&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding a leader’s personality, beliefs, and motivations is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Political psychology offers the tools to do just that, yet its insights remain underused in policy and intelligence circles. This commentary offers both a reflection on what has been done and a call to explore how these insights can be more effectively integrated into present and future analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on understanding leaders as individuals is not new. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter demonstrated the value of such analysis during the Camp David negotiations between Anwar Sadat, President of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel. After thirteen intense days, a historic peace agreement was reached. Reflecting on this pivotal moment in his memoir Keeping Faith, Carter emphasised how crucial it was to understand the people involved – not just the politics. He recalls: “I was poring over psychological analyses of two of the protagonists, which had been prepared by a team of experts within our intelligence community.” He wanted to understand what made these leaders tick – their ambitions, beliefs, strengths, and likely reactions under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team Carter referred to was part of the Centre for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behaviour (CAPPB) within the CIA, founded by Dr Jerrold Post. A pioneer in the field of political psychology, Post developed psychological profiles of key historical figures to aid negotiation and anticipate behaviour. Yet, following the Cold War, these efforts were scaled back, contributing – according to Post – to intelligence “surprises” in the face of major global events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While leadership analysis may still feature in some areas of government, the extent to which it is used, how influential it is, and whether it consistently draws on evidence-based methods all remain unclear. Yet the need for such analysis has never been more urgent. Relying solely on structural or realist frameworks – approaches that treat leaders as interchangeable and states as purely rational actors – no longer suffices in explaining today’s geopolitical realities. Political psychology offers rigorous, research-based insights that can enhance our understanding of decision-making at the highest levels. It is time we take this knowledge more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Carter’s case illustrates the value of such analysis, references to “leader psychology” today are often vague or reductive. Analysts, journalists, and even academics frequently invoke it as a catch-all explanation for behaviour that defies conventional logic, without drawing on the field’s methodological depth. Political psychology is not a rhetorical device – it is a discipline with decades of empirical research and tested frameworks for profiling and understanding leaders. To meet the challenges of our current moment, we must apply its tools with greater precision and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2021, many analysts focused on Vladimir Putin’s cost-benefit calculations, assuming a large-scale military operation would not align with Moscow’s interests. Reports such as one from the Centre for Strategic &amp;amp; International Studies (CSIS) did warn, however, that emotion and miscalculation could override rational judgement – echoing historical moments like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. When the invasion occurred, some analysts were caught off guard, interpreting Putin’s behaviour as irrational or emotionally driven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framing overlooks a deeper point. Political psychologists have long challenged the traditional concept of “rationality” in international relations – a model that assumes leaders make decisions through objective, utility-maximising calculations. In contrast, psychology shows that decision-making is shaped by how individuals perceive and interpret their environment, filtered through belief systems, emotions, cognitive biases, and past experiences. These are not random or chaotic influences, but patterned and analysable factors. Leaders, like all individuals, are subject to psychological dynamics that shape how they respond to information, interpret constraints, and navigate crises. Labelling behaviour as simply rational or irrational, without examining these underlying processes, offers limited explanatory value. By incorporating these insights, political psychology helps us make sense of decisions that might otherwise seem erratic or unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s psychological profile offers a clear case for the value of political psychology. Psychological profiling of Vladimir Putin shows that his belief system has shifted significantly over time, becoming increasingly adversarial. Early in his presidency, he appeared more cooperative, but by the 2008 Georgia conflict, profiles noted growing frustration and a loss of control. This trend intensified after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, with a marked rise in hostility towards the US, NATO, and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the described shifts in Putin’s worldview, much of the Western political establishment continued to engage with him as a rogue – but ultimately manageable – leader. While expert analysis and perceptions did evolve over time, this shift was often slower or more cautious than the changing nature of Putin’s leadership may have warranted. Scholars have also found that Putin should be seen not as a grand strategist but as an opportunist, whose decisions are shaped more by his perception of immediate circumstances than by long-term plans. This interpretation not only helps explain his actions but also suggests a need for nuanced strategies of engagement based on psychological insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another useful example is the reaction to Donald Trump’s behaviour during his second term, which many analysts and politicians described as notably different from his first. He appeared more aggressive in implementing changes, more willing to threaten traditional allies, and more inclined to pursue previously unthinkable alliances. Yet, such reactions often ignore long-standing insights from political psychology. It is well established that leaders learn during their time in office, adjusting their behaviour as they come to understand the limits of their power and the constraints of political institutions. In this context, Trump’s second-term focus on consolidating authority and surrounding himself with like-minded individuals is not unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Trump is frequently described as unpredictable, research has shown that his actions are, in fact, predictable when viewed through the lens of his personality. For example, his approach to China during his first term reflected traits such as competitiveness, distrust, and a preference for direct confrontation – behaviour consistent with his psychological profile. In this sense, he is described as “predictably unpredictable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous psychological assessments of Trump, including those conducted before he took office, have consistently highlighted the extremity of his profile compared to other world leaders. These studies have identified a strong preference for conflictual methods, high achievement and power motives, deep distrust of others, extreme extraversion, low emotional stability, and elevated traits of narcissism and Machiavellianism. Historically, such characteristics have been linked to a heightened focus on loyalty, resistance to constraints, impulsiveness, intolerance, and manipulative behaviour – traits that increase the likelihood of conflict escalation and, in some cases, the outbreak of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars in this field have long examined how leaders respond to crises, process external information, challenge established norms and rely on emotions and belief systems in decision-making. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods – such as content analysis and psychobiographical studies – they have developed tools to assess, compare, and even predict leadership behaviour. Techniques like Leadership Trait Analysis and Operational Code Analysis allow us to profile leaders and compare their scores to known patterns of behaviour among similar profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, leaders high in control and power motivation tend to act assertively, while those with lower scores favour collaboration. A greater degree of conceptual complexity relative to self-confidence correlates with openness to advice and flexibility, whereas the reverse often results in rigidity and selective perception. Task-oriented leaders focus on outcomes, sometimes at the expense of cohesion, while relationship-oriented leaders prioritise unity and internal support. Traits such as high in-group bias or distrust further raise the likelihood of norm violations and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is not too late to make greater use of the tools offered by political psychology – not only to deepen our understanding of leaders but also to improve diplomacy and better anticipate future behaviour. Like any field that seeks to explain human action, psychology is not without its limitations and continues to evolve. Still, the analytical frameworks already available can offer valuable insights. Ignoring them is a missed opportunity for both scholars and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitics will always matter in global security, but it is the choices of individuals – often idiosyncratic, emotionally charged, or shaped by deeply held beliefs – that ultimately steer the course of world events. The assumption that leaders are interchangeable or inherently rational no longer holds. As today’s challenges become more volatile and personalised, integrating psychological insight into political analysis is not optional – it is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

Expanding these programs is key to deepening ties and building a new generation committed to strong U.S.-Brazil relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is the world’s seventh-most populous country and the largest economy in Latin America. Yet despite vast opportunities for economic development and global engagement, Brazil’s educational disparities, skill gaps, and foundational inequalities present significant obstacles to its progress. Historically, cross-cultural exchange has served to help mitigate these challenges and accelerate development—in particular, bilateral educational exchange between Brazil and the United States, which has served as a key pillar of cooperation and fostered academic, economic, and cultural ties between the two nations. This report provides an in-depth look at the cross-cultural educational exchange between the United States and Brazil, analyzing the impacts and benefits for both nations and highlighting opportunities for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-international-exchange-with-brazil&quot;&gt;The Importance of International Exchange with Brazil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-and-soft-power&quot;&gt;Diplomacy and Soft Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Brazil have had a diplomatic relationship since 1824. Today, Brazil is an increasingly critical partner for the United States as it seeks to address challenges in energy, food security, climate change, and multilateral cooperation. Trade also remains a central pillar of the relationship. In 2024, trade between the United States and Brazil reached an estimated $92 billion. Of this total, U.S. imports from Brazil accounted for approximately $49.7 billion—a trade surplus for the United States. Beyond economic cooperation, maintaining a strong political alliance is crucial as Brazil positions itself as a global power—especially as countries like China seek to expand their influence through initiatives such as BRICS, an intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. A key factor in sustaining the close U.S.-Brazil relationship is soft power, including educational exchanges, cultural diplomacy, and scientific collaboration, all of which play a vital role in deepening ties between the two societies. These connections not only foster mutual understanding but also reinforce long-term strategic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beyond economic cooperation, maintaining a strong political alliance is crucial as Brazil positions itself as a global power—especially as countries like China seek to expand their influence through initiatives such as BRICS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States and Brazil share a strong tradition of educational collaboration, the rise of the BRICS bloc has introduced new complexities for alliances within the western hemisphere. Since its formation in 2009, BRICS has sought to challenge Western influence, with member states steadily expanding their geopolitical and economic reach. As a key participant, Brazil has strengthened its ties with fellow BRICS nations—particularly China and Russia—thereby broadening opportunities not only for trade and strategic cooperation but also for educational and cultural exchanges. These evolving partnerships reflect Brazil’s growing role in a shifting global landscape, raising important questions about the future of its engagement with Western institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes for countering Russian and Chinese influence in Brazil continue to rise, particularly given that Brazil is Russia’s leading trade partner in Latin America—and with China’s imports from Brazil reaching $89 million in 2022, more than double U.S. imports that same year. In recent years, education has emerged as a key pillar in strengthening Brazil’s individual ties with both China and Russia. BRICS initiatives have underscored the growing opportunities for educational exchanges between Brazil and Russia, culminating in the establishment of the first Russian-Brazilian school near Rio de Janeiro. Similarly, Brazil and China have recognized the need to expand student mobility, implementing programs to encourage cross-country study. China, in particular, has advanced these efforts through initiatives to bring Brazilian students to the School of Foreign Languages at East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) and offer Chinese instruction in Brazil through the Confucius Institute at FAAP Business School in São Paulo. These developments highlight the urgent need for the United States and Brazil to prioritize educational collaboration—not only to deepen bilateral ties and maximize shared opportunities, but also to counterbalance growing Chinese and Russian influence in Brazil’s academic and cultural spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is also strong global competition to attract international student talent. Recent years have seen an expansion of international students studying outside their home countries, according to UNESCO. The United States is the top host of international students worldwide, but it is notable that both Russia and China consistently rank among the top ten. Beyond BRICS, there are other countries actively recruiting large numbers of globally mobile students that have experienced robust growth, based on 2024 data from Project Atlas. Following the United States, the leading hosts include Canada (+28 percent), Australia (+21 percent), and the United Kingdom (+6 percent). In addition to these large hosts of international students, intraregional mobility within Latin America has also been increasing. For example, more Brazilian students studied in Argentina (24,219) than in the United States, based on 2024 data provided by the Argentinean Ministry of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States looks to build upon its history of hosting the most international students in the world and to compete with other countries for top talent, there continues to be capacity across its nearly 4,000 colleges and universities, particularly at the undergraduate level, which is currently facing declining enrollments. With Brazilian students in the United States mostly studying in undergraduate programs, there is space within our institutions to host more of these often self-funded students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In considering the benefits of international student mobility, it is important to recognize not only the valuable skills, language training, and knowledge gained by international students, but also the immense economic benefit they bring to the United States. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) records the amount that international students contribute yearly to the U.S. economy. International students from all over the world contributed more than $50 billion to the U.S. economy in 2023 and supported more than 378,175 jobs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Over the past 15 years, there has been significant growth in the economic contributions of Brazilian students to the U.S. economy, according to BEA’s data. In 2010, Brazilian students contributed $271 million to the economy. In 2015, four years after the launch of Brazil’s Science Without Borders program (known in the United States as the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program, or BSMP), that number had nearly doubled to $499 million. As of the most recent calculation (2023), Brazilian students contributed $1 billion dollars to the U.S. education sector, supporting jobs at colleges and universities throughout the country.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brazil-us-student-exchange-trends-and-the-lasting-impact-of-special-programs&quot;&gt;Brazil-U.S. Student Exchange: Trends and the Lasting Impact of Special Programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from Open Doors—a 75-year research project on international educational exchange conducted by the Institute of International Education (IIE) and supported by the U.S. Department of State—there were 16,877 Brazilian students in the United States in 2023–2024 (see Figure 1). The trend line below, which tracks the number of Brazilian students studying in the United States since 1948, is more striking not for the current numbers, but for the surge occurring in the mid-2010s, when significant bilateral government programs supported Brazilian students coming to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2b7AKI6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Number of Brazilian Students Studying at U.S. Higher Education Institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of Brazilian students in the United States peaked at 23,675 in 2014–2015. This record high was primarily due to two government programs that supported mobility by providing funding: Brazil’s BSMP and the U.S.-led “100,000 Strong in the Americas” initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s substantial investment of $1.3 billion in international academic mobility through BSMP aimed to send students all over the world for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Between 2011 and 2016, the investment funded over 25,000 Brazilian students, many of whom also benefited from the program’s coordination with more than 2,500 companies, organizations, and universities for hands-on internships and research experience. This program (which will be examined below) yielded swift returns, causing academic exchange participation and enrollment in STEM fields to surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative was launched to expand institutional partnerships, collaboration, and mobility opportunities for the western hemisphere. Through a public-private partnership, the initiative brought together government entities, companies, foundations, and educational institutions to build collaboration between institutions and organizations throughout the region. To receive funding, U.S. and Brazilian institutions submitted joint proposals to a competitive review, with only a select number of winning grant recipients each cycle. This collaborative proposal partnership process has led to an increase in connections and partnerships between Brazilian and U.S. institutions, regardless of whether the proposal received funding, as reported by experts interviewed by the authors. For recipients of funding, awards yielded innovative projects across many U.S. and Brazilian higher education institutions, such as promoting the study of health and nutrition, joint engineering collaborations, the future of mining, building data analytics and entrepreneurship applications, and artificial intelligence for urban sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The number of Brazilian students in the United States peaked at 23,675 in 2014–2015. This record high was primarily due to two government programs that supported mobility by providing funding: Brazil’s BSMP and the U.S.-led “100,000 Strong in the Americas” initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant impact of these programs is reflected in the academic level enrollment data seen in Figure 2. The most remarkable growth was in the number of non-degree-seeking students, a rise driven by BSMP, most of whose beneficiaries were participating in one-year exchange or intensive English study programs. These numbers surged from a baseline of approximately 1,000 students in 2011–2012 to more than 11,500 in 2014–2015. Interestingly, there were also notable increases in the number of full degree students coming to the United States: The number of undergraduate and graduate students grew by over 30 percent from 2013–2014 to 2014–2015, with 6,990 undergrads and more than 4,100 graduate students enrolled in the 2014–2015 school year. These data clearly indicate that the most substantial growth in Brazilian student enrollment coincided directly with special programs promoting student exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Vat21dA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Academic Level of Brazilian Students in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the “shock” of BSMP and the ongoing 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative, undergraduate and graduate enrollment saw a small decline after the BSMP program ended in 2016, but the numbers have continued to rise above pre-program levels. Even following the Covid-19 pandemic, undergraduate numbers have nearly rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, and the number of graduate Brazilian students in the United States has reached a record high, surpassing 5,000 for the first time. This growth has likely been driven by sustained Brazilian student interest, active recruitment by U.S. institutions, regional networks that promote study in the United States, and other partnerships established through these large governmental programs. One example of an organization that builds connections between prospective Brazilian students and U.S. institutions is the Department of State’s EducationUSA, which conducts outreach to students throughout Brazil to promote U.S. colleges and universities and also provides U.S. higher education institutions with resources about how to best recruit students throughout the country. The number of non-degree students, in contrast, has returned to pre-program levels and remained steady since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the lasting legacies of the BSMP initiative has been the increase of STEM as a field of study—a primary goal of the program. As shown in Figure 3, STEM enrollment surged during BSMP, particularly in engineering. Similarly, math, computer science, and physical and life sciences saw significant growth in 2014–2015 and have continued to increase steadily ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8RuS0Cd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Brazilian Students in the United States in STEM and Intensive English Programs.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the impact of the BSMP program is still being seen as the proportion of students studying in the STEM fields increases. For example, in the 2023–2024 academic year, 35 percent of Brazilian students studied STEM, up from just 22 percent in 2009–2010. The most popular of the STEM fields in 2023–2024 was engineering (13 percent), with preferences for mechanical, civil, and electrical specializations. Math and computer science also saw significant growth, rising from 3 percent a decade ago to 8 percent in 2023–2024. Brazil has come to rank among the top ten countries of origin for international students in the United States; despite this progress, however, Brazil sends fewer STEM students than other top countries like Nepal, Nigeria, and Vietnam, indicating that there is room for continued growth and collaboration in these fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-brazil-study-exchanges-drive-startup-growth&quot;&gt;U.S.-Brazil Study Exchanges Drive Startup Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of Brazilian students studying in the United States extends beyond the increase in international exchange and investment in STEM fields—it is also beginning to shape Brazil’s entrepreneurial sector, fostering innovation and contributing to the country’s growing startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Brazil ranked 69 in the Global Innovation Index, climbing to 50 by 2024—a significant improvement. A major driver of this progress has been the rapid growth of venture capital activity, both in the number of deals and their total value. According to the Latin American Venture Capital Association (LAVCA), Brazil’s startup ecosystem has expanded dramatically since 2013. That year, the country had fewer than 50 startups; by 2020, the number had surged to 682, and by 2024, it had soared to 1,428, more than double the 2020 number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expansion has been largely fueled by the adoption of the U.S. venture capital model, which not only provides critical funding but also fosters a culture of innovation and risk-taking. Additionally, the integration of entrepreneurial skills into higher education programs has further strengthened the startup landscape, equipping a new generation of founders with the knowledge and tools necessary to scale their businesses successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Among the 107 startups that received seed capital between 2021 and 2022, 59 percent of founders had studied in the United States—an 11-point difference from the 2019 cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors of this report conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset comprising 161 Brazilian startups that received venture capital funding in 2019 and 107 that had received seed capital in 2021–2022. The goal was to identify trends and patterns associated with entrepreneurs who had studied at accredited academic institutions in the United States. By examining these startups, CSIS sought to understand the potential influence of U.S.-based education on the growth of venture-backed companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 161 startups that received funding in 2019 did so at various stages of development, from seed and early-stage to expansion. These companies were founded between 1990 and 2018, but most were relatively young—80 percent were established after 2008, with 66 percent established after 2011. Nearly 48 percent had at least one founder who studied in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the 107 startups that received seed capital between 2021 and 2022, 59 percent of founders had studied in the United States—an 11-point difference from the 2019 cohort. Notably, all 107 were at the seed stage, ensuring no overlap with the 2019 dataset and focusing the analysis on businesses founded in the last three to four years. This highlights the significant impact of international education experiences in the United States on Brazil’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. In addition, this newly created ecosystem is also a great opportunity for foreign direct investors—of which the United States is the largest one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth highlighting that all startups in this cohort incorporated STEM education in some capacity. Even when their products were not directly related to STEM fields, technology played a crucial role in these products’ development. Forty-six percent of the founders who studied abroad participated in short-term academic programs, which indicates that many may have benefited directly or indirectly from initiatives such as BSMP and partnerships built through the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative. This also underscores how even short-term experiences in the United States can play a critical role in startup creation, in turn highlighting the need to sustain and expand programs that facilitate these exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligned to this period of heightened mobility between 2013 and 2016, the number of STEM graduates overall in Brazil experienced significant growth, from 188,199 graduates in 2015 to 237,767 in 2020. This period also aligns with an increase in Brazilian students studying STEM in the United States, as shown in Figure 4. The upward trend in STEM graduations in Brazil began in 2013–2014 and peaked in 2015–2016, two years after the conclusion of the BSMP, suggesting a lasting impact of the initiative on the country’s talent pipeline and startup ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantifying the direct economic impact of study abroad programs is challenging due to the many factors that influence the sector. However, there is a clear correlation between the expansion of Brazil’s startup ecosystem and the increasing number of entrepreneurs who have studied abroad, particularly in the United States. Notably, at least half of Brazil’s new technology entrepreneurs have received education in the United States, underscoring the significant role of Brazil-U.S. academic exchange programs. These programs not only contribute to Brazil’s overall economic development but also play a crucial role in shaping the industries that will drive its future economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings of this report make clear that exchange between the United States and Brazil benefits both countries diplomatically and economically. Yet rapidly expanding the number of students moving between the two countries will be a challenge. Several of the largest existing barriers remain at the student level, where problems like lack of language proficiency, insufficient programs, limited funding, and unequal access to education hold progress back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Brazil’s economic size and potential, its educational bottlenecks present a fundamental challenge to increasing student mobility, both domestically and internationally. According to the PISA 2022 results, Brazilian students rank far below OECD averages in subjects such reading, mathematics, and science, and these scores have remained nearly unchanged since 2009. Similarly, language skills (or lack thereof) have also been a significant barrier for students. At the global level, Brazil ranked in the “low proficiency” category, placing 81st out of 105 countries in 2024, and even regionally, it trails behind 16 countries in Latin America. Decreasing levels of English proficiency and Brazil’s high level of inequality have also impacted students’ opportunities to study in the United States. From 2013 to 2016, the enrollment of Brazilian students in non-degree programs, including English language programs, surged significantly, peaking in 2014–2015 at 11,581 students. This surge in students due to BSMP’s short-term, funded program likely broadened the pool of students and made the opportunity to study in the United States more accessible to lower-income students. However, as seen in Figure 2, non-degree exchange students dropped sharply after the end of BSMP, despite ongoing need; this shows a clear reduction in opportunities following the end of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited funding also directly restricts study abroad opportunities for Brazilian students in the United States and highlights inequality within Brazil. The International Trade Administration identified in a 2023 report that approximately 80 percent of Brazilian students studying in the United States are from Brazil’s wealthier southern and central eastern states. Because of economic inequality across the country and varying markets that seek out STEM majors, unequal access to education tends to favor those living in wealthier states. Due to limited funding opportunities and resources, students that are able to engage in existing study abroad opportunities often resort to private funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurdles for Brazilian students studying in the United States go beyond the aforementioned student barriers. Currently, Brazil lacks any formal degree revalidation agreements—the official recognition of a foreign degree as equivalent to a Brazilian one—with foreign countries, meaning that students completing education abroad must undergo a strenuous and costly revalidation process through public universities. Furthermore, students must also take into consideration the logistics and economic cost of acquiring visas. These hurdles raise the level of inaccessibility for students affected by inequality within Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this report has largely focused on the mobility of Brazilian students to the United States, it is also worth noting that other barriers likely exist for U.S. students in relation to Brazil. According to Open Doors, from the 2001–2002 academic year through 2015–2016, Brazil consistently ranked among the top 25 study abroad destinations for U.S. students. However, since 2016, it has no longer appeared on this list. This is likely due to a number of factors, including a lack of Portuguese language proficiency, a dearth of study abroad program options in Brazil, and perceptions of safety and security. At the same time, despite the rise of multilingualism in the United States, poor Portuguese and higher Spanish proficiency may deter many U.S. students from seeking opportunities in Brazil, as students studying abroad in Latin America often choose Spanish-speaking countries. For those students who lack Portuguese skills but are undeterred, they face a limited—albeit growing—number of English-language programs in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;expanding-student-mobility&quot;&gt;Expanding Student Mobility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By increasing funding, investing in targeted programs, and strengthening institutional linkages, both the United States and Brazil can expand the number of students studying abroad and enhance the long-term benefits of these exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expand-and-strengthen-funding&quot;&gt;Expand and Strengthen Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil and the United States should prioritize sustained and expanded funding to encourage student mobility. For example, an expansion of the Department of State’s EducationUSA network could create more opportunities for Brazilian students to understand their options, navigate the application and visa processes, and access resources to study in the United States. In addition, establishing long-term programs with funding opportunities for students will lead more Brazilians to pursue their studies in the United States. As Brazilian students have increasing options to study in other English-speaking destinations or BRICS countries, further investment would allow the United States to build a competitive advantage in attracting talented students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;address-educational-gaps&quot;&gt;Address Educational Gaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government should continue and expand investments in English-language instruction at the high school level, ensuring that students gain the proficiency needed to pursue higher education opportunities in the United States. To aid in the training of English-language teachers, there should be continued development of programs that provide rigorous English-language training, such as PDPI (Programa de Desenvolvimento Profissional para Professores de Língua Inglesa nos EUA), which brings Brazilian high school English teachers to the United States to study both English and instruction techniques. At the same time, higher education institutions should expand English and Portuguese bridge programs, including virtual ones that can reach wider audiences and underserved regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil must also increase investment in primary and secondary education to better prepare students for professional and technical careers. The country’s education spending as a share of GDP has been declining since 2017 and currently stands at 5.5 percent. As of 2023, Brazil invested only $3,583 per student in primary and secondary education—well below the OECD average of $10,949.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;promote-non-degree-and-short-term-study-opportunities&quot;&gt;Promote Non-Degree and Short-Term Study Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding non-degree and short-term study opportunities is crucial for increasing student mobility, particularly that of low-income students who may not have the financial means to pursue full degree programs abroad. Short-term exchanges—such as English language programs, specialized training courses, certificate programs, and technical career programs at U.S. community colleges—provide valuable international exposure and are both accessible and cost effective. To enhance participation, both governments should consider reintroducing and scaling up government-backed short-term exchange programs similar to BSMP. Additionally, U.S. institutions can expand summer programs, internships, and research opportunities specifically designed for Brazilian students, providing them with hands-on learning experiences in key fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-institutional-partnerships&quot;&gt;Strengthen Institutional Partnerships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing academic collaboration between institutions in both countries can create more opportunities for exchange. One way to do this would be through the development of dual-degree programs in which students split their studies between U.S. and Brazilian universities and earn credentials recognized in both nations. By establishing credit-transfer agreements and mutual degree validation frameworks through university partnerships, students could have their coursework pre-approved, making it easier to apply their foreign education upon returning home. Expanding faculty-led study abroad programs, joint research initiatives, and English-language courses in Brazilian universities would also make study abroad more accessible, particularly for U.S. students who may not speak Portuguese fluently. By strengthening institutional partnerships with built-in degree validation mechanisms and addressing bureaucratic hurdles, both countries could create a more dynamic and accessible academic exchange ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protracted wars are won by the party able to generate new, competitively trained forces and the armaments with which they are equipped and sustained. The ability to generate a second and third echelon of forces is an important aspect of a state’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Russian defence industry has managed to significantly increase defence production. Ukraine has also done this, although to a lesser extent. European members of NATO, meanwhile, faced substantial problems in expanding defence-industrial output, despite an abundance of funds. This paper examines the processes of military-industrial mobilisation in each of these areas to assess the causes of radically different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia had a well-developed plan for military-industrial mobilisation which it implemented early in the war. Ukraine did not have such a well-developed plan but could draw on its Soviet legacy to regenerate industrial capacity. Europe, meanwhile, lacked both a plan and the data with which to build one; this made investment into defence production inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia and Ukraine maintained a highly centralised level of coordination over their respective defence industries and had an understanding of the supply chains to enable a relatively coherent orchestration of investments. Europe, meanwhile, lacked control, and could only incentivise industry, while governments and industry lacked an understanding of their own supply chains, leading to massive internal competition and uneven expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while Russia d id achieve a much more efficient military-industrial mobilisation, it also cost far more than is generally acknowledged. Russia has not only expanded defence spending but also rerouted money from other budgets to expand military-industrial recapitalisation and has advanced credit to defence companies to enable rapid growth. This will pose challenges in the medium term. It is not reasonable to expect Europe, which is not at war, to mobilise investment to a comparable level. However, the fragmentation of the European defence market has meant that money is spent very inefficiently. Greater European coordination of spending could improve the return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulatory environment in Russia and Ukraine should not be held up as a model. In Ukraine, regulation of core defence industries has necessitated a large unregulated non-traditional defence ecosystem to emerge. In Russia, practices are manifestly unsafe and have often led to accidents. In Europe, however, the burden of regulation is often self-defeating in raising the cost and slowing the production of equipment. Incentives for stockpiling equipment and taking risk, meanwhile, are skewed in such a way as to lead to systemic policy failure. Regulatory reform and harmonisation for the testing, procurement, storage and transportation of defence materiel are essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where Europe must be able to deter Russia with reduced US support, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine should spur significant efforts to address what has been demonstrated to be a manifestly inadequate defence-industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An assessment of the military balance is overwhelmingly concerned with the comparison of adversaries’ first echelon of forces, along with the first round of mobilised reserves. The confrontation of opposing first echelons with their original equipment usually produces the most rapid stages of a conflict. These troops are the most professional and best-equipped units, and they tend to be fewer in number than the force following mobilisation, so there is more space for manoeuvre on a front. The clashes of these forces tend to set the terms for follow-on fighting. They may decisively achieve their objectives, as was the case for Azerbaijan’s forces in Nagorno–Karabakh in 2020, the US-led coalition in Iraq in 1991, and the German invasion of France in 1940. Or they may fail, with the limits of their advance setting the conditions for a period of slower and more destruction-centric warfare, as during the First World War on the Western Front, the Iran–Iraq War, or Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where wars protract, they become industrial, with the capacity of a force to continue the struggle enabled by its capacity to manufacture a sufficient volume of equipment and to remain competitive in the equipment that it fields. Winning a long war depends on the ability to mobilise the necessary resources to ensure the ability to wage it. This applies, of course, to human resources, but the provision of an adequate volume of weaponry and military equipment is just as important. Numerical superiority in troops, their training and high morale do not matter if these troops do not have arms and ammunition. War is not only an art, but also a science, and this is especially true of long wars, which are determined ultimately by the second or third echelon – that is, a country’s reserves – and subsequent entirely new units of conscripts from the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the military balance of second- and third-echelon forces, and thus the capacity of a state to sustain a long war, is not as simple as measuring wealth and industrial potential. By late March 2022, officials in Russia realised that industrial and military mobilisation would be necessary. There has been a persistent narrative in parts of NATO that Russia is an insignificant threat because the GDP of NATO countries alone is about $46 trillion, which is almost half of world GDP. Russia, by comparison, has a GDP of approximately $2 trillion, representing only 2% of global GDP from an economy smaller than Canada’s. The military threat from Russia was often dismissed on the basis that it had an economy the size of Italy. This complacency is evident in the fact that as Russian defence spending expanded by some 227% and China’s by 566% from 2000, defence spending across Europe and Canada continued to decline until 2014 and, even then, was stable until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s comparative economic weakness, Russia still managed to outproduce NATO in military materiel throughout 2022–24, even with significant efforts in some NATO member states to expand defence production. This reflects the challenges of aligning political will, regulatory and legislative enablement, industrial planning and capacity, and understanding and control over supply chains. Russia’s continuing advantage in defence production poses a strategic threat to NATO and the credibility of its conventional deterrence. It poses a catastrophic risk for Ukraine, since its international partners have become its strategic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper compares the military-industrial measures in Russia, Ukraine and European NATO over the course of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It uses such comparisons to identify lessons on how war production among Ukraine’s international partners can be made more resilient and efficient to support Ukraine today and deter Russia into the future. The paper also explains how, and at what cost, Russia has achieved its scaling of military production. The paper does not offer a comprehensive breakdown of the defence industry across all these jurisdictions. Rather, its focus is on key policy issues that have shaped production outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of this paper requires some explanation. On the Russian side, Iran, North Korea, Belarus, India, and China are central to the country’s ability to industrially sustain the war. Similarly, for Ukraine, the US and several non-European partners are important supporters. However, these countries are excluded from the study. The reason for this is that apart from the US, most of these states have been involved in the war as suppliers or funders, servicing orders or offering support. They have not needed to address major policy questions of industrial mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the US, which has retained a substantial defence industry and has policies in place for industrial mobilisation, Russia’s full-scale invasion has prompted investment in the expansion of some kinds of munitions production. However, the mechanisms for doing this were the same as those used during the War on Terror to address shortages of precision-guided munitions. The main policy debate in the US was not one of industrial policy. Rather, it was the balance of investment in equipment relevant to supporting Ukraine and that which is useful in deterring Chinese aggression towards Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper, therefore, focuses on those states where key policy questions of how to industrially mobilise arose, with significant differences in what has been achieved and how. Focusing on Europe, without the US, is also relevant given that over the next few years, it is likely that more US capacity will be fixed in the Indo-Pacific. It is therefore useful and necessary to assess Europe’s military-industrial readiness. It may be asked, quite reasonably, why Europe is treated as a unified entity when it is highly fragmented in defence-industrial policy. The reason is that most European militaries are too small to sustain their domestic defence enterprises. Once scaling activities became necessary, it became clear that the European defence market must be considered collectively. Indeed, the competitive interactions across this market reveal the frictions and opportunities that have emerged over the course of the war. The discussion, therefore, is focused on Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence for this paper is diverse. The authors have – throughout the war – been actively engaged in policy discussions in Ukraine and across Europe on support for the Ukrainian war effort. The authors have also extensively consulted with the defence industry across Europe and both industrial and policy leaders in Ukraine. The research into Russian defence production combines a range of open and closed sources, some of which are sensitive in nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of commercial sensitivity in Europe, operational security in Ukraine and official secrecy in Russia make it difficult to pursue a unified methodology for these three areas of study. Similarly, while the Ukrainian government has assisted in the research for this paper, the Russian government has sought to prevent it. In Europe, meanwhile, there is a diverse range of actors, to which access was also provided under various terms. Together, this makes it difficult to present a comparable data set for each area of study. Instead, therefore, this paper seeks to understand each industrial environment on its own terms through the information available, and subsequently to draw conclusions about policies and their impact on production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief note on numbers. The chapter on Russia includes some specific production figures and costs. In some instances, it has been possible to obtain sensitive industrial information on Russian production, and so these numbers are used. The chapter on Europe does not use many specific numbers, although there are a great many in circulation. This is because while specific numbers are often included in press releases and media reports, the authors’ interviews with the parties concerned invariably indicated that actual numbers were markedly different, or that those that were publicly released amalgamated various kinds of data. The specific data was nevertheless shared in confidence and could not be used. In general, therefore, numbers are omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has three chapters, one for each of the three areas of study: Russia, Ukraine and Europe. From a policy perspective, it may have made more sense to divide the chapters thematically, comparing policy and regulation, industrial capacity, and stockpiling and supply chains across the three areas. However, because of the different methodologies necessary for obtaining data, it is hard to compare like with like, and so the paper considers each separately, and then draws conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russia-military-industrial-mobilisation&quot;&gt;I. Russia: Military-Industrial Mobilisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Russian invasion plan for Ukraine envisaged the destabilisation of the Ukrainian state by Russia’s special services, followed by a coup de main by the Russian military to rapidly seize and take control of Ukraine’s political and economic centres. The main military phase of the campaign was planned to take 10 days, with consolidation of control lasting several months. In this context, Russian planners did not expect to expend significant numbers of munitions or lose large volumes of military equipment. Thus, industrial mobilisation did not accompany the commencement of the Special Military Operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the initial plan failed, Russia found itself expending significantly more munitions and losing more equipment than it was producing. As early as March 2022, this led to advice from a range of Russian ministries to begin mobilisation of both personnel and the defence industries. The Kremlin deferred mobilisation of personnel. Although the Kremlin had decided on achieving its objectives in Ukraine militarily, it initially expected to be able to do this without mobilisation simply because of the limited stocks in Ukrainian arsenals. The expansion of Western military-technical assistance, the culmination of Russian offensive operations in Donbas, and the prospects for a protracted war undermined these assumptions. As a result, the emphasis in Russia shifted towards a partially mobilised war economy. The Russian leadership decided to wage a war of attrition against Ukraine, counting on the unwillingness of Kyiv and its Western partners to maintain the necessary level, pace and duration of funding. Russia’s leaders also assumed that Ukraine and its partners would not be able to effectively transform available financial resources into weapons and military equipment, primarily due to the degradation of industrial capabilities in general and defence-industrial capabilities in particular among Russia’s adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attention of intelligence agencies and think tanks focused on the possible start of the mobilisation of reservists of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation as an indicator of the Kremlin’s readiness to wage a long war. However, the first and more important indicators of Russia’s shift to a protracted conflict were those related to the start of its industrial mobilisation. President Vladimir Putin initiated the partial mobilisation of personnel on 21 September 2022 with his decree “On the announcement of partial mobilisation in the Russian Federation”, in response to a need to increase the density of forces in Ukraine. But industrial mobilisation had already been underway for months. Importantly, Russia had a detailed and established plan for industrial mobilisation as part of its war plans. This included the pre-drafting of legislation to enable military-industrial expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most professional and academic assessments of Russia’s ability to sustain a protracted war have over-emphasised calculations of how long Russia will last with the weapons and military equipment it had in stockpiles when the war began, especially with regard to munitions. Assessments of Russia’s military-industrial capacity to produce more equipment, and the significance of stockpiles for the production and maintenance of equipment, were both scarcer and less precise. Nevertheless, it was when Putin pulled these levers that Russia shifted to fighting a protracted war. This chapter outlines how this mobilisation was achieved, examining legislative, financial and industrial changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobilising-industry&quot;&gt;Mobilising Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to prepare mobilisation was made during Russia’s offensive on Donbas. Officially, it began on 6 July 2022 when the Russian parliament adopted pre-prepared changes to several strategic laws related to Russia’s defence, the defence industry and system of public procurement. These created the legal prerequisites for the introduction of some elements of a war economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, changes to the legislation allowed Russia’s government to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start using all mobilisation capacities and facilities – primarily industrial facilities that can be involved in the production of goods and materials necessary to wage the war (including mothballed facilities).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use material assets of the State Reserve – primarily strategic materials necessary for the production of weapons and military equipment (including reserved ones).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restrict labour rights in organisations, institutions and enterprises whose activities are related to the provision of military needs, including the obligation of employees to work 12 hours a day, at night, at weekends and on holidays, as well as the cancellation of annual leave and reducing the mandatory weekend to one day per week.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prohibit organisations from refusing to conclude agreements with the government on the supply of goods and services aimed at meeting military needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Refuse tender procedures, and purchase from a single supplier, of the goods and services required for the state defence order, as well as for the formation of stocks of products, raw materials and components necessary to ensure the production of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand state regulation of prices in the sphere of state defence procurements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rules could thereafter be applied to any organisation, including private ones, enabling the government to mobilise the economy. These changes built on a robust legislative base, enabling the Russian government to direct its defence industry. In accordance with the Order of the Ministry of Industry and Trade No. 1981 dated 18 May 2022 in the General Register of Enterprises of the Russian Defence Industry, there were about 1,400 enterprises of all forms of ownership. The majority of them were state-owned. More than 977 of these enterprises (including Rostec enterprises) were subordinated to Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade, 166 to the Ministry of Defence, 80 to Roscosmos and 43 to Rosatom. The state therefore exercised significant management over more than 4,000 enterprises and organisations. More than 4.5 million people worked in Russia at enterprises related to the implementation of state defence orders, as either direct employees or contractors: 25% in scientific organisations and 75% in manufacturing enterprises. Thus, taking into account family members, approximately 10% of Russia’s population was connected with the defence industry in 2022, and this figure has since expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes affected the portfolio of a range of critical companies. The state corporation Rostec, which includes more than 800 industrial and scientific enterprises, was responsible for the fulfilment of about 40% of the state defence order in 2022. By analysing its financial indicators it is possible to understand the general characteristic of the entire government policy in this area. According to its 2023 results, despite a significant reduction in the export of weapons and military equipment, Rostec’s revenues increased to almost 3 trillion roubles (about $34 billion). This was a third more than in 2022, and the main part of these funds was from the state defence order. According to the estimates of Rostec Director General Sergey Chemezov, the structure of these funds mostly reflects the cost of weapons and military equipment, as the profitability of Rostec’s production for the Russian military is only 2.28%. Chemezov has stated that up to 80% of equipment employed by Russian forces in Ukraine has included input from Rostec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar processes are taking place with other suppliers of the Russian Ministry of Defence. In 2022, Roscosmos lost a significant part of its export portfolio, which accounted for Western countries and assembled civilian goods and services for use in space. However, in 2023, revenue began to grow again due to an increase in weaponry and military equipment orders. Roscosmos management estimates that in two to three years the loss of Western markets (about $2 billion per year) will be fully compensated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significant growth of companies – such as Roscosmos and, as discussed later, Rosatom – is an important part of the impact of Russia’s military-industrial mobilisation. These enterprises have taken on significant responsibilities for military-industrial production since 2022. Moreover, because Ukraine’s international partners perceive these companies as serving non-military functions, such as nuclear energy, they have often become robust avenues for Russia to obtain specialist equipment and components to enable the continued production of sophisticated weapons. It is not just the scale of their contribution to defence that has increased; it is also their significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are not entirely new. Roscosmos enterprises were active executors of the state defence order prior to 2022. Their cooperation with Western clients (including governmental ones), in addition to financial income, was also used to obtain access to the most modern Western technologies. Such technologies were necessary, for example, for the development of Russia’s own military missile programmes. The West saw Roscosmos as an ordinary space agency and a legitimate partner for NASA and the European Space Agency. However, a large part of the companies that were part of the management of this holding are engaged in the production of weapons and military equipment, including various types of ballistic and cruise missiles for Russia’s Strategic Nuclear Forces, missile fuel, missile launchers and artillery systems. This structure is quite natural, because Roscosmos is the legal successor of the Ministry of General Machine Building of the Soviet Union, a body that was responsible for the coordination of a large number of industrial enterprises and scientific institutions that carried out the production of missiles and space technology, including ICBMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important role of Roscosmos in the Russian defence-industrial complex has never been especially hidden. It was directly spelled out in the holding’s statutory documents, where it is specifically stated that the Roscosmos corporation was created for the production of missile technology, military and dual-purpose rocket and space technology, the provision of satellite navigation for Russian defence and intelligence agencies, and fulfilment of other tasks of the state armaments programme. The special importance of the defence-industrial function of Roscosmos is indicated by the competencies of the heads of this corporation in recent years – Dmitriy Rogozin and Yuri Borisov, before leading Roscosmos, had been deputy prime ministers for defence and space industry. Borisov was also the deputy minister of defence responsible for the armament programme of the Russian Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of the funds in the Russian budget allocated to financing space programmes, even before the full-scale invasion, went to defence tasks – the production of products for the fulfilment of a state defence order, as well as the development of weapons, military and special equipment. In the new space programme for the years 2024–26, more than 1 trillion roubles (about $12 billion) have been laid down. Almost all of these funds will not be directed to the lunar exploration programme, but as state subsidies to companies of the Roscosmos corporation engaged in the development and production of missiles, missile engines and ballistic weapon coordination systems. Among the recipients of subsidies is the Special Design Bureau of the Moscow Energy Institute (OKB MEI), which produces products for the coordination of ballistic, anti-aircraft and cruise missiles, including intercontinental missiles Yars and Bulava. Another form of subsidy is the contribution of funds to the capital of these enterprises. For these needs, Roscosmos will receive $1 billion from the budget in 2024. The Yaroslavl Radio Plant, which produces tactical and satellite military communications for the needs of the Ministry of Defence, will receive part of these funds as part of its charter capital. Special attention in the space programme is paid to the expansion of the satellite group for the performance of military tasks. The militarisation of space technology is, according to the statements of the Russian political leadership, a current priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State nuclear energy corporation Rosatom is also an important executor of the Russian state defence order. The structure of Rosatom includes the enterprises of Russia’s nuclear weapons complex, which are engaged in the maintenance of operational efficiency, modernisation, development and testing of new models of nuclear weapons. Enterprises are also involved in the development and production of non-nuclear weapons. Like Roscosmos, this function of Rosatom is quite natural. Rosatom is the successor of the Soviet Ministry of Medium Machine Building, which, in addition to developing and testing nuclear weapons, dealt with atomic energy. VNIIEF, VNIITF and VNIIA, which carry out the development of nuclear charges and nuclear ammunition, as well as Elektrokhimpribor and Priborostroitelny Zavod, which carry out serial production of nuclear ammunition, are among the enterprises that are part of Rosatom. Rosatom enterprises also participate in the development and production of non-nuclear weapons and military and special equipment, which are actively used by the Russian military against Ukraine. These systems include the Ataka anti-tank guided missile, the Sturm multi-purpose missile complex, the Chrysanthem-S anti-tank missile complex, cluster munitions for the Grad and Smerch multiple launch rocket system (MLRS), the Igla-S MANPADS, complexes for missile control systems, high-precision weapons, and conventional ammunition and their components. Rosatom also develops and produces weapons based on new physical principles, including the Zadyra-16 laser combat complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosatom’s role in the Russian state defence order has predictably increased since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale aggression. At the same time, the West continues to hesitate to apply sanctions against Rosatom, citing the high dependence of Western energy companies on the supply of Russian nuclear fuel and other related technologies. This allows Rosatom to continue to generate substantial income from its international operations. In 2023, it amounted to $16 billion, more than half of all the income of the corporation. In addition, the absence of sanctions removes restrictions on the purchase and import of export-controlled items such as microelectronics, which can also be used by other enterprises of the Russian defence-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Rosatom also expanded its production of microelectronics. For this purpose, a new enterprise of the NPO “KIS” (Scientific and Production Association “Critical Information Systems”) was created within the structure of Rosatom. This entity also started the purchase of specialised assets. In May 2024, it was discovered that Rosatom intends to acquire the Russian company NTC Modul, which produces computing modules, control systems, navigation equipment, high-precision positioning, recognition systems and analysis of video images used in Russian weapons, including in attack UAVs. The purpose of the purchase is to use Rosatom’s funds to expand production, as well as eliminate the company’s current problems with the supply of Western components. It is important to note that for the development of both nuclear and conventional weapons, Rosatom uses funds that formally have no relation to the Ministry of Defence. For example, the state programme “Development of the nuclear energy industrial complex”, supervised by the Ministry of Energy, includes subprogrammes for financing the development of Russia’s defence-industrial complex enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activities of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN) are also subordinated to the interests of war. Even fundamental scientific research is aimed, in accordance with the position of the Russian government, at “the creation of scientific and technical development in the interests of the defence and security of the state, primarily solving the problems of the Armed Forces”. Representatives of the Main Directorate of Innovative Development of Russia’s Ministry of Defence, as well as military innovation technopolis “Era”, participate in the determination of scientific research that scientific institutions of the RAN carry out. Direct customers of research are generally designers of defence enterprises. In January 2024, Putin issued a decree on the inclusion of the head of RAN, Academician Gennady Krasnikov, in Russia’s Security Council. Russia’s budget for 2024 has earmarked about $3 billion solely for fundamental research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other companies have similar recent histories: since 2022, despite clear losses of business in relation to exports, revenue and production have expanded. While space prevents detailed examinations of each case, the point is that the first explanation for Russia’s successes in expanding military production was its comprehensive ability to take existing engineering enterprises servicing civilian functions and repurpose them for military production. This was chiefly enabled by tight state control. However, it also reflects Russia’s concern with production capacities; this stands in contrast with the West, where dual use is largely a discussion about technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of Russia’s legislative changes was the ability to expand the labour available to the defence industry. At the time of writing, Russian defence enterprises are drawing on labour from students in the last year of university and technical schools, as well as those convicted of criminal offences. Drawing on these sources of labour significantly reduces the wage expenses of these categories of employees, who receive a lower wage or are not paid at all. As of May 2024, there were about 34,000 convicts in Russia who were being used for forced labour, both at defence-industrial enterprises and in logistical and other functions supporting the defence industry. Russia aims to increase this source of labour in 2025 to 80,000. According to information released in May 2024 by British defence intelligence, the Russian government is also planning to introduce forced labour mobilisation, with appropriate changes to labour legislation being prepared for this purpose. Russia is also making immigrants from Africa and elsewhere work in its defence industries, although this is not likely to be an extensive phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important element of the transition to war is the blending of defence-industrial processes with the units of the Russian Armed Forces. The re-establishment of BTRZ (equipment repair workshops), was a key part of Russia’s industrial mobilisation plan and enabled the maintenance of legacy equipment. Specialist enterprises of the Russian Ministry of Defence and the repair units of the Russian Armed Forces are actively involved in restoring and repairing weapons and military equipment, as well as carrying out a full cycle of pre-combat preparations of new equipment, including in the combat zone. Such enterprises and units use mobilised personnel as well as conscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Russian military standards, repair work aimed at restoring the operational efficiency and serviceability of weapons or their components is divided into military repair, which is carried out at the bases and locations of military operating units (voiskovoi remont), mostly by the Russian Armed Forces independently; and factory repair (zavodskoi remont), which involves sending weaponry and military equipment to repair enterprises and manufacturing plants. In accordance with Russian standards, only major repairs are carried out at repair enterprises and manufacturing plants; all current repair work must be carried out by military units that operate the equipment independently or with the involvement of specialist repair units. Thus, only those systems that have suffered significant damage are sent to the factories; the military itself must repair medium and light damage. According to information released by the Russian Ministry of Defence at the beginning of 2024, of the weapons, military equipment and special equipment damaged during the war, only 7% is sent to specialist enterprises for repair. Most of the systems (66%) in need of repair are restored by military repair units. A further 22% are repaired by field teams of the Ministry of Defence’s enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-mobilisation&quot;&gt;Financial Mobilisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion above demonstrates that Russian industry has been reoriented to serve defence. This section turns to its funding. Analysis of Russia’s defence industry has chronically under-estimated its defence spending. When evaluating the level of financial support of the Russian Armed Forces, especially in terms of their ability to purchase new weapons, many researchers limit their analysis to the annual budget of Russia’s Ministry of Defence, as represented in US dollars. The budget of Russia’s Ministry of Defence in 2024 was approximately $52 billion, or approximately 15 times less than that of the US Department of Defense, and comparable to that of the UK or France. Given that Russia has a larger force and a significantly larger arsenal than the UK or France, and further expanded production after 2022, the dollar value of the defence budget clearly does not reflect defence spending. As Richard Connolly has observed, Russia’s defence expenditure is considerably higher when compared using purchasing power parity, which produces a level of expenditure commensurate with the results prior to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with a higher baseline of expenditure prior to the war, Russian expenditure on defence has also grown considerably since 2022. Total funding for Russian defence, security and intelligence in 2024 is about $150 billion (non-PPP comparison), with defence amounting to approximately 38.6% of the total budget and about 6.7% of Russia’s GDP. Organisations such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute exclude security and intelligence funding from calculations of Russian defence expenditure, as this includes a range of non-defence activities. While this was a defensible position prior to 2022, it is difficult to justify since the invasion. There are more than 25,000 troops of the Russian Guard operating in the occupied territories in Ukraine, fielding some 520 armoured fighting vehicles, 140 artillery pieces and 22 helicopters. The FSB (Federal Security Service), meanwhile, has established a large presence in the occupied territories that is critical to Russia’s counterintelligence regime there. Russia’s special services have also played a major role in financing the recruitment of personnel in Ukraine. Although security spending should not be counted as only related to defence, a significant proportion of it has directly contributed to the war effort since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the additional expenditure in the defence budget, furthermore, goes to financing the invasion in Ukraine, and the share of these funds intended for defence purchases is significantly higher than in Western countries. Thus, in 2022, the volume of the state defence order amounted to about $27 billion. In 2023, it was increased 1.5 times, and continued to increase in 2024. To cover such high expenditure, a significant part of the funds is raised using bank loans, where the main role is still assigned to Promsvyazbank (PSB). Since 2019, the Russian government has designated PSB as a support bank for servicing the defence industry. At the same time, the government signs long-term contracts with defence enterprises. Payments must be made after several years and, to fulfil the contract, the enterprises receive a targeted loan from PSB. This makes it possible to order and receive weapons for amounts that are significantly larger than the combined annual procurement budgets of the defence and security agencies. With the sufficiently high discount rate (16%) of Russia’s Central Bank and expensive loans provided at 18–19% per annum, defence industry enterprises receive loans in the range of 5–6%. This is ensured by subsidising the difference on the part of the government, as well as providing soft loans by the banks themselves, which then receive compensation from the Central Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the higher than usually acknowledged baseline of expenditure on defence in Russia, the significant expansion of the defence budget since 2022 and the favourable structures of loans to accelerate the availability of funds for defence enterprises, defence has drawn on budgets outside spending allocated to the Ministry of Defence. When assessing the real level of Russia’s cost of waging war in Ukraine, significant expenditure is borne by civil department budgets or is compensated by state and sometimes even private company funds. In addition to the state programmes “Development of the defence-industrial complex”, “Ensuring the country’s defence capability” and others, the military nature of which is understandable, the budgets of formerly civilian programmes are also used to finance the needs of the defence-industrial complex. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Space activities of Russia” and “Development of the nuclear power industrial complex” (about $1 billion per year).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Development of the electronic and radioelectronic industry” (more than $2 billion per year).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Scientific and technological development of the Russian Federation” (Ministry of Education and Science, about $15 billion per year).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Economic development and innovative economy” (Ministry of Economic Development, more than $4.2 billion for the period 2022–24).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Development of industry and increasing its competitiveness” (Ministry of Industry and Trade, more than $7 billion in 2024).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Development of the aviation industry” (about $10 billion by 2030 – Rostec will receive most of the funds) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all funds in each budget line are diverted to military expenditure. However, the emergence of a centralised planning process for military-industrial coordination within the presidential administration has allowed for investments from these budget lines to significantly contribute to the defence industries, through investment in machine tooling, training, logistics and other expenditures. These would otherwise be borne by the defence budget. The involvement of these programmes in defence-related activities is indicated by the decision of the Russian government not to publish data on their implementation. In addition, Roscosmos took a legislative initiative to classify information about all commercial operations of its companies to “protect suppliers”. The Russian government also decided not to publish data on several programmes in the field of international cooperation, in particular “Foreign Policy Activities” and “Support and Promotion of the Russian Language”. This may indicate that these programmes are used to finance the foreign operations of Russian special services. The Russian Fund for the Support and Protection of the Rights of Compatriots Living Abroad (known as Pravfond), which was officially supposed to provide legal assistance to Russian expatriates, was used to conduct Russian influence operations in 48 countries – the majority in Europe – on which millions of euros were spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-production&quot;&gt;Expanding Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output of Russian defence industries has increased due to the effectiveness of the measures outlined above. When it adopted a strategy premised on outlasting Ukraine and its international partners, Russia based many of its industrial targets in 2022 on an assessment of anticipated production in NATO countries. These assessments assumed that industrial mobilisation would be taking place across NATO, albeit unevenly, by 2023, and would reach the planned levels of output in 2024. To overtake the West, Russian enterprises began to work in three shifts, six days a week. At the end of 2022, Russian experts believed that Russia was four months ahead of the West in setting up arms production. This was evaluated as an extremely positive result, since, according to them, “the one who starts the military assembly line first gets an undeniable advantage”. Importantly, the failure of NATO countries to demonstrate alacrity in military-industrial investment at this time contributed to the Kremlin’s optimism over the long-term trajectory of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the maximum development of existing industrial capacities, the Russian government began to actively invest in the creation of new production facilities. According to analysis of satellite images since February 2022, many Russian defence enterprises were expanded, and some were built “from scratch”. This applies to enterprises engaged in the production and maintenance of ammunition as well as UAVs, combat helicopters and explosives. According to Putin, during the first year and a half of the invasion, Russia created 520,000 new jobs in the defence industry. The process of building up defence and industrial capacities has continued. In 2024, almost $1 billion was spent on the renewal and expansion of defence-industrial plants in Tatarstan alone. A significant part of these funds went to the development of the Kazan Gunpowder Plant. Notably, these funds are not government expenditures, but Rostec’s own investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of combat readiness of the troops depends not only on the amount of allocated funds, but also on the efficiency of their use. It is important to note that the main military-economic approach to providing the Russian Armed Forces with the necessary weapons and military equipment is to maximise their military-economic efficiency, which is determined by “the level of damage inflicted on enemy objects at a certain time and at a certain cost of material resources”. This determines the preference for cheaper, mass samples, as well as the restoration and modernisation of existing weapons, including those that are in “deep conservation” warehouses. This approach is particularly noticeable with Russian armoured vehicles. Of the 2,100 tanks that were delivered to the Russian Armed Forces in 2023, only 210 were new tanks and more than 800 were modernised T-72s. The remaining tanks were restored T-72s and T-80s, as well as some obsolete T-62s. There were also T-55s/54s, which are mostly used as self-propelled artillery to fire from closed positions, as well as to strengthen defence lines as long-term firing points. For comparison, in 2023, Ukraine received 70 Leopard 2s, 31 Abrams M1s and 14 Challenger 2s, none of which were new, as well as about 100 Leopard 1s manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has taken the same approach with guided aerial bombs. These have become one of the primary weapons of the Russian Aerospace Forces in the war. In production and, as a result, use, preference is given to the conversion of conventional unguided aerial bombs (FAB-250, FAB-500, FAB-1500 and FAB-3000), large stocks of which were left over from Soviet times, to guided glide munitions with a range of up to 70 km. Such a transformation is carried out by installing a mounted planning and correction module (UMPK) developed by the Russian enterprise Basalt, which is part of Rostec. The UMPK is a Russian analogue of the American JDAM. The relatively low price of the kit, which was about $20,000, attracted the Russians at that time. The UMPK is much simpler than the JDAM. In addition to the relatively accurate kits equipped with a satellite and inertial guidance system, capable of hitting targets at 40–70 km, the Russians also produce and use even more simplified versions that have only an inertial guidance system, and even uncorrected ones that are equipped only with folding wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of cheaper but more primitive modifications of the UMPK inevitably decreases accuracy. This is compensated for by the use of heavy high-explosive aerial bombs weighing 1,500 kg and 3,000 kg, as well as cluster and vacuum bombs, which significantly increase the area of effect. Thus, when using the FAB-3000, the radius of complete destruction of buildings is 18 metres, the lethal impact on manpower is 40 metres, and the infliction of severe but non-fatal injuries is 160 metres. Since the Soviet reserves are finite, production of the FAB-3000 has resumed in Russia, and production of the FAB-1500 and FAB-500 is also ramping up. Currently, Russian industry is trying to adapt UMPK kits for its stocks of FAB-5000 and FAB-9000, which will likely be used to destroy large industrial buildings, port and railway infrastructure, and warehouses, causing significant damage to residential areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partial success with the use of UMPK will probably inspire Russia to look for other relatively cheap solutions that can advance the mass production and use of high-precision weapons. Such solutions could include Russian analogues of the precision guidance kit (PGK) M1156, which turns unguided 155-mm projectiles into guided ones (estimated price of the kit is $12,000), as well as the AGR-20 advanced precision kill weapon system ($20,000), which turns unguided Hydra 70 rockets into precision ones. The Russian defence industry is trying to move in this direction. Among the projects that are receiving special support, it is worth highlighting the OU-122 system, which equips unguided 122-mm projectiles for the Grad and Tornado-G MLRS with a guidance system with an accuracy of up to 10 metres, as well as the Russian complex Ugroza, which turns Russian unguided S-5, S-8 and S-13 rockets into precision munitions. It is also possible to substitute the expensive Krasnopol laser-guided 152-mm projectile and return to the Dynamika module, which was a Russian analogue of the PGK M1156 for projectiles of 152-mm calibre and above, and costs less than $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to produce means of destruction in the volume that meets the requirements of a full-scale war (primarily artillery shells and missiles, the production of which has increased in Russia since the beginning of 2022 from 14 to 22 times, depending on type) directly depends on the availability of the necessary amount of explosives, rocket fuel and some other chemical substances. In Russia these are called “special chemistry”, following the Soviet tradition. Notably, before 2022 Russia was one of the world leaders in the production of explosives, and yet since the full-scale invasion, billions are still being invested both in the modernisation of existing enterprises and in the construction of new special chemical enterprises. The Ministry of Industry and Trade is responsible for the financing and implementation of these investments in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main tasks is to achieve complete independence from foreign supplies. Russia successfully circumvents sanctions by purchasing raw materials – even from NATO countries – to produce explosives. However, the Russian leadership does not favour this. To reduce dependence on imports, Russia is searching for and using alternative technologies. For example, Russia is not a producer of cotton, which is necessary to produce nitrocellulose which, in turn, is the main raw material in the production of gunpowder and other explosive substances. To improve its own supply, the Russian government is investing in the development of technology to produce nitrocellulose from wood and flax. According to statements from Rostec representatives, industrial production has already started and there are plans to increase the share of gunpowder produced from such nitrocellulose to 60–70%. While European explosives manufacturers are concerned about the reliability of the supply of cotton from China, the world’s largest cotton producer, research is also being carried out in China to produce nitrocellulose from wood. According to researchers, this will not only expand the raw material base, but also reduce the cost of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Russian government policies are reflected in the year-on-year production figures so far during the war. Many Western commentators have assumed a high level of corruption and thus inefficiency in Russian defence production. There is corruption, certainly, but this has not prevented Russian industry from meeting its allocated targets. In summer 2023, Russian industry provided the Ministry of Defence with an assessment of what it was likely to deliver in 2024. In 2022, Russian industry had produced 250,000 152-mm artillery shells, which had risen to 1 million in 2023. In 2024, the projected output was 1.325 million 152-mm rounds. In practice, Russia produced just over 1.3 million 152-mm rounds. Russian industry projected that it would produce 800,000 122-mm shells and managed to meet this target in 2024. Growth in 2025 will continue, especially later in the year as new special chemistry factories begin to reduce limitations on available propellent and high explosive to fill shells. Russian industry managed to produce 420 out of a target of 460 Kh-101 missiles in 2023, and, in 2024, this rose to over 500. Production of 9M723 ballistic missiles rose from approximately 250 in 2023 to more than 700 in 2024. UMPK production has also grown precipitously, from only a few thousand units in 2023 to around 40,000 units in 2024, with more than 70,000 ordered for 2025. UAV development is also expanding, with the production rate of Geran-2 one-way-attack UAVs reaching 30 units per day by the end of 2024. Armoured vehicle manufacture, including artillery production, has remained steady at around 2,000 tanks and 3,000 other armoured fighting vehicles per year, although only about 10–15% of these are new-build. However, Russian industry is rapidly acquiring barrel machines and working to expand production lines to increase the output of new-build armoured vehicles. Although output is increasing, it will be lower than current refurbishment rates. The figures speak for themselves in demonstrating that Russia has managed to significantly increase production of its critical weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, an examination of the measures that Russia has adopted makes both the scale of its industrial output and the speed of expansion comprehensible. The current Russian defence-industrial policy is characterised by the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high level of coherence due to the extensive preparation and planning of the defence-industrial mobilisation process, which was adhered to and implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high degree of centralised control following the establishment of a centralised coordinating mechanism to manage the process of defence-industrial mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The establishment of several elements of a war economy, including: industrial mobilisation; the introduction of the appropriate legal regime, which allows the government to set direct tasks to both state and private companies that produce weaponry and military equipment and their components, or produce or extract the necessary raw materials for their production; and the authority to set prices, and to limit the labour rights of employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A ready availability of funds, due to the growth in budget for the production and development of weapons, which is a result of significant increases in the direct budgets of the Ministry of Defence and other paramilitary bodies that are directly involved in the war, as well as the allocation to the war of budgets of a wide range of civilian departments and organisations (Ministry of Industry and Trade, Rosatom, Roscosmos, Ministry of Education and Science, RAN and others). Taking into account this level of militarisation of officially civilian programmes, the real level of budgetary funding of the Russian military’s defence industry programmes is significantly higher than indicated solely by the size of the Russian defence budget, which is about $150 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high level of attracting state and private bank credit to produce weapons and military equipment, with reimbursement by the Russian Central Bank of part of the interest on such loans. This allows defence-industrial enterprises to attract loans at 5–6% per annum in roubles. Such lending allowed for an increase in the volume of the state defence order in 2024, rising probably to more than $50 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A high level of investment in the modernisation of defence-related existing enterprises, as well as in the creation of new enterprises. Such investments are made from the enterprises’ own funds, the majority of which are state-owned, and from state programmes that are not formally related to the war and are aimed at ensuring Russia’s economic development, enabling import substitution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximising the combat effectiveness of weapons – according to the Russian criteria for this – by giving preference to mass, cheap samples of weapons and military equipment, and to the restoration and modernisation of existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reduction in the cost of services for the production and maintenance of weapons and military equipment due to the introduction of partial de facto labour mobilisation. This allows for the involvement in production and logistics of conscripts undergoing military service in special repair units, as well as the involvement of students who receive minimal payment for their work, and prisoners whose work is close to unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of industrial mobilisation exposes the Russian economy to the risk of growing economic instability over time and will have significant negative long-term consequences for Russian society if it is sustained. In the medium term, however, these policies are enabling Russia to massively increase output of military equipment. Moreover, a large proportion of the funds dedicated to this expansion represent capital investment in industrial capacity such that large-scale production can continue with reduced funds. Thus, unless there is a rise in political instability, it is likely that Russia will be producing large quantities of military equipment for a protracted period, even if there is a forced rebalancing of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-europe-blasé-faire-defence-economics&quot;&gt;II. Europe: Blasé-Faire Defence Economics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing before the Bundestag on 27 February 2024, then Chancellor Olaf Sholtz pronounced that, “The twenty-fourth of February 2022 marks a watershed in the history of our continent”. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine left Europeans feeling suddenly insecure, and galvanised a wide range of pronouncements pledging support for Ukraine, commitment to NATO and condemnation of Russia. In Germany, a special €100-billion fund was allocated to the Bundeswehr. And yet, despite large amounts of money being made available and near-universal rhetorical commitment to boosting defence, European defence production languished for more than a year. European countries have struggled systematically to convert capital and intent into production output. Understanding why they have failed requires an examination of the policy dilemmas that have hampered the allocation of funds, the regulation that has limited its effective expenditure, and the issues of supply chain resilience and competition that have limited value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;money-to-munitions&quot;&gt;Money to Munitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion many states pledged lethal aid. The desperate need to push equipment into Ukraine that would make an immediate difference with little training or support meant that man-portable anti-tank and air defence systems were prioritised, along with small arms. Thus, European countries began to send NLAWs, Panzerfaust-3s, Javelins, Karl Gustav recoilless rifles, Stingers, Marlet and Starstreak MANPADS to Ukraine. Although individually effective, the impact of these gifted weapons paled in comparison with the stocks of weapons Ukraine already possessed. Nevertheless, when Ukraine managed to blunt Russian advances more successfully than the country’s international partners anticipated, it also found itself running short of artillery munitions and other core platforms. Ukraine’s partners lacked either large stockpiles or latent production capacity for these items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial decisions on allocation of funds were straightforward and went in two directions: funding for replenishment of stocks of gifted weapons, such as NLAW; and funding for new platforms relevant to NATO’s conventional deterrence, such as F-35 purchases. For most European countries, however, there were some key policy challenges in how to allocate funds for Ukraine’s enduring resistance. The first challenge was simply a question of time. Although national stocks are not publicly disclosed, it is evident that Western European states had just weeks of artillery ammunition in stockpile. The problem was that while they could contract to expand production, their stockpiles were inadequate to bridge the gap until new production could come online. Russian forces prepared to press hard against Ukrainian troops in Donbas in April 2022. In response, European governments mostly prioritised purchasing ammunition from the international market on the basis that this would provide a more immediate benefit to Ukraine and a more predictable supply in the short term for the purposes of planning. The shorter delivery times were also politically attractive and fuelled the rounds of announced support packages. Leaders used these to demonstrate to their domestic audiences that they were making good on their rhetorical commitments to Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first orders to the defence industry were to replace the man-portable weapons that had been donated. Subsequent discussions arose on orders for artillery ammunition. This discussion became problematic. Most European states were only willing to propose orders to replenish their own stocks, or else wanted to make large one-off orders that could not be met by existing capacity and were also not long term enough to support capacity being increased. Companies therefore started to add orders sequentially to their order books. However, while governments proposed more contracts, the result was simply to extend the delivery timetable. Companies had no assurances from governments that orders would continue over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For governments, three main factors limited willingness to make long-term investments. First, they were unsure how long the demand would last. Second, the core requirements for the Ukrainian military were not assessed to necessarily be the same as for a NATO military – raising the question of opportunity costs. In some cases, ramping up production was seen as coming at the expense of NATO modernisation. Third, many countries worried about the competitiveness of an industry over the long term. For example, even if the UK ramped up munitions production, it was feared that it would produce fewer rounds – likely at an uncompetitive price point – than Germany. The risk, from the UK’s point of view, was that it would spend significant amounts to expand production capacity, and then have to subsidise an uncompetitive production line for a protracted period when there might well be a supply glut and demand slump across NATO. This led many countries to hold off placing orders. Countries such as Finland moved faster, but, initially, this simply placed their orders higher in the order books. In 2022, orders did not expand production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries on NATO’s eastern flank, the industrial paralysis that was afflicting Europe in 2022 was a cause of alarm. NATO members were depleting their stockpiles but failing to invest in industrial capacity to sustain Ukraine’s or NATO’s ability to fight. In this context, the Estonian government began to agitate for an EU commitment to supply Ukraine with 1 million rounds of 155-mm ammunition within a year. The EU as an institution was exceedingly reluctant to take on this task. Article 41.2 of the Treaty of Rome states that “Operating expenditure to which the implementation of this Chapter gives rise shall also be charged to the Union budget, except for such expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications and cases where the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise”. Although the Article refers to “operations” rather than industrial activity, the European Commission has interpreted it as preventing the EU institutionally from spending on orders with the defence industry. Nevertheless, the Estonians correctly pointed out that with each European state making its own orders to industry, the orders were small, but, if combined, would potentially be large enough to make it commercially viable for companies to invest in expanded production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia’s diplomacy achieved its objective of galvanising a political realisation of the importance of key war materials. However, it did not resolve the industrial problem. The EU, unable to fund defence procurement under its own interpretation of its mandate, instead set about negotiating framework agreements with defence companies to produce rounds at a fixed price, through which member states could each spend. This was to turn multiple small orders into one large one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mechanism, while innovative, ultimately failed, for one simple reason: the companies had no idea how many rounds were going to be ordered. The price set, therefore, reflected the fact that companies might need to have capital to invest in scaling production, or might need to retain small production lines with significant overheads. The result was an agreed price point of €4,000 per round, which many member states viewed as too expensive and therefore continued to try to draw up contracts directly with companies. Member states also did not like the idea of funding an EU project that would place orders outside their own territory. The result was that from an ambition to deliver 1 million rounds in 12 months, the EU managed to contract through its framework agreements 40,000 to be made in the first year, and a further 40,000 the following year. With member states refusing to put money forward, the project was given political protection by member states counting their own purchased rounds as contributing to the 1-million objective, so that the EU claimed to deliver 500,000 rounds within a year. This reflects what was eventually delivered to Ukraine, but a large amount of this was purchased from the international market, and not from new production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitivities over spending among Ukraine’s international partners were exacerbated by Russia’s coercion of Europe by constraining energy supplies. Across the continent, as the cost of energy spiked, governments had to reallocate spending in their budgets to subsidise energy and to build new infrastructure to expand liquefied natural gas capacity. This put pressure on European treasuries during a period of economic stagnation. It also created a political problem. Although European publics were largely supportive of Ukraine, private polling across the continent tended to show that defence was not a top priority other than in states along NATO’s eastern flank. Politicians, therefore, largely saw the diversion of major spending from other portfolios to defence as a vote-loser, whereas gifting stores or diverting existing defence expenditure to support Ukraine was a vote-winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU members were politically sensitive to price, and therefore spurned the European Defence Agency’s framework agreements. However, confidence in their direct contracting proved limited. Early in the conflict, arms companies suggested that with modest investment, they could significantly boost output of shells. When these proposals were examined, however, it was discovered that the speed at which companies could expand production was far lower than originally anticipated. To understand why, it is necessary to outline what is required to produce a shell. A shell must have its casing forged, be filled with high explosive and have a fuze added. In general, forging and fuze production can be expanded quite easily. Filling is more complicated. A shell is filled with high explosive in a temperature-controlled environment, where the temperature is slowly lowered so that the explosive in a batch of shells is set in an even manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most filling facilities were not working at capacity at the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, each type of shell uses the same infrastructure. Thus, companies quoted a capacity in response to government enquiries. However, orders made for either 155-mm, 105-mm, 122-mm or 152-mm howitzer shells, or 120-mm or 125-mm tank rounds, or 120-mm, 81-mm or 82-mm mortar bombs, suddenly took up the available filling capacity for other orders. When filling capacity hit a ceiling, the challenge in expanding production became regulatory: more locations needed to be certified to handle high explosives. Despite ministries of defence perceiving the urgency, the need to handle such matters with alacrity was not felt across government departments. These issues, however, were teething problems compared with the supply chain challenges that subsequently emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many arms companies, when approached by governments, quoted what was feasible in terms of output from their own production facilities. But this assumed a ready supply of raw materials. With small orders across Europe, manufacturers of high explosive and, more importantly, explosive propellants, had consolidated into a small number of suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been limited demand for highly enriched nitrocellulose, as the precursor for propellent powders, for decades. Suddenly, demand far exceeded supply. This had several consequences. The cost of explosive energetics rose steeply and drove up the price per shell. Prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 155-mm rounds cost between $800 and $3,000 (the higher cost reflecting framework agreements where companies held cold production lines ready for government). This rose to $6,000–$8,000 per round. At the same time, Russia had fixed the price for 152-mm ammunition from its domestic industries at around $1,000. Furthermore, while a certain amount of nitrocellulose may have been available on the market, and companies could assess how many shells they could produce based on that amount, the fact that governments were contracting domestic manufacturers in isolation saw these companies bidding against each other for these supplies. Beyond inflated costs, this also meant that where a European defence manufacturer succeeded in increasing production, it was often at the expense of another European company, so that while governments across Europe invested in munitions production, output remained far below both the projections of the manufacturers and the requirement from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major barrier to scaling the whole munitions enterprise was that key parts of it – especially nitrocellulose enrichment – had been offshored to China. In consequence, Western companies lacked not only the facilities and machinery, but also the skilled workforce to begin production. For industries, such as explosives production, where entry into the workforce required recruitment, potential vetting and a high level of sign-off from governments, private industry was again faced with the challenge of being asked to make investments in areas where the demand from government might be short lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2024, European investment in munitions production had started to see results. Germany and the Nordic states, in particular, had increased their levels of output. But production nevertheless continues to be significantly below demand. Ukraine needs approximately 2.4 million 155-mm rounds a year to confidently hold its defence line. Between the US and Europe, Ukraine received approximately 1.6 million rounds in 2023 and 1.5 million in 2024, and the consequences can be measured in lost personnel, equipment and, eventually, terrain. European governments continue to scour the international market to make up the shortfall. And while diplomatic efforts to convince countries with relationships with Russia – including Serbia, Egypt and others – to arm Ukraine have yielded results, it is nevertheless embarrassing that this is proving easier than increasing domestic production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four lessons that can be identified in this sorry story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, reflexive secrecy among NATO members – on production capacity for ammunition – has shielded democratic governments from accountability for a hollowing-out of the sector and limited the ability for coordination of production among allies, without significantly improving security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, governments have not questioned the resilience and depth of their supply chains. This has made it hard to anticipate the impact of large injections of capital into arms production in terms of the capacity to scale production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the chronic tendency to try to protect domestic manufacturing has driven intense competition among allies. This has meant investment was devalued, rather than used to encourage collaboration to maximise the efficiency of production across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, a desire to run defence industries to sustain the industrial requirements of a war purely based on free-market economics without price controls – but in a heavily regulated sector – meant that governments maximised risk to investors, while also driving up costs on themselves. The resulting incentive structure was one that left private businesses lacking trust and unwilling to commit capital, and governments unable to provide certainty to investors as to whether regulation would be sufficiently flexible to meet the demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, European governments pursued a form of blasé-faire economics, in which they wanted the private sector to solve the problem without creating any incentives or a regulatory environment that would allow it to do so. The conclusions are that governments need to retain effective data on their supply chains, have robust plans for expanding production, cooperate proactively with allies to efficiently burden-share and be much more interventionist in the business to ensure appropriate outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stockpiles-safety-and-obsolescence&quot;&gt;Stockpiles, Safety and Obsolescence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside failing to scale production of basic ammunition natures for three years while massively driving up the price of war materiel, European defence-industrial policy also failed to replenish stockpiles of precision weapons. The UK, for example, still has not replaced the man-portable weapons that it gifted to Ukraine in 2022, although it has signed contracts to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason for the failure to replenish precision weapons stocks is a consequence of the order profile within many precision weapons portfolios in Europe. Since the end of the Cold War, the anticipated expenditure rates of precision weapons have been low. Nevertheless, countries have wanted to maintain the competitiveness of their munitions. The approach has been to order a small production run of a given complex weapon, and then to contract the same business to develop a future and more-capable munition to be produced in similarly small quantities – often at smaller quantities owing to increasing costs. Thus, companies such as MBDA have been encouraged to design a weapon such as Stormshadow, build a specified number and then move to the design of future capabilities that keep pace with enemy defences, closing down the previous production line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence of these iterative improvements is that there is little emphasis given to retaining the capacity to manufacture more of the previous generation of capability. In the case of man-portable complex weapons production in the UK, this became evident when orders were placed to replenish stocks, only for the delivery schedule of new munitions to be set out to 2026. There were several reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the need to set up the production line and hire staff. But more consequential was the need to manage obsolescence. Because the original production had been concluded, some of the sub-components were no longer being produced, while the small numbers of components needed made re-establishing production of the sub-components uneconomical. This meant that the manufacturer had to redesign how to make the munition before it could set up new production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for small order volumes is the carriage life of munitions. Over time, weapons degrade and this can reach a point when they are deemed to be insufficiently reliable to be depended on in combat. For this reason, most countries specify a lifespan for a munition after which it needs to be disposed of. This means that if a certain number of munitions are expected to be used, the purchase of any further munitions will not only be wasted but will also impose further costs in safely disposing of the munitions. Russia does not have this approach and continues to store extremely old munitions. In many cases, this has reduced their reliability. In others, where inspection has determined that the munitions are not in a condition for use, it has provided a base for refurbishment of munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence suggests that the assessed lifespan of most Western munitions is considerably greater than is currently reflected in regulation. Not all countries certify weapons for the same period of time, but there is limited evidence to suggest that the countries that certify weapons for a longer period have correspondingly serious safety issues. Across NATO, there is sufficient evidence to extend the shelf life of a large proportion of munitions in some territories. Furthermore, there are conditions in which a munition is no longer suitable for its originally intended purpose. Weapons carried on aircraft, for example, can become fatigued because aircraft expose them to significant G-forces, temperature and pressure changes and therefore pose a flight safety risk if they are retained on aircraft weapon stations. However, Ukraine has demonstrated that many of these munitions can be usefully stockpiled and used in a ground-launched role. The result is that it should be possible to significantly increase both the size and lifespan of a stockpile in Europe simply by reassessing existing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems of obsolescence and small stockpiles were not confined to munitions. The UK, for example, initially gave Ukraine 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks (MBT), out of a fleet of 227. This was despite the UK intending to upgrade only 148 Challenger 2 MBTs to the Challenger 3. In part, the reason for the tiny fleet being donated stemmed from shortages of spares packs so that a larger fleet would see availability diminish rapidly for both Ukraine and the UK. Again, many of the components of the spares packs were no longer being manufactured, such that new production had to be established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the demand for armoured vehicles grew from across Europe, it became apparent that stockpiles of these vehicles were limited. This partly stemmed from a tendency to sell off old military surplus vehicles to private companies. In the UK, for example, the Treasury charged the military for the assessed depreciation in value of a given system held in storage. This meant that the armed forces were actively disincentivised by penalties from retaining equipment in stores. The tendency was therefore to pay for the removal of sensitive equipment and weapons from vehicles, and then to sell the hulls to private companies. In Belgium, this policy was followed in 2006 with the sale of the country’s fleet of Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns for about €15,000–€20,000 each. However, in 2023, when the Belgian government wanted to donate these vehicles to Ukraine, the company was offering to sell the vehicles back to the Belgian government for a cost significantly in excess of €500,000. The company argued that, to be effective, the vehicles would need their electronics and, in particular, their radar repaired, and that as the targets they would be used against had changed and the old components were obsolete and no longer available, the radar should also be upgraded. Additionally, the contracts were sales, and not storage contracts, and so the company could increase costs reflecting the urgency of demand and it was its decision as to whether the vehicles were sold. The Belgian government therefore could not control the timeline of retrieving the equipment from storage. No agreement was reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues that constrained the acceleration of expanding production were export controls and intellectual property (IP). To continue with the example of the Gepard, ammunition for the weapon was scarce as it had been withdrawn from service in most European operators in the 2000s. Switzerland had produced the ammunition, but, as a neutral country, it did not grant permission for its use in Ukraine. This required production to be established outside Switzerland, further delaying the delivery of key systems. In this instance, the workaround was simple because the IP for producing 35-mm shells was available elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With other systems, IP posed more of a problem. For example, EU investment in expanded 155-mm production did not address a key challenge. States had deviated from Standard since the Cold War. So, whichever 155-mm systems were invested in risked favouring some countries with investment over others – giving them economies of scale in production and thus a long-term structural advantage in the market. Furthermore, if production capacity supported specific systems, it would structurally advantage their associated specialist ammunition producers. Even where obsolescence meant that key parts were no longer produced, and the number of systems being serviced made it uneconomical to restart production of the relevant spares, there was nevertheless reluctance in some quarters to share technical drawings or other IP with Ukraine, where workshops might begin making the spares necessary to keep the vehicles in the fight. The intricacies of the various debates over IP and permissions to release equipment are less important than the overall effect. When Europe needed to surge both supply to Ukraine and production of supporting systems, these complications slowed and introduced uncertainties into planning that had a tangible negative effect on equipment reaching Ukraine in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that regulation across Europe has significantly undermined the ability to rapidly develop systems to retain competitiveness. UAV and air defence development is one of the fastest-growing areas of competition in Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia have developed an insatiable demand for UAVs, which are employed on a wide range of tasks, from reconnaissance and deception, to both tactical and operational strike. Given that Europe has a large aeronautical industry – European states have extensive experience in manufacturing UAVs, and access to many of the supply chains to obtain the relevant components – this is an area where European states should have had a significant advantage in mobilising to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most UAV development, however, although often drawing on expertise from across Europe, has been in Ukraine. The reasons for this largely relate to price and regulation. Most European states strictly regulate airspace and expect UAVs to be approved for operation by civil and military aviation authorities. The actual regulations are often more permissive. However, at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, militaries were extremely conservative in this area. The view in many militaries was that while they might have the authority to sign off on risk, if they did so and something went wrong, their permissions would be curtailed, threatening their mission. Across Europe, ministries of defence were largely prepared to suffer mission failure as long as they achieved procedural success. This speaks to wildly inappropriate career incentives in the civil service and militaries within these government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been consequences of tight regulation for UAV manufacturers. They have faced the need to design a UAV, and then to keep the production capacity and engineers employed throughout the testing and evaluation period, after which they might receive a contract – probably for a small number of platforms since European militaries are not losing them at comparable rates to the Ukrainian military. Since the UAVs supplied to Ukraine would often fail the regulatory hurdles for adoption into NATO forces, the equipment supplied to Ukraine could not be sold back into European militaries, but instead has had to go through significant subsequent modification. The result was often a 10-fold increase in cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not a UAV project, the same factors meant that a £20-million contract to deliver a capability to Ukraine came with an estimated cost of £200 million to bring the same system into service with the British Army in comparable numbers. In the UAV space, it is not uncommon for a platform that would cost £2,500 if manufactured for Ukraine to cost between £8,000 and £16,000 if made for the British military. The consequence of this is that European governments – while investing heavily in capability development for the Ukrainians – have not seen that investment drive a parallel modernisation of their own forces. This has, in the longer term, created a divergence of interests between money spent on Ukraine and money spent on force modernisation. But the reason for that divergence is largely regulatory and could be closed with effective policy. Necessary changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reappraisal of electromagnetic spectrum legislation and flight safety regulation to prioritise enabling the military and experimental capabilities, especially in specified geographic areas around military testing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reduction in support for defence venture capital and an increase in support available to scale ventures that have a proven track record.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alterations to the budgeting for military units to encourage the stockpiling of equipment and the building up of equipment reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An audit of ammunition life, handling procedures and risk management to simplify the stockpiling, storage and handling of munitions, and to align regulation of NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examination of the terms of reference appointing staff to oversee programmes so that authority to take risk rests with individuals who are being assessed on the effect they achieve against objectives, rather than their adherence to existing policy; if the trajectory of existing policy is towards mission failure, they should be obligated to change the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, therefore, looking at stockpiling and regulation across Europe reveals the reality that militaries are not rewarded or resourced to maintain large stockpiles of equipment. Governments pursue outsourcing to a degree that gives them an inability to control the timelines on access to stockpiles or reserves of equipment. The rules on stockpiling also contribute to a tendency to accept obsolescence entering the supply chains for critical systems, impeding their reintroduction into service. Moreover, safety regulations based on projected degradation – despite real-world data to the contrary – significantly increase the cost to European states of both storing and manufacturing critical defence materiel. Preparing Europe for an industrial war, therefore, requires a re-examination of the incentives on these matters, and, in particular, consideration of how those incentives manifest when action must be taken quickly to achieve mission success. The inadequacy of the current architectures speaks for itself. Three years into the largest security threat to Europe since the Second World War, European NATO still cannot meet the basic defensive needs of one country under war conditions. A great many officials will make excuses for the individual failings outlined in this paper. There is – it seems – always a list of reasons for making the wrong decisions. The question that Europe must answer is how it can ensure that it does not find itself in this position again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-ukraine-the-start-up-war-machine&quot;&gt;III. Ukraine: The Start-Up War Machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s industrial response to Russia’s full-scale invasion is vitally important to evaluating the industrial balance of the conflict. However, this cannot be fully understood without a brief appreciation of the condition of Ukraine’s defence enterprises prior to the invasion, where there was both latent capacity and systemic decay. This chapter therefore begins with an overview of the post-Soviet legacy of Ukraine’s defence industries, before examining efforts after 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dismemberment-of-an-inheritance&quot;&gt;Dismemberment of an Inheritance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1991, a significant part of the Soviet military-industrial complex was in present-day Ukraine. It consisted of more than 3,594 enterprises and scientific organisations that produced military and dual-purpose products, with a total of about 3 million personnel. Almost 700 enterprises, including 205 industrial associations and 139 scientific and industrial organisations, with a total of 1.45 million personnel, were directly engaged in the production of military products. Ukrainian scientific research institutions were involved in a high proportion of Soviet fundamental and applied scientific research in the field of security and defence. Ukraine produced intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) (including the SS-18 Satan), aircraft carrier cruisers (including the nuclear-powered super aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk), cargo planes (including the world’s largest An-225 and An-124), main battle tanks (the T-64 and T-80), air-to-air missiles, anti-tank missile complexes and a long list of other hi-tech weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of Ukrainian enterprises servicing defence declined rapidly after the fall of the Soviet Union. The number of defence-related factories declined by more than 50% by 1993, and there was a massive reduction in orders. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine not only stopped buying new weapons for a time, but also became the object of forced demilitarisation, during which weapons and military equipment were destroyed or even transferred to Russia at the expense of Western partners. Ukraine renounced 176 ICBMs (130 SS-19s and SS-24s), about 2,000 strategic nuclear warheads and about 4,000 tactical nuclear warheads. Demilitarisation also affected conventional weapons. As part of the Nunn–Lugar programme, for example, in the late 1990s, Ukraine transferred part of its fleet of strategic bombers to Russia: eight Tu-160 bombers; three Tu-95MS bombers; and 19 Tu-22M3 bombers. Russia was also given 581 Kh-55 cruise missiles with a range of 2,500–3,500 km and 386 Kh-22 cruise missiles with a range of up to 600 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it is these strategic bombers that Russia is using to launch missile strikes on Ukraine. To understand how significant the Ukrainian contribution was, it is worth noting that according to experts’ estimates, today Russia has no more than 60 Tu-22M3s, of which only half are in a state of combat readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, Ukraine was also forced to destroy 60 Tu-22Ms of various modifications – nine Tu-160s and 21 Tu-95MS – and 487 Kh-55 cruise missiles. In fulfilment of disarmament obligations to the US, 132 mobile operational-tactical missile complexes (Elbrus) with a flight range of up to 300 km, and 185 ballistic missiles were decommissioned. In 2012, S-200B air defence systems, with a range of up to 250 km, were withdrawn from service. The formal reason was that these complexes could potentially use missiles with a special nuclear warhead to destroy group targets. Under the terms of its cooperation with NATO, Ukraine also carried out the systematic destruction of its own conventional ammunition, light weapons and even small arms. Since 2006, 133,000 tonnes of ammunition, 1,000 portable anti-aircraft missile systems, and 1.5 million units of small arms have been destroyed in the course of NATO’s Partnership for Peace and its provisions on the destruction of “excess ammunition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preserving-skills-and-capacity&quot;&gt;Preserving Skills and Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, was also diminished. The Ukrainian defence industry lost the large internal orders that had previously underpinned its capacity. Instead, legacy Ukrainian industry focused on servicing the lifecycle of weapons and military equipment inherited from the Soviet Union, with new investment focused on modernisation rather than replacement. For the majority of Ukrainian defence enterprises, the only way to survive was to find foreign customers in the market for Soviet legacy arms. In a short time, Ukraine entered the list of the world’s largest arms exporters and had significant success, including in competition with Russia. One example of its competitiveness was the contract for the supply of 320 T-80UD tanks to Pakistan from 1996 to 1999. To fulfil the order, the Malyshev plant increased production to 110 tanks each year, just a fraction of the company’s total capacity to produce up to 900. At that time, the entire budget of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence for the procurement of weapons allowed only for the purchase of a couple of dozen tanks per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the fall of the Soviet Union, the number of people in the defence industry declined rapidly, while approximately 95% of all products of Ukraine’s defence industry were exported. Until 2014, a significant proportion of these exports also went to Russia, which was never able to completely replace Ukrainian products. Even after the start of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in 2014 – when Ukraine stopped military-technical cooperation with Russia – Moscow remained dependent on the supply of a number of important elements. Of note are the Ukrainian Motor Sich engines for Russian helicopters and airplanes and gas turbine engines for Russian warships produced by the enterprise Zorya-Mashproekt in Mykolaiv. In addition, Ukraine refused to continue servicing the Russian SS-18 Satan intercontinental missile systems, which were developed and produced in Ukraine at the Yuzhmash enterprise, and the SS-19 Stiletto, whose control system was developed in Kharkiv by the Hartron enterprise. Some experts believe that Russian aggression against Ukraine is partly due to Russia’s need to regain control over the Ukrainian defence-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the need for Russia to purchase products from the Ukrainian defence industry was one of the factors that allowed this industry to survive until 2014, and the Russian aggression that began in 2014 became an impetus for its subsequent development. After the Russian invasion of Crimea and, later, Donbas, Ukraine faced a de facto embargo on the sale of Western weapons to it, which lasted in various forms until 2018, when the US government finally approved the export of lethal weapons to Ukraine. Under such conditions, the Ukrainian defence industry became almost the only source of increasing the capabilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. As in the case of Russia after 2022, initially Ukraine’s main emphasis was not on the production of new items, but rather on the restoration and modernisation of equipment that was in long-term storage. As of September 2014, when active hostilities in Donbas were suspended by the start of the Minsk negotiation process, Ukraine restored 12,000 units of military equipment, a significant part of which was restored by the repair units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the following years, the main priorities of the Ukrainian defence industry became the replacement of Russian components necessary for the maintenance of existing weapons and military equipment, as well as rearmament due to the development of new systems. As of the beginning of 2021, Ukraine managed to replace at least half of all Russian components, and start serial production of a whole series of systems that were to prove their high efficiency during the full-scale invasion. In particular, these included the Neptune anti-ship missile complex, the Bogdan self-propelled howitzer and the Bukovel electronic warfare complex. However, this still leaves Ukraine dependent on sourcing some components from the international market, or from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian defence industry consisted of more than 300 enterprises, institutions and organisations involved in the development and production of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total number of workers in the defence industry was more than 250,000. Most of these enterprises were state-owned, and most of them were managed through the Ukroboronprom state corporation, which included 118 of the largest defence industry enterprises of Ukraine. The enterprises of Ukroboronprom were engaged in: aircraft construction and aircraft repair; production of high-precision weapons and ammunition; production and repair of armoured vehicles; production of radar, electronic warfare and communication systems; and shipbuilding. The Ministry of Strategic Industries was responsible for the formation of the state military-industrial policy, which covers the activities of both state-owned and private enterprises of the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;redirecting-the-enterprise&quot;&gt;Redirecting the Enterprise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Ukrainian defence industry had wide-ranging structural issues in terms of investment in facilities, its ability to generate revenue for investment from government contracts and limited access to international partnerships, the fact that the state had so much control over it proved significant during the initial transition to war. Ukraine did not implement formal industrial mobilisation. The share of the Ukrainian budget directed to the development of the defence-industrial complex and the expansion of production capacities was also much more modest than Russia’s. In 2022, only $60 million was allocated for these purposes. This rose to $300 million in 2023 and $1.2 billion in 2024. These funds were insufficient to either establish significant industrial concerns from scratch, or incentivise independent market actors. However, because Ukraine had large existing enterprises over which the state had control, these funds could go directly into restarting production. The presence of a large number of existing enterprises, as well as hundreds of thousands of qualified engineers and workers, whose jobs had previously been sustained by defence exports, was extremely important. They made it possible to provide immediate repair and maintenance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the country’s own and captured military equipment, as well as to establish repair and maintenance of Western equipment, and support and increase the production of ammunition and other weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite modest investments, Ukraine managed to significantly increase the production of weapons at existing enterprises. Moreover, it launched new ones during the first two and a half years of the war. The production of weapons and military equipment in Ukraine tripled in 2023, and, according to then Minister of Strategic Industry Oleksandr Kamyshyn, should have grown on a similar trajectory throughout 2024. In autumn 2022, the production of 152-mm artillery shells, used in the Soviet self-propelled howitzers Akatsiya, Msta-S and Hyacinth-S, began in Ukraine for the first time. In September 2024, Ukraine disclosed that it was producing 155-mm projectiles used in NATO artillery systems in Ukraine. This became possible thanks to the transfer of a licence for the production of these projectiles by the Norwegian government, and the provision of relevant machines by another state. According to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, every second piece of ammunition used in the combat zone, as of October 2024, was produced in Ukraine. This applies not only to artillery shells, but also to mortar bombs of 82-mm and 120-mm calibres, the serial production of which was established by Ukroboronprom and Ukrainian private companies together with partners from NATO countries. The cost of ammunition produced at Ukrainian enterprises is also significantly lower than prices on the world market. NATO buys 155-mm shells for $4,000–$8,000, whereas Ukrainian shells of the same calibre cost about $1,500. Ukraine, however, suffers from challenges in scaling the production of charges, just as in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has found the development and expansion of indigenous missile production more challenging. Prior to the full-scale invasion, the main effort was the restoration of tactical-operational missile complex “Tochka-U”. There was also ongoing work to develop a coastal defence cruise missile P360 Neptune as part of the Ukrainian navy’s strategy of coastal defence. This project was accelerated after the full-scale invasion to protect Ukraine’s coastline, which led to a successful engagement in April 2022 against the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, the cruiser Moskva. Subsequent work was undertaken to modify the Neptune to engage land targets. The capability that emerged had a functional range of 400 km with a 350-kg warhead, compared with the 200-kg warhead of the original anti-ship missile. This “land-Neptune” was used successfully against a number of Russian targets in Crimea and the oil terminal of the Kavkaz port in Russia. A longer-ranged variant of Neptune has since been developed, known as “Long-Neptune”, with a reported range of 1,000 km. In some respects, the return on investment for this programme is quite impressive. Only $40 million was spent on the development of the entire RK-360MC complex, including the cruise missile, command post, launchers, and transport and charging vehicles. At the same time, limited funds and restrictions on access to components have significantly limited Ukraine’s ability to scale the output of such programmes. Ukraine has pursued a number of parallel defence programmes, including for ballistic missiles, and a range of jet-powered one-way-attack UAVs and cruise missiles. Although production of these systems collectively is currently small, it is anticipated that the output of these systems will increase significantly in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of these efforts to the outcome of the war is evidenced by the resources Russia has devoted throughout the conflict in targeting the Ukrainian defence industry with long-range strike. As a result of attacks on defence enterprises during the full-scale invasion, at least 100 workers have died. To identify the locations of defence production, Russian special services actively used the shortcomings of the openness of Ukrainian registers. Such shortcomings allowed them to identify the addresses of production premises, as well as the names of managers and owners of enterprises. To reduce the threat, from the first days of the invasion, Ukraine actively used dispersion and organised the production process in such a way as not to accumulate significant volumes of finished products and components in one place. There was a protracted debate over the relocation of production facilities to hardened and subterranean structures. Early in the war, dispersion was preferred to reduce the disruption of output. However, following Russia’s increasingly intensive strikes throughout 2024, the government is now actively investing in the construction of protected locations for defence manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;harnessing-private-investment&quot;&gt;Harnessing Private Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Ukroboronprom and its subordinate enterprises have had success in expanding the production of critical weapons systems and developing key classes of complex weapons, the concentration of the defence industry under government ownership has been criticised within Ukraine. It is widely argued that the government was not able to invest in emerging technologies such as UAVs to properly enable their development. The restrictions on profit margins for sales to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence prior to the full-scale invasion also limited the capital available to invest. Nevertheless, at the start of the invasion, a large number of Ukrainian private companies sought to transition their activities to defence production and, in the initial phases, were not especially motivated by profit. When in 2022 it became clear that UAVs were a transformative capability for reconnaissance and strike, Ukraine also found that it could not source enough robust UAVs from the international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, an indigenous manufacturing ecosystem emerged. Although the UAV manufacturing ecosystem in Ukraine comprises more than 120 companies, it may be subdivided into three broad categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first tier are companies with the technical expertise to design and produce highly effective UAVs and to update them to remain effective in a contested electromagnetic environment. There are, in effect, fewer than 15 such enterprises and they often have close relationships with particular units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This enables rapid testing, evaluation and therefore refinement of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second tier contains companies that can design and produce simple UAVs that are moderately effective. Companies in this tier can also produce UAVs designed by the more capable enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third tier consists of companies that can replicate simpler successful designs but are not able to design effective UAVs. This comprises the bulk of enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of entities in this ecosystem drives an extremely fast adaptation cycle. However, it is also quite inefficient in terms of the speed that it can scale a given capability. The failure to consolidate many of the lower-tier enterprises means that there is a higher-than-necessary overhead cost for output. Nevertheless, output of UAVs has climbed month-on-month so that Ukraine now produces more than 100,000 UAVs, of all types, per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the UAV enterprise is the most widely promoted, it is not the only area of private defence innovation. Another good example is the distributed air defence enterprise, the backbone of which is the Sky Fortress sensor system, which uses distributed microphones across Ukraine to detect and track the acoustic signature of aerial targets transiting Ukrainian territory and thereby provide live tracking for the coordination of air defence groups. The key part of this system is its ability to accumulate the acoustic data in real time and undertake the algorithmic analysis of the acoustic data. The initial development of this system was achieved at a cost of about $5 million. The scaling of the system was achieved by using commercially available sensors and bearers so that parts of the system could be maintained and updated quickly and cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private companies have also begun to emerge in the production of legacy military systems, including armoured vehicles, artillery systems and even missiles. In 2024, the Ukraine’s private company KZVV began to produce 15 Bohdan self-propelled artillery systems of 155-mm calibre each month. Such levels exceed France’s monthly production of the CAESAR wheeled howitzer. In sum, as of 2024, Ukraine’s defence-industrial complex, together with private companies, covers 500 enterprises, employs 300,000 personnel, and is an important element of the Ukrainian economy. In 2023, of the 4.9% increase in Ukrainian GDP, 1.5 percentage points came from the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, a lack of funds remains the main challenge for Ukraine’s defence industries. Of the $40 billion in Ukraine’s defence budget for 2024, $30 billion was spent on salaries and other payments to military personnel, and only $6 billion was assigned to the purchase of weapons. At the same time, the lack of long-term contracts with the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, or special government bank interest compensation programmes (as introduced in Russia), have made it impossible to attract bank funds for crediting operations of the defence-industrial complex. The government attempted to resolve this problem in November 2024, when it adopted a programme of preferential lending to defence enterprises at a rate of 5% per annum. Although this is a step in the right direction, the size of the loans (about $2 million for working capital up to three years and about $10 million for investment projects) will not meet the problem of underfinancing of the industry. The Ministry of Strategic Industries continues to assess a significant level of slack capacity in Ukraine’s industries owing to a lack of finance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that foreign purchases of defence materiel from Ukrainian defence enterprises or joint ventures are the key to addressing this issue. An example of the former approach was the Danish government’s decision in early 2024 to finance the production of 18 Bohdan self-propelled howitzers, which could subsequently be gifted to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. They were manufactured and handed to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence two months after the contract was signed. In September 2024, the Danish defence minister signed a further agreement with his Ukrainian counterparts for an additional $630 million of investment under this scheme. It is worth noting that most of this amount, almost $440 million, will be financed by Russian assets frozen in Denmark. In October, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence announced that Lithuania plans to finance the production of the Ukrainian rocket-drone Palyanytsia for $10 million. At the beginning of November 2024 Norway also signalled its intention to start purchasing weapons for the Armed Forces of Ukraine from Ukrainian manufacturers. Since September 2024, Ukrainian manufacturers have also been invited to tenders held for weapons purchases by the UK and Latvian ministries of defence. Financing the Ukrainian defence industry is important to ensure jobs and the stability of the Ukrainian economy in the event of a ceasefire or similar pause in high-intensity fighting, and will reduce what may otherwise be required in financial aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model of a joint venture has significant additional long-term benefits. First, it means that Western governments can order from their own industrial manufacturers. However, the cost of production can be driven down by producing elements of a system in Ukraine. It also means that systems with sensitive elements – such as guidance units – for which countries may be reluctant to transfer IP, can be added into weapons where much of the body and other sub-systems are manufactured in Ukraine. Finally, there is the opportunity for this to create a bridge from Soviet legacy systems to Western systems, allowing Ukrainian joint enterprises to compete with Russia for contracts around the world. A good example here is projects relating to air defence. Due to the shortage of ammunition for the Soviet air defence systems, which remain in service with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Buk and Kub systems are being adapted so that they can use AIM-7 Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles. NATO has a significant interest in maintaining large-scale production of air-to-air missiles because of the centrality of airpower in its way of war. Moreover, this project is extremely important because it shows how cooperation between Ukrainian and Western defence industries can find solutions that allow Russia’s role in the market for the maintenance of Soviet systems to be replaced, even where Russia has a complete monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, therefore, Ukraine has been able to significantly increase its defence-industrial output with the assistance of its international partners. There were two critical enablers for this expansion: the large pool of talent available because of the previously high level of defence-industrial production from the 1990s; and the significant level of government control of the defence-industrial sector, which allowed for the rapid pivot of activities. Access to capital, however, was a major constraint on defence production and innovation prior to, and during, the full-scale invasion. The question is whether market power among Ukraine’s international partners can be harnessed to expand the production capacity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Russian, European and Ukrainian defence-industrial response to the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine reveals important lessons on how to effectively translate investment into defence-industrial output. These lessons relate to financing, the amount of latent capacity, the level of government control, and the regulatory environment of the products that emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On preparation, one of the clear differences between Russia, Europe and Ukraine is that Moscow had a mobilisation plan and stockpiles from which to draw. The mobilisation plan included legislative changes. The Russian industrial-mobilisation process was largely successful. Ukraine lacked such a clear plan but had many of the same mechanisms in place due to its Soviet legacy. It was therefore able to implement a level of industrial mobilisation, albeit at a slower rate. European states either had no plan or did not activate it. Nor did they have the data to rapidly develop and execute a plan. This lack of preparedness meant that European states were slow and took many false steps. The lesson is simple: NATO members need industrial annexes to their national defence plans and these should be deconflicted between members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast in government involvement in military-industrial processes is also important. In Russia and Ukraine, the government retained an extremely high level of ownership over defence enterprises, which allowed them to be highly responsive to government direction. In the US, the law allows the government to direct companies to service the defence industries, and key areas such as ammunition production remain part of the Department of Defense. These arrangements have made it possible to significantly expand output. Other countries such as France, where the government retains significant control over defence industries, have also largely succeeded in meeting planned output increases – with an increase in production of artillery systems and a steady increase in shell production – although their plans were not especially ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of Europe, however, the market has proven a very poor driver in response to the conflict. The incentives of the market – increased profits – are not necessarily aligned with maximising the volume of materiel produced for a given level of investment. Moreover, governments did not incentivise private industries to behave constructively. The refusal to give long-term orders or to consolidate orders, for example, made it very difficult for defence companies to justify the risk of expanding capacity rather than extending existing order books. The lack of government involvement in much of the supply chain also meant that governments lacked the data to understand where expanded capacity would most effectively enable increased production. Orders for shells without investment in special chemistry, for example, drove up prices more than it increased output. At the same time, governments did not create or enact legal mechanisms that would have allowed them to impose a sense of mission on defence industry. Given that governments are the customers of these enterprises, and there is limited investment beyond government, it is evident that the state did not exercise the leverage it could have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latent capacity is also relevant for industrial readiness. In Russia, there was significant latent capacity in its defence industries: civilian industries were pushed into the defence sector. In Ukraine, there was similarly significant underuse of the defence-industrial base prior to the full-scale invasion. More importantly, both countries had significant reserves of trained scientists and engineers with experience in the defence sector who could be brought back into the industry. This was existentially important to Ukraine. Across Europe, there is a large pool of talent in these areas, but the lack of mobilisation left a significant body that was not related to defence. Moreover, with very few countries producing defence materiel throughout the supply chain, there was significant unevenness in the availability of trained personnel. It has been especially difficult to attract workers to areas such as special chemistry, an area from which Europe divested for a long period. Thus, even where companies have tried to expand, they have struggled to find the right talent. The main impact of this has been to extend the lead times on capital, which has led to increased outputs. A key question for Europe’s readiness for a major conflict, therefore, is to understand the areas where it has surplus talent in one country that is needed in another, or where there is simply a lack of skills and it is worth investing to train personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial landscape also differed. Russia has made massive investments in the defence industries, going well beyond the funds allocated to defence within the state budget. Such investments represent the partial mobilisation of the economy to a war footing, which has allowed Russia to significantly expand and modernise its defence-industrial enterprise, although this is at the expense of the rest of the economy, including critical sectors such as education and health. Much of the investment has gone into expanding production facilities, as up-front costs. It is anticipated that, in 2026, funds will be redistributed to other ministries, but this will not reduce the level of orders placed with the defence-industrial enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine had both similar latent capacities and high levels of state control of the sector. However, the government did not move to a full mobilisation footing. The lack of funds for the sector has also remained a major limiting factor in the expansion of critical defence enterprises and the scaling of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, in aggregate, large sums of money were made available. However, the investments in each country represent very modest increases in investment, such that they have not stimulated a proportional increase in defence manufacture. Relatively small, one-off orders have generally not incentivised the defence sector to expand its production capacity. Investment has also overwhelmingly focused on products rather than fundamentals in the supply chain, such that investment has driven competition in the higher tiers of the supply chain and increased cost, rather than expanded output. The profile of investment, therefore, has been poorly suited to enabling an expansion of defence-industrial output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries should not embark on a level of mobilisation at the expense of the wider economy, as pursued in Russia, and the prioritisation of R&amp;amp;D spending in many European enterprises has undoubtedly produced highly capable weapons. However, NATO does emphasise the importance of deterrence to prevent the outbreak of war. Deterrence is psychological. In this context, the European response to the invasion may be deemed a failure: Russia assessed the policies that were pursued and deemed them inadequate. It is worth emphasising that a relatively modest increase in expenditure across NATO could have had a significant effect on Russian calculations, if that money translated into tangible outputs. At present, the debate on budget inputs across NATO is largely divorced from the debate about military outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth comparing regulation. In Russia, regulation has proven extremely lax for the storage of ammunition, working conditions and quality control. This has led to munitions striking Russia rather than Ukraine and stores being detonated by small numbers of low-yield munitions, and has arguably made defence-industrial output less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, the freedom to test equipment under battlefield conditions as well as easy access to training areas has enabled rapid R&amp;amp;D for both Ukrainian and European defence enterprises. At the same time, failures of security at enterprises have exposed them to significant risk from the Russian special services, while information handling and the approach to IP during the war has arguably reduced the willingness for collaboration from international partners, and the availability of investment capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the general approach to regulation has been detrimental to increased defence production. In the first instance, restrictions on access to testing and evaluation facilities have led to large numbers of systems being produced that do not meet requirements. This is only discovered at a late stage. Where effective systems have been procured, the risk that businesses must take on in developing them before they are certified has hugely increased costs. Planning laws and other processes have also increased cost and reduced the speed at which defence enterprises can expand. Moreover, few countries have demonstrated a joined-up approach to such issues in government so that the UK, for example, has yet to achieve its announced ambition of expanding 155-mm artillery manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest difference, and the most important area of policy consideration, is that Russia and Ukraine ultimately have a single authority responsible for the enterprise. In Europe, each country is too small to be self-sufficient but there is no multinational coordination of the defence industry. Member states have opposed the EU playing such a role. NATO lacks authorities and information. As competitors, European defence enterprises tend to be very secretive about their capacity with both other governments and other companies. The result is that there is neither efficiency nor the data and authorities anywhere to rationalise the process. Coherence of multinational supply chains is in the interests of all European NATO members if they need to transition to war. So, whether in NATO or the EU, the establishment of an entity with this responsibility seems critical. If Europe wishes to deter war, it must demonstrate that it is developing the capacity to wage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, ransomware attacks have become a persistent national security threat. Attacks against hospitals, schools and businesses of all shapes and sizes have normalised what should be intolerable: organised cybercriminals regularly disrupting and extorting victims, causing misery in the process and undermining the UK economy and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some operational success and increased international collaboration against ransomware criminals, significant policy interventions have not been forthcoming. The UK government, like many other national governments, has received criticism for its lack of progress on ransomware. In December 2023, for instance, the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy published a report that argued: “If the UK is to avoid being held hostage to fortune, it is vital that ransomware becomes a more pressing political priority, and that more resources are devoted to tackling this pernicious threat to the UK’s national security.” Much of this criticism has been directed towards the Home Office, which is the lead department for the government’s counter-ransomware strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After several years of development, the UK government has launched a consultation on a set of legislative proposals that aim to reduce the impact of ransomware on the UK and increase the amount of intelligence available to operational agencies on incidents and payments. The consultation has three main proposals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A targeted ban on ransomware payments for regulated critical national infrastructure (CNI) sectors and the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new ransomware payment prevention regime, which would require victims to acquire authorisation from the government before they can proceed with a ransom payment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mandatory ransomware incident reporting regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation on these proposals closes in April 2025. If legislated in their current form, the proposals would significantly change the experience of UK ransomware victims and arguably represent the most consequential intervention by any national government on ransomware to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 25 February 2025, RUSI convened a half-day workshop to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the government’s proposals. Thirty-eight participants took part in the workshop. Most were senior stakeholders from industry, including chief information security officers representing CNI sectors, and senior managers and practitioners from law firms, incident response firms, cyber security vendors and cyber insurers. Additional participants were drawn from regulators, civil society, UK government and UK law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The half-day workshop was broken into three main sessions. In the first substantive session, a Home Office representative provided a brief overview of the proposals, which was followed by a moderated Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second session, the workshop participants were divided into three breakout groups. Each breakout room had the same task: to assess the proposals in relation to the government’s stated objectives. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to reduce the amount of money flowing to ransomware criminals from the UK, thereby deterring criminals from attacking UK organisations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to increase the ability of operational agencies to disrupt and investigate ransomware actors by increasing our intelligence around the ransomware payment landscape&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;to enhance the government’s understanding of the threats in this area to inform future interventions, including through cooperation at international level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final session focused on asking participants to discuss alternatives to the government’s proposals. Workshop participants also reflected on whether their perspectives on the proposals had changed following the breakouts, and if so, how. To facilitate candid discussion, the workshop was held on a non-attributable basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal-1-payment-ban-for-public-sector-and-regulated-cni-providers&quot;&gt;Proposal 1: Payment Ban for Public Sector and Regulated CNI Providers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the ransomware challenge is the issue of incentives around ransom payments. Ransom payments sustain the ransomware business model. The high profit margins of ransomware have drawn more cybercriminals into the ecosystem and enabled operators to expand their capabilities. Although there is some evidence that the number of victims paying and the revenues generated fell in 2024 – likely due to the impact of law enforcement operations and increased organisational cyber resilience – ransomware remains lucrative for many operators and affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over recent years, the question of whether to ban ransomware payments has become one of the thorniest and most contentious in cyber policy. Proponents of a ban argue that because payments perpetuate the criminal business model, banning them will remove the primary motivation for ransomware attacks. To date, policymakers in multiple countries have largely resisted these arguments due to opposition from industry, concerns about “revictimising” victims and uncertainty about the effectiveness of a ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government has proposed a partial payment ban for ransomware. The ban will cover all public sector bodies and regulated owners and operators of CNI. The government’s logic for the ban is that removing the ability to monetise ransomware will make the UK public sector and CNI “unattractive propositions for ransomware attacks” and therefore deter criminals from targeting UK organisations. At present, the government has not committed to saying how the ban would be enforced or whether criminal or financial liabilities would be levelled against organisations that flout it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workshop, participants were asked to assess the payment ban against the government’s stated aims, whether it was fair to victims, and what possible intended and unintended outcomes it could create. In general, participants were negative about the assumption that the proposed ban would have a significant impact on the volume of ransomware incidents in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some participants agreed that the proposed ban would probably reduce the number of payments that would go to criminals, there was scepticism about whether this would represent a significant blow to the profitability of ransomware, given that UK victims probably represent only a single-digit percentage of global ransomware victims. Even more scepticism was expressed about the government’s assumption that the proposal would ultimately deter attacks against the UK public sector and CNI. This is because most ransomware operators are opportunistic, rather than seeking to target specific victims. A joint National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and National Crime Agency (NCA) 2023 white paper on ransomware explicitly assessed that “the majority of the initial accesses to victims are gained opportunistically and are not targeted against a particular organisation or business sector”. One participant argued that even if we assume ransomware operations are targeted, cybercriminals are unlikely to have a rigorous understanding of how the UK defines and regulates CNI. The possibility that the proposal has been developed based on a misguided assumption of how ransomware criminals operate led another workshop attendee to remark that the Home Office “has gone into this with one eye open”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants argued that the proposal could end up creating more harm than benefit for the UK if essential services experience sustained disruption or businesses are forced to declare bankruptcy because of the cost of business interruption. A particular concern among participants was the possibility that organisations with limited financial and technical resources to improve their cyber resilience – such as schools, local councils or small businesses – could be disproportionately affected by the proposed ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to mitigate this could be to ensure that more financial and/or technical support is made available for organisations and sectors covered by the proposed ban. Indeed, some participants viewed this as an essential precondition for implementing the ban. However, this would require a significant step change in how the government supports victims of ransomware and other cybercrimes. At present, the UK state provides very limited incident response or financial support for organisations affected by ransomware, even in the public sector. There is currently no suggestion in the consultation documents that the government intends to change its existing approach. Several workshop participants noted that this (and other aspects of the consultation) raised concerns that the proposals have been developed in a silo from other government departments and agencies responsible for cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, participants were sceptical about the sustainability of a hardline ban. For instance, if a ransomware attack against a public sector or CNI entity presented a serious risk of threat to life should the ransom not be paid, the government would be put in the challenging position of deciding whether or not it should follow (or uphold) its own law. At this stage of the consultation, the government has declined to discuss the possibility of exemptions and thresholds. If a hardline ban is upheld, lives could be put at risk in extremis. If exemptions were created (pre-emptively or reactively), ransomware threat actors could use this as a rationale to insist that public sector and CNI victims can or should pay a demanded ransom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final theme of the workshop discussions on the proposed ban centred around compliance and enforceability. While there was a consensus that many organisations would comply with the ban, it was noted that some would seek ways around it. Several participants from incident response vendors and law firms, for instance, argued that some large, privately owned CNI providers would potentially try to divert ransom payments via offices in other jurisdictions or through subsidiaries. Other participants raised questions about effective compliance with the ban for organisations at the other end of the spectrum: SMEs. For instance, ensuring that SMEs in affected sectors are even aware of their obligations under the ban will require the government and regulators to put significant resources into awareness-raising initiatives and campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-recommendations-for-the-government&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Recommendations for the Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the workshop discussions, the following key takeaways and recommendations were identified for the government on the proposed payment ban:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there is an ethical case that UK taxpayer money should not be used to fund payments to criminals, there is considerable scepticism among industry stakeholders that the government’s proposal will reduce the impact of ransomware on the UK. The government should consider the argument that the ban will not achieve its objective of deterring ransomware attacks against the UK public sector and CNI. As part of this, the government should encourage ransomware threat intelligence specialists in the NCSC and NCA to provide private feedback on the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government should develop incentives, as well as punishments, to ensure that the ban is fair and that organisations comply with it. This will likely involve expanding the types of financial and technical support available to victims of ransomware in affected sectors. There was a strong sense among workshop participants that a precondition for legislating a ban should be improving support available to affected SMEs and public sector organisations with smaller budgets or limited access to central government funding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, if the government is committed to the ban, it should consider how to ensure that multinational companies or companies headquartered in other jurisdictions comply with the ban. Ultimately, this may rest on other countries following the UK’s lead and implementing their own bans. The possibility that some multinationals may circumvent the ban also highlights that its effectiveness may rely on internationalising it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal-2-the-ransomware-payment-prevention-regime&quot;&gt;Proposal 2: The Ransomware Payment Prevention Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, British ransomware victims who are considering a prospective payment do not need to engage with government or law enforcement entities. Where a payment is ultimately made, neither the victim nor their third-party support needs to report this payment to any relevant public body; however, some do so on a voluntary basis. The Home Office believes that there is scope to engage with – and potentially influence – the ransomware victim journey, by requiring that ransomware victims engage with a suitable government entity when they are considering making a ransomware payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this effect, the government is proposing a ransomware payment prevention regime, which would force UK organisations to engage with a vested authority to request authorisation before they can make a prospective ransomware payment. The vested authority – a proposed new 24/7 unit – would review the case and determine whether authorisation can be granted. During the workshop Q&amp;amp;A, Home Office officials suggested that an initial response would be provided to the victim organisation within a target 72-hour window. Such a payment authorisation regime would be the first of its kind – for ransomware payments – either in the UK or internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop Q&amp;amp;A, Home Office representatives indicated that the decision to authorise (or not) would be based on sanctions risk (for instance, whether a payment could go to North Korean entities), possibly with the addition of other weighted factors. (At the time of writing, Home Office representatives have not outlined what these additional weighted factors might be.) Once authorisation was granted, the victim organisation would be able to take its authorisation certificate to its chosen ransomware payment intermediary and proceed with the payment. It is important to emphasise that under the proposals as currently worded, a ransomware payment by a UK-based organisation made without explicit authorisation would, in effect, be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop highlighted that several aspects of the proposal require clarification. For instance, it is not clear whether a victim organisation would have the right to appeal a negative decision. It is also unclear how this law would interface with firms which have a multi-jurisdictional presence and which could, in theory, make a payment from outside the UK without liaising with the authorisation regime in the UK. The Home Office is reportedly aware of these issues and is considering them as part of ongoing internal deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workshop participants were forthcoming and forthright in their views about this proposal. Perspectives were shared on: the degree to which the proposed authority could operate effectively; whether it is an appropriate use of resources; and whether there are risks of unintended consequences. On balance, views on the proposal were generally negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns were raised about whether the prospective authorisation unit could provide a clear response within a sufficiently rapid timeframe. Participants were worried that the unit could under-deliver on the 72-hour turnaround (for instance, during busy periods). Some participants also noted that, in their view, 72 hours was too slow. This highlights the diverging priorities of victim organisations and government in the event of a ransomware attack. The victim organisation, which may be in the initial phase of a severe forced crisis, will want to quickly develop an assessment of its options for containment and remediation. The payment of a ransom may be one option among others; in extremis, it may be the most expedient, the “least worst” or even the only option available. In contrast, the government’s priority – as an external observer – would be to not only assess the rationale and legality of the proposed payment, but also impose time delays on the victim’s decision-making, in order to counter a rushed decision to make a ransom payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, participants recognised that if the government’s intention is to throw “grit” into the ransomware response ecosystem and “scare” victims into applying serious thought about whether or not they should pay a ransom, the proposal would partially achieve this. Previous research has highlighted that “taking time” in the aftermath of a ransomware incident can reduce a victim’s propensity to pay a ransom. Participants from the ransomware response ecosystem noted that from their experience, the added “nudge” of a government, regulatory or law enforcement agency becoming aware of a prospective payment may make some victim organisations less inclined to seriously explore a payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also felt that to make the proposal meaningful, the government would need to “stick its neck out” and provide clarity on what constitutes a sufficient sanctions check. At the moment, while there are some commonalities, ransomware sanctions check procedures vary between different firms. Participants suggested that the government could, by publishing clear guidance alongside the formation of the new unit, provide a legal benchmark and counter permissive interpretations of sanctions compliance that may be present among some industry actors. This would be a significant step change in the government’s approach to ransomware sanctions, as the current approach offloads all responsibility onto victims, insurers, payment brokers and financial institutions. At present, while sanctioned entities have almost certainly received payments, no sanctions enforcement has taken place in the UK – or indeed internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some participants noted that they were sceptical that the UK government would actually provide clarity or take a position on sanctions checks. In their view, it was much more likely that the government would continue to offload responsibility onto industry. Nonetheless, the unit would presumably need to have access to its own sanctions data, an ability to make a judgement call, and a means of conveying its judgement in a meaningful way to a victim organisation. Participants noted that it was unclear whether government or private sector intelligence (or a combination) would be used to inform the authorisation decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants raised concerns about the ethics of the proposed law and unit, as the government could, in effect, “play God” and determine whether a business goes bankrupt due to a ransomware breach. While this hypothetical scenario assumes that a ransom payment would both be affordable and resolve the encryption/exfiltration issue, participants emphasised their disquiet that a government body should be able to make such a high-stakes decision about the future viability of a UK organisation that has been the victim of serious organised crime. Participants suggested that this potential risk could be more pronounced for SMEs, which they referenced as the “bread and butter” of the UK economy. A common phrase through the workshop was that where punitive measures are to be applied against victims of serious organised crime, the UK government should offer more “carrot” to accompany the “stick”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-recommendations-for-the-government-1&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Recommendations for the Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The workshop suggested that there is probably considerable opposition to the proposed payment authorisation regime in parts of industry involved in ransomware response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the proposed regime does go ahead, the Home Office should provide clarity on a number of aspects of its design and implementation. These include but are not limited to: appeal processes; type and levels of censure for non-compliance; rationale for authorisation and denial; and the role of loopholes, including payment organised outside of the UK. These are important elements that will define the success and failure of the proposed regime and therefore should be subject to additional public consultation at the earliest possible opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As with the other proposals, the government will need to dedicate considerable resources to raising awareness among SMEs about their obligations under the payment prevention regime. The government may well be underestimating the amount of resource required to raise awareness among SMEs, given their challenges with cyber security and general capacity for compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Home Office may want to give concerted thought as to whether the payment authorisation regime is the most effective means of achieving the government’s goals, and whether, at an estimated £17.3 million per annum, the new unit would present a cost-effective intervention against ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;proposal-3-a-mandatory-ransomware-incident-reporting-regime&quot;&gt;Proposal 3: A Mandatory Ransomware Incident Reporting Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, ransomware breach reporting in the UK is patchwork and ad hoc. In essence, multiple UK entities may receive voluntary reports from ransomware victims. Additionally, the voluntary nature of ransomware reporting means that victims may decide not to report their breach. They may also decide that the nature of their breach does not necessitate a report to the Information Commisioner’s Office (ICO), as data subjects may not be impacted. The lack of a singular catch-all entity to report to – and issues with synchronising existing reporting – means that it is not possible to map the scale and depth of ransomware incidents in the UK. To design and implement suitable interventions, it is necessary to be able to map the problem with sufficient accuracy. The current lack of reporting on ransomware attacks also hinders the ability of future victims to learn from the experiences of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Home Office is proposing a new mandatory reporting regime for ransomware incidents. Victims of ransomware would have an initial 72-hour window to report an incident after it has been discovered. The victim would then be expected to submit a full report within 28 days. This proposed reporting requirement would be in addition to existing requirements to report a data breach to the ICO and other relevant regulators. As one ex-law enforcement officer noted during the workshop, the UK does not typically have a policy of mandatory reporting of crime – although the UK’s Crime and Policing Bill, introduced to Parliament in February 2025, includes provisions to introduce a new statutory duty for professional child-support stakeholders to report suspected cases of child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop Q&amp;amp;A, Home Office representatives noted that they are deliberating as to whether reporting should be threshold-based, and if so, what the threshold would be. The core purpose of the mandatory reporting regime would be to build the national UK situational awareness of ransomware, which, at present, is based on a patchwork of mandatory reporting to the ICO (and other regulators) and voluntary reporting to the NCSC and law enforcement (typically through Action Fraud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three proposals, the reporting regime was the most warmly received by workshop participants. Participants viewed it as the most cost-effective of the three proposed interventions. There was also a sense that it had the least risk out of the three proposals of causing or exacerbating harm to victims of serious organised crime or of displacement and unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, there was also a pronounced sentiment in the workshop that mandatory reporting was a necessary precondition before the other proposals could be legislated – that is to say, in the absence of a clearer national picture about the scale and depth of ransomware incidence in the UK, proposals 1 and 2 are premature and are based on imperfect or even faulty impact assessments. Participants described the degree of the “known unknown” of the UK’s ransomware threat intelligence picture as more pronounced compared to other analogue or digital threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised that any mandatory reporting regime would need to be “low lift” for the victim organisation and empathetic to its circumstances at a time when it is in crisis and may not have a clear picture as to what has occurred. Participants noted that some organisations may not conduct a forensic investigation of the incident and may not be in a position to provide a detailed report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with discussions about public–private cyber threat intelligence sharing, some participants expressed a view that the channel of information should be two-way or quid pro quo; for instance, a victim organisation could be presented, after its initial report, with information about the type of ransomware which was used in its attack. This information could be used by the victim and its third-party support to inform forensics, remediation and recovery efforts. Research has highlighted that ransomware victims can feel that they report into a “black hole”, with limited or no tangible acknowledgement from the public entity that they report to. There is arguably an opportunity to support the formation of a more tangible feedback loop. To maximise the utility of gathered data, the Home Office – and wider government – should consider how the NCSC and the national, regional and local law enforcement community can be primed to best make use of the data to support victims, inform operational activity and bolster prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while the “displacement” effect or unintended consequences of a mandatory reporting regime are likely to be more limited than those relating to proposals 1 and 2, there may still be some ripple effects. Participants from the incident response sector emphasised that in “almost all” of their cases, the client would agree to voluntarily report the incident to law enforcement. This may include phone calls with police, site visits and so on. There is, however, a perception across government that ransomware incidents are significantly under-reported. Assuming participants spoke in good faith, it should be noted that their attendance may represent a selection bias: industry stakeholders who are willing to engage in person at an event relating to a government ransomware consultation may be more likely to encourage their clients to voluntarily report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the workshop highlighted that there is a potential risk that a mandatory reporting regime would reduce the flow of voluntary reporting, as ransomware victims may look to prioritise their mandatory reports and see this as replacing the voluntary ones. In principle, this may not be an issue; information about the incident would still be reaching central government and could filter through to the relevant regional and local law enforcement entities. However, possible consideration could be given to whether voluntary reporting brings informal benefits (either to the victim organisation, third parties or the government) that could be hindered by the introduction of mandatory reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, at present, the projected private and public familiarisation costs for the mandatory reporting regime are £970,000 and zero respectively. Depending on where the proposed reporting threshold eventually sits – and especially if smaller SMEs are included – thought should be given as to how this budget can be used most effectively and, if necessary, whether the budget should be increased to amplify reach across the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-takeaways-and-recommendations-for-the-government-2&quot;&gt;Key Takeaways and Recommendations for the Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There was a broad consensus among workshop participants that the UK’s ransomware reporting landscape is, at present, confusing, overlapping, and ineffective at developing a true national threat intelligence picture. If the views of workshop participants are a litmus test of vested stakeholders, a mandatory reporting regime may be regarded as having more support than the other proposals in the consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government should consider that increasing data on incidents will not necessarily lead to more law enforcement interventions against ransomware threat actors, unless relevant agencies have more resources. Operationalising more intelligence on ransomware incidents and criminals will probably require a significant change in how cybercrime units are funded, particularly within the NCA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Home Office should continue internal deliberation and provide clarity as soon as possible on the suggested thresholds and definitions for a prospective mandatory ransomware reporting regime. There may also be an opportunity to consider implementation of a twinned reporting mechanism for ransomware payments, where victims are mandated to inform the government if they have made payment. Basic reported information could include the original ransom demand, the ransom paid, the ransom note and the wallet details. This could be a lighter-touch way for the government to gather insights on ransomware payments – and “throw grit” into victim decision-making – without implementing a payment authorisation regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Home Office would also need to give concerted thought as to how mandatory reporting mechanisms would be harmonised with existing reporting. This includes reporting within the UK (to the ICO and other regulators) and outside the UK. It should also be noted that this deliberation about mandatory reporting takes place against the backdrop of severe criticism of the UK’s main cybercrime reporting entity, Action Fraud, which has been described by the parliamentary Justice Committee as “not fit for purpose”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Trilateral Track 2 Nuclear Dialogues, organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in partnership with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and the Fondation pour la Recherche Stratégique (FRS), have convened senior nuclear policy experts from the United Kingdom, France, and the United States (P3) since 2009 to discuss nuclear deterrence, arms control, and nonproliferation policy issues. By identifying issues of mutual concern and areas of consensus, the group seeks to improve collaboration and cooperation among the three nations across a range of challenging nuclear policy concerns. The majority of the experts are former U.S., UK, and French senior officials; the others are well-known experts and academics in the field. Since the dialogue’s inception, currently serving senior officials from all three governments have routinely participated in the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year the Track 2 members of the group issue a consensus statement reflecting their discussions. All signatories agree to this statement in their personal capacities, which may not necessarily represent the views of their respective organizations. In 2024, the group’s discussion addressed a range of emerging strategic challenges for the P3, which are reflected in this statement of their consensus after the 2024 round of meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, the United Kingdom, and France hold common values and principles directed toward a shared purpose of sustaining global peace and security, as well as an understanding of their respective roles as responsible stewards of the nuclear order. While each of the three nations has unique perspectives and policies regarding nuclear issues and the nature of today’s security environment, as the three nuclear weapons states in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance, they play a unique and enduring role in the stewardship of international alliances and partnerships, especially in matters of nuclear deterrence, nonproliferation, and arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;domestic-political-continuity-and-change&quot;&gt;Domestic Political Continuity and Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024 saw national elections in each of the P3 countries. While states may shift strategies, priorities, or resources to reflect the considerations of new national leadership, we are confident the P3 states will remain highly committed to continued cooperation with one another, their leadership roles within the wider alliance network, and maintaining the strength of NATO’s nuclear deterrent. This commitment is bolstered by a shared recognition of the increasing interconnectedness of the security environment: Each member of the P3 has overlapping and interdependent vital interests, threatened by adversaries that are collaborating at a scope and scale unprecedented in the post–Cold War world. While domestic political shifts may alter the way in which threats are addressed and managed, the appreciation of the threat posed by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea transcends political change in the P3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increasingly-collaborative-adversaries&quot;&gt;Increasingly Collaborative Adversaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea increased both the breadth and depth of their collaboration over 2024. Russia and China’s 2022 “partnership with no limits” has been supplemented by the June 2024 Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement between Russia and North Korea as well as the January 2025 Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Moscow and Tehran. Russia’s growing reliance on weaponry and personnel from North Korea to sustain its war in Ukraine, as well as its own increasing military activities in the Indo-Pacific, underlines the real strategic consequences of adversary cooperation. The rapid rise of Chinese capabilities in all domains is now a central concern for all members of the P3. The expectation that China will soon possess a stockpile of more than 1,000 nuclear warheads combined with the continued opacity of Chinese nuclear doctrine, and the Chinese military’s increasingly belligerent behavior regarding P3 military forces and Western allies in the Pacific, warrants consideration of the consequences for the United States and its P3 allies’ deterrence commitments: a problem further compounded by growing Chinese competitiveness in other domains such as sea and space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the P3 work to balance commitments in both the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, they recognize that greater security in one theater cannot be obtained by taking undue risks in the other. Adversary success in one theater would only embolden others elsewhere. Closer adversary collaboration increases the risks of enabling regional nuclear bullying, proliferation, and simultaneous conflicts, but such aggression can be deterred by credible signaling that the P3 along with other allies are prepared to confront and win conflict in two theaters simultaneously. The P3 should explore ways singly and together to make those aiding and assisting aggression and coercion suffer for such activity. Furthermore, to the degree Russian aggression in Ukraine is successful, expansionist policymakers in China, Iran, and North Korea will be emboldened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While closer adversary collaboration has rightly prompted a discussion on what new systems and activities are required for the alliance to maintain its deterrent posture, the alliance must also ensure that new initiatives do not come at the cost of existing proficiencies in the alliance. NATO’s nuclear mission is foundational to European security, and any changes to alliance behavior, capabilities, or mission set must first and foremost uphold and serve the nuclear deterrence mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modernization-and-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Modernization and Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia continues to pose a significant threat to Euro-Atlantic security through its repeated escalation of the war in Ukraine and transition to an economy fully geared toward sustaining large-scale war, and President Putin’s repeated threats of using nuclear weapons. In turn, the sustainment, support, and optimization of NATO’s nuclear deterrence posture is essential. While the modernization of nuclear forces in the alliance remains a necessity, the alliance must also carefully consider the conventional assets that support the nuclear mission and enhance deterrence. Investments in deterrence-supporting infrastructure, air and missile defense, and deep-precision strike capabilities, as well as the integration of those systems across both the nuclear and nonnuclear members of the alliance, would greatly enhance the credibility and coherence of NATO’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is great value for the P3 in investing now in supporting infrastructure, including pit production capacity, shipbuilding capacity, and other capacity-building measures. While these investments will not only aid in managing transition risk as allies modernize certain systems, they also serve to bolster NATO’s current deterrence posture and may disincentivize adversaries from attempting costly arms races if the alliance’s ability to compete is apparent. Current investments in submarine infrastructure in Barrow and in the surge capacity of U.S. pit production will have long-term deterrence payoffs justifying their costs. Similarly, NATO members should take advantage of the alliance-wide consensus regarding the renewed importance of air and missile defense and conventional precision strike to make serious investments in expanding and integrating NATO’s capabilities in both mission sets. Placing renewed emphasis on the conventional aspects of NATO’s deterrent would also encourage the non-nuclear members of the alliance to make lasting contributions to the alliance’s nuclear mission without taking it on themselves. A balanced division of labor in these domains would not only bolster NATO’s deterrence posture but also send a robust signal that the alliance remains united and clear-eyed regarding the nature of the threat it confronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States deemed the current U.S. strategic nuclear modernization program of record was necessary but not sufficient to meet the future threats faced by the United States. While the United States is the only member of the P3 to arrive at this conclusion regarding its national modernization track, the question of sufficiency is one that should be asked at the alliance level. The alliance has a strong understanding of threats to European security and strategic stability, and must now take steps to achieve a strategic posture, including a mix of conventional and nuclear capabilities, for the security environment. While arriving at the correct blend of capabilities and strategies will undoubtedly be a challenge, the successful modernization of the alliance’s strategic capabilities remains a no-fail mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nato-and-the-nuclear-order&quot;&gt;NATO and the Nuclear Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evolving threat environment, the P3 commitment to uphold the norms that shape the global nuclear order and to implement their unique nuclear responsibilities is more critical than ever. The P3 have worked to raise awareness within the alliance regarding the threat to European security posed by adversary behavior; however, of equal importance is messaging outside of the alliance regarding the threat those same actors pose to the norms and institutions that underpin global security architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a challenging moment for arms control, risk reduction, and transparency measures. While Cold War–era arms control looks to be increasingly unlikely, the P3 do not reject arms control outright, but rather are open to improving transparency with Moscow and Beijing and are taking steps to lay the groundwork for future arms control opportunities when the security environment improves. At the same time, there is much work to be done to reverse the deterioration of the norms and institutions that serve to control nuclear weapons globally. Combatting Russian and Chinese disinformation within the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), raising awareness to the ways in which adversaries cheat and conduct duplicitous diplomacy, alongside persistent positive engagement with the Global South are critical actions to preserve the global nuclear order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the P3 face a dynamic security environment with an enduring commitment to one another’s security. In managing the complexity of a changing environment, the direction of the P3 is guided by four key points. First, the alliance is clear-eyed with regards to the threats they face. Second, it is apparent that the alliance must modernize its arsenal to face the challenges of the day in both the nuclear and conventional domains. Third, the P3 are equally aware of the resourcing and coordination challenges that lie ahead and must now work to solve them. Finally, and most importantly, the P3 reiterate the value of the alliance and remain steadfastly committed to its success. In such a highly contested security environment, the value of coordination, cooperation, and commitment to one another is greater than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The P3 nuclear community lost a longstanding and dearly held member this year. The nuclear communities of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France mourn the loss of John Harvey, and express their gratitude and admiration for the generosity with which he shared his wisdom. He will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The much-beloved great-power paradigm of international relations and the era to which the United States has recently claimed it is returning is deeply flawed on many levels. One of the most basic problems is the attention placed on the supposedly “great” powers themselves—raising them above others and bestowing upon them a potency they rarely possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen consistently since the Napoleonic Wars, focusing on individual powers overlooks the fact that wars (and even peaceful disputes) are usually won by stronger alliances. It is the grouping of more powerful states that often—one might even say usually—determines international affairs, not the acts of individual states. Indeed, it is arguable that the greatest single powers have regularly been beaten by stronger alliances. The British Empire of the American Revolution was beaten by the American colonists allied to the French, Dutch, and Spanish, for instance. A few decades later, Napoleon, who controlled most of Europe, was defeated by a more powerful alliance of the Russians, British, Austrians, and Prussians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-century-of-alliances-as-determinants&quot;&gt;A Century of Alliances as Determinants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the twentieth century, this pattern repeated itself. Germany was arguably the greatest power in Europe in both World Wars, but was defeated twice by superior alliances. At the same time, Germany was held back by poor allies, such as Austria-Hungary in World War I and Fascist Italy in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War likewise saw two very different alliances in competition. The United States was allied with the major states of Western Europe, helping to maintain the economic dominance of the West. The USSR was allied with the states of Eastern Europe, whose loyalty it could only maintain through brute force, greatly diminishing their contribution to Soviet strength. In the end, the more powerful NATO alliance emerged to dominate Europe, while the Warsaw Pact was confined to history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alliances matter because they affect power relationships in a number of ways. In peacetime, alliances are some of the best deterrents to adversary action—if they are assumed strongly united. Before 1914, wars were often prevented because alliance structures deterred individual powers from initiating major hostilities. In 1907, ironically, it was the assumed strength of the German-Austrian alliance (which, along with Italy, was often called the Central Powers) that deterred Russia from risking an outright war over the control of Bosnia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When states no longer believe that alliances can deter effectively, however, war can result. In both 1914 and 1939, for instance, different German leaderships—Kaiser Wilhelm II’s in the first instance and Adolf Hitler’s in the second—calculated that the alliances arrayed against Germany were not sufficiently united to prevent a German victory. In 1914, the view was that Britain, in many ways the key member of the Triple alliance (which also included France and Russia) arrayed against Germany, would either not join in any European war or, if it did, would not be able to influence the war before German military power had decided its outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something similar happened in 1939. At that time, Hitler, worried that an alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union might go to war against him if he invaded Poland, broke up the potential grouping through the Nazi-Soviet Pact with Joseph Stalin. By making Stalin an ally and splintering the prior alliance, Hitler believed he had made his attack on Poland strategically viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If strong alliances can deter wars while weak or fractured ones encourage them, then once wars start, the stronger alliance almost always ends up in the superior position. The World Wars are the obvious example: In both World War I and World War II, the Allies—anchored by Britain and the United States in both, and including other significant powers such as France and Russia (and later the Soviet Union)—presented the opponents with such overwhelming combined production capacity and technological advancements that victory was all but inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the importance of alliances in determining the outcome of international rivalries in both peace and war, it is surprising how often they are overlooked when discussing the Indo-Pacific. Though it is common to discuss any war in the region as revolving around the United States and China and their individual intentions and capabilities, such a conflict would be heavily influenced by the two acting as part of larger alliances or through the support offered by friendly states such as in the case of China. Indeed, just as alliances have played a major role in shaping the course of the Russia-Ukrainian War, it would be safe to say that alliances could very well determine the future of the Indo-Pacific. The war in Ukraine has also revealed that possessing the most advanced military equipment is not enough—the willingness to use it matters even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the Russia-Ukrainian War has shown that neither Russia nor Ukraine can be seen as powers fighting on their own—and how mistaken early analyses of the war were because they approached the conflict in that light. Before February 24, 2022, it was widely assumed that Russia, as a great power, would overwhelm Ukraine in a “shock and awe” campaign in a matter of days or weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the war assumed to be so short in duration, the role of allies or supporters was downgraded. Indeed, it was widely assumed that the war would be so short that Ukraine should not be supported by those inclined to do so. It was a view which, sadly, seemed to be widely shared within the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this outlook, Ukraine’s group of possible allies—which were far more economically powerful than Russia’s, with the United States in the lead but also including most of Europe—provided Ukraine with only limited weapons before Russia’s full-scale invasion. Even once the invasion started Ukrainian resistance proved to be far more effective, indicating the war could last much longer, aid to Ukraine was strictly limited in terms of range and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s experience with its allies was in some ways a mirror image. Two of its allies, North Korea and Iran, showed that economic power alone is not enough. Both states provided extremely important military support in mass quantities—and gave it with no strings attached. Iran first provided Russia with Iranian-produced Shahed drones (unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs), which proved so effective that Iran later agreed to let Russia produce them domestically. This meant that by the second half of 2024, Shaheds were the most common system used by Russia to attack Ukrainian cities practically every night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea might even have surpassed such aid. The North Koreans not only provided Russia with more artillery shells than all of Europe and the United States combined had provided to Ukraine, they even ended up sending their own troops to fight (and die) on Russia’s behalf. While Ukraine’s allies seemed to panic at the thought of sending their own troops—even for support work like training Ukrainian soldiers—North Koreans entered the front lines of combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the innate strength of allies alone matters only so much. The willingness of allies to do what is needed to win can trump statistical power. The result of the war in Ukraine, for instance, is being decided in real-time by the behavior of allies and partners—or those thought to be allies and partners. Russia has received consistent support throughout the war from allies such as Iran and North Korea—and, to a lesser degree, China. They have provided Russia with the weapons they could, and put little or no restrictions on their use. Ukraine has not been so lucky. Though its allies are economically and technologically much stronger than Russia, these allies have been restrictive and unwilling to commit to Ukrainian victory. Indeed, at the time of writing, the United States seems to be in the process of switching from being a supporter of Ukraine to be, at best, a tacit enabler of Russian power. President Trump seems set on acting not as an ally of Ukraine, but as a mediator between the two countries, and appears to be intent on forcing Ukraine to cede some of its territory to Russia without any strong security guarantees. This shift by the United States will almost certainly play a major role in how the war progresses in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alliances-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Alliances in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the overall balance of forces in the Indo-Pacific were presented in chart form, there would be one clearly dominant force and one secondary force. The dominant force would be the U.S.-led alliance. The United States itself remains arguably the most powerful state in the world. It still possesses the strongest and most technologically advanced economy, dominating the high-tech landscape, and is able to build the most advanced weapons in the world. It is home to the world’s most efficient and powerful financial markets and can raise money in vast quantities from across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is not without its flaws. Its ability to manufacture in mass has withered over the previous decades, as it has outsourced much of its finished production processes to Asia, particularly China. However, the United States also has powerful Indo-Pacific Allies who have developed the capacity to manufacture what the United States cannot, and those allies must step up to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipbuilding is a powerful example of these dynamics. Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. shipbuilding industry has collapsed. The United States now hardly produces any non-warships (and produces relatively few warships, as well), while China has become the world’s largest ship producer by far. Indeed, when compared to the world’s major shipbuilding powers, the United States does not even appear as an independent producer—it is relegated to “other” (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6yokdbF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

Funaiole, Brian Hart, and Aidan Powers-Riggs, Ship Wars: Confronting China’s Dual-Use Shipbuilding Empire (Washington, DC: CSIS, March 2025)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What stands out, however, is not just the Chinese position, but also how U.S. allies Japan and South Korea occupy second and third place—with a combined shipbuilding capacity that at least matches that of China. And this is just one example of the economic and technological capabilities of U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific. In fact, if the economies of Japan (fourth-largest in the world) Australia (thirteenth), South Korea (fourteenth), and Taiwan (approximately twentieth) were combined, you would have an economy that would easily be the third-most powerful in the world. Such a power would also have world-leading capabilities, such as Taiwan’s semiconductor production capacity, and a highly developed ability to make arms, such as South Korea’s ammunition manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this does not include other U.S. allies in the area such as the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. What is more, both Vietnam and India currently have or have had border wars with China—and neither is particularly well-disposed toward the Beijing government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All together, the possible pool of U.S. allies or U.S.-inclined powers in the Indo-Pacific is a powerful and diverse coalition—with economic strength and a combined military power of some heft. Of course, just adding them together in theory is meaningless. They would need an alliance structure under which to coordinate their actions and take advantage of all that potential power. Only the United States could provide that—but if it does not, all that is really left is a list of wealthy nations who have no ability to act as an alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of possible Chinese partners (China does not have any formal allies) is far less impressive in material terms. Indeed, China has so antagonized many of the countries on its borders that its two closest allies are as much dependencies as anything else—Russia and North Korea. The Russian economy is about tenth in the world, though reliant on resource extraction as much as anything else, and with limited technological capacity for manufacturing advanced equipment (the war in Ukraine has once again exposed how much less effective Russian weapons are than U.S. weapons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, compared to North Korea, Russia is an economic titan. North Korea is one of the most economically backward places in the world, with a population that regularly experiences government-caused famine and deprivation. Calculating the accurate size of the North Korean economy is not easy as it is such a closed society. However, the CIA recently estimated that North Korea had the 138th-largest economy in the world—and was only the 201st-fastest-growing economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s two most dependent partners are economically backward compared to U.S. allies, they have certain advantages for China that U.S. allies lack in terms of willingness to commit. North Korea has already revealed in the war in Ukrainian that they will do almost anything to win a war and will provide aid to their allies without much hesitation and fundamentally without limits. Both Russia and North Korea are heavily militarized powers with large, if not terribly efficient, militaries. North Korea has a mass force of over a million armed soldiers (though those who have fought in Russia have shown very limited tactical sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military is considerably more powerful than the North Korean military, though it was also revealed to be seriously overrated and has suffered major losses in the war against Ukraine. It has certain high-quality ranged weapons and has learned some lessons about modern warfare (in particular, how to fight in a UAV-rich environment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What these allies could do in case of war would be to offer useful support in a few areas. Both, but particularly Russia, could provide large amounts of raw materials to keep the Chinese economy producing at maximum output and to keep the Chinese population fed. They could also tie down the forces of the United States and its allies through demonstrations and actions from the demilitarized zone on the Korean Peninsula all the way to the Arctic, Europe, and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such military demonstrations could be very useful. If the North Koreans could distract both South Korean and Japanese forces, it would lessen the kinds of forces that U.S. allies (if they were so inclined) could send to help Taiwan. North Korea could do that even without a direct ground attack, by launching or even threatening to launch a large missile and ranged weapons campaign. It should be noted that the North Koreans are, after a rocky start, gaining important experience in UAV warfare through their deployments in Russia. Russia, on the other hand, could lessen the chance of any wide-scale European support for Taiwan or other democratic Asian allies. As it is, European states have precious few resources that they could deploy to the Pacific, and they would hardly want to spare them if the Russians were threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, China’s allies could help force the United States to fight with more limited aid from its allies, even without resorting to full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s allies are both economically and technologically much weaker than the United States’, but at the same time, they seem more politically willing to support Chinese interests. This difference is of considerable importance. Though the United States may have allies in the Indo-Pacific, it is not acting as the leader of a powerful alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because not all of the United States’ allies are pledged, or even inclined, to fight for each other—and as such, can play only a limited role in deterring China from action, if the Chinese government was so inclined. That basic problem can be seen by looking at the two most likely flashpoints that could, at any time, go into crisis mode for the United States and China—the South China Sea or the fate of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are two of the most well-known and contested areas of the globe. The South China Sea is a constant flashpoint between the United States, China, and a number of U.S. allies or close friends (see Figure 2). China’s government claims control over the waters of the area through what is referred to as its “nine-dash line” claim. Though the claim has been ruled to be without merit by an international court of arbitration, this has not stopped Beijing from building up and fortifying a chain of island bases, many of them artificial constructions, in the area. The country is now regularly deploying powerful naval assets to assert their claim to the waters, in particular assaulting, often with water cannons, Philippine civilian and military vessels. It should also be mentioned that Taiwan sits within the nine-dash line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GnylZtj.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Map of South China Sea Claims.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:South_China_Sea_claims_map.svg&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a long-standing defense treaty with the Philippines, one which was updated in 2023 to reflect Philippine concerns over the South China Sea. The United States has also used firm rhetoric to say that it will defend the Philippines if the moment comes, in an attempt to deter China. However, the reality is that this deterrence seems only sporadically successful at best. For the past two years, the two states have seen a series of clashes as they each seek to stake their claims to access and control the eastern parts of the South China Sea. In August 2024, for instance, Chinese and Philippine warships clashed near the Sabina Shoal, which saw vessels from both sides crashing into each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese assertiveness in the region and willingness to risk military clashes seems at least partly motivated by the fact that, outside of the United States, it is not clear that any other state is committed to the defense of the Philippines’ rights. While Japan sells military equipment to the Philippines, for instance, it is not committed to its defense. And if Japan is not committed, the idea of other U.S. allies, such as South Korea or Australia, committing themselves is decidedly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are not much better when it comes to the unity of U.S. allies when it comes to their ability to deter China over Taiwan. The air and waters around Taiwan are some of the most heavily militarized in the world. Over the last few years, the Chinese have run a continual series of exercises and patrols, at least 10 major ones since 2018, to say nothing of the practically continuous Chinese naval and air activity around Taiwan. This looks to be a clear attempt to intimidate the Taiwan people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the vital strategic importance of Taiwan—geographically, economically, and arguably militarily—one might think that U.S. allies in the region would be willing to commit to its defense. However, once again showing the unstable nature of the U.S. alliance grouping, few, if any, actually are. Once again, Japan would be a vital strategic power in the defense of Taiwan, and a clear Japanese commitment to stand side-by-side with the United States could be a powerful deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Japan has been reluctant to make such a move. Though Japan is increasing defense spending considerably (from an admittedly low base) and claiming that it will play a more assertive role in the world, Japanese leadership, in a position it has maintained for decades, has also been careful not to say it will fight for Taiwan—even if the United States eventually decides that it will. In the 2022 National Security Strategy of Japan, the Japanese government speaks warmly of relations with Taiwan and acknowledges the island’s strategic importance but remains entirely ambiguous on whether Japan would fight for Taiwanese independence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Japan’s relationship with Taiwan has been maintained as a non-governmental working relationship based on the Japan-China Joint Communique in 1972. Japan’s basic position regarding Taiwan remains unchanged. Taiwan is an extremely important partner and a precious friend of Japan, with whom Japan shares fundamental values, including democracy, and has close economic and personal ties. Peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is an indispensable element for the security and prosperity of the international community, and Japan will continue to make various efforts based on its position that the cross-strait issues are expected to be resolved peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Japan is hedging on this issue, other U.S. allies are more active in saying that they will not fight for Taiwan. Australia might be the best example. Much has been made of Australia’s role as a U.S. ally—to such a degree that, in 2021, Australia reneged on a deal to build submarines with France in favor of a similar agreement with the United States and Britain under what is known as the AUKUS agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia are allies through the ANZUS Treaty (which originally included New Zealand), signed in 1951. The treaty has led to long-term integration between the U.S. and Australian militaries, and Australians have fought alongside the United States in conflicts around the world, from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the Australian government has also gone out of its way to say that it is not committed to fighting for Taiwan—even if the United States eventually does. In 2023, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles stated categorically that Australia had “absolutely not” pledged itself to the defense of Taiwan under AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the basic problem and contrast between U.S. allies and China’s alliances. U.S. allies are held together by individual ties with the United States. If they could act together, they could be an extremely powerful deterrent. However, as of now, they are really a series of unconnected bilateral security relationships—far from being mutually supportive. Indeed, this fragmented structure adds a layer of confusion to U.S. planning, as the United States cannot be sure who would fight for what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of possible Chinese partners, on the other hand, is intrinsically not nearly as powerful. However, its allies have shown a willingness to go to war for each other and provide as much weaponry as possible without limitations. It is, therefore, more a question of the size of the dog in the fight versus the size of the fight in the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-allies-and-an-indo-pacific-war&quot;&gt;U.S. Allies and an Indo-Pacific War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of commitment from U.S. and Chinese allies (or lack thereof) could go a long way to deciding the outcome of a U.S.-China war in the Indo-Pacific. There are many different scenarios that one could devise for the region, and listing them makes little sense. What is practical is to think in terms of a short war versus a long war—with a greater emphasis on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, analysts and others are drawn in by what is best called the “short-war myth”—the idea that a war will resemble the conflict drawn up by prewar planners and be decided by engagements in its opening phases. This idea, that a war “will be over by Christmas” appears regularly from World War I, where Germany hoped to win in a short opening campaign, to the present Russia-Ukrainian War, which many confidently predicted would see Russia conquer most of Ukraine in weeks or even days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the only benefits of the terrible war in Ukraine is that it seems to have injected discussions of a U.S.-China war in the Indo-Pacific with a greater awareness that the opening stages might not be decisive. Before February 24, 2022, there was discussion of a war between the United States and China over Taiwan being over relatively quickly—often with a quick Chinese victory. In October 2020, the Pentagon ran a series of war games simulating a U.S. attempt to defend Taiwan, and reportedly, the United States “failed miserably” in its goal, the island often falling quickly to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that since then, the idea of a quick and decisive war has been more regularly questioned. The difficulties of any Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan, for instance, have been seen in a set of war games run by CSIS. In a majority of the 24 run-throughs of the game, the Chinese amphibious assault failed—though it extracted heavy losses on U.S. and Taiwan forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is right—and history and technology points very much in the direction of this being right—then the failure of a Chinese amphibious invasion will almost certainly not end any war, but likely extend it to many months or even years. Moreover, Chinese military maneuvers staged around Taiwan in the last two years indicate that China may favor an interdiction strategy over an invasion. Instead of undertaking a very risky and uncertain invasion of Taiwan, China might instead use their geographic location to cut the island off from the outside world, forcing the United States to expose its valuable military assets to reestablish connections. Once again, that is a recipe for a longer war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where allies can make all the difference. Wars are rarely won by the military equipment on hand when it starts; more often they are won by equipment built during its course. For the United States, this poses a real alliance question. Though we cannot be certain, odds are that the United States would enter any war with China with a significant technological advantage. This could lead the United States to inflict considerably more damage to the Chinese military than vice versa in the opening stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, once the war lengthens out of its opening the fighting will be determined by equipment built after its commencement. This would see the pendulum swing toward China. Chinese manufacturing capacity is considerably larger than the United States, and with a large amount of productive facilities at its beck and call, the Chinese military will start gaining a significant numerical—if not qualitative—advantage over its U.S. rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of this advantage would be UAVs/drones, which are dominating much of the battlespace in Ukraine and Russia. China has the existing capacity to produce many times more UAVs than the United States. Indeed, it has recently been estimated that one Chinese company, DJI Technology Company, controls 90 percent of the US commercial drone market share and 80 percent of the global market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compete with such manufacturing capabilities, the United States would be desperate to tap the manufacturing prowess of Japan and South Korea, both of which have superior capabilities to the U.S. in some areas such as shipbuilding (as mentioned earlier). The question the United States would face is whether its allies would willingly turn themselves into a U.S. production asset—with China only hundreds of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What holds sway in production would be equally true for logistics. To fight a long war over Taiwan, the United States would be strengthened considerably by access to the bases, supplies, and repair facilities of allies such as Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore. Overall, these allies would provide wonderful facilities to bottle up Chinese shipping in waters close to the Chinese shore while allowing the United States real flexibility in deciding where and how to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, a significant amount of study supports the idea that without South Korea and Japan by its side, the United States’ ability to fight for Taiwan might be severely—perhaps even fatally—compromised. South Korea could undertake a range of different operations, from threatening North Korea (potentially diverting Chinese forces) to intelligence gathering and even directly threatening Chinese naval and air forces in the Yellow Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan might be even more important to the determination of any war over Taiwan, for reasons of both capabilities and logistics. The country, with its growing air-sea denial forces, could play a key role in limiting the range of China’s operations—helping to hem in Chinese naval forces, for instance, to waters to the west of Japan (including the Ryukyu Islands).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistically, Japan provides a depth and range of facilities for the United States, the denial of which would be very difficult to compensate for. Without Japanese bases, the United States would have to rely more and more on its Marianas bases (Guam), which are more than a thousand miles farther from the Chinese coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, for well-known political reasons, the United States at present cannot count on South Korea or Japan providing even logistical aid—let alone militarily confronting China. If, in the end, the South Koreans and Japanese stand fully aside, the United States will struggle to support Taiwan to such a degree that it might not even be worth attempting to defend the island. In this way, U.S. allies could very well determine not only the outcome of any war with China, long or short, but if such a war can even be fought effectively in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-understanding-the-value-of-allies&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Understanding the Value of Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the strangest developments of the last years is that both China and the United States (at least under the Trump administration) seem to be going out of their way to antagonize countries that would like to be their friends, or at least more friendly toward them. China’s aggressiveness has angered almost every country off its coast, from Japan (where the Chinese claim the Senkaku Islands) to Taiwan (which the Chinese claim) to the aforementioned South China Sea, which has brought into the conflict the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Beijing has also seen greater tensions in their relations with Seoul, as they seem increasingly angry at the defense relationship between South Korea and the United States. Instead of picking and choosing to try and break apart a possible U.S.-led alliance, China seem to be going out of its way to scare possible U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only the United States could take advantage of this dynamic—but so far, it has failed, and it looks like things will get worse. The rise of political populism in the United States, exemplified by the second election of Trump, has seen much of U.S. foreign policy recast as a zero-sum, often directly bilateral game. In this era, U.S. allies are seen as perfidious scroungers, trying to make the United States defend them while stealing U.S. jobs to boot. Trump himself made this very clear in an interview in July 2024. He claimed that Taiwan should be paying the United States for its defense, saying that the United States was “no different than an insurance company,” while Taiwan “doesn’t give us anything.” He went on to say that Taiwan was stealing the U.S. semiconductor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of language is no different than that used about U.S. allies in Europe—and does seem to herald a growth of isolationism and detachment within a significant part of the U.S. electorate. If this happens, the idea that the United States would actually be able to knit together a stronger alliance—which it very much needs—is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hardly comforting to realize that neither China nor the United States understand the value of allies. Instead of being drags, allies are almost always vital to winning wars and establishing predominance in times of peace. Those who try to frame the Indo-Pacific as a U.S.-China area of confrontation would do well to remember this. It could very well be that the power that does understand this is the power that prevails in the struggle for control of the Indo-Pacifc—the most vital area of the world, economically and strategically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Grey zone” as a qualifier for challenges, threats and even warfare describes an approach that seeks results from action below the threshold of war or armed conflict. Attempts to frame a precise definition raise theoretical and practical questions. Can action “below the threshold” of war be a form of “warfare”, or is the threshold subjective and open to manipulation? Can grey zone action be deterred without threatening to cross the line into a state of war? How can the victim of aggression escape a trap where moves to deter grey zone challenges attract condemnation for “provocation” or “escalation” that might be more damaging than the original attack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s “campaign against Taiwan”, which Sir Alex Younger, former Chief of the UK Secret Intelligence Service, described as “a textbook on subversion, cyber and political harassment”, presents a compelling case study for understanding the grey zone phenomenon. While Taiwan’s situation is distinctive in some ways, the grey zone pressures it faces – including incidents such as sabotage of undersea infrastructure, election interference and digitalised disinformation – closely parallel those faced by other countries in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An understanding of Taiwan’s evolving response to the grey zone is instructive for policymakers experiencing similar challenges. The purpose of this policy brief is to draw insights from Taiwan’s experience, leading to policy recommendations that could have wider application. The brief traces the emergence and defining features of the “grey zone” concept, then looks at China’s actions and Taiwan’s responses, and concludes with recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief is based on desk research and interviews in Taiwan between November 2024 and February 2025, including a two-day workshop involving experts and officials from Taiwan and other countries facing similar challenges (Australia, Canada, Finland, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Sweden, the UK and Vietnam).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-the-grey-zone&quot;&gt;What is the Grey Zone?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Quadrennial Defense Review of 2010 noted “The future strategic landscape will increasingly feature challenges in the ambiguous grey area that is neither fully war nor fully peace”. The actual term “grey zone challenges” appeared in a paper by Philip Kapusta published in 2015, which described “competitive interactions among and within state and non-state actors that fall between the traditional war and peace duality … characterized by ambiguity about the nature of the conflict, opacity of the parties involved, or uncertainty about the relevant policy and legal frameworks” (author’s emphasis). Kapusta adds that participants can “interpret the conflict differently”, and parties can use the resulting ambiguity about the nature of the conflict “to avoid accountability for their actions”. Alongside ambiguity, a more recent RAND study identified the following characteristics of grey zone activity: “unfolds gradually, is not attributable, uses legal and political justifications, threatens only secondary national interests, has state sponsorship, uses mostly nonmilitary tools, and exploits weaknesses and vulnerabilities in targeted countries and societies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “grey zone” has become part of Western policy vocabulary, yet the critical issue of the “threshold” remains contentious. Contrary to NATO doctrine that suggests there is “no defined threshold that separates confrontation from armed conflict because many actors intentionally try to obscure or confuse exactly where this threshold lies”, the International Committee of the Red Cross warns that “political narratives surrounding ‘competition’, ‘hybrid warfare’, ‘proxy warfare’ or other ‘grey zone’ terminology must not obfuscate the legal classification of armed conflicts and the application of IHL [international humanitarian law]”. The ICRC goes on to say that even when it is difficult to obtain clear information about the situation this should not be an “excuse for – or be confused with – failure to apply the law to these facts … activities such as imposition of economic measures, information operations, and espionage, by themselves, do not trigger the application of IHL”. As John Raine has argued, “much, but not all, of what we see being conducted in this space could be characterised as features of the difficult, new peace as much as the new warfare”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Intelligence Council assesses that “grey zone activities and campaigns are likely to increase in the coming years and become a dominant feature of great power competition and international relations more broadly because of eroding or nonexistent norms; emerging, evolving, and expanding domains; and perceptions of their comparative advantages”. Technological developments also expand the scope for grey zone action. The internet and social media function as vectors for attack and subversion not imagined in the era when the law on armed conflict and the UN charter were written. Globalisation has also intensified the range and value of international connections, expanding dependencies that can be held hostage. As Sir Alex Younger put it, “propaganda, subversion and sabotage have been a feature of inter-state conflict for ever. But I think it is also fair to say that our attack surface has increased”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of the grey zone to avoid accountability or attribution provides leverage in the cognitive and informational (for example, narrative) dimensions of conflict. The first battle for legitimacy is won by shifting the charge of “aggressor” onto the victim, who – reluctant to be accused of “escalation” – will be tempted to do nothing, even at the risk of appearing incompetent. Democracies dependent on alliances are especially vulnerable to this trap. Citizens demand accountability, and an elected leader who takes firm measures can face opposition charges of recklessness. Appear too willing to “escalate” and you may trigger in your allies the fear of entrapment and end up abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-grey-zone-experience-and-response&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Grey Zone Experience and Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-approach&quot;&gt;China’s Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views bringing Taiwan under its control as a “historic mission and an unshakable commitment”. The fact that Beijing has not given any deadlines or outlined any proscribed methods suggests it is planning to choose a moment and a set of circumstances where “reunification” can be achieved at a cost that does not jeopardise its main policy objectives: building China into a “great modern socialist country” and returning it to “centre stage” in the world. Put another way, the CCP prefers to win Taiwan without fighting. Its exploitation of grey zone approaches is shaped by the possibility that the US position “against any forced, compelled, coercive change in the status of Taiwan” could escalate into a military intervention with catastrophic costs (similar language was adopted in a joint US–Japan statement in February 2025).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming China seeks to avoid a direct clash with the US, the main obstacle to its aim of extending control is the people of Taiwan’s choice to elect governments that refuse to accept what it claims as a “consensus” that both sides of the Taiwan Strait “work together to advance national unification”. If Taiwan were to freely choose unity, the US military would no longer be a factor. If, however, the government in Taipei changed to one that accepted Beijing’s conditions, allowing resumption of “normal” cross-strait relations, China could bring the full power of its diplomatic and economic instruments to bear, marginalise the “separatist” tendency in Taiwanese society, fully detach Taiwan from external support, and be reassured that Taiwan was on track to unification some time down the road. Rather than thinking of the target as the island of Taiwan, and military invasion as the method, it is more apt to see the target of Beijing’s actions as a preferred political status, and Taiwanese popular opinion as the strategic “centre of gravity” (Carl von Clausewitz’s metaphor for “the hub of all power and movement, on which everything depends”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has not formally adopted the grey zone concept in its own doctrine, a related set of concepts termed the “Three Warfares” (public opinion, psychological and legal warfare) was introduced by the Central Military Commission into the Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) Political Work Regulations in 2003. The International Institute for Strategic Studies identifies China’s legal warfare objectives with regard to Taiwan as to: “intimidate and coerce Taiwanese society”; “erode Taiwan’s territorial claims and sovereignty”; “isolate Taiwan diplomatically”; “build legal justifications to legitimate future action against Taiwan”; and “promote further cross-Strait integration to keep open the option for reunification without military action”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is quite open about its intention to bypass the government in Taipei and “conduct extensive and in-depth consultations on cross-Strait relations and national reunification with people from all political parties, sectors, and social strata in Taiwan, and [to] work with them to … advance the process of China’s peaceful reunification”. The PLA is also an instrument of this grey zone pressure, including through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Air and maritime incursions across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and adjacent to 24 nautical miles off Taiwan, and over Taiwan’s air defence identification zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military exercises in the waters off Taiwan, including assigning maritime paramilitary forces in joint training with the People’s Liberation Army Navy and the China Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Flying UAVs over offshore islands and weather balloons over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Broadcasting “news” to Taiwanese audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Using marine survey vessels and hydrographic survey ships as a “cover” for the military to improve its battle management around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber attacks on governmental agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Targeting critical infrastructure, including allegedly severing underwater cables.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s ROC National Defense Report 2023, similar to a defence white paper, recognises the risk of subversion, noting that China “has never let up its infiltration and wedge-driving moves in the media and on the internet. Behind its military threat, [it] is exhausting every means to incite discrepancies within Taiwan and create people’s distrust against the government”. The report highlights China’s use of the following modalities “aim[ed] at creating a division among our society and driving wedges among our people”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Disseminating controversial messages, propaganda and deliberate distortion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wedge-driving and provocation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threats and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To return to the threat of military invasion, intensified PLA activity, such as large-scale military exercises, erodes warning times for potential operations. Taiwan’s defence officials emphasised to the author that grey zone actions need to be viewed as part of an escalation ladder that could go to full military action but could also pivot into higher-order grey zone actions such as a “quarantine” or full blockade. While the US Defense Department estimates there would probably be “unambiguous indicators of larger hostile actions against Taiwan”, the Commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command , Admiral Samuel Paparo, said recently that Chinese “aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan right now are not exercises, as they call them. They are rehearsals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwans-predicament&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Predicament&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the vulnerability to grey zone attack common to all democratic systems, Taiwan’s status creates additional disadvantages by obstructing collective action. A growing number of states maintain a policy aligned with Beijing’s “One China” principle, that Taiwan is an “inalienable part” of the People’s Republic of China. Even states such as the US and the UK, which Taiwan considers like-minded, have some form of China policy restricting diplomatic relations and defence cooperation. UN member states that are induced to sign off on the One China principle are more likely to consider Beijing’s action towards Taiwan as an internal matter, ignoring Taiwan’s invocation of the right of individual or collective self-defence. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that when Taiwanese interviewees as part of this research identified two reasons for reluctance to “escalate”, the first is concern that the international community (even countries friendly to Taiwan, especially the US) would not welcome an escalation and might not back Taiwan up (an assumption somewhat borne out in wargaming).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason given for reluctance to “escalate” was fear of domestic turmoil within a society split by divisions on cross-Strait relations. Scholars describe how Beijing’s colonisation of Taiwan’s “media ecology” going back to the period of Ma Ying-jeou’s presidency from 2008 to 2016 has created an information infrastructure favourable to advancing its strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, Taiwan’s response breaks down into three areas: appeals for external support; interceptions of PLA ships and aircraft; and work to develop resilience. President Lai Ching-te launched the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee in June 2024 to work on: civilian force training and utilisation; strategic material supply; energy and critical infrastructure; social welfare, medical care evacuation readiness; and information, transportation and financial network protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-counter-grey-zone-playbook&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Counter-Grey Zone Playbook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of grey zone approaches indicates that the recipient finding the effects of such actions intolerable can react in two ways. One is to neutralise effects through measures likely to be viewed as defensive, such as enhancing resilience. The other is to counter the aggressor’s intent, through dissuasion or deterrence responses designed to stop the action either by disabling the means to carry it out (denial), or by imposing costs to a point where the aggressor concludes that it is against their interest to continue (punishment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeting intent by cost imposition entails a risk of escalation. Even where risk of escalation is deemed an acceptable price for putting a stop to the harm caused by grey zone activity, it may be rejected as a course of action because of the costs that come with being identified as responsible for escalating. For reasons connected to the “blame shifting” aspect of grey zone action noted above (such as uncommitted allies and divided domestic opinion), this is especially the case for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s predicament calls for a counter-grey zone playbook with response options that bring advantage to the victim. At the difficult end of the spectrum is a set of actions where the risk/return calculus results in favour of cost imposition, even at the risk of escalation. For example, make a public warning that a drone flying into territorial airspace will be shot down – if that happens, the other side will find it harder to make a charge of “aggression” stick. Or procure non-lethal weapons and draw up rules of engagement to guide a more robust response. It is likely that this category of response options, which could be termed “dark grey”, will grow from the adoption of uncrewed systems that can engage in the contest without loss of life, thus limiting escalation to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dark-grey&quot;&gt;Dark Grey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be effective, dark grey responses require government institutions that can promptly calculate appropriate consequences and carry them out without delay, ensuring the perpetrator as well as domestic and international audiences understand the cost imposition consequent to that grey zone action. Responses should maintain the distinction between perpetrator and victim by calling out grey zone moves in public and diplomatic arenas (where possible in advance) and explain why they are unacceptable and why consequences must follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done. Difficulties arise where grey zone actions are not immediately obvious, and their effects are sometimes not detected until it is too late. A RAND analysis concluded that many low-end grey zone activities “cannot be deterred”, and identified eight criteria required for deterrence to work on the “high end” of the zone. These are outlined below, with an assessment of each of the criteria in relation to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Intensity of the aggressor’s motivations” (high – the CCP identifies the Taiwan issue as “the core of China’s core interests”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Attribution of the aggressor’s role” (rising).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Level of aggression” (rising).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“U.S. and partner alignment on unacceptable outcomes” (uncertain).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“U.S. and partner alignment on deterrent responses” (low).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“U.S. and partner proportionate response capabilities” (weakening).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Regional and global support for deterrence” (high in principle, lower in practice).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“The aggressor’s expectation of meaningful responses” (trending up).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s status in the international community and the uncertainty of the US security guarantee narrows its options in all eight criteria, except perhaps attribution of the aggressor’s role, where Taiwan has most agency to improve deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s detention in February 2025 of a Chinese captain and crew of a vessel suspected of involvement in severing underwater cables is a good example of dark grey action. Denial of the capability (even at the risk of escalation in the form of tit-for-tat detentions) is justifiable on the basis of the strategic importance of the infrastructure in peacetime. Investor confidence in Taiwan as a global IT hub could be dampened if the cable-cutting incidents become more frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;light-grey&quot;&gt;Light Grey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Light grey” responses are often more appropriate to Taiwan’s predicament. These include making pressure tolerable through measures that neutralise the effects (through resilience), or by turning the aggressor/victim narrative to Taipei’s advantage. The Philippines’ “assertive transparency” approach – broadcasting video of violent attacks from the Chinese Coast Guard – was found to consolidate domestic legitimacy and attract support from international partners, even if it has less success in changing Chinese policy. Where China’s grey zone actions resemble war rehearsals, the light grey response would frame them as indicative of Beijing’s aggression and its intent to escalate and thereby risk triggering a broader threat to international peace and security. The object should be to flip the narrative from being about Taiwan’s isolation to about the imperative for collective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light/dark grey distinction is not absolute, but the essential difference is that dark grey actions are more symmetrical and light grey actions less so. Dark grey actions confront the problem head-on, imposing direct costs and effecting denial while accepting a calculated risk of escalation. Light grey options instead aim to flip the narrative: exhibiting resilience as proof of government competence (shoring up domestic cohesion) and shining light on events from an angle that casts the shadow of blame on the aggressor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging that Taiwan is already going some way to enact the approaches described above, the following recommendations are highlighted for emphasis, and for their potential for application in other cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-get-ahead-of-the-curve&quot;&gt;1. Get ahead of the curve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in analysis of grey zone action can not only identify patterns of actions and effects, but also foresee the opportunities for light grey exploitation before the adversary, staying one step ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-leverage-information-exchange-for-insight-and-regional-coalition-building&quot;&gt;2. Leverage information exchange for insight and regional coalition building&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing experience with other victims will improve analytical capability and support an international collective action message. Networks of expertise open the door to operational or diplomatic partnerships, overcoming some of the isolation effect Taiwan is experiencing, and illuminating opportunities for horizontal escalation across the wider area of China’s grey zone activities. Attendance at the workshop held for the research for this brief indicates the strong appetite among Taiwan’s neighbours for exchanging lessons on maritime grey zone issues, which can help Taiwan overcome attempts to isolate its policy community. Taiwan could host a regional Network of Excellence, bringing together expertise from both countries around Taiwan and those elsewhere which face grey zone or lawfare challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-access-a-broader-knowledge-base-and-a-wider-diplomatic-network&quot;&gt;3. Access a broader knowledge base and a wider diplomatic network&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan can benefit from expanded links with European governments and institutions where the challenge of grey zone activity is fast rising, leading to new thinking about how best to respond. A RUSI commentary on Russian cable cutting is one example of common operational interests. Elizabeth Braw’s work on Finland’s response to Russian’s grey zone activities indicates that education is an area where resilience can produce deterrence by denial. NATO’s UK-based Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure can share insights on this set of problems. Broader appreciation for Taiwan’s predicament and the insights it has to offer partners facing similar challenges can encourage the international community to support a collective action approach countering efforts to isolate Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-exploit-technology-for-attribution-and-cost-imposition&quot;&gt;4. Exploit technology for attribution and cost imposition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital connectivity forms a bridge to multilateral cooperation, with opportunities to pool data and apply machine learning (although the question remains as to what happens when ships turn off their Automatic Identification System to evade detection) and algorithmic tools to identify irregular patterns of activity, and produce predictive analysis. Especially in areas of real-time awareness, such a common operation picture can restrict the scope of ambiguity, aid attribution and have a cost imposition effect by increasing international support in proportion to some kinds of grey zone pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-flip-grey-zone-pressure-to-harden-resilience&quot;&gt;5. Flip grey zone pressure to harden resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to China, its grey zone pressure is directed not at the “compatriots” on Taiwan, but at “separatists”. The more China’s grey zone action can be shown to harm the interests of ordinary people (such as by depressing foreign economic investment), the harder this narrative becomes to sustain. The more Taipei bases the legitimacy of its response on economic and social resilience, the harder it makes it for Beijing to attribute Taiwan’s responses to a “separatist” minority. Taipei’s message should expose China’s bullying and harassment, but also communicate convincingly about why it will not have the desired effect. The more resilience against violence and bullying becomes normalised, the more it entrenches the narrative of China as the reckless aggressor and Taiwan as the responsible victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan faces an escalating grey zone challenge that could undermine the island’s political cohesion and security. As an open, democratic society facing a powerful adversary with uncertain international support, Taiwan is constrained in its choices about how to respond to grey zone action. Unless China takes unambiguous attributable action that severely damages Taiwanese property, harms its population or occupies territory, the best course of action is mainly in the realm of “light grey” responses – measures that enhance resilience and improve powers of attribution, deny the sanctuary of ambiguity, attach to the opponent the reputational cost of “escalation” and “aggression”, bolster social cohesion and lend weight to appeals for international support and solidarity. Taiwan can set an example for others dealing with grey zone action. As it continues to develop approaches such as those outlined in this policy brief, it will strengthen its position to resist pressure and build a broader likeminded coalition that together could deny the gains sought by China and others from exploitation of grey zone vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

However, al-Sharaa’s willingness to find common ground has sparked discontent among his own supporters.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Some are now considering defecting to more radical groups, such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, both of which are reportedly seeking to establish contact with critics of the interim government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s new interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has been laying the groundwork for engagement with the West since 2016, when he began steering his al-Nusra insurgent group towards a split from al-Qaeda. Up until then, al-Sharaa’s group had functioned as al-Qaeda’s Syrian branch. In the mid-2010s, however, it began seeking to reach an understanding with regional and international actors, first and foremost Turkey. Those were the years when Russian intervention in Syria was turning the tide in favour of the Assad regime and the U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State threatened to engulf al-Nusra itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That split lost al-Sharaa the support of thousands of al-Qaeda loyalists, who turned against him. However, he clearly thought that without an alliance with Turkey — and also without the tolerance of the U.S. — his group would not survive the very challenging time that lay ahead. His new organisation, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), held discussions with U.S. and British intelligence, according to internal sources, and thanks to the separation from al-Qaeda it did in fact earn an exemption from the air campaign against Islamist movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was an act of supreme pragmatism, but it allowed HTS to maintain its strength at a time when all the main competing organisations were being smashed to pieces — whether by the U.S. or the Russians. The fall of the Assad regime at the end of 2024, however, was less the result of the military proficiency of HTS and its allies than of the Assad regime rotting from within. It is clear that even al-Sharaa did not expect to find himself in power — at least not as quickly as it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many believe that HTS has been sharing intelligence with the U.S. about the location of al-Qaeda and Islamic State members, who were regularly hit with precise airstrikes, for years. If that was the case, it was done covertly and did not arouse too much controversy within HTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since HTS came to power in Damascus, al-Sharaa’s extreme pragmatism has come into the open. He has sought Western approval, has reached out to Israel, has reached an agreement with the mainly Kurdish and leftist SDF, has agreed to negotiations with Russia over its bases in Syria, has offered peace to Iran, and has even suspended the implementation of Islamic Law (which was being applied in the HTS stronghold of Idlib prior to the change in regime in Damascus). Some of these offers might have been made in the expectation that they would be rejected. For example, Russia was offered the chance to keep the bases in exchange for returning Bashar al-Assad and other dignitaries of the former regime, a service Moscow is highly unlikely to render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-debatable-pragmatism&quot;&gt;A debatable pragmatism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this pragmatic approach might well be the only viable one for a new regime that is dependent on Turkish goodwill, has no money, and counts on limited manpower to control the country (there are probably no more than 30,000 armed men under al-Sharaa’s direct control). Most Sunni Arab armed groups in Syria have pledged support to the new government, and after the March 11 agreement with the SDF, a kind of de facto federal approach has been agreed with the Kurdish militias too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far from clear, however, how solid all these deals are. One HTS cadre said in March that he did not think the SDF deal had really been cleared with the Turks and their Syrian National Army proxies. Al-Sharaa rushed to reach an agreement after coming under heavy Western criticism after his armed forces massacred hundreds of civilians in Latakia and Tartus in early March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the membership of HTS itself, and of most of its allies, is still made up of committed jihadists, many of whom are unhappy about some or all of al-Sharaa’s policies. The negotiations with Russia over its bases elicit some of the most negative comments, acknowledges an HTS commander in Idlib, contacted in February. He says most of the ranks-and-file fighters believe that the Russians should be told to exit Syria without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Sharaa’s friendly approach to the U.S. is less controversial, as the militants understand that the U.S. did not target them during its air campaign — which remains ongoing. They must have also noticed the favourable press coverage from some U.S. media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is a much more controversial topic. Tehran was just offered normal diplomatic relations, and unsurprisingly, its relations with Syria worsened rapidly, sparing al-Sharaa any need to justify his initial opening to his base. The new government believes Iran and Hizbollah are reaching out to various groups to re-mobilise them against the new regime — it is they who Damascus accuses of being behind the clashes in Latakia and Tartus that started on March 6. Border clashes with Hizbollah are quite frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly the worst criticism derives, however, from Al Sharaa’s soft approach to Israel — the more so as the latter not only occupies Syrian land, but also seeks to establish direct links with Syrian communities, such as the Druze in Suwayda. Moreover, sympathy for the Palestinians is very widespread among the ranks of HTS, where Hamas also enjoys a high level of support. Critical voices within HTS, such as an officer in the new ministry of defence contacted in February, believe that the majority of the members of HTS oppose the current approach of al-Sharaa towards Israel. However much hatred might be there for Iran, they believe that Israel should get no better treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations with Turkey are not problematic for now — unsurprising given the role that Ankara has played in enabling the success of HTS. Nevertheless, HTS members still say that they do not want any foreign country to interfere in their internal affairs. In reality, Turkey has huge leverage, as it not only controls the largest armed force in Syria — the Syrian National Army — but also hosts over 3 million Syrians. Maintaining friendly ties with Turkey is essential for Syria’s economic recovery. Most HTS members are worried about the extent of Turkish influence, but they are ready to put off discussion of the issue until the new regime has consolidated. The allies of HTS are divided between Turkish proxies and groups that are outright hostile to Turkey, making a balanced position hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem that al-Sharaa has to face stems from the generous deal struck with the Kurdish SDF earlier this month. Some of the groups in his coalition government still do not see eye-to-eye with their president on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;criticism-from-within&quot;&gt;Criticism from within&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping foreign states happy while maintaining the satisfaction of his own base is going to be hard for al-Sharaa. Many of his allies come from the Islamic State, having joined following the fall of Raqqa. With the exception of the younger recruits, most of the rest come from al-Qaeda, as does al-Sharaa himself. It is not too far-fetched to speculate that disgruntled members might consider going back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Qaeda is not seen as a threat for now, and HTS officially claim that the group has largely been crushed, with its minimal remaining presence remaining underground. The Islamic State is known to maintain cells and guerrilla groups in some mountain and desert areas, especially around Raqqa, but its capabilities, too, are assessed as being very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, according to the aforementioned source in the Ministry of Defence, in the future it is certainly conceivable that the dissidents from al-Sharaa’s young regime might feel attracted by al-Qaeda or Islamic State, who according to some sources within HTS are already reaching out to members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Sharaa is reportedly worried too, and some senior HTS figures already assume there will be defections. Entire groups, if marginalised and dissatisfied, might consider rekindling links to either global jihadist group. “A small mistake of our leadership and the current interim government will collapse,” says the source in the MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially at risk of defection are the movement’s numerous (4,000-6,000) Central Asians, Uyghurs, Chechens, and Daghestanis, who either joined HTS and its allies individually or allied with it as a group. Many of them were in the Islamic State until 2017, and it is very likely that at least some of them retained connections with friends and relatives who are still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true regarding past links to al-Qaeda. Some of the Central Asian groups, such as Katibat al Tawhid Wal Jihad, even renewed their pledge of loyalty to the late Ayman al-Zawahiri back in 2019, at a time when they were already associated with HTS. Several other groups never formally broke with al-Qaeda, or else they withdrew their pledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al-Sharaa has attempted to pacify the uneasy Central Asians and the other foreign fighters by issuing Syrian citizenship. He also offered some of them positions in the new Syrian army. Many see al-Sharaa’s offer not only as generous, but as the only viable alternative, arguing that the Central Asians should take whatever pragmatic alternative comes from the leadership and be thankful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others, however, still say that this is not what they fought for during long years of war — what they want is the establishment of a “full” Islamic Law regime. They are angry that al-Sharaa has not imposed the hijab on Syrian women and that he decided not to implement the sort of religious regime that existed in Idlib. These Central Asians are also furious over al-Sharaa’s policy of befriending Western countries — especially his refusal to condemn Israel over its occupation on Syrian soil, let alone to take any action. Some even remain committed to global jihadism, a member of the Uzbek group Katibat Imam al Bukhari openly said when contacted in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is therefore a growing gap between a portion of the Central Asians and al-Sharaa, even if one of these Central Asians critics says that the bulk of the foreign fighters are still willing to give him a chance to rectify his policies over the coming months. Failing that, they would be ready to part ways. For Certainly, he says, both the Islamic State in Syria and al-Qaeda will be happy to welcome back their disgruntled foreign fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle Corridor, officially known as the Trans-Caspian International Trade Route, is often touted as the shortest trade route connecting China to Europe – an alternative to both Russia’s Northern Corridor and the Suez Canal. On paper, it is a game-changer. And if you follow regional news, you will see a near-weekly stream of announcements celebrating milestones along the route. Just in the past few weeks, Kazakhstan pledged to boost cargo shipments to 10 million tons, Maersk- a Danish shipping company- completed its first trial shipment from Japan to Europe via Middle Corridor, and Bulgaria announced a $1.8 billion investment in the Middle Corridor railway network- the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these developments accelerate, the potential of the Middle Corridor is becoming increasingly apparent, calling for a closer analysis of how Europe should engage. In today’s complex geopolitical climate, it is in Europe’s interest to diversify its trade routes to strengthen its global connectivity. But doing so requires more than just strategic ambition – it demands a nuanced understanding of the practical realities and security risks along the trade routes. To play a meaningful role, Europe must engage with trade routes not just as an observer but as a committed partner, fostering cooperation and supporting their development, when and where the potential is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;middle-corridor---promises-and-hurdles&quot;&gt;Middle Corridor - Promises and Hurdles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle Corridor has gained even more significance – as a politically appealing alternative for trade – since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Only in the first 11 months of 2024, the cargo volume reached 4.1 million tons, a 63% year-over-year increase, and a stark change from the 586,000 tons recorded in 2021. But complexity lurks beneath these promising statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle Corridor isn’t a single, seamless transportation route. It is a complex network of roads, railways, and sea connections spanning multiple countries, each with its own logistical and bureaucratic challenges. Bottlenecks remain, from geographical constraints – harsh winters and strong winds in the Caspian delaying ferries – to bureaucratic hurdles like harmonising customs procedures, training personnel, and practical issue of railway gauge mismatches, or tax system misalignment between European and Soviet-era systems. Infrastructure investment is another pressing challenge, with estimates pointing to an €18.5 billion funding gap for much-needed modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these hurdles are overcome, the route could offer significant benefits – not just for European interests, but also for the South Caucasus, Central Asia, and China. And its success would do more than just shift trade routes; it would strengthen regional connectivity, boost interregional commerce, and demonstrate that Central Asia and the South Caucasus are more than transit zones but strong partners that Europe should engage meaningfully when it comes to trade. However, managing expectations on the ground and addressing concerns will be just as crucial as physical investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If neglected, this Middle Corridor could see the route fall victim to the same geopolitics that Europe seeks to avoid, allowing China, Russia and other regional actors to fill the void and impede, not facilitate, European supply chains in the future. It is important, therefore, for Europe to balance both its priorities and local views, as well as consider ways to secure the route against future disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-proofing-supply-chains-along-the-middle-corridor&quot;&gt;Future-Proofing Supply Chains Along the Middle Corridor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Europe, a main benefit of the Middle Corridor in the past three years has been an additional trade route that avoids transiting Russia, where many goods are sanctioned. It is therefore in Europe’s interest to ensure that Russia is not able to co-opt this route for its own purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) has recently conducted in-person interviews on the ground to better understand the practical realities of trade along the Middle Corridor. Interviewees along the Middle Corridor told us that many of the goods they shipped along the route were those that could not be transported via Russia because they were subject to sanctions, such as those on the G7 Common High Priority Items List. This was, they said, both because local authorities were increasingly vigilant about preventing the transfer of such goods to Russia, but also because Russia regularly confiscates goods that it deems useful or goods travelling to and from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any European engagement to promote trade along the Middle Corridor should keep in mind future risks that this route may also be used to divert critical technologies. This needn’t mean abandoning trade with the region altogether. Instead, European policymakers could consider three key factors to ensure that trade promotion is accompanied by programmes that address risks of circumvention–both now and in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, sanctioned goods shipped to Russia often transit or trans-ship through several jurisdictions to avoid detection. As transparency initiatives and trade data become publicly or commercially available, circumvention networks move to new, less visible jurisdictions. Even where trade data is available, multiple transshipments mean there are multiple points of potential evasion – where goods disappear or are smuggled without formal reporting. The inherent multijurisdictional nature of the Middle Corridor may provide many such opportunities for diversion. To combat this, European institutions should continue work with regional and international initiatives such as the Digital Trade Corridor to digitise and automate customs declarations and other trade procedures, ensuring transparent and visible movement of goods. This could have the added benefit of helping to combat corruption in the customs sector, and therefore of curbing organised crime and other illicit trade activity that relies on border corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are vulnerable to being co-opted for diversion purposes. In the past three years, networks seeking to circumvent sanctions on Russia relied on companies set up by Russian individuals, but field interviews indicated that as these networks were detected, Russian networks approached local companies to act as intermediaries. This took various forms, some involving more direct involvement than others. In some cases, contacts said, an SME may be asked simply to act as a transshipment route on paper and receive a small commission for this. At the other end of the scale, SMEs may hold goods on their premises (for example a farm or warehouse) until it can be smuggled over a border. European engagement should be accompanied with programmes to ensure regional SMEs’ links to Europe are strengthened and therefore reducing the incentive for SMEs to be coopted in circumvention. In addition, European programmes can work to train SMEs and increase their capacity in sanctions awareness and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third important source of diversion is Russian influence in local high-tech industries, which is likely to grow. Local high-tech companies can plausibly import sanctioned technologies, and then divert them to investors or partners in Russia. The countries along the Middle Corridor route have defence technology industries of their own (albeit some more advanced than others), and these technologies are set to grow rapidly. Further, the industries in which high-tech components are used extends beyond defence, spanning industrial parks, special economic zones, renewable energy companies, logistical centres, and AI development or crypto mining ventures. European countries can support local states to instil greater transparency in their foreign investment approval process, which would have additional anti-corruption benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;engagement-should-balance-european-and-local-views&quot;&gt;Engagement Should Balance European and Local Views&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European views on the Middle Corridor have been somewhat ambiguous. On one hand, they see an opportunity for influence and engagement; on the other, concerns linger over the potential for sanctions evasion along the route. Since 2022, much of the diplomatic attention on Central Asia and the Caucasus has focused on sanctions evasion and circumvention – an important intervention, given early indications that critical sanctioned technology was being trans-shipped through the region. But diplomacy needs both carrots and sticks, and supporting infrastructure development can be a way of demonstrating European commitment to building up long-term trade relationships that foster cooperation in other areas, such as sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-country field interviews revealed that local partners remain keen to expand trade with Europe but see clear gaps in European action. Future engagement must take these concerns seriously, as many of the practical challenges raised on the ground are rooted in political and geopolitical realities – requiring policy solutions, not just rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-the-ground interviews by the authors identified issues that deserve attention by European stakeholders. First, the main direction of trade is overwhelmingly east-to-west. This is because there is a lack of European exports (at least not in similar volumes), which means trucks and railcars may be forced to return from Europe empty, effectively doubling transport costs. Given that the Middle Corridor is already more expensive than competing routes, this absence of return cargo poses a significant challenge to its long-term cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, nearly every logistics company interviewed pointed to the difficulty of securing permits for trucks and visas for drivers. With Europe tightening migration policies, very few drivers can obtain the necessary permissions, forcing companies to turn down work due to a shortage of authorised personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, investment remains a critical issue. Modernising and aligning infrastructure across the route requires substantial funding. While European investment is welcomed, local actors stress that financing would need to come at below-market interest rates, given that the Middle Corridor is already costlier than alternative routes. Local stakeholders also told us they prefer a multilateral investment structure, to avoid perceptions that the route is dominated by one geopolitical superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europe-should-consider-what-diversified-trade-routes-are-worth&quot;&gt;Europe Should Consider what Diversified Trade Routes are Worth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we write, there is widespread speculation on the future of sanctions on Russia, as well as on future geopolitical contests. Amidst this uncertainty, European engagement to develop the Middle Corridor remains not only relevant but necessary. One of the important lessons for Europe from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been about the need to diversify trade routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, Europe must present itself as a reliable partner both in terms of trade and in other areas of cooperation such as infrastructure investment. Local countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus have demonstrated their commitment to this route, investing their own funds in developing parts of the Middle Corridor. Where Middle Corridor expansion is funded by other countries – Russia and China, for example – they will see benefits. Europe has many geopolitical and investment factors to consider when assessing the benefit of this route. It should decide what trade diversification and development in the region is really worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper profiles subnational diplomacy between the UK and China, with a focus on the direct engagement of UK local authorities with Chinese diplomats and local governments. It draws on extensive interviews with these UK authorities. The paper assesses the preparedness of local authorities to capture the benefits and mitigate the risks of engaging with China and proposes actions to improve their effectiveness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, city, state and local governments engage in subnational diplomacy to advance their policy agenda, against the backdrop of national policy and their role in their country’s overall governance. In China too, cities and provinces pursue international engagement to support trade and investment, to learn, to enhance civic pride and to project soft power on the world stage in a context where subnational diplomacy is more tightly linked to national policy objectives than in the UK. The role of the Chinese Communist Party and its United Front Work Department, which seeks to shape opinion at home and abroad, are important additional considerations that influence and, at times, constrain or determine how China’s cities and provinces engage with the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authority engagement with China covers civic and cultural activities, trade and investment, the education sector, and some activities with local communities. Interactions are primarily with UK-based Chinese diplomats, in the context of twinning relationships with Chinese local governments and less formalised relationships with other local governments across China. Although recovering, activity remains lower than before the Covid-19 pandemic. Most of those interviewed in the research for this paper observed that, to date, civic engagement has proven more successful than trade- and investment-related activity. Educational links, especially the number of Chinese students coming to the UK, are strong and highly valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In engaging further with China, local authorities can draw on strengths developed in cities across the UK. These include the individuals who have developed longstanding experience with China, and the cross-sector organisational structures for engagement that some cities have developed to good effect. Cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Edinburgh and Belfast have used these approaches to develop warm relationships and strong reputations in China, resulting in tangible positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China has fallen down the priority ranking for local authorities in recent years; many councils judge opportunities offered by engagement with other countries to be greater. Spending pressures have reduced resourcing, exacerbating the always-present scale mismatch with Chinese city counterparts. China-related activity has become more politically contentious; security concerns loom larger. In this context, local authorities seek greater clarity from central government on the UK’s overall China policy, on the specifics of when and where to engage or not, and greater support on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as the UK “re-engages” with China at senior political levels, local authorities have an opportunity to take a fresh look at their China-related activities. An important foundation for this effort is a more explicit articulation of the role of subnational diplomacy within the UK’s overall China policy. This can emerge from discussions between local authorities, the devolved administrations and the UK government about where they see opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its simplest, however, the main factor holding back local authority engagement with China today is the widespread local assessment that, all things considered, the benefits do not outweigh the risks and the costs. Changing this would require clearer direction and guidance from the UK government and support to China capability-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is substantial value to establishing a UK-wide framework that enables more effective local authority engagement with China. This would create an overview of activity, improve information flow, provide coordinated, granular guidance on UK–China policy and help build China capabilities locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a need to articulate more clearly for local authorities the areas where engagement is supported and where it is not. There should be clarity, without imposing or mandating, on the role that local authorities can play in UK–China relations, and where there is national-level support for local initiatives, avoiding mixed messages from different departments. There is also a need to provide and/or orchestrate the delivery of training and experience-sharing sessions across local authority leadership to strengthen China capabilities, not just among those working on a regular basis with China. Finally, those focused on China need to remember that the main priority for local authorities is naturally their own locality. Changing perceptions on the UK’s China policy and ensuring that key messages are “received” takes time, persistence and effort. Communication with local authorities thus needs to be tailored accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities should develop their own assessments of the China opportunity, relative to other opportunities, guided by the UK overall policy context. This means assessing the benefits – most likely with a focus on trade, investment and education links – as well as the risks and how to mitigate them. Where the potential for benefit is clear (which will not be in all cases), authorities should adapt the holistic, cross-sector approaches to China engagement that have worked well in cities such as Manchester and Liverpool. Structuring engagement through larger authorities offers the opportunity for broader efforts and may help to address the resourcing challenge. Setting clear priorities and making judicious use of the UK’s official presence in China is also important. This all requires experience-sharing and training that builds China capabilities among a broad base of councillors and officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the UK and China collaborate more closely on areas of mutual benefit, local authorities are well positioned to play an important role. Whether they play such a role depends on decisions and actions taken at local and central government level to identify where the benefits of engagement justify the effort involved. It also requires measures to strengthen the capabilities of local authorities to engage successfully with Chinese counterparts – in other words, their China capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;context-and-research-objectives&quot;&gt;Context and Research Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s relationship with China is multifaceted, presenting opportunities and risks. It has undergone significant shifts over time, most recently since the “Golden Era” announced during President Xi Jinping’s 2015 visit. Such complexity and change are unsurprising given China’s economic heft and increasing innovation: its economy is now five times larger than the UK’s and its R&amp;amp;D spending is eight times higher. Added to this comes China’s increasingly significant role on the world stage, its Party-state system of government under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the dynamics of US–China and transatlantic relationships, which affect the UK’s other diplomatic relationships. China’s leadership in new technologies, such as electric vehicles, solar, wind and high-speed rail, is of relevance to the UK’s own energy transition and economic growth. At the same time, there is continuing attention to the potential security and dependence risks of over-reliance on China. In common with its allies, the UK has expressed the essence of its approach to China through three words: “cooperation, competition and challenge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the period of Covid-19 travel restrictions and limited political engagement between senior British and Chinese leaders, the UK and China are now re-engaging. While national government activity receives most attention, subnational interactions between the UK and China are also important. This paper presents research on subnational diplomacy between China and local authorities across the UK, within the context of China’s overall approach to subnational diplomacy across other sectors of British society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five core questions are explored:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the objectives and nature of China’s subnational diplomacy in the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the different structures and channels through which China conducts its subnational diplomacy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the objectives of UK local authorities in engaging with China and what have been the outcomes to date?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How well positioned are local authorities in the UK to engage effectively with China, and with what benefits, risks and challenges?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What actions would strengthen the effectiveness and resilience of local authorities in the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-methodology-and-structure&quot;&gt;Research Methodology and Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper draws on an extensive series of interviews with UK local authorities on their experience with China, conducted from October 2024 to January 2025, a literature review of China’s subnational diplomacy in other countries, and open source research into China’s diplomatic objectives and activities towards the UK. The interviews were a mix of in-person and remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subnational dimension examined in the paper applies primarily to the UK: the focus is on China’s diplomatic efforts at the local authority level, below the level of the UK government and that of the devolved nations. From the Chinese side, although not the only relevant actors, China’s local governments play a critical role in China’s subnational diplomacy through their extensive sister-city engagement across the UK. As such, the research covers mainland Chinese provinces and cities but does not include Hong Kong, which is under a different governance structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What qualifies as diplomacy – and therefore which are the relevant actors on the Chinese side – is more ambiguous. The UK, China and others have long engaged in “People to People” diplomacy. Xi has said “China is willing to … give play to the unique role of people-to-people diplomacy”. This broadens the scope of diplomacy beyond government structures. Xi has also declared that “Party, government, military, civilian and academic, east, west, south, north and centre, the Party leads everything”. This implies that any Chinese non-governmental actor may also be pursuing China’s national diplomatic objectives in line with Party goals. Research on China’s subnational diplomacy in the US has identified primary actors that “range from explicit government entities to players with mixed and hidden ownership, to private actors whose interests are bound to China’s. They include Chinese organizations dedicated to trade, investment, and technological cooperation; companies, pools of capital, and industry associations; and media and educational institutions”. One Australian researcher observed “when [Australian] subnational actors deal with Chinese entities of any kind, they can never be certain to what extent they are actually dealing with the national party-state”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of China’s subnational diplomacy needs therefore to take a broad view. It is however fallacious to view all Chinese organisations and individuals as acting in lockstep, collectively executing a single top-down policy direction. Rather, each pursues their own objectives based on circumstances and ambitions, within the overall context of Chinese policy priorities. Martin Thorley has conceptualised this as a “latent network”. He argues that the influence of CCP direction is both over- and underestimated. It is overestimated in that companies, universities and others have the space and motivation to mostly pursue their own agendas, while communicating how these choices align with national priorities. However, it is underestimated as, when required, these same actors are ultimately subordinate to specific central CCP directives at the expense of their own interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore helpful to distinguish three groups of Chinese actors engaged in diplomacy at the UK subnational level:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese national-level diplomatic activities (embassy, consulate, ministerial visits) with UK local authorities, universities, companies and others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese local government activities with UK local authorities and others (such as twinning arrangements and other delegations).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other Chinese activities across the UK, primarily engagements with non-governmental counterparts (such as business-to-business, university-to-university and cultural).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on the interactions of UK local authorities with mainland Chinese actors, while placing them in the context of the three groups above. The primary research consisted of interviews with 26 persons across 21 UK local authorities and related bodies, supplemented with additional interviews with the devolved administrations and seven national organisations with differing roles in UK–China subnational engagement. Interviewees were selected to ensure geographical balance and be representative of China-related activity across the UK. Considerations included the scale, category and remit of different entities (including city and county councils, combined authorities and inward investment agencies), those with positive or less positive experiences and individuals with greater or lesser experience with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-related matters are now often viewed as contentious and sensitive for both individuals and local authorities. Interviews were therefore conducted on a non-attributable, confidential basis to encourage frank and open conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has five chapters. Chapter I outlines the nature and objectives of China’s subnational diplomacy in the UK, while Chapter II describes the structures and channels through which it is conducted. Chapter III profiles the objectives and experience of the UK’s local authorities in their relations with China, and Chapter IV assesses the preparedness of these authorities for successful engagement with China. The final chapter presents recommendations aimed at raising the effectiveness and resilience of UK–China subnational relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-nature-and-objectives-of-chinas-subnational-diplomacy-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;I. The Nature and Objectives of China’s Subnational Diplomacy in the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s subnational diplomacy in the UK is best understood along three dimensions: the role that subnational diplomacy plays in China’s national diplomacy overall; the objectives of China’s national diplomacy with the UK; and the objectives that China’s cities and provinces are pursuing through engaging with their UK counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-subnational-diplomacy-in-chinas-national-diplomacy&quot;&gt;The Role of Subnational Diplomacy in China’s National Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subnational diplomacy has been rising in importance around the world. In the words of one researcher, “the international engagement of cities and local governments has increased and diversified recently … cities and local governments leverage international connections to access investment, share ideas and shape solutions to their local challenges”. These activities bring benefits for all involved, including employment creation and economic growth resulting from increased trade and investment, cooperation in science and technology research, and the promotion of cultural ties, people-to-people exchanges and cross-cultural understanding. China has also increased such activity; from 2000 to 2018, China’s sister-city relationships in the Asia-Pacific rose in number from 440 to 950.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, subnational diplomacy allows local governments to advance their own agenda against the backdrop of both national policy and their role in their country’s overall governance. In the US and Europe, local authorities seek at times to counteract national policy: some US states, for example, continued to advance their climate agenda during the first Trump administration, against the direction of federal policy. By contrast, China’s subnational diplomacy is more tightly tied to national foreign policy objectives. A report from the Mercator Institute for Chinese Studies (MERICS) think tank concluded that: “While in Europe subnational governance is primarily decentralized, with regions and cities acting autonomously, China’s provinces and cities are part of a highly centralized and unitary system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Research Methodology and Structure section highlighted, what this means in practice is nuanced: Chinese national policy goals are expressed in broad, ambiguous terms that frequently leave scope for local interpretation and adaptation. China’s sheer scale makes overall top-down direction impractical and ineffective. Cities and provinces generally pursue their own agendas, based on local circumstances, often in competition with one another, and they tend to interpret national directives in accordance with their aims and interests. They make sure, however, to communicate alignment with national goals, to not act explicitly to offset national-level policy and, when required, to follow specific top-down direction. This is especially true in matters related to national security, which has been defined increasingly broadly by the central authorities in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most countries, subnational engagement can be a useful and effective channel to both support national foreign policy objectives and advance the interests of local governments. This national link is an explicit aspect of Chinese policy discourse. One Chinese academic described a theory of “parallel diplomacy”, in which subnational outreach complements national-level diplomacy to take advantage of the “autonomy of regional, subnational governments as international actors”. One Xinhua article considered how relationships with local governments in the US can act as a counterbalance to national tensions. It argued that “local governments are more ‘pragmatic’ than their federal counterparts, focused on ‘employment and economic development’ rather than security concerns”, “going against the wind” of “rising national-level tensions”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US State Department has also observed such behaviour, and has described how China “uses subnational relationships to influence its national political and economic interests in partner countries … This exposes local governments to growing economic dependency, industrial espionage and technology transfer, and increasing political pressure and disinformation”. There is a risk that moreover, “lower levels of experience and awareness, especially among smaller cities, can be exploited to circumvent the due diligence mechanisms of national agencies”. Both the US government and two of the interviewees in this research highlighted how China’s approach has echoes of Mao’s dictum to “encircle the cities from the countryside” or to “use the local to control the centre”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s organisational structures reflect this coupling of the national and the subnational. The Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) describes itself as “China’s lead organisation for engaging with local governments in foreign countries” and operates China’s sister-city and sister-province relationships, as specified in Article 5 of the Regulations on the Management of Friendship City Work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP’s central role also links national and subnational diplomacy via, for example, the role of the United Front Work Department (UFWD), which is one of the CCP’s six main departments. It has been the subject of increasing media attention in the West. Charles Parton has observed that while the UFWD’s main activities are within China, it has become increasingly active internationally as a result of globalisation and the desire to more actively promote CCP interests and values abroad. Efforts focus on ensuring that Chinese overseas, including students, remain in line with the CCP and “on the more general objective of ensuring that foreign countries, their governments, businesses, academia and societies are better aligned with the CCP’s world view and ambitions”. Xi has spoken of “improv[ing] and strengthen[ing] our work related to Chinese nationals overseas to give shape to a powerful joint force for advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”. While the CPAFFC is not a UFWD bureau, it is widely seen as an affiliated organisation, acting in line with United Front objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overall-objectives-of-chinas-diplomacy-with-the-uk&quot;&gt;Overall Objectives of China’s Diplomacy with the UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s diplomatic objectives with the UK derive from both China’s overall foreign policy objectives – a substantial topic beyond the scope of this paper – and the distinctive attributes of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese foreign policy pursues China’s declared “core interests” of sovereignty, development and security in a world that is, in Xi’s words, undergoing “great changes unseen in a century”. These changes present China with both opportunities to be seized and risks to be addressed. The stance and actions of the US dominate Chinese considerations. In 2023, Xi stated that “Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country’s development”. Based on its assessment of US “containment”, China seeks to prevent or weaken alliances between the US and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a close ally of the US and a P5 member of the UN Security Council, with significant diplomatic influence globally, the UK’s stance is of significant interest. China seeks to shape British sentiment to be at worst, not hostile, and at best, favourable to China, such that the UK concludes that its interests do not lie in aligning with the US on China policy. China is, however, uncompromising on its core interests and insists on non-interference in what it sees as “internal affairs”, including Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong. The UK’s historic role in Hong Kong is therefore especially salient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is a sizeable trading partner for China and is its 12th largest export market. British research and innovation in biotech, renewables, advanced manufacturing and other areas fit well with China’s ambitions for technology leadership. This presents opportunities for Chinese in acquisitions, investments and talent recruitment in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The City of London’s financial markets are world leading: an attractive option for Chinese finance and renminbi internationalisation. Britain’s education sector also has strong appeal to the Chinese middle class, even more as US–China tensions rise. The UK is also an attractive showcase for endorsing Chinese capabilities to others – hence China’s historical interest in nuclear power at Hinkley Point and having the UK select Huawei for its 5G network. Alongside its inherent economic benefits, increased trade and investment in both directions also opens the potential to increase the UK’s dependence on China, which could then be used coercively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China wants to strengthen its “discourse power” – “the ability to set and shape narratives” – in the UK, as it does globally. For Xi, “telling China’s stories well” is “a glorious diplomatic mission”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;objectives-of-chinas-cities-and-provinces&quot;&gt;Objectives of China’s Cities and Provinces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s national objectives provide the context for its subnational governments’ engagement with the UK. However, cities and provinces do not, in most cases, simply execute top-down directives. As elsewhere in the world, they pursue their own interests to attract investment (in competition with other Chinese cities and provinces), support local companies in expanding overseas, and access technology and research that supports local industrial competitiveness, aligned with national policy. Chinese local governments are also keen to share experiences on economic development and other topics. Specific sectors of interest depend on local circumstance. Interviews for the research for this paper highlighted, for example, Shanghai’s interest in Liverpool’s and Manchester’s post-industrial transition and Liverpool’s maritime expertise. Shenyang, meanwhile, found value in Belfast’s port experience. In addition to the direct economic benefits, local officials benefit through positive performance evaluations and improved promotion prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Chinese cities have been keen to engage across a wide range of non-economic activities. Several interviewees highlighted sister-city interest in engagement on education, health, social services, firefighting and policing, primarily for the purposes of learning and experience-sharing. However, China’s economic challenges have sharpened the focus of engagement on tangible economic benefits. Alongside the need for job creation and growth, Chinese local governments face increasing funding pressures, stemming from the declining real-estate market (the main source of local government revenue) and substantial costs incurred during Covid-19. However, several interviewees reported continued outreach in the areas of education, sports and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As elsewhere, Chinese cities and provinces also pursue civic engagement for its own sake as a form of “soft power”, dovetailing with national ambitions of strengthened “discourse power”. These activities demonstrate to residents their city’s internationalisation and importance on the global stage. One interviewee in a city China partnership described a Chinese city’s pride in showcasing its achievements to representatives from all its sister-cities globally. City-to-city civic engagement contributes to explicit policy goals of becoming “international cities”. Chengdu, for example, is proud to be a “Creative City of Gastronomy” and holds the Chengdu International Food and Tourism Festival. The political priority to pursue such engagement and the funding available to do so remains higher than in the UK. Overseas initiatives that highlight the positive aspects of China’s culture and progress again contribute to career success for local officials. City-to-city engagement also opens up for local officials the attractive prospect of international travel, which is closely managed and requires specific approvals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, however, local officials are aware of the risks (including to their own careers) that result from situations that run counter – or are perceived to run counter – to China’s core interests. These include matters related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Taiwan and the legitimacy of CCP rule. For Chinese local authorities, avoiding such situations is a non-negotiable aspect of engagement with the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-structures-and-channels-of-chinas-subnational-diplomacy-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;II. Structures and Channels of China’s Subnational Diplomacy in the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China pursues its subnational diplomacy in the UK through a range of formal and informal structures and channels. China’s formal diplomatic structure takes the form of the London embassy and consulates in Belfast, Edinburgh and Manchester. Diplomatic officials, led by current Ambassador Zheng Zeguang, engage with a wide range of institutions, communities and individuals across the UK. These include local authorities, the focus of this paper. They also include British and Chinese companies, universities, colleges and schools, Chinese community and business associations, and individuals of all nationalities, which are outside the direct scope of this paper. These interactions do, however, influence how local authorities approach their own engagement with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambassador Zheng’s activities outside London illustrate this formal subnational engagement. From 2022 to 2024, the Chinese Embassy reports 53 ambassadorial events across 25 unique locations, with repeat visits to Liverpool, Glasgow, Cardiff, Belfast and Edinburgh. There were 18 meetings with local government authorities, 16 visits to universities, nine economic and trade events, including regional forums and receptions, and seven cultural and youth engagements, including school visits, ceremonies and festivals. It is believed that China’s consuls-general undertake a similar range of activities, although details are not published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s formal diplomatic structure works closely with other organisations to promote Chinese interests in the UK. The China Chamber of Commerce in the UK (CCCUK) advocates for the interests of Chinese businesses; CCCUK’s Standing Committee comprises major Chinese companies, primarily state-owned. There is also activity related to Chinese students and overseas Chinese more broadly. In its 2023 China report, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee concluded that the UFWD is responsible for “influence and interference activities directed at the Chinese diaspora, from managing relations with prominent Chinese individuals and groups to coordinating support for Chinese positions or targeting dissident groups abroad”. There is no firm evidence on the scale of this activity in the UK. As of January 2024, the London embassy’s website listed at least one senior diplomat dedicated to Overseas Chinese Affairs (a United Front function), although this information has been subsequently removed. The same report concluded that China “seeks to monitor and control Chinese students’ behaviour – primarily via the network of Chinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSAs)”. The UK has more than 90 CSSAs, operating as branches of a central CSSAUK. Many CSSA activities are cultural and help Chinese students adjust to British life. Some CSSAs, however, describe their operations as “subordinate to” or “officially guided by” the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese government is also the main funder of 30 Confucius Institutes in universities across the UK. These institutes primarily promote Chinese language learning and cultural understanding, but research has identified more politicised activities that advance China’s policy positions and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most local authority interviewees reported that these other UK-based Chinese organisations seldom engage directly with them. In some cases, there was more regular direct interaction with Confucius Institutes – for example, in Belfast and in the Liverpool China Partnership. Interactions were partly highly positive. However, some interviewees observed that some councillors questioned the merits and appropriateness of engagement with China on civic matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, however, it is China’s own subnational governments – provincial, city and even district in the largest cities – that engage with local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Covid-19, many Chinese delegations have tightened their focus on attracting inward investment to their locality. Invest Shanghai, the Shanghai government’s investment arm, has an office in London. Consequently, according to interviewees, they more often engage directly with British businesses than with local authorities; the China-Britain Business Council and others often play a facilitating role. Whatever their origin in China, the first port of call for Chinese delegations is London. Tianjin’s Tianjin Invest delegation and a delegation from Shenzhen’s Pingshan district visited London in 2024. Many also visit Edinburgh, Liverpool and Manchester, given the strong history of China engagement in these cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other delegations focus on learning and building connections across British institutions of all kinds. Some of this activity is organised by “travel agents” (individuals in the UK and China who organise the visits). For example, an Anhui province delegation visited London and Edinburgh in November 2024 to understand financial regulatory issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other forms of UK–China subnational engagement fall under the heading of “people-to-people” relations. These can, in the broadest sense, be interpreted as a form of subnational cultural diplomacy. For example, according to one interviewee from a national organisation, in 2024, the Shenzhen Symphony Orchestra toured the UK, with the help of a British company based in China. Sometimes, these activities arise from sister-city relations: the Salford–Yangzhou sister-city relationship provided the context for the China Flower Association’s collaboration with the Royal Horticultural Society, supported by philanthropic funding from the local Chinese community. Mostly, however, local authorities are not directly involved in such engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees highlighted regular visits by Chinese universities and companies to meet UK counterparts and vice versa, generally without local authority involvement. Before Covid-19, delegations of Chinese entrepreneurs came regularly to the UK. These visits were typically a mix of study-tour, high-end tourism and a search for investment opportunities, especially in new technologies and real estate. Individuals – both Chinese and British – play a key organising role. M31 Capital, a Shanghai-based investment fund, organised one such post-Covid-19 visit in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-objectives-and-experience-of-uk-local-authorities-in-relation-to-china&quot;&gt;III. The Objectives and Experience of UK Local Authorities in Relation to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop of China’s engagement with a broad range of actors across the UK, local authorities have engaged directly with China for many years. While the state of UK–China relations at the national level has always provided important context, UK local authorities make their own choices on when, where and how to engage. In recent years, direct engagement has mostly been with Chinese cities and provinces and with China’s diplomats in the UK. Interviewees confirmed that after Xi’s 2015 state visit, there was extensive direct engagement with potential Chinese investors and businesses, mirroring receptivity at the national level. This is now much diminished. The distinctive nature of the City of London Corporation, home to more than 40 Chinese financial institutions, makes it the exception in engaging with Chinese financial institutions, ministries and regulators at the national level, as well as with Beijing and Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;origins-and-objectives-of-local-authority-engagement-with-china&quot;&gt;Origins and Objectives of Local Authority Engagement with China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origins of formal UK–China local authority engagement lie in twinning agreements with sister-cities and sister-provinces. According to the CPAFFC, 69 such agreements have been concluded. There is no comprehensive information on the number of dormant agreements or those terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first agreements date from the early 1980s. This was at a time of increasing government-to-government connections at the national level. In 1983, Cardiff, Birmingham, Coventry and Sheffield signed agreements with Xiamen, Changchun, Jinan and Anshan respectively. Similarly, Belfast–Shenyang and Stratford–Fuzhou signed agreements in 2016 after Xi’s 2015 UK visit. However, interviewees also highlighted the personalised, bottom-up origins of specific twinning initiatives. For example, Manchester’s 1986 Wuhan agreement was suggested by Chinatown residents, while in the cases of Leeds–Hangzhou (1988) and Essex–Jiangsu (1992), Chinese students studying locally provided the spur for the specific agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees discussed the fact that, throughout China’s rapid growth and opening-up, local authority engagement has always had a range of objectives and rationales. These can be grouped into four categories. First, local authorities saw value in civic engagement to promote people-to-people relations, increased understanding and a more prominent positioning in the world. Second, they saw economic opportunity in China – initially as an export market for local business and, over time, as a source of inward investment. Third, as Chinese students increasingly studied overseas and outbound tourism increased, China became more important to local universities – as a source of students and for research cooperation – and to the local “visitor economy”. Finally, in some cities, the presence of sizeable local ethnic Chinese communities has reinforced interest in cultural understanding and economic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-changing-focus-and-level-of-activity&quot;&gt;The Changing Focus and Level of Activity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus and level of activity across these four categories varies between authorities and over time. This reflects changes in China and in UK–China relations; the experience of individual authorities in engaging with China; and the other opportunities and constraints that these local authorities face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, interviewees indicated that there is less activity than before Covid-19. Covid-19 travel bans halted most activity, although Zoom calls maintained some contact. There were also examples of sister-cities providing support during Covid-19. Essex County Council, for example, secured 200,000 face masks from Jiangsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While activity is increasing, the rebound has not been as rapid as expected. Covid-19 has not, however, been the main cause. Interviewees repeatedly stated that, on the British side, more important causes were pressures on spending, including reduced resourcing for international affairs, and the political contentiousness and uncertainty, both locally and nationally, about engaging with China. This has led local authorities to consider more explicitly what priority to place on China, relative to other countries, and what their distinctive role in China-related engagement is, relative to other stakeholders such as universities and companies. Interviewees consistently saw their role as supporting and enabling the success of the diverse stakeholders locally, rather than “doing their job for them”. This means bringing people together, identifying how the whole can be more than the sum of the parts and, according to one city council interviewee, “use the assets that one has creatively”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-challenges-and-political-contention&quot;&gt;Increasing Challenges and Political Contention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past five years, local authority engagement with China has become significantly more politically contentious. As one interviewee from a city China partnership with long China experience said, “China has dropped down the list of priorities – it’s just too complex and challenging to deal with”. Combined with continued budgetary pressures, these complexities have put all China-related spending under the spotlight. Interviewees stated that civic and cultural engagement has come under most pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While economic opportunities remain highly valued, other countries are consistently seen as a higher priority and less challenging than China. “There is increasing nervousness on trade and investment [with China], although increasing exports is less sensitive than investment”, said one city council interviewee. Conversely, the importance of Chinese students for the local education sector stood out repeatedly by interviewees, although concerns and anxiety about research cooperation have risen. Finally, the community relations aspect remains important, although this engagement too has become more complicated: the arrival of British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) visa holders from Hong Kong who have left Hong Kong because of their concerns over China’s implementation of the National Security Law and tightened controls on freedom of speech has increased the differences and intensity of debate within ethnic Chinese communities on the merits or otherwise of engaging with China and on what terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local politicians and officials are inevitably aware of media reports on China-related geopolitical tensions and the national debate on the UK’s approach to China. Interviewees across the UK mentioned events occurring in other local authorities. Examples included the violence against Hong Kong protesters outside the Manchester Chinese consulate in 2022 and the promptness and forcefulness with which Chinese diplomats raised Taiwan-related engagement, such as Edinburgh City Council’s initiative to sign a friendship agreement with Kaohsiung in 2024. The de-twinning movement, which advocates that cities break off relations with sister-cities primarily for reasons of human rights was cited as a further challenge. Interviewees consistently stated that “we don’t do social media” for China-related activities, even on economic cooperation, with one city council interviewee saying, “China is the only country that we handle in this way”. “Local politicians are extremely wary of any publicity that comes out of meeting with Chinese”, added another. One observed that people are cautious about being associated with the Chinese Embassy; they also do not want this caution to be communicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civic-and-cultural-engagement&quot;&gt;Civic and Cultural Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of local authority engagement with China, civic and cultural activities have been at the core of subnational engagement with China, often reflecting the preferences and expectations of Chinese sister-cities. Over the years, there have been many activities between British and Chinese counterparts, including, according to interviewees, museum exchanges (Colchester–Nanjing), badminton and horticulture (Glasgow), a Ningbo Friendship tram bridge in Nottingham, and 200,000 children learning Mandarin across 160 schools in Northern Ireland. In a recent example, Chengdu provided funding to enable three Sheffield athletes to compete in a Chengdu half-marathon in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although they continue, such activities are now less common. They inherently bring intangible rather than tangible benefits, and in an environment of budget cuts and political sensitivity, the spending involved has become increasingly hard for councils to justify. Several interviewees noted these pressures started around 2012, pre-dating the rise in geopolitical tensions and even the so-called “Golden Era”. One council went from having two people working on China to one person covering the world. Another removed the individual who was focused full time on its China relationships. Travel is a challenge, too: “We have to explain there is no travel budget; we can’t do the things that we would like to do”, said one interviewee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their own increased funding pressures, Chinese counterparts continue to routinely offer to pay the expenses of council-led delegations to China. However, this raises issues of potential undue influence – real or perceived – and vocal media or other local reaction. Consequently, councils repeatedly decline such offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many interviewees evaluated the civic side of engagement as more successful than the economic, based on the level of activity and warmth of ties. Examples include Leeds–Hangzhou, Glasgow–Dalian, Edinburgh–Xi’an and Manchester–Wuhan. Many were frustrated by this. “We haven’t seen much tangible in 10 years. Just more continued woolly inward delegations. We don’t get much out of it and nor do our partners”, said one city council interviewee. Another said, “It all feels very ‘civic’. It has not moved to tangible outcomes.” One interviewee with long experience of China suggested that “there needs to be a clear business case if a twinning relationship is to be sustained”. Another compared his city’s experience with Chinese and German sister-cities: “With China, it all remains very vague; the Germans move much more quickly to specifics”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trade-and-investment&quot;&gt;Trade and Investment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attracting Chinese inward investment and supporting local company exports to China have been – and remain – important objectives for local authorities, offering the prospect of tangible returns. Despite slower growth, China remains the world’s second-largest economy. Mainland China is the UK’s fifth-largest trading partner. A 2020 study estimated that tourism, education and trade with China support up to 129,000 jobs across the UK. Between 2000 and 2023, the UK was Europe’s largest recipient of Chinese foreign direct investment. Across the UK, Chinese companies play an important role in local economies, including Jingye Steel (Teesside), Envision AESC (Tyneside) and Geely (West Midlands). Financial sector links are also important, generating £1.3 billion in exports to China in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, economic benefits have often not lived up to expectations. Interviewees reported that UK exports to China fell in 2023 and 2024, remaining below the 2019 level. China accounts for only 0.2% of the UK’s total inward investment stock. Interviewees also reported that promised investment from sister-city relations often did not materialise. Chinese business delegations would visit without substantive results, or mooted investments did not pass due diligence. Investment was more often in real estate than industry, although the West Midlands was mentioned by one interviewee from a city China partnership organisation as securing important investments. Supporting local companies with business in China has also not been straightforward. A city council interviewee stated: “Large multinationals do not need our help, and smaller businesses often struggle with the expense of getting started, which we are not able to help with”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors account for this. British sentiment towards the China business opportunity has see-sawed between excess optimism and excess pessimism. Often, those dealing with China have found it hard to distinguish between aspirational Chinese expressions of interest and specific opportunities. At times, the UK has underestimated the importance Chinese counterparts place on signing memorandums of understanding, and overestimated the importance placed on completed deals. Those involved have lacked sufficient appreciation of the divide between British and Chinese culture, in government and business, and how to bridge it. However, China’s leadership in electric vehicles and other technologies is now raising fresh hopes. An interviewee from one city talked also of tech start-ups set up by Chinese students graduating from the local university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s economic challenges, several interviewees identified a recent increased focus by Chinese counterparts on practical commercial outcomes. There was, however, still frustration that Chinese contacts often emphasised formalism over substance: “We often find that the group photo is of the most interest”, said one interviewee working on inbound investment. Many local authorities still lack the capabilities to successfully navigate China’s distinctive context and engage with the right individuals: “Finding the right people to deal with in China is more difficult than in any other country”, said one city council interviewee. “We organised a week of activities for a visiting delegation, and they only told us at the end that the week was interesting but not really their main focus”. Conversely, at their best, twinning relations provide an invaluable way to navigate these issues: “Our close relationship meant we had access across all departments in the Chinese city, not just through the Foreign Affairs Office”, said a county council interviewee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities with other countries have risen in priority – the result of China’s slower growth, its perceived risks and challenges, and geopolitics. “Before Covid, we saw lots of investment, but post-Covid we’ve not visited China; the focus has been on India. Companies also hesitate to emphasise exports to China – the market is intensely competitive and IP protection concerns are still there”, said one city council interviewee. Several interviewees perceived China had not ranked highly in the priorities of the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), and said companies were drawing conclusions from that, even though China remains a priority market for some (although not all) DBT sector teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;education-and-research-cooperation&quot;&gt;Education and Research Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees from local authorities repeatedly mentioned the importance of Chinese students to local universities and colleges and to the local economy. There are over 150,000 Chinese studying across the UK, representing an important source of university income. Several interviewees also highlighted how Chinese university alumni help create opportunities for the future. Partnership collaboration between universities in sister-cities was another consistent theme. Some cities are home to universities with campuses in China – notably, Liverpool (Xi’an Jiaotong campus in Suzhou), Nottingham (Ningbo) and Belfast (Queen’s University CQC joint centre with China Medical University in Shenyang).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic links have influenced sister-city relations. Under pressure to end its twinning with Ningbo as a result of China’s implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Nottingham City Council voted to retain links, considering Nottingham University’s Ningbo campus. Conversely, Newcastle terminated its relationship with Taiyuan, following lobbying to de-twin over Xinjiang and China’s sanctioning of a Newcastle University academic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interviewees mentioned changing attitudes towards academic research cooperation. The National Security and Investment Act 2021 and heightened media attention have both made universities “hugely hesitant” on research cooperation with China, stated one interviewee working on economic development. The perceived complexity and ambiguity of due diligence and approvals on potential security risks is discouraging engagement. Another city council interviewee mentioned a Chinese delegation that expressed interest in visiting a university’s innovation centre. The university concluded the simplest route was to host a reception in the foyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-chinese-community-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;The Chinese Community in the UK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 census identified 445,000 people across England and Wales identifying as ethnically Chinese, with London accounting for around half, and significant Chinese communities in Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, Bristol, Sheffield, Cambridge, Milton Keynes and elsewhere. Since the launch of the Hong Kong BN(O) visa scheme in 2021, around 144,000 people have arrived in the UK under the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In numerous cities, interviewees mentioned the positive, important role played by the local Chinese community in engaging with China, in suggesting and facilitating sister-city ties, and in maintaining cultural, educational and economic relations. Initiatives to mark Chinese festivals and spread awareness of Chinese culture were mentioned, as were themes of inclusion and anti-racism. These activities do not of themselves necessitate involvement from China. There are, of course, diverse perspectives within the Chinese community on China. Interviewees observed that it was for local Chinese community and welfare associations to determine how they engage with local consulates and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of Hong Kong BN(O) visa holders was repeatedly cited as changing how local authorities view engagement with China. A city council interviewee said, “There is an increasing diversity of views in the local Chinese community between those who have been here a long time; recent arrivals from China; and recent arrivals from Hong Kong”. For many local politicians, “there is a lack of understanding of BN(O) issues which leads to fear on how to deal with them,” observed one interviewee. He added, “Human rights are more and more the top thing in politicians’ minds re China”. Another city council interviewee observed that “there are increasing divides in the local Chinese community. Our political leaders don’t want to take sides”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-in-the-role-of-twinning&quot;&gt;Evolution in the Role of Twinning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twinning provided the starting point for UK–China subnational engagement, and remains important, with China as with other countries. But China and the world have changed. At one extreme, one interviewee at a large local authority observed, “we have a friendship agreement, but we don’t service it all. Engagement has moved on.” City networks such as the C40 Climate Action group and the World Cities Culture Forum offer broader-based mechanisms for sharing learning and for engaging on the global stage, including with Chinese cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic logic also leads most larger authorities to combine continued sister-city activity with an approach that takes in other major Chinese cities. Local businesses see opportunities across the whole of China, not just in one place. Inward investment agencies seek investment from everywhere. Universities want to attract students from across China, and their alumni return home to live all over China, providing a basis for future relations and economic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-the-preparedness-of-uk-local-authorities-to-engage-effectively-with-china&quot;&gt;IV. The Preparedness of UK Local Authorities to Engage Effectively with China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees highlighted strengths and weaknesses in how well prepared local authorities are to make the most of opportunities with China, while addressing risks and managing China’s own subnational diplomatic agenda. China’s distinctive economic, cultural and political environment makes this more challenging than with many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than either ignoring China or being overly enthused by warm overtures, local authorities need to assess realistically the scale and nature of their own China opportunity and the associated challenges and risks. They need to be clear about both their own objectives and those of their Chinese counterparts, separating those aspects where interests are complementary and those where they may be at odds or pose a challenge. In other words, councils need to translate the UK’s stance of “cooperation, competition, and challenge” to the local level. They then need to have the capabilities to turn this opportunity into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some local authorities have built up an extensive track record of doing this. This experience should be shared more systematically across the UK. However, historical challenges remain, and new challenges have entered the equation. Resourcing levels need to be justified by a cost-benefit analysis of the risks and returns. Concerns related to security and values need to be addressed with appropriate support. Questions about the UK’s overall China stance currently add to uncertainty and caution at local authority level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter outlines three areas of strength on which local authorities can build, and three challenges which need to be addressed to ensure effective engagement with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;areas-of-strength&quot;&gt;Areas of Strength&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent decades have seen extensive local authority engagement with China, even if economic benefits have often disappointed. These efforts provide a good foundation for the future, based in: the practical experience of key individuals who have navigated the ups and downs of working with China; lessons on effective structures and ways of working; and the relationships, reputation and outcomes resulting from engagement to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience Built up Over a Long History of Relations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The depth of China-related experience that most interviewees had accumulated over many years is striking. Most too remained committed and enthusiastic about continuing involvement with China. Several had found ways to hold on to China responsibilities as their job role changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These individuals are well placed to judge how to realise China-related opportunities and avoid pitfalls. They understand the cultural context – for example, around meeting orchestration and gift-giving – and how to bridge different perspectives on the UK and Chinese sides. This commitment brings with it a positive belief in and enthusiasm for the benefits of engagement in business, education, sport and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are, however, far from naive about the objectives of Chinese counterparts and the context in which they are working. Interviewees raised issues of security and values. One city council interviewee queried a visiting delegation’s request to visit a semiconductor plant when bundled together with a series of otherwise civic interests. Several mentioned conducting due diligence on individuals before meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many have experience of sharp interventions by Chinese diplomats, described by one city council interviewee as “bullying”, often related to Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights. They judge when to stand firm and push back, accepting, if necessary, when the Chinese side decides not to take part. One city council interviewee observed, “The local work with the Confucius Institute was focused on culture, art and other non-political matters and so was always very friendly. But once, the role of the Party was mentioned and the atmosphere changed sharply. Completely different tone. I realised that this was beneath the surface the whole time”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proven Structures and Approaches for Engaging Effectively&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustained activity with China on a significant scale needs more than a handful of committed individuals. It requires the right organisational structures and ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most successful approaches have been holistic in nature, making links between economic, cultural, education and other activities. Interviewees revealed a range of models, all with cross-sector participation. These include China partnerships with council involvement, working groups organised and led by the council, and membership organisations that remain in contact with council officials. In the case of Manchester, at the forefront of strong China relations, there was an explicit decision from the start to take a holistic approach rather than lead with trade and investment. This resulted in the Manchester China Forum, “the city-region’s special purpose vehicle for driving forward the Greater Manchester – Greater China relationship”. The Liverpool China Partnership (LCP), the Leeds China Task Force (mentioned by an interviewee) and the Bristol &amp;amp; West of England China Bureau are other examples. The LCP was set up by Liverpool City Council in 2015, as a legacy of the UK government’s 2014 International Business Festival, to expand Liverpool and the city-region’s business, academic and civic partnerships with China. It currently has more than 20 member organisations from the public, private, higher education and health sectors. In these structures, the local authority’s role is to enable and facilitate local stakeholders rather than seeking to “do” everything. Broadening activity to a wider group spreads the resource load, aligning effort and incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These structures are evolving. Attracting inward investment is increasingly the remit of organisations such as MIDAS (Greater Manchester) and the West Midlands Growth Company. For these agencies, China is just one source of investment, albeit a potentially important one. Agencies require their own China capability, but benefit too from a continued holistic approach, as do city councils, which remain a key driver of civic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities have also adapted their ways of working to changing circumstances. Several interviewees noted the increased role and value of ceremonial positions in meeting with Chinese counterparts. “We arranged the meeting with the Lord Mayor when the council leader declined”, said one city council interviewee. Another city council interviewee said: “Lord Mayors are a very interesting part of our armoury. They don’t have decision-making power, but their ceremonial role fits well with Chinese expectations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relationships, Reputation and Outcomes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustained local authority efforts have established warm relationships and strong reputations in China for those authorities and have demonstrated the ability to deliver outcomes. While Manchester receives consistent mentions, many others have also been active, including Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, the City of London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manchester’s sister-city relationship with Wuhan has served as an anchor to unlock relations with other cities, including Shanghai, Chengdu and Nanjing. The Manchester China Forum states that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chinese firms have invested in projects with a development value more than £6bn in the region. Notable projects include the Far East Consortium investment into the £1bn Northern Gateway project and the £1bn Airport City development involving Beijing Construction and Engineering Group as a major equity partner. … direct connectivity between Manchester and … [airports in China] allows enhanced links between the city-region as well as the wider Northwest of England and Greater China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Liverpool China Partnership reported that through it, Liverpool has developed partnerships in Xi’an, Kunming, Chengdu, Qingdao, Tianjin and Jinan, beyond its sister-city relationship with Shanghai. It has built on university cooperation in Suzhou, Kunming and Shanghai and in its international leadership in sports science and maritime, its football prowess and local businesses keen to expand in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheffield too has a long history with China, dating back to a sister-city agreement with Anshan in 1983. In 2010, the Sheffield–Chengdu twin city relationship was formally signed. While one high-profile investment deal fell through, there were benefits in the business and education sector. According to one city council interviewee, local universities have a disproportionately high percentage of international students from Chengdu and the wider Sichuan province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-to-address&quot;&gt;Challenges to Address&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local authorities face evolving challenges in engaging with China. Although councils have always lacked the scale and resources of their Chinese counterparts, these constraints have become tighter. Security concerns and political and media attention have also increased. As a result, local politicians and officials are less willing to leave China matters to those few individuals with extensive China experience. However, they also lack both the security training and China-related experience to assess thoroughly the balance of opportunity and risk. In this shifting, uncertain landscape, interviewees repeatedly called for clearer direction from the UK central government on the specifics of working with China and the need to strengthen China capabilities at local authority level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Issues of Scale and Resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale imbalance between British cities and their Chinese counterparts has been present from the start. Sheffield, with a population of just over half a million, is twinned with Chengdu, with a population of nearly 10 million. British cities naturally struggle to match the resource levels of their sister-cities. While local government funding pressures date back to the early 2010s, they have continued to tighten, limiting engagement with China. China-related activities necessarily compete for resources with other calls on spending, and need to demonstrate strong, tangible expected returns based on a thorough cost-benefit analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced activity during and since Covid-19 has also had an impact. In the words of one city council interviewee, “there’s been a loss of institutional memory. We used to know how to do these things well [meeting with delegations from China]. We need to bring that back”. An interviewee working in a national organisation said, “We do see some loss of muscle memory [on how to engage with China]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responding to the Changed Context at Local Authority and National Levels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increased political and media salience has changed decision-making. Whereas many decisions were previously left to those working directly on China, typically with greater China knowledge, local political leaders and senior officials now want to be more involved. This means that the individual preferences and priorities of council leaders play a more important role in what happens regarding China; some choose to focus elsewhere. It also necessitates broader communication with and education of those with limited China experience who now make many China-related decisions. “We often don’t have enough maturity and understanding of China and of what we want to get out of it”, stated one interviewee involved in a city China partnership. An interviewee from an economic development agency said, “All too often, people don’t know what they don’t know”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing security concerns and the associated legislation have also reduced local authority appetite. While universities and companies are more directly affected, councils pick up on the sentiment around them. Simply not engaging is seen as simpler and safer than addressing actual risks and complying with security legislation. “China is often put in the ‘too difficult’ box”, said a city council interviewee. “People need some reassurance that not everything is a security risk, and it can be managed”, observed one interviewee working in a national organisation. There is a need for training on security awareness and assessment and for easy-to-access central support. While one interviewee working in a city council mentioned the usefulness of existing UK government support, another reported relying on Google and third-party software for due diligence on visiting delegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns weigh even more heavily given China’s slower economic growth and accompanying media reports, unmet expectations in the past and the emergence of new opportunities in India, ASEAN and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addressing Ambiguity About UK–China Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees consistently voiced a desire for greater clarity on the UK’s overall China strategy, citing two aspects: specific guidelines about where activity is encouraged and where it is not, with consistent “joined-up” messaging across departments; and easy access to “lines to take” that reflect current Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO) policy positions on key themes in the UK–China relationship. Some also looked for political “cover” from ministers and support against media pressures in situations where the local authority engages with China in line with national policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current climate has created a risk-averse culture at local level, such that it is likely that some attractive opportunities are being missed. Interviewees observed that local political leaders and officials often found it simpler to not pursue discussions as they could not judge what was encouraged and what was not. “We were approached by a Chinese company about investment. But is this something that central government welcomes? We just don’t know”, said one city council interviewee. Another observed, “We would like some guidance on how we do energy transition and the role of China within that”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those authorities with extensive China activity also called for clearer communication, apart from the City of London, which benefits from its proximity to central government. One interviewee from such an authority said: “We get mixed messages. DBT says ‘Engage!’. The security services say, ‘Don’t engage!’”. Another noted that communication takes time to have an impact: “I see a lag of months or even longer between what the UK government is saying and doing on China and what is being picked up and acted on at the local level. Maybe what we’re seeing now is the effect of the past couple of years working through locally. These things take time to shift”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interviewees also called for simpler ways to get up-to-date FCDO position statements on key China matters. This helps, for example, to prepare mayoral and council leaders when speaking on China. One city council interviewee said, “People think they understand [UK China policy] but they may be a year out of date”. Others, such as interviewees from Edinburgh, Leeds and the City of London, highlighted the quality and responsiveness of existing FCDO support. Core Cities UK’s International Coordination Group also received high praise as a mechanism for sharing experience and communicating with FCDO. Beyond communication, some called for national government to provide leadership and political cover. “There is a lot more we could do with China, but we need some political cover. If we as a council do something, will any minister stand up and say that it’s OK if the media starts questioning?”, asked one county council interviewee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inherent geopolitical uncertainty remains a challenge. “With the current uncertainty, why would I start investment discussions with China? These can take years to come to fruition and I don’t know if UK policy will change again to line up with the Americans”, said one interviewee from an economic development agency. “Who knows where we will be in five years? China may be our new best friend again by then”, said an interviewee from a city China partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-conclusion-and-actions&quot;&gt;V. Conclusion and Actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening the UK’s subnational efforts needs to start with greater clarity on the objectives, scale and scope of this activity. It also requires a clear assessment of where China’s own objectives are complementary and where they pose risks. Implementation then requires a series of actions at both national and local levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on subnational diplomacy in other countries highlights the need to monitor activity, ensure coordination and consistency of approach, identify best practices and put in place national and regional support structures. For example, the US State Department established a Subnational Diplomacy Unit in 2022. Its mission is to “lead and coordinate the State Department’s engagement with mayors, governors and other local officials in the United States and around the world … to bring the benefits of U.S. foreign policy, such as jobs, investments, innovative solutions, and international experiences, to the local and state level. It supports U.S. national security priorities by integrating local ideas into foreign policy and fostering connections among cities, municipalities, and communities in the United States and abroad”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees suggested a series of actions at local authority and UK government level to make local activity more effective and more resilient. The first step, however, is to determine and articulate the role of local authorities in the UK’s overall China diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the UK’s subnational diplomacy is almost entirely bottom-up in nature, determined by local priorities and interests, although influenced by the state of the overall UK–China relationship. Numerous interviewees requested explicit UK government guidance on the role it sees for local authority engagement with China and how it can complement and reinforce the UK’s approach to China. They argue that the UK as a whole would benefit from a more coordinated approach. “Central government needs to recognise that local government can be an effective delivery agent for its foreign policy … It can be less complicated than at the national level”, said one interviewee on a county council. Another city council interviewee stated that “there is lots of talk these days about city diplomacy. And we could play a more effective role. We need better guidance on how the FCDO sees the role of cities and where we can contribute”. A third city council interviewee argued that “major cities can play a bigger role in economic diplomacy”. These comments have echoes of China’s approach to subnational diplomacy, delineating specific areas of complementarity. This does not, however, represent a call for top-down mandated action that might itself undermine the “less complicated” nature of subnational engagement and be inconsistent with the role of different levels of government in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While interviewees seek guidance, they also seek involvement. The best approach is an interactive process where local authorities, devolved administrations and the UK government share views on the way forward. Organisations such as Core Cities UK, Key Cities and the Local Government Association can also serve as mechanisms for engaging with cities and councils. One suggestion was to translate specific sector or topic priorities agreed at a UK–China level (such as climate or renewables) into local authority initiatives with Chinese counterparts. These may then warrant central or local funding, helping address resource constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations resulting from this research fall into two areas: establishing a UK-wide framework; and pursuing effective and resilient engagement at local authority level, based on local assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establish-a-uk-wide-framework-for-local-authority-engagement-with-china&quot;&gt;Establish a UK-Wide Framework for Local Authority Engagement with China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its very simplest, the main factor holding back local authority engagement with China today is the widespread judgement that, all things considered, the benefits of engaging do not outweigh the risks and the costs. Changing this would require greater clarity of direction from the UK government and increased support to the building of “China capabilities” at local level, followed by local authority action, appropriate to their own situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UK-wide framework for local authority engagement with China would have substantial value. It would create an overview of activity, improve information flow, provide coordinated guidance on UK–China policy and help build China capabilities locally. This in turn will enable sustainable local authority engagement based on better local assessments of opportunities, risks and priorities and more effective implementation. There are four areas for action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish the structure and processes for a UK-level overview of local authority engagement with China (and, potentially, other countries).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Gaining full value from local authority engagement while remaining aware of risks requires better oversight, coordination and information; the list of UK–China twinning arrangements, for example, is currently maintained by China’s CPAFFC rather than by the UK government. There are a range of organisational forms that would achieve this: a small China-focused unit that maintains contact with major cities and city networks on specific UK–China initiatives; an actor-agnostic unit that supports local authority resilience in relations with all countries; or a unit with a broader remit similar to the US State Department’s Subnational Diplomacy Unit, playing a role in relations with all countries. This unit might also facilitate contact between local authorities and the UK government’s presence in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide local authorities with greater clarity and granularity on what the UK’s China policy means for the specific decisions they face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Guidance should articulate areas where engagement is supported and where it is not. It should provide clarity, without imposing or mandating, on the role that local authorities can play in UK–China relations and where there is UK government (or devolved administration) support for local initiatives. It should avoid mixed messages coming from different departments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide and/or orchestrate the delivery of training and experience-sharing sessions to strengthen China capabilities across local authority leadership, not just among those working on a regular basis with China.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Topics should include the objectives of China’s own subnational diplomacy; practical considerations in engaging and negotiating successfully with Chinese counterparts (such as conducting due diligence on visiting delegations); awareness, assessment and mitigation of potential security concerns and support available; and success stories and challenges to date. Beyond formal training, the UK government can help facilitate regular networking and experience-sharing across local authorities. While there is no one “best way” to work with China, there remains value in putting together a “playbook” that summarises local authority experiences with China, including best practice case studies and pitfalls to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure consistent, persistent communication on all aspects of UK–China policy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The main priority for local authorities is naturally their own locality. Even on the international front, China does not currently rank high on the priority list. This results in large part from how local authorities judge the UK government’s own priorities. Changing perceptions and ensuring key messages are “received” takes time, persistence and effort. Communication needs to be tailored accordingly. The FCDO should also ensure there are clear rapid-response contact points that provide updated information on an as-needed basis regarding “lines to take” on key aspects of UK–China policy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pursue-effective-and-resilient-engagement-at-local-authority-level-based-on-local-assessment&quot;&gt;Pursue Effective and Resilient Engagement at Local Authority Level Based on Local Assessment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current UK–China “re-engagement” presents an opportunity for local authorities to take a fresh look at China, based on local assessment and drawing on best practices and lessons learned. They can take action in seven areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop their own explicit case for engagement (or not) based on a cost-benefit analysis compared with alternatives.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The core opportunities will typically be economic in nature, including benefits to the education and tourism sectors. The case should draw on local assets that are of distinctive appeal to China (including economic, educational and cultural) and previously established relationships and reputation. It should identify where sister-cities offer the most attractive route and where a broader, multi-city approach to China is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct a local risk and resilience assessment, drawing on UK government guidance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This should identify the potential risks of engaging alongside the benefits. Risks include security exposures (such as in technology) and the potential for excessive dependence on China that may be used coercively (such as in relation to Taiwan matters). Local authorities should then develop a risk and resilience plan to monitor and mitigate these risks, including through training and awareness sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop structures to engage with Chinese counterparts in a holistic, cross-sector and cost-effective way (including civic, cultural and other people-to-people initiatives) while keeping a clear focus on tangible returns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Learn from and adapt partnership approaches that bring together local stakeholders with China-related interests and enable resource-sharing (following the model used in, for example, Manchester, Liverpool and Belfast).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore opportunities to pool efforts and/or engage with China via or in coordination with larger authorities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While China will always operate at a larger scale, scale also matters for the UK, enabling a critical mass of China expertise, opening new funding possibilities and allowing for larger opportunities, potentially more attractive to China. England’s combined authorities present new options for engaging with China at a larger scale, as they operate on a larger scale with larger budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make judicious use of on-the-ground resources in China of the UK government and devolved administrations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The British Embassy, consulates and representatives of the devolved administrations based in China have extensive, relevant, on-the-ground experience. Travel budget constraints increase the value of good connections between local authorities and these in-China capabilities, although here too, resources are stretched, and clear priorities are important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a resource-constrained environment, prioritise the forms of engagement with China that bring most value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Chinese counterparts will be focused on their objectives. Local authorities should be equally firm in pursuing theirs and not waste time out of misjudged politeness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage senior council officials and councillors to participate in China capability-building sessions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These should cover the context of China and UK–China relations, the opportunities and the risks and the lessons learned, with explicit consideration of the economic, security and values dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK and China collaborate more closely on areas of mutual benefit, local authorities are well positioned to play an important role. The specifics are for local authorities to decide, drawing on experience from across the UK. But clarity is also needed on how local activity contributes to overall China policy. There is a need for enhanced communication, information-sharing, oversight and the strengthening of China capabilities across the UK. Maintaining a nuanced and current understanding of how China approaches subnational diplomacy across the UK is also important. Here, there would be value to further research the role that Hong Kong plays and how China engages with the devolved administrations. All this can help overcome current risk aversion, enable better assessment of opportunities and risks to security and values, and ensure effective implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Zelensky’s visits to Washington, DC on 28 February ended with mixed reactions - disappointment in the West and satisfaction in Russia. Consequently, European leaders gathered in London on 2 March to reassess the outcome of the meeting between the two presidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commentary argues that Europe is only looking at its own back yard when it comes to security. The global security threats encompass both Russia (frontline Europe) and China/Russia/North Korea (frontline Japan). As former Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stated: “Ukraine Today may be East Asia Tomorrow.” This has not changed and this is why the ranking of the contributors to Ukraine since the Russian invasion ranges from the US, the EU, Germany, the UK also to Japan. Japan recognises its wider role in European security based on the shared values with its western partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In East Asia, Japan is supporting global security by holding up the alliance with the US - yet this is completely absent from the Western discussions. This is not about Japan interceding for Europe with the US but making sure the US stays engaged with regard to its global security role, one that includes Europe and East Asia. This commentary examines the strategic importance of maintaining global order by “bridging the two sides of the continent” and explores Japan’s role in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this author heard from a few participants to the Munich security conference in February, everything was about Russia, with little attention given to China. However, on a global scale, Europe remains committed to the Indo-Pacific region. France, for instance, has deployed the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier strike group for CLEMENCEAU 25, conducting multinational exercises with the US and Japan in the South China Sea and making port calls in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that Europe and Japan share common values and interests in upholding the global rules-based order. While the US under the Trump administration primarily focuses on competition with China, the question that arises is - what role can the US allies on both sides of the continent play?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-space-that-follows-pax-americana&quot;&gt;The Space that Follows Pax Americana&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Japanese Ambassador to the US, Koji Tomita, wrote in the Nikkei on 3 March, “The inconvenient truth of Trumpism is the end of Pax Americana. The US may have the capabilities, but its willingness to support global stability is eroding.” History has shown that, in the absence of a balance of power, vacuums are inevitably filled. If this is the case they are likely to be filled by China and Russia. Professor Kent Calder of Johns Hopkins University echoed this sentiment in the same article, stating, “As the US retreats from maintaining world order, the national interests of Europe and Japan are increasingly aligned, and Japan’s role in Eurasia will only grow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hints of this evolving role can be found in the US-Japan summit statement from 7 February. Despite concerns over President Donald Trump’s hard-liner stance on Japan, PM Shigeru Ishiba’s first visit to Washington, DC was ultimately deemed successful, resulting in a joint statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key takeaways for Europe from the US-Japan Joint Statement indicate how the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a “new golden age” of US-Japan relations, promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific while contributing to global peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement included strengthening bilateral security and defence cooperation, emphasizing the importance of the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, reaffirming the alliance as a cornerstone of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, based on shared common values. Japan reiterated its commitment to enhancing its defence capabilities, a move welcomed by the US. This includes expanding US commitments beyond military cooperation with efforts to bolster the US-Japan alliance, through: industrial collaboration; increasing bilateral military presence in Japan’s Southwest Islands; enhancing defence readiness through joint exercises; and strengthening defence industrial cooperation with co-production and co-development of defence technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget economic benefits; the US president likes a “deal”. The leaders acknowledged the critical role of economic cooperation in their alliance by fostering economic ties and technological cooperation, committing to increased bilateral investment, industrial collaboration in cutting-edge technologies such as AI and semiconductors, and joint efforts to counter economic coercion. They also announced plans to strengthen energy security by expanding US liquefied natural gas exports to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multilateralism-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Multilateralism in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of their cooperation, the two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation among like-minded countries, including Japan-Australia-India-US (Quad), Japan-US-South Korea, Japan-US-Australia, and Japan-US-Philippines. The two leaders reaffirmed their opposition to China’s militarization in the South China Sea, expressed concerns over North Korea’s missile program, and emphasized the strategic importance of peace across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underscoring Japan’s role in maintaining global stability, particularly in countering aggressive actions by China, Russia and North Korea, it is clear that a strong Japan also contributes to European prosperity. Given these developments, Europe should recognize and leverage Japan’s unique strategic position and Japan’s role in bridging Europe and the US. Japan wants to help maintain the balance between two sides that might not always agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three key points to consider: First, Japan is the only Indo-Pacific nation with both the will and capacity to act as a bridge between Europe and the US. To support Ukraine effectively, Europe should adopt a global strategic perspective that includes Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Japan faces three authoritarian adversaries – China, Russia and North Korea – positioning it as a frontline observer and deterrent against Russian actions in the “Eastern Front”. As such Japan is a strategic watchtower, whose role can enhance security coordination with Europe. Therefore, Europe should work alongside Japan to ensure sustained US engagement in global security. Japan, in fact, is a vital ally in the wider relationship between the US and Europe, beyond the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, without strong US commitment, neither peace in Europe nor stability in the Northwest Pacific can be guaranteed. Historically, US support was crucial in conflicts such as World War II and the Falklands War. The US has been the essential link between Europe and Japan, fostering peace and prosperity. Thus, in order to counter the rise of authoritarian states, Europe and Japan must continuously cultivate and strengthen their alliance with the US. Maintaining alliances requires ongoing effort – like a garden, it must be nurtured and cared for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s strategic alignment with Europe presents a unique opportunity to reinforce global stability. By strengthening its role as a bridge between Europe and the US, Japan can help maintain a balanced world order. Keeping this in mind – and if we talk about a value-based alliance – it would be fitting for Europe to invite Japan to the table for the discussion on Ukraine. As geopolitical challenges intensify, fostering this trilateral relationship will be critical for ensuring peace, security, and prosperity across the globe. Europe needs to recognize Japan’s role in maintaining stability and the value based global order.&lt;/p&gt;

Four existing regional frameworks should be adapted for this purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national security of the United States has long benefitted from its vast and unrivaled global network of allies and partners. This network will be even more important in a more competitive, multipolar world. Nowhere is this truer than in the Indo-Pacific region, where the strategic competition with China for the twenty-first century is taking shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report identifies two issues that have historically undermined multinational strategic planning between the United States and its closest allies: (1) an overreliance on ad hoc bilateral frameworks, and (2) outdated, insular practices. Improving this situation will require a renewed focus on the four factors that underpin successful multinational strategic planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic alignment on the purpose and priorities of a particular multinational grouping;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared institutions that allow effective communication and coordination between individuals and organizations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interoperability between partner militaries that allow them to effectively fight alongside one another; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal factors such as a consultative leadership style and strong relationships between U.S. personnel and their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report applies these principles to four existing multinational frameworks: the Military Framework, AUKUS, Five Eyes, and the Quad. It argues that if these frameworks can be adapted with these four principles in mind, these bodies have plenty of unused potential to improve the United States’ approach to multinational strategic planning in the Indo-Pacific. The report ends with policy recommendations designed to help Department of Defense leaders act on these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also features an appendix of four detailed historical case studies of multinational strategic planning. These cover planning in peace and war, including in (1) the First Gulf War, (2) NATO’s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, (3) NATO’s 1950 Medium Term Defense Plan (MTDP), and (4) the 10-nation northern European Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), established in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-winston-churchill&quot;&gt;– Winston Churchill&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the competition for the twenty-first century, the United States has a large advantage over its authoritarian rivals: its friends. Since 1945, the United States has nurtured an unprecedented and unrivaled global network of allies and partners. The second administration of President Donald J. Trump has yet to publish a defense strategy, but if the previous version is any guide, this emphasis on allies and partners will remain. As the 2017 National Defense Strategy from the first Trump administration stated: “Sustaining favorable balances of power will require a strong commitment and close cooperation with allies and partners because allies and partners magnify U.S. power and extend U.S. influence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasingly dangerous and competitive world gives U.S. political and military leaders an urgent imperative to address these issues head on. Nowhere is this truer—or more important—than in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close cooperation with allies and partners requires multinational strategic planning. This means coordinating the military lever of government power with other nations. Getting this right helps the United States make the most of its network of allies and partners to maximize its influence and address perennial issues such as burden sharing among allies. Multinational strategic planning hinges on key factors such as shared priorities, interoperability, and trust. Yet on many of these counts, the United States has been accused of being a poor partner, maintaining outdated and insular practices that have hindered multinational strategic planning. An increasingly dangerous and competitive world gives U.S. political and military leaders an urgent imperative to address these issues head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this truer—or more important—than in the Indo-Pacific region, where the United States faces a “long-term, strategic competition” with China. Washington’s network of alliances and partnerships will be a vital component of the Trump administration’s strategy to deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s challenge to regional stability and global order. These relationships, however, are not self-sustaining; the United States gets out what it puts in. As former Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth put it: “Alliances and partnerships are like gardens: They don’t grow overnight, they must be tended carefully to flourish, and they can wither if they are neglected.” Allies and partners can act as a force multiplier for U.S. policy, as long as the garden is regularly tended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, U.S. leaders have engaged in plenty of gardening to strengthen America’s network of allies and partners across the region. In 2023 alone, the United States forged new force posture and basing agreements with Australia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and South Korea. However, if Washington fails to improve how it cooperates with its closest friends, these agreements will not meet their potential. This will undermine the credibility and potency of the deterrence on which U.S. strategy is founded and degrade the United States’ global influence, reputation, and power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that strengthening alliances by improving multinational strategic planning will require a renewed focus on the fundamentals: strategic alignment from top to bottom, institutions that are multinational by design, enhanced interoperability at all levels, and enduring investment in the personal relationships that underpin the United States’ alliances and partnerships. It examines the actions leaders in the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) can take to transform their approach to multinational strategic planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Allies and partners can act as a force multiplier for U.S. policy, as long as the garden is regularly tended.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report begins by explaining key terms and concepts in the first chapter, as well as this project’s approach. The second chapter then assesses the current state of play of DOD multinational strategic planning, focusing on the Indo-Pacific region. It finds the United States relies too much on ad hoc, bilateral relations rather than multilateral frameworks designed for the job. It also suggests the United States is often a poor partner in multinational strategic planning, displaying undesirable behaviors such as unilateralism, poor communication, and overreliance on military-to-military channels and foreign liaison networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help rectify this situation, the third chapter then examines best practices for successful multinational strategic planning. A literature review is complemented by four case studies of multinational strategic planning in action (with more detailed studies in Appendices A through D). The result is a framework of four key drivers for successful multinational strategic planning: strategic alignment, shared institutions, interoperability, and personal factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final chapter applies these factors to four multilateral frameworks with relevance to the Indo-Pacific: the Military Framework, AUKUS, Five Eyes, and the Quad. These are existing frameworks that are either underutilized or hold broader potential to improve the United States’ approach to multinational strategic planning in the Indo-Pacific. Each framework is analyzed using a SWOT analysis—which considers strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats—based on the four key factors for successful multinational planning. Policy recommendations are then made for each framework. These are designed to help DOD leaders improve U.S. multinational strategic planning in the Indo-Pacific region by making more use of existing frameworks for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-01&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 01&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-terms-and-concepts&quot;&gt;Key Terms and Concepts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter defines the terms “allies and partners” and “multinational strategic planning.” It also explains the project methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Allies and Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms “ally” and “partner” are both used by the U.S. government because they mean different things. The main distinction is whether the United States has signed—and ratified—a formal treaty of alliance with the nation in question. Being in an alliance with another nation, or group of nations, involves a mutual obligation of assistance in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a partner is a state with which the United States has any sort of cooperative security endeavor. This does not require a treaty or include any mutual defense obligation. Partnerships cover a wide variety of relationships including ad hoc coalitions, security communities, and strategic partnerships. This definition reflects that an allied/non-allied binary oversimplifies the question of how states partner in the post–Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multinational-strategic-planning&quot;&gt;Multinational Strategic Planning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is focused on improving U.S. multinational strategic planning with allies and partners. But what is multinational strategic planning? In simple terms, it is coordinating the military lever of government power with other nations. This definition is based on U.S. and NATO doctrine, which define the three key terms in this concept as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multinational:&lt;/strong&gt; “Between two or more forces or agencies of two or more nations or coalition partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic:&lt;/strong&gt; “The level at which a nation or group of nations determines national or multinational security objectives and deploys national, including military, resources to achieve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning:&lt;/strong&gt; “[The] primary means by which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or designated combatant commander arranges for unity of effort and purpose and through which they guide the planning, integration, and coordination of joint operations across combatant command areas of responsibility and functional responsibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conceptual terms, multinational strategic planning is a form of defense cooperation. This covers the full gamut of cooperation between two or more nations on defense issues. Cooperation can range from formal military planning and operations to joint procurement, security assistance, information sharing, or simply high-level coordination between political leaders on military issues. Defense cooperation is often difficult because national defense is the primary function of any government and the ultimate expression of sovereignty. This can lead to political, economic, and military barriers to cooperation. However, if such friction can be overcome, cooperation can lead to a range of important mutual political, economic, and military benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced form of defense cooperation is integration. Defense integration occurs at three levels: strategic, institutional, and tactical. Multinational strategic planning spans all three levels. It is initiated and founded at the strategic level through agreement on shared priorities and threats. It is carried out at the institutional level through shared arrangements (e.g., regular meetings between senior leaders or multinational headquarters) and results in multinational initiatives at the tactical level (e.g., exercises, operations, and common equipment).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;project-approach&quot;&gt;Project Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was designed to combine empirical insights from practitioners and historical case studies with the theory of multinational strategic planning and defense cooperation. It is built on three pillars of evidence gathering: interviews, discussions, and workshops with officials and experts; a literature review on the practice and theory of multinational strategic planning; and four historical case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews, discussions, and workshops were held between June 2024 and February 2025 with around 50 officials and experts from several European and Indo-Pacific nations, including Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Discussions ranged from formal interviews and workshops to informal meetings and conversations. Discussions were conducted under the Chatham House Rule, and all discussants remain anonymous (unless they gave permission to be named).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state of U.S. multinational strategic planning and a framework of key factors were developed based on a literature review of contemporary and historical sources, ranging from media stories to journal articles, books, and primary source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To refine the framework, four case studies were developed: (1) the First Gulf War, (2) NATO’s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, (3) NATO’s 1950 Medium Term Defense Plan (MTDP), and (4) the 10-nation northern European Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), established in 2014.20 In the First Gulf War and ISAF cases, multinational planning was triggered by an armed attack, while NATO’s MTDP and the JEF provide examples of peacetime planning. All four cases exhibit different levels of success or failure from which insights and lessons are drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. Multinational Strategic Planning Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter looks at the current state of play of multinational strategic planning, with a focus on the Indo-Pacific. This region is where much of China’s challenge to U.S. primacy will play out; it is the most important region for U.S. national security and defense. This section begins by examining a range of existing and new initiatives between the United States and its regional allies and partners related to multinational strategic planning. A more discursive take is then presented on how the United States conducts multinational strategic planning with its allies and partners. This discussion is based on research and interviews with officials and experts from allied and partner nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-us-multinational-strategic-planning-initiatives-in-the-indo-pacific-region&quot;&gt;Overview of U.S. Multinational Strategic Planning Initiatives in the Indo-Pacific Region&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States conducts multinational military planning in at least three main ways: (1) highly formalized processes that produce multinational operational plans, (2) high-level consultations aimed at coordination rather than operational plans, and (3) informal exchanges that augment national planning processes with insights into partner-nation assumptions, capabilities, and plans. Table 1 provides examples of bilateral and multilateral initiatives in each category. Some of these are long-standing, while others were established more recently (these are bolded).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;TABLE 1 Examples of U.S. Multinational Strategic Initiatives Focused on the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; NOTE Bold = new or significantly updated since 2021; *Does not yet exist, but the intent to upgrade U.S. Forces Japan to a joint operational headquarters was announced in July 2024; **Focused on the Middle East region but includes several Indo-Pacific allies and partners; ***Formal multinational planning within AUKUS is limited to the trilateral rotational deployment of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered attack submarines under Submarine Rotational Force (SRF) West.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Formal Multinational Planning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold standard for institutionalized multinational defense planning between the United States and its allies is the NATO alliance, which operates two formal multinational planning processes in parallel. Formal multinational planning uses standardized planning processes like the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) that involve dedicated staff from multiple nations and result (in most cases) in written multinational plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no equivalent to the NDPP process in the Indo-Pacific—not least because there is no equivalent to NATO in the region. Neither is there likely to be, given the widespread desire within the region to avoid over-militarizing regional disputes where possible. Instead, the United States has pursued what it calls a “latticework” of bilateral and minilateral agreements in support of a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” The closest arrangements are with U.S. treaty allies including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few multilateral frameworks conduct formal multinational strategic planning in the Indo-Pacific. A standout example is the long-standing trilateral cooperation between the United States, Australia, and Japan, which was updated last year to include “Trilateral Defense Consultations.” This mechanism is designed “to support alignment of policy and operational objectives of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), the Australian Defense Force (ADF), and the United States forces from peacetime to contingency.” It complements activity in recent years to “trilateralize” existing U.S.-Australia planning initiatives by including Japan in activities such as amphibious training, air interoperability, and multi-domain exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More limited examples include activities under AUKUS, a 2021 trilateral agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to equip Australia with a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered attack submarine and enhance cooperation on advanced capabilities. This has included limited trilateral planning through the rotational presence of U.S. and UK submarines in Australia. The United States also leads the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), a large coalition of 46 countries that includes its Indo-Pacific allies but focuses on illicit non-state actors in the Persian Gulf and the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bilateral front, the Republic of Korea/U.S. Combined Forces Command has a combined planning staff, and the two countries were engaged in deepening their bilateral strategic planning for contingencies involving North Korean nuclear use in 2024. The United States is also increasing its ability to conduct such planning with both Japan and the Philippines. In July 2024, Japan and the United States declared their intent to focus on “upgrading Alliance command and control (C2) . . . and enhancing cross-domain operations.” The United States is also upgrading U.S. Forces Japan into a joint headquarters, which would likely enhance its ability to plan with Japan’s joint command. The United States and the Philippines declared their intent to “reinvigorate bilateral planning and coordination efforts” and agree on new basing sites, before agreeing to new bilateral coordination and information-sharing initiatives in 2024. The United States and the Philippines have also recently created the Roles, Missions, and Capabilities Working Group to “ensure more frequent and regular policy and operational coordination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Multinational Coordination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other important bodies are aimed at consultation and coordination rather than formal multinational planning. These initiatives do not follow formal planning processes, lack the dedicated planning staff employed by formal processes, and rarely result in written multinational plans, although they generally do involve the creation of various documents and communiqués. The coordination that occurs in these bodies is also expected to influence formal national-level planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A standout example is the trilateral partnership between the United States, Japan, and South Korea launched at Camp David in 2023. The partnership includes formal multinational planning activity based on a trilateral security cooperation framework, including “senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchange cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bilateral front, the 25th Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue is a regular forum for strategic coordination between the United States and South Korea that complements the formal planning mechanisms associated with the Combined Forces Command. The United States also engages in a range of cooperation initiatives with Fiji, India, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad, despite its more limited original mission, has evolved as a consultative forum for strategic coordination between the United States and three Indo-Pacific allies and partners—Australia, India, and Japan. It facilitates discussions on shared strategic challenges, particularly those posed by China, through not only summits but also ministerial and working-level meetings. Its members have conducted combined maritime security activities through the Malabar naval exercise, although the exercise is not formally linked to the Quad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have also established the International Joint Requirements Oversight Council (I-JROC) as a forum for the vice chiefs of defense in the three allied countries to review joint and combined warfighting concepts as they develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of multinational coordination in the region is the 10-nation intergovernmental group the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The United States is not a member but has been invited to attend ASEAN meetings, including those focused on defense. For example, in November 2024, former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin attended the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) for the fourth time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the newest multinational body for strategic coordination is the Military Framework. This little-known forum is a U.S.-led group of 14 nations for global coordination with its allies in the strategic competition with China, Russia, and other authoritarian powers. It was established in 2016 as an informal mechanism to coordinate, at the military-strategic level, the U.S.-led coalition to counter the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, known as Operation Inherent Resolve. It has recently been repurposed to address the challenges of “great power competition” and “strategic competition,” as described in the 2017 and 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more niche multinational framework is the Five Eyes group, an intelligence-sharing alliance among Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The group grew out of U.S.-UK intelligence cooperation after World War II and became the Five Eyes in 1956—although the agreement was not made public until 2005. Although it does not have a formal planning role, it provides a valuable platform for its five participant countries and undertakes some planning-adjacent activities like its Future Operating Environment 2040 publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Informal Multinational Exchange&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informal multinational exchanges help make national plans work in a multinational context. These activities give the United States insight into the plans and intent of allies and partners—and vice versa. They are not explicitly designed as planning or coordination bodies or exercises but provide important inputs into formal planning processes and strategic coordination activities. The flow of information from these exchanges into planning activities is more organic than in formal processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key avenue for multinational exchange is wargaming, described by several interviewees as a valuable tool for strategic planning. Wargames allow participants to open a dialogue about assumptions and courses of action that might otherwise be untenable (e.g., due to domestic political constraints). These discussions transpose some of the benefits of multinational planning into informal national planning. This value has been demonstrated through the inclusion of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom in the U.S. Globally Integrated Wargame. For example, the United Kingdom has been able to increase its conceptual compatibility with the United States, increasing the likelihood the two countries’ militaries will be able to fight effectively alongside one another. NATO has also used wargaming to similar effect regarding future force design and strategic options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also holds an array of combined military exercises with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. The flagship exercise is the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) maritime exercise, which was established in 1971. RIMPAC 2024 featured 29 nations and included over 25,000 personnel, 40 ships, and over 150 aircraft. Other examples include the trilateral U.S-Japan-Australia Yama Sakura exercise (since 1982), Exercise Valiant Shield on maritime operations (since 2006), and the Large Scale Global Exercise for command and control for combined military activities (since 2021). These exercises provide an opportunity for strategic coordination between the United States and its allies and partners by testing concepts and doctrines against new threats, aligning procedures, and improving interoperability. Last year the U.S. Army’s Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center (JPMRC) hosted its largest Indo-Pacific exercise to date, which included Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-views-of-us-allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;The Views of U.S. Allies and Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important perspective on how the United States conducts multinational strategic planning is the views of the allies and partners themselves. This section summarizes the findings of discussions and workshops with around 50 officials and experts from several European and Indo-Pacific nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall view among allies and partners was consistent: The United States is a uniquely valuable but often frustrating partner who regularly treats allies and partners as an afterthought rather than a priority. Specifically, four themes emerged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Unilateralism and dominance. Some interviewees suggested that the United States exhibits a tendency to plan unilaterally before looping in its allies and partners. The overall impression was that multinational planning is led, instigated, and dominated by the United States—a habit established and perpetuated over many years but one that needs to change soon. U.S. leadership can be overbearing and dominant in multinational forums. The United States does not make its priorities clear, with mixed signals coming from different parts of the vast U.S. system (e.g., the Joint Staff vs. the combatant commands). This ambiguity leads to indecision and gives reluctant allies an excuse to vacillate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor communication. Several interviewees then argued that the United States does not always clearly communicate what is needed from its allies and partners. U.S. information sharing is either nonexistent or happens at the last minute. The perception is that this is a result of bureaucratic impediments (e.g., information-sharing limits) but can also be a tactic to prevent other nations from challenging U.S. decisions. This means foreign liaison officers also lack the opportunity to consult with capitals and offer productive contributions. The United States often does little to address or allow for language barriers, particularly with Indo-Pacific nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Overreliance on military-to-military channels. Several interviewees argued that the United States is too reliant on military-to-military channels for its strategic planning and coordination activities. This often undermines strategic alignment due to a lack of constructive dialogue at the political level. It also makes unilateral planning more difficult because allied and partner militaries can use U.S. ambiguity to their advantage in bureaucratic fights over resources. There is a broader lack of joint upstream strategic and policy analysis—as distinct from military-strategic or military-operational analysis—between the United States and other nations. Doing more of this analysis would provide myriad benefits, including strategic alignment, a shared threat picture, shared assumptions, and collective analysis of common issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Overreliance on ad hoc cooperation and the foreign liaison network. The United States was seen by several interviewees as relying too much on makeshift or ad hoc arrangements rather than preexisting frameworks, which might allow a more systematic and routine approach to multinational planning. The only option for allies is often to use their embedded personnel, such as exchange and liaison officers. Some nations have many more of these than others, spread throughout the DOD enterprise from the Pentagon to the combatant commands. But these personnel are often seen as one of two extremes: as effectively U.S. personnel, or as foreign officers. The former means their contact with and utility to their home nation is restricted; the latter means their contact with and utility to the DOD is restricted. Both are problematic. There was a general sense among interviewees that the DOD needed to adapt its models—or introduce new ones—for the express purpose of making the most of allies and partners in the strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States is a uniquely valuable but often frustrating partner who regularly treats allies and partners as an afterthought rather than a priority.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary-of-the-state-of-play&quot;&gt;Summary of the State of Play&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the United States has introduced plenty of new initiatives with regional allies and partners over the last four years in the Indo-Pacific—but these are chiefly bilateral and informal. There is no dedicated multinational framework for conducting formal multinational strategic planning with allies and partners in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, according to its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific and Europe, the United States talks the talk but does not always walk the walk when it comes to being a good partner. Its closest allies have described several endemic issues regarding U.S. conduct and institutions, including the themes described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this report seeks to offer a remedy to this twin diagnosis of overreliance on bilateral frameworks and poor conduct of multinational strategic planning where it does occur. In order to improve this situation, the first task is to understand what best practice looks like. The next section does this by identifying the key factors for successful multinational planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task is then to apply these factors to a multinational framework. In lieu of an obvious candidate, the literature review identified four existing frameworks involving the United States that could be adapted to this purpose. Two are broadly focused:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Quad&lt;/strong&gt;, which operates at the political level and is focused on Indo-Pacific security; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;__The Military Framework, which is focused on the military-strategic level of global strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two are more narrowly focused:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUKUS&lt;/strong&gt;, which is primarily focused on submarine development and deployment; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Eyes&lt;/strong&gt;, which is focused on intelligence sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final section of the report thus applies the key factors to these four existing multinational frameworks to generate policy recommendations for developing them—and improving the United States’ approach to multinational strategic planning in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-03&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 03&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-four-key-drivers-of-successful-multinational-planning&quot;&gt;The Four Key Drivers of Successful Multinational Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter analyses the factors that influence successful multinational strategic planning. It does so in two parts: a literature review and then four case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part examines the existing literature to reveal the four key drivers of successful multinational planning: strategic alignment, shared institutions, interoperability, and personal factors. Each one is described in Table 2 below. Importantly, as Figure 1 illustrates, these factors are not equal: The most important factor, and the foundation of multinational strategic planning, is the need for strategic alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ TABLE 2 Explanation of Key Factors for Successful Multinational Strategic Planning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of the chapter uses four historical case studies of multinational strategic planning in action to further refine and validate the four drivers identified above. Some of the findings of these case studies are incorporated directly into the preceding analysis of the four drivers, where relevant. This section offers a summary of each case study and the key findings; a detailed version of each case study is available in Appendices A through D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-alignment&quot;&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theory and history suggest strategic alignment is the foundation of multinational strategic planning. It reflects a mutual understanding of the broad intent and purpose of any security partnership, often but not necessarily rooted in a shard worldview and strategic culture. Alignment helps define collective obligations and caveats—such as on when and how force may be used by different nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the First Gulf War, the United States did not undertake any multinational planning until it reached strategic alignment with its coalition partners on whether to pursue the defense of Saudi Arabia (Operation Desert Shield) or offensive operations to liberate Kuwait (Operation Desert Storm). The NATO mission in Afghanistan consisted of countries with decades of experience planning together through NATO mechanisms, but multinational planning grew increasingly dysfunctional as strategic alignment decreased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process and outcome of reaching strategic alignment depends in no small part on the preexisting threat perceptions and military preferences of the states involved: States that already share a common picture of threat and preferences for offensive or defensive use of force find it easier to reach agreement on a defense relationship. For example, the original 12 NATO members formed their alliance in 1949 based on a shared sense of the threat posed by the Soviet Union, and the need for a collective security organization to counter it. Decades later in Afghanistan, NATO consensus on the need to destroy al Qaeda, expel the Taliban, and rebuild Afghanistan, catalyzed by the shock of the September 11 attacks, obscured important disagreements. Despite agreeing on the broad intent and purpose of the war, different preferences regarding the use of military force hindered interoperability, fragmented the coalition, and pushed the war toward unilateral action. In contrast, Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm involved an effective division of labor between military contributors despite their diversity, based on a common perception of Saddam Hussein as a threat to Middle Eastern stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues of identity and culture also matter. A common political identity like the U.S.-UK “special relationship” or common perception of shared historical experiences eases the path to alignment. The 1949 North Atlantic Treaty led to an alliance based on the shared experience of World War II and a desire to avoid a sequel. It was also based on a shared conception of the Euro-Atlantic community among its members, which was part of the appeal to the 20 allies who have joined the alliance since then. Similarly, the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is founded on a shared geography and culture, which has been referred to as the “amphibian, beer drinking nations of northern Europe.” But strategic alignment can be maintained without cultural homogeneity: Political differences caused significant friction between the United States and Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War, but careful diplomacy and the urgency of the Iraqi threat helped overcome those frictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic alignment is difficult to achieve and maintain given differing interests, priorities, sensitivities, risk appetite, and threat perceptions. But perfect strategic alignment is not necessary for effective multinational planning. In the First Gulf War, regional politics made a unified command structure politically impossible, so the coalition designed a bespoke institution—the coalition coordination, communication, and integration center (C3IC)—to allow for operational execution of defensive operations and the more difficult task of planning offensive operations. Equally, the creation of NATO’s 1950 Medium Term Defense Plan (MTDP) was hostage to divergence and disagreement between allies—particularly European allies and the United States. Yet allies adapted their approach, institutions, and leadership to preserve allied unity and agree to the collective plan, which resulted in the 1952 Lisbon Force Goals. These examples suggest divergent strategic preferences can be overcome through active management and institutional design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Shared institutions reinforce habits of cooperation which in turn feed back into the sense of shared purpose and strategic alignment that birthed the institutions in the first place.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-institutions&quot;&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nations often consummate strategic alignment by forming institutions, norms, and rules that inspire and regulate their cooperation. Many of these are formal organizations—such as the NATO alliance—or dedicated arrangements, such as foreign liaison officers or professional military education programs. But others are informal practices or norms that nonetheless shape and enable cooperation. The main institutions considered in this report are planning structures, command and control (C2) systems, and information-sharing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History demonstrates that shared institutions are neither necessary nor sufficient on their own for effective multinational strategic planning, but they do appear impact its quality. In the First Gulf War, for example, the United States conducted strategic planning with Saudi Arabia through a relatively informal joint planning group, but building institutions like the C3IC and deepening liaison networks throughout the war seems to have dramatically improved coalition strategic planning. In Afghanistan, NATO took advantage of its well-developed institutions to ease initial planning, but the United States increasingly bypassed these institutions as they frustrated its leadership. Multinational strategic planning can occur both where institutions are lacking but strategic alignment is high and where institutions are strong but strategic alignment is low, but only the first is likely to result in sustainable, quality planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared institutions for multinational planning can work well whether designed from scratch or adapted from existing institutions. For example, the NATO MTDP process was a bespoke institution that was based on existing NATO bodies. Likewise, the JEF case study is an example of a new institution that was formed from a NATO initiative—the 2014 Framework Nations Concept, which itself was based on NATO’s original Regional Planning Groups—even though it ended up outside alliance structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current and historical institutions for multinational planning exhibit great variety. Some coalitions have fully integrated their command staffs. Others have focused more on coordination of independent command and planning structures. Little work has been done on establishing which are most effective—or what factors make one type of institution more effective than others. The prevalence of tailored institutions in the cases studied here highlights the importance of adapting institutions to the specific—even unique—purposes and politics of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared institutions reinforce habits of cooperation which in turn feed back into the sense of shared purpose and strategic alignment that birthed the institutions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions also have utility beyond their immediate functional purposes. They create their own momentum and inertia. They reinforce habits of cooperation which in turn feed back into the sense of shared purpose and strategic alignment that birthed the institutions in the first place. Much as the value of plans is often found in the planning, the value of institutions is the institutionalization. The ultimate example might be NATO: The habits of cooperation developed over decades led to the alliance enduring and adapting even after its chief adversary and raison d’être collapsed. A more recent example is the JEF, a UK-led group of 10 northern European nations which has developed a range of institutions over the last decade (see Appendix D for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective institutions exhibit “stickiness”: They endure changes in context or politics because they prove their worth. Such stickiness has many benefits for multinational strategic planning. Another recent example where stickiness persists is the 2023 Camp David agreement between the United States, Japan, and South Korea, which has led to 80 meetings and a first trilateral military exercise. The agreement has already spanned two U.S. administrations, with the first meeting under the Trump presidency happening recently in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperable militaries fight together more effectively because they have shared standards for tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), matériel, and information systems. Shared TTPs and doctrine allow militaries to better synchronize their efforts at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Mechanisms that facilitate the flow of information between militaries’ technical systems are also the bedrock of interoperability: Militaries that lack a shared picture of the operating environment or the ability to securely communicate on the battlefield struggle to operate alongside one another. Scholars have also emphasized the role that linguistic and cultural understanding plays in interoperability. Joint training, professional military education, and joint exercises play a major role in aligning militaries and building interoperability, but enormous challenges remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving seamless equipment interoperability is difficult, even for NATO. U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Bill LaPlante argued in 2022 that what NATO truly requires is for its equipment to be interchangeable: for a 155 mm artillery round produced in France to work properly when fired from a U.S. howitzer. The United States is seeking to solve some of these problems by providing military equipment to allies and partners and by deepening its defense industrial integration with its most trusted and capable allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informational interoperability also faces important challenges. One set of institutions that often undermines effective strategic planning is those for sharing information and intelligence. Solving these challenges involves difficult trade-offs between interoperability and security. Some challenges are technical, but others require more extensive intervention, such as linguistic and cultural education. These challenges may even be worsening in some areas. The emerging U.S. architecture for Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) could exacerbate the problem if it is not designed with partner interoperability in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History suggests that a minimum level of interoperability is necessary to undertake multinational strategic planning, and that more interoperable militaries can reach greater heights of such planning. But greater interoperability does not pull countries toward greater multinational planning on its own. During the First Gulf War, interoperability problems between NATO and Arab militaries did not prevent joint operations, although multinational planning seems to have been easiest where interoperability was highest: between the U.S. and Saudi air defense commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability in practice is heavily influenced by strategic alignment. In Afghanistan, the NATO coalition looked good on paper, but national caveats introduced for political reasons prevented allied forces from operating effectively alongside one another. Neither does interoperability solve all problems. The commitment to interoperability by NATO allies in their first strategic concept in 1949 did not prevent the emergence of a “disembodied” approach to strategic planning which hampered the MTDP process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personal-factors&quot;&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual agency and leadership seem to matter in multinational strategic planning. The vital role of personal factors was a common theme among interviewees. History suggests personal factors help reduce friction and overcome barriers to cooperation. Preexisting (and positive) working relationships between leaders at all levels seem to enable better cooperation and coordination between militaries—even if these effects are rarely definitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interoperability in practice is heavily influenced by strategic alignment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of consultative and bold leadership styles also seems best suited to multinational strategic planning. For example, General Dwight D. Eisenhower’s leadership as NATO’s first supreme allied commander was critical to the MTDP process. In the First Gulf War, the strong relationships between General Norman Schwarzkopf’s team and its Saudi counterpart, combined with its “leadership by question” approach, made a big difference to the outcome. The reverse also seems to be true: Poor relationships, toxic leaders, and lack of trust constitute a barrier to more effective multinational strategic planning, as appears to have been the case during NATO’s ISAF mission in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-case-studies&quot;&gt;Historical Case Studies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section uses four historical case studies of multinational strategic planning in action to further refine and validate the four drivers identified above. The case studies include: (1) the First Gulf War, (2) NATO’s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, (3) NATO’s 1950 Medium Term Defense Plan (MTDP), and (4) the 10-nation northern European Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), established in 2014. These four case studies cover multinational strategic planning in peace and at war. All four contain successes and failures from which insights and lessons are drawn. Each case study is summarized here and examined in greater detail in the Appendices A through D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 1: The First Gulf War.&lt;/strong&gt; The First Gulf War was characterized by the successful execution of a plan originally designed by the United States but later adapted and adopted by coalition planners. It faced significant difficulties but overcame them by conducting unilateral planning before strategic alignment was achieved, adopting institutional designs tailored to coalition politics, and taking advantage of common language, doctrine, and equipment where possible. Coalition planners also drew significant benefits from favorable personal factors, including leadership style and personal relations, particularly between U.S. military leaders and their counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This case study supports the finding that strategic alignment is the bedrock of multinational strategic planning. In this case, it helped the United States expand its coalition and incorporate members into a common planning process. It also points to the importance of tailoring shared institutions to the nations and circumstances involved, with a focus on interoperability to enable execution of multinational plans. This case also highlights the need to establish multinational planning structures before a crisis, where possible; doing so could have mitigated many of the planning and operational challenges experienced by the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 2: NATO’s ISAF mission in Afghanistan.&lt;/strong&gt; This case study highlights the challenges to multinational strategic planning faced by ISAF’s mission in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. These occurred despite NATO’s well-established institutions and focus on interoperability. Many of these challenges were due to the pressures working against maintaining strategic alignment across such a large coalition—51 countries contributed troops—and throughout such a long, dynamic campaign. Strategic alignment in such a coalition is a vital and precious commodity that requires continuous, active efforts to maintain beyond the initial “honeymoon period” of a long campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The same goes for shared institutions: In this case, existing NATO institutions provided a strong foundation but required constant adaptation to cope with new coalition members and shifting strategic and operational imperatives. This case also reveals the challenges that arise when multinational planning is dominated by one nation (in this case, the United States). Such structural imbalance can be mitigated by personal factors such as relationships, leadership, and trust—but these tensions can also be exacerbated by the same factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 3: NATO’s 1950 Medium Term Defense Plan.&lt;/strong&gt; The 1950 MTDP was the first major instance of alliance multinational strategic planning in peacetime. As the 1949 Strategic Concept stated: “The essence of our overall concept is to develop a maximum of strength through collective defense planning.” The MTDP put this ambition into practice. While the immediate result was failure—the planning goals were too ambitious for postwar allies to meet and had to be changed—the process was ultimately successful in giving the young alliance a shared goal and project, which played a key role in transforming NATO into a functioning alliance. The formal planning process it established still exists to this day: The NDPP is the engine room of alliance strategic planning and the foundation of NATO’s collective defense.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This case study highlights the importance of strategic alignment, which in the case of NATO laid the groundwork for the alliance based on a common view of the Soviet threat. This led to the North Atlantic Treaty, the (almost) literal foundation of NATO. It also reveals the role of shared institutions. The MTDP provided a formal process for multinational strategic planning which paid dividends: It laid the groundwork for NATO’s longevity and success. It also reveals how political tensions within coalitions are inevitable and unavoidable. The MTDP was replete with examples where fundamental tensions between allies—particularly between the United States and European allies—threatened to fracture cohesion and strategic alignment from within. Yet the same allies—aided and abetted by NATO’s own international staff and leaders like General Eisenhower—recognized these tensions and took steps to proactively manage them through new initiatives, institutions, and enlightened leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 4: The UK-Led Joint Expeditionary Force.&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF is a multinational framework of 10 like-minded northern European nations, led by the United Kingdom. The framework was established in 2014 and over the last decade has played an increasingly important role in European security by taking collective measures to deter Russian aggression, support Ukraine, and secure critical undersea infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The JEF is a prime example of converting strong strategic alignment into shared institutions. This group of allies in a small but vital region shows how relatively homogenous views about common threats, identity, history, culture, and priorities can overcome traditional barriers to multinational cooperation and planning. At the same time, maintaining such an exclusive “in group” also leaves behind an “out group.” For the JEF, this has meant little cooperation with partners in the region but not “in the club,” such as Poland and Germany. The JEF experience also demonstrates how cooperation is a work in progress and takes dedicated efforts to maintain and adapt—you get out what you put in. The JEF has rapidly developed an array of shared institutions that underpin cooperation, including a joint headquarters and staff, a 10-year vision, a detailed policy directive, a constant drumbeat of activity supported by a strategic communications campaign, and a clear brand. It has also adapted its focus over its first decade to meet emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-for-improving-us-multinational-strategic-planning&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations for Improving U.S. Multinational Strategic Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter concludes the report with policy recommendations for DOD leaders to put the principles identified above into practice. It focuses on four multinational frameworks relevant to the Indo-Pacific that are currently underutilized by the United States: the Military Framework, AUKUS, Five Eyes, and the Quad. Each section contains a SWOT analysis of the multinational framework in question—using the four factors for successful multinational strategic planning identified above—and several policy recommendations based on the SWOT analysis. Implementing these recommendations will help DOD leaders improve U.S. multinational strategic planning in the Indo-Pacific region by making more use of existing frameworks for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-military-framework-a-swot-analysis&quot;&gt;The Military Framework: A SWOT Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Military Framework is a U.S.-led forum for global coordination with U.S. allies in the strategic competition with China, Russia, and other authoritarian powers. The framework was established in 2016 as an informal mechanism to coordinate, at the military-strategic level, the U.S.-led coalition to counter the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, known as Operation Inherent Resolve. More recently, the framework has been repurposed to address the challenges of “great power competition” and “strategic competition,” as described in the 2017 and 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategies. The motto of the framework is “Upholding Rules Based Order – Shared Strategic Understanding – Informed Military Advice – Collaboration &amp;amp; Integration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Implementing these recommendations will help DOD leaders improve U.S. multinational strategic planning in the Indo-Pacific region by making more use of existing frameworks for this purpose.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basis of the Military Framework, and its key strength, is the core of like-minded allies who formed the group in the first place. The recent pivot away from countering violent extremist organizations toward its new purpose of strategic competition therefore poses a potential threat to strategic alignment which requires managing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key weakness of the framework is its bias toward Europe (10 out of 14 members are Western European nations). The recent addition of Japan and the proposed addition of South Korea strengthen the global (and Indo-Pacific) credentials of the group. However, expanding the group is also a threat, as its established identity, cohesion, and focus could become diluted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weakness of the Military Framework is the lack of a clear and compelling shared vision. This was less problematic during the framework’s early focus on countering violent extremist organizations, but the shifting focus toward strategic competition has sparked debate over the framework’s purpose and scope. Many cite China as the primary focus. However, an unclassified readout from a meeting between the participating chiefs of defense suggest a wider focus, listing not only the Indo-Pacific but also Ukraine, Russia, and the Middle East. The framework’s motto is even broader still: “upholding rules-based order.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final threat to strategic alignment stems from the problem of group power dynamics—a key issue in all four case studies of multinational strategic planning. Uneven influence, capabilities, resources, and national constraints (e.g., public opinion, legislative constraints, and election cycles) between members creates friction and undermines cohesion. These challenges will require active management and dedicated mechanisms to ensure transparency and maintain cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key strength of the framework is its existing shared institutions. For example, it benefits from a small secretariat based in the Pentagon, embedded liaison officers from member nations, and regular meetings between chiefs of defense. These institutions are dedicated, but they are also minimal and light touch. This is both a strength and weakness: Flexibility comes at the expense of formality. The framework places no obligation on its members to contribute resources (e.g., staff officers, shared intelligence or plans, or even deployed forces to framework initiatives). Even the agreement signed by each member is non-binding. But interviewees raised the problem that this can lead to uneven contributions and strained relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the framework that is a both strength and weakness is its low-profile nature; interviewees described it as “discreet” and “invisible.” This approach reinforces group identity via a sense of exclusivity and enables candor between its members. But it also risks creating a sense of exclusion from non-members which could undermine wider cooperation between the United States, framework nations, and their regional partners. The lack of political awareness within member governments also weakens the framework’s utility and effectiveness. It undermines the group’s supposed commitment to a “whole-of-government” approach. For that reason, one interviewee suggested its low profile was the framework’s “single biggest issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interoperability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military interoperability is a strength of the framework, which its members refined and proved over several years of operations in the Middle East. Most participants use NATO standards and doctrine. But interviews revealed four threats to framework interoperability: (1) language and cultural barriers; (2) a lack of shared awareness of operations, activity, and investments (OAI); (3) insufficient focus on non-state actors (despite the group’s heritage); and (4) the lack of attention paid to emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence, cyber, and quantum technology. AUKUS provides an opportunity to address the latter, given its focus on developing emerging technologies and the fact that all three AUKUS nations—Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—are already framework nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trust and close personal relations between its members has been a key strength of the framework since its inception. As its official history states: “The most precious ‘product’ of the framework is neither tangible nor measurable. It is instead something elusive and sublime: trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leadership of the framework has been a strength and weakness. On the one hand, by leading and hosting the framework, it has invested more than any nation. On the other, U.S. leaders have in some cases been overly demanding and dominant, especially when they saw some nations as not pulling their weight—even if this was due to sensitive national political issues or constraints. This presents an opportunity to take a more transparent and accountable approach to governance, balancing leadership with inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another weakness is insufficient recognition of the need for framework staff to be experts in defense diplomacy, a military profession in its own right. One opportunity to address this is to pick framework staff who have attended professional military educational institutions in the United States or other member countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the Military Framework&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Agree on a collective vision. Military Framework participants should agree to a clear purpose and level of ambition. Doing so would address the threats posed to group cohesion and effectiveness by the lack of clarity around the purpose and focus of the framework. This should specify the unique value the group will provide the United States and its allies within the broad realm of global strategic competition. It should drive clear goals and purposeful activity. The collective vision would be strengthened by each member “renewing its vows” through a long-term commitment to the framework (e.g., 5 or 10 years). Making this vision and commitment in public would boost the low profile of the framework, which is seen as a key weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formalize the operating model. The framework should establish a formal operating model to match the agreed collective vision. This would institutionalize how the framework operates, maintaining flexibility, but no longer at the expense of formality. The model should identify the right decisionmaking approach for the framework (e.g., consensus, opt-in, majority, or non-binding). This should include a mechanism to proactively identify and combat the corrosive political dynamics that can undermine cohesion, such as burden-sharing debates or differing priorities and constraints among participants. The model should include a formal process to share OAI information and coordinate the efforts of framework nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Match membership to purpose. The membership of the framework should be matched to its collective vision and purpose. This must reflect an increased focus on the Indo-Pacific. If the unique value offered by the framework is coordinating the military-strategic aspects of strategic competition, the fact that the locus of this competition is in the Indo-Pacific requires nothing less. This would address a gap in the market that cannot be filled by NATO, Five Eyes, the Quad, or other groups. The framework should find the “Goldilocks” coalition size—not too big, nor too small—and a way to include partners, not just allies, through an informal “14+n” format.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Raise the profile. The profile of the framework should be raised. This would solve several issues related to the lack of political awareness of the framework. This would entail shifting the group’s culture from invisible to visible, discreet to overt. In more practical terms, this also would require developing a clear brand and a strategic communications campaign. A consistent drumbeat of operational activity driven and branded by the framework would make a big difference—the JEF and NATO both provide good examples to follow. This activity should be goal-based, with the goals determined by the collective vision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aukus-swot-analysis&quot;&gt;AUKUS SWOT Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS is a trilateral agreement between the governments of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Signed in 2021, the agreement consists of two pillars. Pillar One is an agreement to support Australia in acquiring a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered attack submarine fleet. In March 2023, the three governments announced a “pathway” toward this goal in three phases: increased visits of U.S. and UK submarines to Australia; delivery of three U.S. Virginia-class submarines beginning as early as the 2030s; and development and delivery of the SSN-AUKUS, a new class of boat based on a UK design. Pillar Two concerns the development of a wide range of emerging and advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS is the perfect storm of strategic alignment: The agreement promises the holy trinity of military (capability and scale), economic (industry and exports), and political benefits (prestige and domestic jobs) to each nation. This is its core strength. However, it is also a potential weakness if it undermines broader alliances or precludes other nations from joining. The expansion of AUKUS to include new members—such as Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea—under Pillar Two would offer an opportunity to add significant expertise in the critical domain of emerging technologies and build on existing bilateral cooperation, such as between the United Kingdom and Japan or the United States and South Korea. But expansion is also a threat to strategic alignment, given that cooperation in larger groups is often less successful due to additional potential points of disagreement and friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ambition of AUKUS has required the development of dedicated, shared institutions. These new and novel institutions have become a core strength of AUKUS. They range from bureaucratic bodies like the Joint Steering Group to much wider shared institutions like the collective aim to “foster deeper integration of security and defense-related science, technology, industrial bases, and supply chains.” One opportunity is to expand the new initiative for coordinating submarine operations—known as Submarine Rotational Force (West)—to the broader task of multinational strategic planning within AUKUS. This would require AUKUS partners to agree to a new shared strategic and operational framework—which is exactly what the United Kingdom and Australia recently committed to do bilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interoperability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability is the primary focus and strength of AUKUS Pillar One. This includes technical and operational aspects. Technical interoperability spans nuclear propulsion systems, sensors and weapons systems, and a common vertical launch system. It also extends to common submarine repair and maintenance facilities. One goal of AUKUS is “integrated submarine forces.” Integration is the deepest form of defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical interoperability that forms the foundation of the AUKUS agreement has also led to new operational arrangements. For example, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to establish a rotational presence of one UK Astute-class submarine and up to four U.S. Virginia-class submarines based in HMAS Stirling in Western Australia under SRF-West. Implicit in this agreement is a need for trilateral strategic planning of submarine operations. One threat to the success of this key element of AUKUS is the emergence of the bad practices identified in Chapter 2 of this report. One opportunity would be to expand the multinational strategic planning already taking place within AUKUS beyond submarine procurement and operations to the coordination of trilateral deterrence activity in the region writ large. Another opportunity would be to include new AUKUS partners—such as Canada, Japan, and South Korea—in such an initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability between advanced technologies is also a focus of Pillar Two. However, while Pillar One is narrow and well focused, the broad scope of Pillar Two is a potential weakness if it lacks focus and undermines the strong AUKUS brand. The threats to Pillar Two are similar to Pillar One, including stringent U.S. export controls and technology sharing. But some of this red tape has already been lifted in Pillar One; for example, new U.S. legislation granted AUKUS an International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) exemption, in what might be termed the “AUKUS effect.” One opportunity is to apply this model to remove known barriers to trilateral strategic planning, such as information sharing and overclassification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key strength of AUKUS is its members’ shared history and strategic culture. They also speak the same language. Military personnel from each nation are well acquainted: They regularly attend each other’s professional military education institutions, and the United Kingdom and Australia have the largest network of U.S. liaison and exchange officers of any ally. Under AUKUS, naval and civilian personnel will undergo an extensive program of training and deployment. Each military will also increase the number of embedded personnel and naval port visits. This strong foundation of personal relationships among the three AUKUS nations presents further opportunity to build out AUKUS as an effective trilateral strategic planning platform, beyond the current focus of submarine development and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for AUKUS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Broaden trilateral strategic planning within AUKUS. The narrow trilateral strategic planning that currently exists within AUKUS could be broadened to focus on coordinating regional deterrence activity. Doing so would build on the strong foundations of AUKUS (across all four factors).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reduce barriers to cooperation. An AUKUS initiative focused on broadening trilateral strategic planning could also benefit from the “AUKUS effect” of reducing red tape and removing barriers to cooperation (such as information sharing and export controls).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include AUKUS partners. An AUKUS initiative focused on broadening trilateral strategic planning could also benefit from the inclusion of partners to maximize coordination and effect. The AUKUS nations have already agreed to consider the addition of at least one partner (Japan) to Pillar Two. The addition of Japan and others—such as Canada, New Zealand, and South Korea—to aspects of AUKUS as partners could also take place within a broader regional deterrence initiative. Keeping any expansion well focused will help minimize any risk of derailing the wider initiative by involving too many participants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;five-eyes-swot-analysis&quot;&gt;Five Eyes SWOT Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance of the United States. Its members share raw and finished intelligence and have (at least tacitly) agreed not to spy on one another. The alliance is an appealing platform for multinational strategic planning due to its high levels of strategic alignment, developed institutions, significant interoperability, and history of favorable personal exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes is notable for its ability to “maintain an ongoing similarity in the worldviews of its members.” This is its foundational strength that allows a global division of labor between member services. Australia and New Zealand, for example, collect intelligence in different parts of Asia; the United Kingdom monitors Europe and western Russia; Canada focuses on eastern Russia, Latin America, and the northern Atlantic and Pacific regions; and the United States collects on the Caribbean, China, Russia, the Middle East, and Africa. Five Eyes members respond to the needs of their partner governments when those partners lack the relevant coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shared similarity of worldviews creates the main opportunity to adapt the Five Eyes as a strategic planning platform. But adapting the intelligence alliance to such a purpose could represent a threat to the strategic alignment that has undergirded its success. Strategic alignment depends on a consensus on the organization’s purpose. Seeking to expand the organization’s purpose could undermine that consensus, particularly because member nations are not completely aligned on how to prioritize global threats, despite their similar worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes has developed a set of institutions that represent a major strength of the alliance. The Five Eyes nations exchange liaison officers, conduct joint intelligence operations, and jointly staff important facilities. The United States also has a classification label allowing release to Five Eyes nations. Unlike other intelligence partnerships, the Five Eyes do not share intelligence on a need-to-know basis or through a barter system, but rather share all intelligence they gather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The endurance and success of Five Eyes owes something to its narrow, institutional focus on intelligence sharing. It was based on U.S.-UK intelligence cooperation during World War II, then slowly and carefully expanded over several decades, becoming the Five Eyes in the 1950s (though this was not revealed publicly until 2005). But this strength is also a potential weakness: Maintaining such a narrow focus might preclude expansion into other areas of common interest. The group has branched out into futures analysis, producing a document entitled Five Eyes Future Operating Environment 2040 in 2018. Although this stretching of its institutions suggests an opportunity for further expansion into strategic planning, adding a dedicated multinational strategic planning role to the Five Eyes group could pose a threat to its existing institutions and track record of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not appear to have prevented the Five Eyes nations from broadening the group in 2013 into the Five Country Ministerial, described as “a forum for the Five Eyes security ministers to meet and discuss opportunities for collaboration,” which suggests an opportunity for similar expansion to include high-level officials focused on international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interoperability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shared institutions of Five Eyes countries are part of what makes high interoperability a major strength. The Five Eyes intelligence services were built on British models during and after World War II, increasing both the cultural and institutional fit between organizations. The extremely high level of information sharing and common language are also strengths that drive interoperability. Together, these aspects of the alliance create the opportunity for a planning organization that would be able conduct the debates necessary for strategic planning based on a common set of facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes nations also share significant military interoperability, which is another strength. The United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom are all NATO nations, while both Australian and New Zealand are members of NATO’s Partnership Interoperability Initiative, which includes countries that have contributed to NATO operations or taken “concrete steps” toward interoperability. The five nations’ military interoperability creates the opportunity for Five Eyes nations to plan and conduct joint operations with ease relative to other, less interoperable militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institutions of Five Eyes nations have generated key personal relationships, which have in turn increased trust between institutions and the opportunity for “bureaucratic work-arounds.” These relationships specific to Five Eyes build on a larger network of personnel exchange, professional military education, and liaison relationship between the countries. These factors represent another strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the Five Eyes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build on the trust and interoperability of Five Eyes to create a new multinational strategic planning institution focused on the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; The Five Eyes’ strong foundations of strategic alignment, institutions, interoperability, and mutual trust suggest the group is well positioned to expand its remit by developing a dedicated institution for multinational strategic planning. The group’s recent expansion into the Five Country Ministerial and Future Operating Environment work suggests that such expansion is feasible. A natural first step might be to create an equivalent of the Five Country Ministerial for the U.S. secretaries of state and defense and their foreign equivalents. Their common interest in a secure and stable Indo-Pacific would make this region a natural focus for such an institution, building on related initiatives such as AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain the Five Eyes’ focus on intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt; In expanding the Five Eyes, its core value and task—intelligence sharing—should not be disrupted. This favors creating new institutions rather than adapting existing ones. Moreover, the importance of accurate intelligence for strategic planning suggests a potential symbiosis between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quad-swot-analysis&quot;&gt;Quad SWOT Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad is a diplomatic coalition made up of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States that is focused on a “shared commitment to strengthening a Free and Open Indo-Pacific.” Originally established in 2007, the Quad was revived with annual foreign ministerial meetings beginning in 2019 and leader-level summits since 2021. In recent years it has emerged as a forum for high-level coordination on a broad range of issues, from pandemic and disease response to natural disasters, maritime security, infrastructure, emerging technology, and cybersecurity. Although the forum has potential for multinational strategic planning, divergent understanding of its role and limited institutionalization have, so far, constrained the Quad’s evolution beyond a forum for strategic coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad is aligned on one thing: Each member agrees that a more powerful and assertive China threatens regional stability. The group is based on the shared idea that coordinated actions by the four countries can strengthen rules-based order in the region. Quad members are less aligned when it comes to the specific role of the group; this poses a threat. India’s continued reluctance to expand the Quad’s activities beyond joint statements, in particular, limits its ability to evolve beyond a coordination role. Australia’s desire to preserve economic ties with China, which led to its temporary withdrawal from the Quad in 2007, could also resurface due to domestic political priorities and hinder the Quad’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited institutional framework beyond regular leader-level and ministerial meetings remains a weakness of the Quad, which continues to undergo gradual institutionalization. While it began as an informal, ad hoc senior-level dialogue, in recent years the group has operated with a more regular tempo of engagements, led by the annual ministerial meetings. The Quad has a well-defined agenda and six working groups across a wide array of security and economic issues. However, these have largely acted as a coordination and deliberative body for unilateral commitments already made in other arenas. The Quad also launched the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) in 2022 as an information-sharing and training initiative for maritime domain awareness. The IPMDA presents an opportunity as a shared institution for bolstering regional information sharing for near-term law enforcement while also establishing organizational structures and surveillance practices for latent military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interoperability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad’s multinational military exercises, in tandem with its institutional growth, are a strength and foster interoperability. After years of exclusion, Australia rejoined the Malabar naval exercise in 2020 alongside the other three Quad countries. Despite its resistance to military cooperation through the Quad, India has engaged with Quad partners in bilateral formats like the Japan-India Maritime Exercise and the Australia-India joint training exercise. Quad members have also participated in larger multinational exercises, such as RIMPAC, with more than two dozen other countries. These engagements, along with activity on maritime security and disaster response, represent an initial foray into multinational strategic planning. This groundwork presents an opportunity for the Quad to readily transform into a military cooperation framework when strategic alignment permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The varying levels of technological cooperation among the Quad countries, however, represent a threat. U.S. alliances with Australia and Japan have enabled advanced technology cooperation. Indian strategic orientation, however, precluded a similar partnership with the United States, leading it to maintain high-level military ties with Russia. India’s fielding of Russian equipment—which introduces security risks and is incompatible with the other Quad partners’ systems—presents an immediate challenge to interoperability and a long-term obstacle to strategic alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal factors had an outsized role in the initial gathering, dissolution, and reformation of the Quad. The late Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo’s active diplomacy initiated both iterations of the Quad, while his sudden resignation in 2007 contributed to its initial collapse. Australia’s withdrawal was also a leader-driven decision, as former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd chose to withdraw from the Quad soon after taking office. The Quad remains, first and foremost, a senior-level dialogue. This support has been an enduring strength of the group but raises the threat that future leadership shifts in all four capitals could hinder its evolution or lead to another dissolution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendations for the Quad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve strategic alignment.&lt;/strong&gt; If the Quad is to venture any further into the realm of multinational strategic planning, the group will need firmer foundations. The limited strategic alignment of the Quad might be its biggest weakness. A slow and steady approach over many years has seen the Quad grow its outer structures—through a proliferation of political projects—while neglecting its foundations. Bolstering strategic alignment would help the group regardless of whether it leads to more multinational strategic planning. This could be done by agreeing to a new Quad vision and launching it at the next Quad leaders’ summit in New Delhi later this year. The attendance of President Trump, his good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the recent commitment to deepen the U.S.-India defense relationship could be used to address India’s concerns and improve alignment over the Quad’s role and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop dedicated multinational strategic planning institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; The Quad already conducts ad hoc multinational strategic planning to deliver multinational exercises involving the four nations or to deliver the Quad’s maritime domain awareness initiatives. Quad leaders have also already indicated their intent to add new activities, including “shared airlift capacity to support civilian response to natural disasters and maritime patrols to improve interoperability.” These activities would benefit from a dedicated multinational strategic planning institution. This does not have to be onerous or permanent; it could be stood up temporarily or rotated between each Quad nation. If established, these institutions would also boost habits of cooperation and strategic alignment within the Quad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 80 years ago, on June 6, 1944, better known as “D-Day,” allied forces launched the largest amphibious assault in history, Operation Overlord. The United States and its wartime allies succeeded in planning and fighting together to achieve this monumental effort. A year later, Europe was liberated and the allies stood on the brink of victory. But another challenge was fast approaching: Toward the end of the war, Winston Churchill tried and failed to alert the United States to Stalin’s plans for the subjugation of Eastern Europe. In exasperation he exclaimed: “There is only one thing worse than fighting with Allies, and that is fighting without them!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Churchill’s observation was the driving force behind the formation of NATO five years later in 1949. Its express purpose was to bind the allies together into an organization capable of planning together in peacetime and fighting together in wartime—and thereby deterring a Soviet invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no “Asian NATO.” The closest historical equivalent was the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Established in 1954, SEATO lacked the equivalent formal institutions of NATO and only included two Asian members. It was disbanded in 1977. Despite the growing threat from China and efforts in the region to push back against an assertive Beijing, there is little prospect of SEATO or a modern equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean Washington has no mechanism for the United States to improve multinational strategic planning with its allies to buttress regional deterrence. Several frameworks already exist, many of which have been strengthened in recent years. This report identifies four such frameworks with the potential to contribute much more to the United States’ ability to plan and fight alongside its Indo-Pacific allies. Two are broader and more strategic in nature—the Five Eyes and the Quad—while two are narrower and more operational in their focus—the Military Framework and AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Operation Overlord, NATO and all instances of successful multinational strategic planning—whether in peace or war—are four key principles: strategic alignment, shared institutions, interoperability, and personal relationships. If U.S. leaders can keep these principles in mind as they strive to improve multinational planning with their allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, they will go a long way to realizing Churchill’s wisdom in today’s dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is no “Asian NATO.” . . . this does not mean Washington has no mechanism for the United States to improve multinational strategic planning with its allies to buttress regional deterrence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-first-gulf-war&quot;&gt;The First Gulf War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Case Study 1)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The First Gulf War was characterized by successful execution of a plan that was originally designed by the United States but adapted and adopted by coalition planners. It faced significant difficulties but overcame them by conducting unilateral planning before strategic alignment was achieved, adopting institutional designs tailored to coalition politics, and taking advantage of common language, doctrine, and equipment, where possible (Table A-1). Coalition planners also probably drew significant benefits from favorable personal factors. Below are three key lessons from the First Gulf War:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic alignment is the bedrock of multinational strategic planning. In this case, it helped the United States to expand the coalition and incorporate members into a common planning process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shared institutions must be tailored to the nations and circumstances, with a focus on interoperability to enable execution of multinational plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Early planning is better than waiting for a crisis. Conducting multinational strategic planning before the invasion probably would have improved the conduct of coalition warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-planning-process&quot;&gt;The Planning Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case includes six clear planning processes under various sets of circumstances:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. planning for the defense of Saudi Arabia:&lt;/strong&gt; Unilateral planning without clear plans for multinational planning occurred when the United States and Saudi Arabia lacked clear strategic alignment or major relational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. planning for offensive air operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Unilateral planning in preparation for coalition inclusion occurred when the coalition lacked strategic alignment but had relational institutions and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-Saudi planning for defensive operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Multinational strategic planning for parallel operations occurred when the parties had strategic alignment but lacked relational institutions and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-Saudi planning for offensive operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Multinational strategic planning for parallel operations occurred when the parties had strategic alignment and relational institutions but lacked interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-NATO partner planning for ground operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Multinational strategic planning for joint operations occurred when the parties had strategic alignment and interoperability but lacked relational institutions. The coalition integrated members into preexisting institutions for these operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-Saudi planning for air defense:&lt;/strong&gt; (See previous bullet.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the United States unilaterally drafted plans through its formal planning process and then built these plans into coalition war plans through interaction with other countries’ staff. The foundation of the coalition war plan was OPLAN 1002-90 Operations to Counter an Intra-Regional Threat to Saudi Arabia, which was devised under General Schwarzkopf between 1988 and 1990 and became the operational plan for Operation Desert Shield. The draft plan was originally classified for “U.S. eyes only.” The United States planned for offensive operations unilaterally until the passage of a UN resolution, authorizing Iraq’s expulsion from Kuwait by “all necessary means,” demonstrated strategic alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not clear why Saudi leaders were not included in the creation of OPLAN 1002-90, which could have ameliorated the significant logistics problems that occurred. The United States was not aware of the extent of Saudi logistics capability and lacked preexisting agreements for the support of U.S. forces if deployed to the region. This forced planners to confront a trade-off between accepting risk to U.S. forces or accepting inefficient movement of forces to theater with support elements that turned out to be unnecessary. It also meant that host-nation support for U.S. forces was negotiated on an ad hoc, local, and personalized basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eventual inclusion of Saudi Arabia in multinational planning “forced the Saudis to plan for the reception, sustainment, and integration of coalition forces” in Saudi Arabia. Had more coalition partners been included in operational planning, the United States may not have underestimated partner capabilities and could have reached a more efficient and flexible operations plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One plausible explanation for Saudi Arabia’s exclusion is that the plan evolved from an organizational routine, which would not change without being forced to do so by a crisis. If this organizational explanation is correct, then the creation of more relational institutions prior to the outbreak of the crisis might have allowed the United States and Saudi Arabia to plan much more quickly while avoiding the above logistics problems through multinational strategic planning before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-alignment-1&quot;&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Desert Shield/Desert Storm coalition faced important barriers to strategic alignment. Strategic alignment was made more difficult by its size: The coalition included 38 countries. These countries were also extremely diverse: 13 were NATO members, 9 were Arab states, and 16 were neither. The coalition also had to manage a potential spoiler, the Soviet Union, which could have provided material support to the Iraqi military or blocked coalition efforts at the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coalition members’ domestic politics also posed a significant barrier to strategic alignment. Despite Saudi Arabia’s clear interest in having the world’s most powerful military guaranteeing its security, its leader, King Fahd, was sensitive to the effects that a U.S. deployment to Saudi Arabia would have on Saudi Arabia’s domestic and international position. Saddam Hussein made these barriers a key component of his strategy, seeking to foster support for his invasion among Arab publics and divide the emerging coalition. The asymmetry between U.S. and Saudi political and military structures also risked significant friction within the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the coalition and nature of strategic alignment meant that strategic alignment was built gradually and unevenly: There was no single threshold moment at which strategic alignment was “achieved.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition nonetheless exhibited a high degree of strategic alignment. Hussein’s actions represented a clear threat to the coalition’s main military contributors. The United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Kingdom all perceived Iraq’s actions as upsetting the balance of power in the Middle East and (to some contributors) the international order. Hussein’s strategy helped solidify the coalition’s strategic alignment by creating an image of Hussein as irresponsible, destabilizing, and threatening. He achieved this counterproductive task both through ecological warfare—dumping oil in the Gulf and setting oil fields ablaze—and through his Scud missile attacks against Israel, which hardened Syrian opinion toward Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic alignment was not universal, however. Some states had to be persuaded to cooperate. Syria and France, for example, depended on the Gulf states and the United States for other important policy goals. Fear of the consequences of non-participation influenced their role in the coalition, a path which was smoothed by side payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-institutions-1&quot;&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Saudi Arabia had an institutionalized relationship before the Gulf War, but this did not include institutions for multinational planning. This lack of shared institutions caused initial problems which could have been avoided. For example, the lack or preexisting agreements for the support of deployed U.S. forces meant host-nation support had to be negotiated on an ad hoc and piecemeal basis, which often depended on personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-led coalition developed a purpose-built multinational planning group: the C3IC. The C3IC allowed coordination between the U.S.-led Western chain of command and the Saudi-led Arab chain of command, which was vital for operational execution and was used in the much more difficult task of planning offensive operations. The United States also created a dense network of liaisons throughout the coalition, which enabled more effective intra-coalition coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The planning process that pre-dated the creation of the C3IC and the growth in liaison network institutions also seems to have been less efficient than later multinational strategic planning. The defense of Saudi Arabia took four months to plan, but the offensive operations took four weeks. Earlier efforts at multinational strategic planning would probably have ensured that coalition planners learned the lessons that eventually permitted them to produce an offensive plan in the fraction of the time it took to complete a less challenging planning task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability-1&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the coalition also meant the potential for major interoperability problems. The coalition’s use of the same vehicles as the Iraqi military raised serious problems for battlefield identification. The main effect seems to have been to push multinational strategic planning toward different outcomes rather than serving as an obstacle to the planning as such. Where interoperability was high, as in the U.S. and Saudi air forces, the both countries integrated each other’s forces into preexisting institutions—the Saudi air defense system and the U.S. Air Tasking Order (ATO). Where interoperability was relatively low, as between NATO and Arab militaries, multinational strategic planning resulted in plans in which more interoperable militaries would act together, with NATO countries operating alongside the United States and Arab countries operating under the Saudi chain of command. This approach may have limited any issues caused by interoperability—along with the fact that the main combat effort was conducted by U.S. forces—but it comes with the opportunity cost of ruling out coalition-wide operations. That said, the ultimate success of the operation suggests that interoperability problems are often a complicating factor rather than a decisive obstacle to multinational strategic planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personal-factors-1&quot;&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorable personal factors may have played a role in coalition success, but the apparent ubiquity of good working relationships across the U.S.-Saudi divide makes assessing their importance extremely difficult. The commander of U.S. air forces for Desert Storm had worked with his Saudi counterpart for several years prior to the crisis. The U.S. Third Army staff exercised “leadership by question” rather than by dictate in the context of the C3IC. The education that General Schwarzkopf’s Saudi counterpart received at U.S. military institutions gave the two men a common language and understanding of doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-isaf-mission-in-afghanistan&quot;&gt;NATO’s ISAF Mission in Afghanistan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Case Study 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite NATO being an institutionalized and interoperable military alliance, it has faced challenges in successful execution of multinational strategic planning. This case study focuses on coalition planning during the operational years of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) (2003–2014), before it gave way to the Resolute Support Mission. NATO’s history of interoperability and existing relational institutions enabled it to conduct multinational planning from the early days of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan, but the dominant U.S. role in ISAF eventually gave way to increasingly unilateral U.S. planning of coalition activities. Below are three key lessons from ISAF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategic alignment achieved early in a campaign can fracture and is difficult to sustain in an extended campaign without active efforts to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Existing shared institutions can help establish multinational planning but require continuous adaptation to stay useful and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unfavorable personal factors can exacerbate the structural tensions present in a U.S.-dominated campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-planning-process-1&quot;&gt;The Planning Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were at least three major phases of planning under different circumstances in the war in Afghanistan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO planning for assumption of ISAF command: Multinational planning occurred through existing relational institutions at a time of high strategic alignment—but with limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO planning for expansion of ISAF (OPLAN 10302): Multinational planning for parallel operations occurred under conditions of decreasing strategic alignment and limited relational institutions—but significant interoperability and favorable personal factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Americanization of ISAF, counterinsurgency (COIN), and transition to Resolute Support Mission: Unilateral planning occurred under conditions of low strategic alignment, strong relational institutions, significant interoperability, and unfavorable personal factors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its establishment under UN Security Council Resolution 1386, ISAF was initially led on a rotational basis by individual NATO countries. In August 2003, NATO formally assumed command after significant lobbying by the four original ISAF lead nations. The planning for NATO assumption of ISAF command did not begin through a formal NATO planning process. Rather, NATO Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) officials, who had already been supporting the individual NATO countries leading ISAF, informally began planning by early 2003 through position papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning through formal NATO processes—as laid out in MC133/3 NATO Operational Planning—did not occur for two reasons. First, by the time NATO leaders decided to take command in early 2003, Canada and Germany were making troop-level decisions based on the existing structure. Second, NATO’s plan to assume command of ISAF by August of that year meant there was limited time to flow additional forces. As such, OPLAN 10419 was drawn up to reflect existing ISAF structures without the opportunity for NATO planners to conduct initial formal mission analysis to determine requirements. Broad strategic alignment gave way to informal planning, which cemented the existing ISAF structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-alignment-2&quot;&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shock of the September 11 attacks, European desire for closer defense partnership with the United States, and the search for a post–Cold War NATO mission helped form strategic alignment among coalition members. They agreed on the need to destroy al Qaeda, remove the Taliban from power, and rebuild Afghanistan, which led to multinational planning under the eventual NATO assumption of ISAF command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even while coalition members agreed on the broad intent and purpose of the war in Afghanistan, they faced challenges in maintaining this alignment and planning during the extended campaign. Each coalition member had a varied understanding of how to fight the war in Afghanistan. Differences in strategic culture—how each coalition member viewed using military force—led to organizational and operational variances as each coalition member took a leading role in over two dozen provincial reconstruction teams (PRTs) across Afghanistan. Defensively oriented German strategic culture, for example, contributed to the German-led PRT emphasizing force protection and greater civilian involvement compared to PRTs led by other coalition members. Varied understandings of the war’s purpose in coalition states from the outset, combined with growing public perceptions of the conflict as a distant, open-ended war, further complicated strategic alignment and restricted each government’s ability to adjust to operational realities. This was reflected in each government’s ability or willingness to meet NATO’s operational demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military units deployed to Afghanistan consequently received varying training, assumed different roles across regions, and operated under differing restrictions on the use of force depending on their country of origin. The United States, for example, had to stand up an army, Germany had to build up the police, the United Kingdom tamped down on narcotics trade, Italy built the judicial system, and Japan took care of disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The division of labor between the coalition led to a bifurcated strategic view as the campaign progressed. Germany, Italy, and other coalition members in the relatively peaceful northern and western provinces prioritized peacekeeping and nation-building, while the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, operating in the more dangerous southern and eastern provinces, emphasized counterinsurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this intra-coalition strategic misalignment, multinational strategic planning gave way to more unilateral U.S. decisionmaking. At ISAF’s inception, the Bush administration worried that coalition-imposed constraints could mirror challenges the United States faced under NATO command in the Kosovo campaign. As then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed to Zal Khalilzad in February 2001, “neither NATO, the UN or any other coalition should be in a position to control U.S. decision-making. If the U.S. needs a coalition to achieve its goals, leadership must gain prior agreement to do whatever it is it thinks may be needed to achieve the stated goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of traditional U.S. leadership in the early years of ISAF, other coalition members took on key leadership roles within ISAF that permitted multinational strategic planning. Denmark, for example, initiated “comprehensive approach” planning in 2003, which influenced NATO headquarters to develop a Comprehensive Strategic Political-Military Plan (CSPMP) for stabilization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the coalition confronted a strong insurgency, however, the American role in ISAF expanded significantly, partly driven by coalition members’ constraints in increasing troop contributions or taking part in intensive combat. With this expansion in manpower came greater U.S. control over planning. Beginning in 2006, the ISAF commander (COMISAF) was always a U.S. general who also oversaw Operation Enduring Freedom. General Stanley McChrystal introduced COIN as ISAF’s new strategy—with little NATO debate—after being appointed COMISAF in 2009, despite clashing with the NATO-developed strategy. Neither SHAPE nor the NATO Military Committee provided significant input on operational plans created by COMISAF, and plans were often implemented in Afghanistan before official NATO validation. Multinational strategic planning, however imperfect, gave way to increasingly unilateral U.S. planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-institutions-2&quot;&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s SHAPE was a key institution that conducted multinational strategic planning from the beginning of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan. Even before NATO’s assumption of ISAF command, SHAPE assisted the member states that initially commanded ISAF and prepared to assume and then expand command. Its structural weakness, however, led to force-generation problems that plagued ISAF and NATO planners. Existing alliance planning processes were unsuitable in multinational planning for a protracted, expeditionary mission. While coalition members submit annual responses to the Defense Planning Questionnaire (DPQ) listing resources available to NATO, the DPQ does not reflect allocated or committed forces. As such, national political intent superseded alliance planning documents like the DPQ, complicating SHAPE’s efforts to resource and expand the NATO mission in Afghanistan. Further, as discussed, despite the established chain of command with COMISAF reporting to NATO, SHAPE’s influence on coalition planning fluctuated. The appointment of high-profile U.S. generals as COMISAF eventually relegated SHAPE to a largely bureaucratic function of multinational strategic planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISAF structures that predated NATO’s assumption of command were relational institutions that proved to be a double-edged sword for multinational planning. As discussed, SHAPE planners had limited time to prepare for NATO’s assumption of ISAF command, so existing ISAF structures were helpful to execute OPLAN 10419. They, however, also inherited the constraints of existing force-generation structures. SHAPE officials thus struggled to fill positions not already offered by Canada, Germany, and other NATO countries. Certain positions, like helicopters or intelligence units, were never fully filled under OPLAN 10419—and the issue of force generation would never be fully resolved as the ISAF mission expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In dealing with force-generation problems, existing NATO gatherings, particularly summits, and newly created ones—like the SHAPE-organized Global Force Generation Conference—proved to be helpful relational institutions. Political pressures ahead of the 2004 Istanbul summit, for example, generated additional commitments needed to execute the expansion of ISAF beyond Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability-2&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition developed new ways to improve interoperability, particularly through the Afghan Mission Network (AMN), which became the primary network for coalition command and control and information sharing. The common network—developed under the U.S. leadership of COMISAF David McKiernan and McChrystal—combined with senior leadership support to foster a “need-to-share” culture and enabled the coalition to overcome classification challenges to multinational strategic planning experienced in the First Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveats—the restrictions on the use of force given by home governments—constrained coalition war efforts. For example, no NATO combat forces were immediately available to respond to a 2006 attack on the Norwegian-Finnish PRTs in Meymaneh, as nearby units were restricted from engaging in combat. Meanwhile, German advisers, in charge of training the Afghan National Police, were limited to training within the confines of bases. In this way, caveats frustrated COMISAFs, who repeatedly proposed scaling them back in NATO gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveats had a mixed impact on multinational strategic planning. They allowed some countries to participate in ISAF despite political sensitivities, and NATO operational plans were developed with consideration for caveats and rules of engagement, permitting states to opt out of certain operations. However, these caveats complicated planning for resourcing the combat-intensive elements of ISAF’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personal-factors-2&quot;&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal relationships exacerbated the coalition’s frustrations with the Americanization of ISAF that diminished multinational strategic planning in favor of unilateral U.S. planning. NATO member states viewed General McChrystal’s leadership—compared to Generals John Allen or David Petraeus—to be “disrespectful,” inviting greater scrutiny to operational plans drawn up by McChrystal. The formal command structure allowed NATO members to reject operational plans and provide input, even as increased American command involvement in ISAF reshaped the de facto planning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-c&quot;&gt;Appendix C&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-1950-medium-term-defense-plan&quot;&gt;NATO’s 1950 Medium Term Defense Plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Case Study 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1950 Medium Term Defense Plan (MTDP) was NATO’s first strategic project and the first major instance of multinational strategic planning conducted by an alliance in peacetime. Ironically, the immediate result was failure: The planning goals were too ambitious for the postwar allies to meet. They were never attained, even with drastic increases in defense spending in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the process was ultimately successful in transforming the North Atlantic Treaty into a functioning organization—in effect putting the “O” in NATO. The formal planning process it established endured the Cold War and still exists to this day, in the form of the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP). This process is the engine room of alliance strategic planning and the foundation of NATO’s collective defense. The collective approach to planning and burden sharing that the MTDP set off imbued the young alliance with a common sense of purpose and community, which fed into the solidarity that remains NATO’s most potent asset to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are two key lessons from the MTDP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A formal process for multinational strategic planning can pay dividends. The MTDP was pivotal in laying the foundations for NATO’s longevity and success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political tensions within coalitions are inevitable and unavoidable. They must be proactively and openly managed from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-alignment-3&quot;&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important factor in the conduct and (eventual) success of the MTDP—and of the NATO alliance writ large—was the fact that it was based on a formal treaty. Signed on April 4, 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty captured a common purpose and vision to which all 12 original allies—and the additional nations that joined NATO during and after the Cold War—committed at the highest levels. The foundation stone of the treaty was the commitment to mutual defense captured in Article 5. But the treaty also contained 13 other articles ranging from economic collaboration (Article 2) and consultation (Article 4) to accession (Article 10). Taken together, these articles meant allies had committed to more than a narrow deterrent to aggression: They had committed to building a common political community, “founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a common vision was often not enough to rule out divergence within the alliance. The alliance was skewed from the start, as it was based on the large asymmetry in power between postwar Europe and the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty was envisaged by its founders as an American security guarantee to Europe, and not the other way around. In practice, this power differential led to bad behaviors from both the United States—which “rejected genuine multilateral military planning, choosing instead to emphasize designated areas of [unilateral] strategic responsibility”—and European allies, who chafed at “delegating power to the governments of larger nations” and often agreed to planning targets they knew they had no chance of meeting. This problem was exacerbated by the distinct strategic cultures among allies—particularly between Europe and the United States—and the fact that it was Europe that was most vulnerable to Soviet attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem of divergence was never totally overcome, but three strategies helped mitigate it. The first was the consolidation of non-U.S. power as a counterweight. This occurred through a range of initiatives, including the European Defense Community (although it did not ultimately come to fruition); the accession of West Germany and other nations over time; the United Kingdom (and later France) acquiring nuclear weapons; and the creation of nuclear sharing arrangements. A second, more technocratic strategy was the creation of several bodies within the alliance that would operate on an equitable basis using consensus decisionmaking. These included the Standing Group, the Temporary Council Committee, and the secretary general—the figurehead of NATO—who, by convention, is never an American.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third strategy that strengthened strategic alignment in NATO was enlightened U.S. leadership, tailored to the situation—both decisive and passive, when required. This first required farsighted U.S. political and military leaders to grasp the benefits that multinational planning could provide and support it from the top down. As the historian Andrew M. Johnston explains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The American military gradually accepted joint planning as a kind of virtue that could actually be beneficial in resolving some of its own internal problems [such as basing and transit rights]. . . . The [U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff] saw joint planning as a strategic opportunity, believing that, with the right inducements, the Europeans would themselves fill the vacuum on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times this required listening carefully and acceding to the demands of allies, while at others it required a stronger hand. As RAND’s Richard L. Kugler concludes: “During the 1950s, NATO performed best when the United States exercised its influence as the coalition’s strongest partner by decisively leading the alliance in sound directions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these mitigations could not prevent the MTDP (and NATO’s strategy writ large) from being hostage to divergence and disagreement between allies. As Johnston describes, the MTDP force goals were a result of political bargaining and power dynamics more than intelligent design—in particular, “the desire of the United States to maintain its autonomy over the use of atomic weapons, and its freedom from the constraints of the new alliance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-institutions-3&quot;&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MTDP process itself was a collective institution developed specifically to overcome shortfalls in NATO’s ability to deliver on the promise of the North Atlantic Treaty—namely, rebuilding Europe’s armed forces and integrating NATO’s military forces in the most efficient and cost-effective way. As NATO’s 1949 Strategic Concept stated: “The essence of our over-all concept is to develop a maximum of strength through collective defense planning.” The MTDP institution also sought to address potential barriers to smooth cooperation, including through solving the tension created by the asymmetrical distribution of power and vulnerability within NATO (as above). Despite allies’ subsequent failures to resource the agreed plan and force goals, it is widely agreed by analysts and historians that the process did much to lay the foundations for NATO’s cohesion and strength, which endured through the Cold War and contributed to its end. The overall lesson of the MTDP experience is therefore clear: Multinational strategic planning can offer significant political, economic, and military benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the experience also yields several lessons about what not to do when building multinational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such lesson is the importance of having a strategic planning process based on clear, shared, and realistic goals. This was not the case for the MDTP, where vagueness, optimism, and incoherence took hold. Planning goals were not realistic because they were designed based on a nation-first, not NATO-first, approach. This led to targets that were highly inflated and not based on sound military logic or an informed, collective view. This was compounded by another problem: the tension between military realities and political pressures. At first, allied political leaders were hesitant to set any planning goals at all. The reason was to maximize political freedom of maneuver with regard to European military aid. But this only led to incoherence, as Johnston explains: “By not establishing a clear strategic goal, NATO opened itself up to divergent interpretations of the meaning behind its military reconstruction. This vagueness, the deliberate disengagement of national and international strategic policy-making, was what one American official called ‘disembodied military planning.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another source of tension exacerbated the situation: an unspoken contradiction between U.S. and European goals. Washington wanted to maximize Europe’s level of conventional rearmament ambition to preclude its own involvement in any future ground war while maintaining a focus on nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, European allies saw agreeing to ambitious targets as a way of placating the United States into defending the continent—and had reasons to assume the United States would foot much of the bill. At some level, disembodied planning was thus a feature, not a bug, of early allied planning because it allowed the United States and Europe to operate within their own realities and meet their own political pressures. But the result of disembodied planning was bad for everyone: unrealistic targets that threatened to undermine NATO’s credibility just as the alliance was getting started. The main lesson is for coalition members to be realistic and honest with each other from the very beginning about what they are trying to achieve and the political constraints each brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MTDP is also instructive on institutional specialization. Just like in economics, specializing in one area over others can yield benefits in performance or efficiency. However, in multinational coalitions, focusing on one thing means giving up another—and therefore relying on other members to cover the gap. This dilemma can undermine an otherwise efficient division of labor. The MTDP process tried and mostly failed to implement such an approach to generating “collective balanced forces” based around a regional division of labor. The main reason was that smaller nations did not have sufficient confidence to commit to specialization in practice. For example, as Johnston explains: “Norway and the Netherlands feared that a unilateral reconstruction of their military to accommodate balanced collective forces might leave them stranded. The risk could only be taken if NATO provided real protection. These concerns were merely acknowledged by the Standing Group; they were not embodied in the strategic concept.” The lesson is that any division of labor within coalitions requires every member to commit to playing their part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability-3&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO leaders recognized the importance of interoperability from the beginning. The alliance’s first strategic concept made this clear in one of its key objectives: “Standardization, insofar as practicable, of military material and equipment for use in operations as developed by common defense plans.” The concept also aimed for standardization across military doctrine and procedures, information sharing, maintenance and repair. The benefits of interoperability were appreciated by all allies, particularly the United States. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff saw that the ability to operate alongside their allies, beyond the experience of the previous war, would also give them flexibility regarding bases and logistics for their strategic air power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there were two key issues that undermined NATO’s interoperability goals. The first was the problem of disembodied military planning. The force planning goals that emerged from the MTDP were based on “simply amalgamating five separate regional plans” rather than a composite picture across Europe. This lack of interoperability at the level of military planning and NATO planning put the MTDP process onto the wrong track from the beginning. Second, the alliance had no means of ensuring compliance with its own goals for interoperability based on standardization. As a 1952 report by Chatham House on NATO’s progress assessesed: “NATO has the beginnings of a policy for standardization of weapons and war production, but no powers to do more than recommend action and give reminders.” Although standardization is much greater across NATO today, this problem is still apparent in the fragmented state of European allies’ forces and defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personal-factors-3&quot;&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal factors have always been central to NATO. A large part of the alliance’s history is the key figures who occupied critical roles, such as the national permanent representatives, the supreme allied commander, or the secretary general. This history is also dependent on the many allied officials and national representatives over the years who have done the work that makes NATO function. Their relationships grease the wheels of NATO. Hence, it is often said the real work of NATO is done in the corridors and canteens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1949, key leaders were still very familiar with each other from working together closely in their wartime alliance just a few years before, a fact that helped NATO’s early success. For example, the relationship between General Eisenhower and Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, which was so crucial in World War II, was also important in NATO’s early years: Both men served as supreme commander and deputy supreme commander, respectively, in the early 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership of one man played a key part in getting the MTDP off the ground. The appointment of General Eisenhower as NATO’s first supreme allied commander was crucial to the MTDP. His appointment was used as leverage by the United States to get its European allies to engage with the MTDP process and take on the emerging force goals. Senior U.S. military leaders looked upon Eisenhower “as a recruiter . . . who would then go over and try to push through the contributions to the MTDP.” Once in place as supreme commander, his leadership was critical; he has been described as “the MTDP’s cheerleader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formation of institutions that depended on personalities and relationships also influenced the success of the MTDP, in particular the delegation of national authorities to the permanent representatives to NATO, who sit in the North Atlantic Council—the alliance’s premier decisionmaking body. Within the alliance, personal relations between key nations also mattered greatly. For example, talks between U.S. President Harry S. Truman and UK Prime Minister Clement Attlee were crucial in maintaining a unified approach to the MTDP within the “special relationship” that would lead by example: “The only way we can do anything with NATO is for the United States and the United Kingdom to go ahead and act and force the others to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-d&quot;&gt;Appendix D&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-joint-expeditionary-force-jef&quot;&gt;The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Case Study 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is a multinational framework of 10 like-minded northern European nations, led by the United Kingdom. It includes Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. The United Kingdom provides command and control for JEF operations from its Standing Joint Force Headquarters in Northwood, London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF falls under NATO’s Framework Nations Concept, established at the 2014 Wales Summit to encourage groups of allies to develop deployable capabilities led by a “framework” nation. The concept takes advantage of the potential for small groups of like-minded nations to overcome the collective action problem that can undermine international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inception 10 years ago, the JEF has conducted a wide range of tasks in northern Europe, becoming an important layer in the European security architecture. After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the JEF ramped up reassurance and deterrence missions in northern Europe. It also provided a political forum for northern European leaders to coordinate support for Ukraine. Most recently, it has led northern Europe’s response to secure critical undersea infrastructure and monitor the Russian shadow fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are three key lessons from the JEF:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Small groups based on preexisting factors (e.g., identity, history, culture, and priorities) can overcome traditional barriers to multinational cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation is a work in progress and takes dedicated effort and adaptation to maintain: You get out what you put in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multinational cooperation based on an “in” group also leaves behind an “out” group. This can be a problem if those excluded are potential partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-alignment-4&quot;&gt;Strategic Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic alignment of the 10 JEF nations is based first and foremost on political factors such as like-mindedness, a common strategic culture, shared threat perception, a clear regional focus on northern Europe, shared operational experience, and common values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This collective identity is both founded on and bolstered by existing political groups such as the Northern Group, NORDEFCO, the Baltic-3, NATO, and the European Union. It is also founded on the shared experience of the Cold War, including a military-strategic lineage in NATO’s original Northern European Regional Planning Group and its successors in NATO’s integrated command structure throughout the Cold War and today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF nations also share a clear, collective vision for their framework. The first vision was published as part of the 2014 NATO Wales summit, during which the intent to establish framework nation groups was established to provide “a rapidly deployable force capable of conducting the full spectrum of operations.” The latest 10-year vision was agreed to and published at a meeting of JEF leaders in October 2023. Beneath the high-level vision, there is also a more detailed policy direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One strategy employed by the JEF to develop cohesion has been through dedicated branding and public relations activity. The first vision was published as part of the 2014 NATO Wales summit, which established the intent to create the framework nation groups to provide “a rapidly deployable force capable of conducting the full spectrum of operations.” This is enabled by the commitment in the JEF Policy Direction to “a regular drumbeat of JEF exercises, table-top exercises, scenario-based discussions and other activities.” These continuous activities deliver the JEF’s vision while generating solidarity and cohesion, given every nation’s commitment to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of cooperating groups is critical: While small groups can overcome the collective action problem that blights defense cooperation, groups that are too small lack critical mass to be effective. If groups are too large, they risk diluting their purpose and undermining agility. The trick is to find a just-right, “Goldilocks” coalition. JEF membership has grown since 2014 from 7 to 10 nations, still relatively small compared to other framework nation groups such as the 20-nation German Framework Nations Concept, which has failed to achieve very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF operates a flexible, ad hoc model to operating that foregoes consensus in favor of a voluntary “opt-in” arrangement. This model allows the JEF to be flexible and allows each participant to tailor contributions according to available resources and political factors. However, it is not without risks. The utility of the JEF could be undermined if no participating nations are able to generate the forces required to meet its vision. If this burden continually falls on certain members, the effects could undermine solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility can be a two-sided coin: The jack of all trades is a master of none. This might be one reason why in recent years the JEF has focused on the mission of countering hybrid threats—especially threats to critical undersea infrastructure. However, if the JEF is to be credible on the demanding, high-end tasks in its vision—such as crisis response and warfighting—it may need to forego flexibility and agility for dedicated standing forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, adaptation is a theme that runs through the history of the JEF and must take some credit for its cohesion, longevity, and utility. Initially established in 2012 by the United Kingdom to replace the Joint Rapid Reaction Force (which was disbanded in 2010), the JEF concept quickly became part of NATO’s adaptation to Russia’s aggression and invasion of Crimea in 2014. When Russia invaded the rest of Ukraine in 2022, the JEF quickly adapted again to provide a ready-made political forum for northern European nations to support Ukraine. In 2023, the JEF evolved yet again to focus more on the emerging threat to undersea infrastructure in the region. The downside of continually adapting, or changing, is the lack of stability around which to plan for and invest in collective military capabilities. This problem is at the heart of some recent analyses and critiques of the JEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-institutions-4&quot;&gt;Shared Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF coalition is based on preexisting institutions across three levels of integration: strategic, tactical, and institutional. Even so, it has constructed a variety of institutions designed to improve cooperation among its members. These include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A permanent operational headquarters, based in Northwood, United Kingdom, with a multinational staff from the JEF nations and a dedicated secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A C2 model that is flexible and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A voluntary, opt-in model for partner contributions to JEF activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A bespoke JEF Operating Framework, which includes both persistent “Joint Integration Options” and proactive “Joint Response Options.” The latter was activated for the first time by JEF defense ministers in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A commitment to go beyond coordinated activity in the short term to coordinated long-term capability and force development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regular meetings of senior JEF leaders at all levels, political and military. As the JEF Policy Direction states: “As with all successful cooperation frameworks, the JEF’s key strength is its unity and cohesion. Without it, our competitors will exploit political divergence, set conditions for strategic advantage, and reduce our response options. It is essential, therefore, that the JEF continues to facilitate regular senior political, policy and military meetings in order to maintain a shared understanding and develop a coordinated and synchronised response to evolving challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institution building also applies to public image and self-image. Since 2018, the JEF nations have delivered both a constant drumbeat of activity and dedicated strategic communications campaigns to make sure everyone knows about it. This has the twin effect of building the group’s public image while reinforcing awareness and confidence—or self-image—among the JEF nations. This effect also applies to any would-be adversaries whom the JEF nations wish to deter from aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, several questions remain about the JEF’s institutions. First, the voluntary opt-in model sounds good on paper, but it is unclear how it might stand up in a crisis if JEF planners do not know what forces are available to them. This model could also undermine group solidarity over time if some nations consistently fail to volunteer forces. A more structured approach might therefore pay dividends—but it might also require the JEF to answer difficult questions, like whether it should maintain standing forces. A related question is about measuring impact: The JEF might conduct plenty of activity, but activity is not the same as effect. The effects that the JEF seeks to achieve—primarily to reassure regional allies and deter the Kremlin, but also second-order effects such as increased interoperability—are difficult to measure, but it will be difficult to claim success without doing so. A final question is one of leadership. The framework nation concept implies the lead nation is expected to do more. While the United Kingdom has done plenty to lead the JEF since 2014—such as hosting its headquarters and building the JEF into a heavyweight political forum following Russia’s 2022 invasion—London has come under pressure recently to show more leadership. The framework nation model puts inherent emphasis on the coalition leader, and these expectations may be difficult to meet in practice unless they are carefully managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability-4&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF’s commitment to interoperability is set out in its 2021 Policy Direction: “Having highly capable and interoperable forces is a critical capability for the success of the JEF; this capability underpins credible deterrence; and provides our joint contribution when we need to respond.” The same document also clarifies what this means in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Interoperable. JEF Participant forces need to be increasingly interoperable in order to be able to operate in a wide range of scenarios. This will be achieved through more regular joint activity, increased coordination at the operational level, and an improved understanding of the availability of JEF Participant capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this effect is delivered through the JEF’s consistent drumbeat of activity. As Arnold and Monaghan point out, “the main benefit of doing this is to develop the interoperability and readiness of JEF forces to work together in a crisis.” Defense industrial cooperation between several JEF nations—such as NORDEFCO and Nordic-Baltic cooperation—also contributes to technical interoperability, as does operating the same equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that all 10 JEF partners are now NATO members means that they are all pursuing NATO standards and doctrine, which contributes to interoperability. As the JEF website states: “With NATO doctrine as its baseline, the JEF has strong working relationships with partners and provides a gearing between nations and NATO.” While some analysts have questioned whether the JEF undermines NATO by placing more demands on limited resources owned by the same nations in the same region, officials have claimed the JEF can address a critical gap in regional security by acting “while NATO is thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personal-factors-4&quot;&gt;Personal Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF is founded on strong personal relations between its counterparts. These are further strengthened by its institutions. The JEF nations are well aligned in terms of both strategy and strategic culture. Many of them possess advanced armed forces with an expeditionary mindset and capabilities—hence the name of the Joint Expeditionary Force. All JEF members contributed forces to NATO’s ISAF mission in Afghanistan, which ended in 2014. In fact, the JEF was established in part to help carry over and build on this experience of multinational operations among northern European nations. This includes the personal relationships developed between the military personnel of the JEF over the years of the NATO ISAF mission, many of whom are now in senior positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal relationships are also founded and developed on international professional military education courses—such as the United Kingdom’s Advanced Command and Staff College, which is attended by personnel from all 10 JEF nations—and exchange and liaison officers. The JEF headquarters itself—based in Northwood, United Kingdom—is also staffed by personnel from the JEF nations. The close ties and common strategic culture between the JEF nations can be summed up in a quip made in 2022 by Leo Docherty, a UK defense minister, that the JEF consists of the “amphibian, beer drinking nations of northern Europe.” The downside of this feature—an identity based on an “in group” and an “out group”—is the exclusivity it produces, which may prevent or undermine extending the group to nations with different outlooks or cultures. In the case of the JEF, this may include Ukraine, Poland, Germany, and other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolving global geopolitical landscape has compelled European states to reassess and modernise their defence capabilities, with a focus on digital transformation. This paper examines the digital defence technology priorities of five key European countries – the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Spain – highlighting their current capabilities and stated priorities and the challenges for achieving their digital ambitions. The analysis is structured around several key themes, including sovereignty, interoperability, legacy system integration, digital literacy and organisational barriers to digitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK possesses some advanced digital capabilities but struggles with integration and scalability. The Next Generation Communication Network aims to address connectivity issues. However, delays and unclear requirements have hindered progress. The UK’s hybrid cloud strategy and emphasis on “Secure by Design” principles are steps forward, but challenges in digital skills, procurement processes and legacy system integration remain significant obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; France has had success in scaling its digital capabilities, driven by a strong emphasis on national sovereignty. The DESCARTES, SIA and ARTEMIS.IA programmes are enhancing connectivity and data integration, but challenges in procurement persist. France’s focus on achieving 70–80% capability rather than perfection has allowed for more efficient delivery of digital systems, but the focus on domestic solutions complicates interoperability with allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germany:&lt;/strong&gt; Germany has mature enterprise-level digital capabilities but faces challenges in cohering operational and enterprise efforts. The Bundeswehr’s multicloud strategy and focus on AI technologies are promising, but bureaucratic hurdles, risk aversion and a lack of digital skills hinder progress. Emphasis on NATO interoperability is strong, but internal integration across the armed forces remains a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poland:&lt;/strong&gt; Poland is digitalising its armed forces through platform-centric modernisation, with significant investments in C4ISR and air defence systems, alongside the F-35. However, the lack of an enterprise-level digitalisation strategy and digital skills within the armed forces are major constraints. Poland’s cyber-security capabilities are robust, but the country remains heavily reliant on external technology, particularly from the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spain:&lt;/strong&gt; Spain lags other countries in this paper in terms of digital capabilities, with limited financial resources and a lack of strategic vision for digitalisation. The Integrated Defence Information Infrastructure is a step forward, but the armed forces struggle with data integration, cloud adoption and AI deployment. Spain’s low defence spending and fragmented industrial base further complicate efforts for digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cross-national-analysis&quot;&gt;Cross-National Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sovereignty:&lt;/strong&gt; Each country in this paper defines sovereignty differently, with France setting a high standard that may not be replicable in the other countries. A clear definition of digital sovereignty and a candid feasibility analysis are essential for practical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Each country in this paper faces a pervasive lack of digital skills, which is a significant barrier to digitalisation. The pay gap between public and private sectors exacerbates recruitment and retention challenges, while military leaders often struggle to grasp the specific functions and limitations of digital technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interoperability:&lt;/strong&gt; While each country emphasises NATO inter-operability, the interpretation and implementation of standards vary. Bilateral and multilateral interoperability initiatives are beneficial, but NATO must clarify its role in standard-setting to ensure cohesive integration across the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European armed forces face a complex landscape of digital transformation, with varying degrees of success and significant challenges. The path forward requires a clear-eyed assessment of strategic priorities, resources and political will. While ambitious goals for digitalisation are commendable, tempering these to focus on measurable, achievable objectives may offer a more realistic path to success. Defence ministries and leaders in the armed forces must navigate these challenges to ensure that digital technology aligns coherently with broader strategic modernisation frameworks, shaping Europe’s military capabilities for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shifting global geopolitical landscape has forced many European countries to re-evaluate their defence capabilities as they look to procure and modernise a host of capabilities. While the armed forces have been digitalising since the introduction of Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) concepts in the 1990s, current doctrinal emphasis on multidomain operations (MDO) requires connectivity across domains through modern digital capabilities. New concepts – especially software-defined defence (SDD) which emphasises using software iteration, rather than hardware, to upgrade – have thus been introduced to aid capability development in the modern digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the state of digital technology across European defence ministries and armed forces differs dramatically. Such differences exist in terms of the actual infrastructure and software bought, developed and/or deployed, the methods of digitalisation, and the governance and bureaucratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to analyse the priorities of five key European countries – the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Spain – by exploring their digital defence capabilities. It does so by evaluating stated priorities and assessing the efficacy and feasibility of their digital ambitions. Analysis of these case studies also incorporates key themes, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of different concepts of sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration among the armed forces and interoperability with allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration, upgrading and/or phasing out legacy technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The state of digital literacy and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Organisational limitations to fielding modern digital technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this analysis, the paper offers insights to policymakers, industry and broader society about the intricacies of the relationship between Europe’s armed forces and their digital technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five countries were selected for this paper to depict a range of digitalisation across medium-to-large countries. The UK, France and Germany were chosen due to the size of their populations and economies, as well as their politico-military and economic importance within NATO and their relatively advanced digital capabilities. Poland is rapidly expanding the size and sophistication of its armed forces and is seen as NATO’s frontline against further Russian aggression. Spain was chosen due to its relative lack of emphasis on defence spending, although it has a robust civilian digital technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these countries differ in their approaches and priorities, they are analysed and compared largely based on their ability to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Produce and procure digital innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Achieve connectivity across their forces while maintaining security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop and deploy modern capabilities in data analytics and computing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scale innovations across the enterprise and armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain and achieve interoperability with allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper is based in part on a review of public domain ministerial and armed forces documents, alongside academic and journalistic literature published largely between 2020 and 2024. Research also included interviews with 39 individuals conducted both in-person and online between August and December 2024. The interviewees were selected for their knowledge of and proximity to the development, procurement, deployment or employment of digital defence technology. They included members of industry, academia and government from the five countries, alongside relevant individuals working in multinational organisations. The interviews were conducted on the condition of anonymity to protect identities and maximise candour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;LIMITATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper examined the state of digital defence technology within the five selected case countries, as well as the trajectory for future technological deployments. However, a repeated point across many interviews was that the technology itself is often the least important element of the technology ecosystem. Across government, industry and academia, the “people, process, technology” framework was cited as necessary to understanding the state of digital capability, with “people” being the most important, and “technology” the least. As such, while this paper outlines the technology priorities, the non-technological underpinnings of, and inhibiters to, the fielding of digital technology form a significant part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence expenditure on a given area, in both absolute and relative terms, is often seen as an indicator of the commitment of both countries and ministries to invest in a certain type of capability or strategy. Yet spending on digital technology confounds simple estimates of expenditure, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, budget estimates are still overwhelmingly oriented towards platform-centric procurement, even when incorporating a whole-of-life model that includes maintenance and decommissioning costs. The shift towards service deployment models (data-, infrastructure-, and software-as-a-service) requires continuous, flexible funding streams. Such an approach remains difficult for defence bureaucracies to scale and measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, countries differ in their reporting of various digital investments across budgetary categories. Enterprise-level network infrastructure, fifth- or sixth-generation aircraft and healthcare chatbots for military families would all qualify as investment in digital technology but belong to different budgetary authorities and intersect with other categories of capabilities. Countries also differ in their budgetary detail and transparency, especially when assessing whole-life costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, level of investment does not necessarily correlate with an ability to overcome the various challenges facing digital procurement and deployment detailed below. Instead, overall investment in the armed forces in recent decades, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP, appears to reflect the maturity of a country’s defence ecosystem, which in turn correlates with the level of digital capabilities available to (if not necessarily fielded by) a given force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, this paper avoids delving into a detailed analysis of spending on digital technology, instead focusing on the many non-financial drivers and limiters of digitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;STRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has six sections, one for each case study country and one providing a comparative analysis. Each case study describes broadly the state of digital technology within the country’s defence establishments, with details on networks, hosting, services, security and data-centricity at the enterprise and service levels. This includes which technology is currently deployed, which programmes of change or procurement are ongoing, and the scalability of current and future capabilities. The structures of the case studies are not uniform, to reflect the differing strategies, strengths and challenges each country faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk&quot;&gt;THE UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) and armed forces possess some advanced digital capabilities but lack integration across networks and programmes and struggle with scaling innovations and addressing its legacy estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mixed-success-of-ongoing-programmes&quot;&gt;MIXED SUCCESS OF ONGOING PROGRAMMES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capabilities and infrastructure provided by existing enterprise-level networks are to be replaced by the Next Generation Communication Network (NGCN), an MoD Defence Digital programme intended to allow connectivity across the enterprise and form the core of the “Digital Backbone”. Given dissatisfaction with past networking contracts, the commercial design of the NGCN is intended to disaggregate the dependence on key large network integrators by using numerous smaller bids to integrate the MoD’s disparate networks. While described as the future enabler of MDO through network integration, NGCN is best understood as a refashioning of the network procurement process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the specific capabilities of the NGCN remains difficult as it has yet to be delivered and has already faced several years of delays – causing expensive extensions to existing contracts. The NGCN remains rated as “Amber” (delivery feasible but facing significant issues) by the UK’s National Audit Office. Further challenges are also probable as government and industrial partners are uncertain what the NGCN will comprise. One senior MoD member mentioned that they had received at least six different descriptions of the NGCN. This failure to understand and outline the requirements for network integration has delayed the programme and sown doubt as to whether it will come to market in a form that will match ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the NGCN, it is likely that the need for surveys and rebuilding of the digital architecture within various defence organisations will be necessary to understand and mitigate the impact of many legacy systems. For example, it was found that for one cyber operations centre, 20% of its data processes cannot be automated due to obsolete systems. Windows 98 and NT4 are still used by operators, even as the MoD is asking its employees to become “digitally native”. Yet problematic systems can only be updated or retired if they are identified. A senior official described navigating their networks as “recce by fire” due to the absence of estate planning and that therefore there was an inability to “automatically monitor, detect, respond and then pre-empt”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has several large programmes intended to transform its core and deployed IT services – MODNet Evolve, New Style of Information Technology (Base) and New Style of Information Technology (Deployed) – which are currently rated as Red (unachievable), Amber and Amber, respectively. These large-scale procurements are dogged by many of the issues facing the broader digital defence ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discrete programmes across defence have led to the development of functional services, such as Defence Developer Services and Defence Data Analytics Platform, both associated with the Defence Digital Foundry. Yet these platforms and services are typically discussed as “pockets of innovation” – highly capable technology that is not scaled across the enterprise. Similar notions arise when discussing the development and deployment of AI technologies, which, while more advanced than most European peers, face challenges in scaling UK innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changing-operating-procedures&quot;&gt;CHANGING OPERATING PROCEDURES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UK has emphasised the importance of sovereignty in its digital systems and data, the MoD has chosen a mixed approach for hosting. It has adopted a hybrid “Cloud First” strategy and is in the process of shifting its systems and data to several cloud providers. Its framework and accreditation system, MODCloud, incorporates several US hyperscalers, and is the main platform for hosting at OFFICIAL level through public, private and hybrid services. The MoD is developing its SECRET and above services on MODCloud to mirror its capabilities at the OFFICIAL level and will also rely on US hyperscalers. MODCloud is intended to be the “front door” for hosting, but the MoD is also incorporating private cloud services for unique, sensitive use cases. SECRET-level cloud infrastructure was expected to be at full operating capability by the end of 2024, a target on which progress has been made, although full capability will probably be achieved in 2025. Above SECRET hosting is essentially on on-premises servers. It does not seem likely that the gap between the desire for sovereignty and reliance on hyperscalers will close, despite the increasing complexity of this mixed approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the MoD’s cyber resilience revolves around its promotion of “Secure by Design” (SbD): the implementation of security principles from the beginning of the DevOps cycle to avoid the need for lengthy and costly security accreditation of a finished product. SbD is viewed overwhelmingly as a strong idea by both industry and government, as accreditation has been one of the largest barriers to the MoD’s procurement of digital technology. However, the implementation of SbD principles has yet to match ambitions. Defence Digital appears to lack the authority, capabilities and personnel (especially architects) to manage consistency across the many systems in development, leading to variable external accreditation. Furthermore, SbD does not apply to most systems, which were accredited prior to SbD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-challenges&quot;&gt;OTHER CHALLENGES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD lacks the specialist digital skills necessary to develop its own digital capabilities (a problem stemming from broader recruitment and retention issues, alongside public–private salary discrepancies) and it also has a risk-averse digital culture. Without an agile digital culture where leaders understand the limitations and lifecycles of technologies, not only will procurement authorities fail to outline clear requirements to industry, but the MoD will be unable to reuse and integrate its vast legacy estate. Ideally, a more digitally literate force would be more aware of the interplay between technological and socio-organisational elements that underpin continuous technological innovation cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD has laid out a strong digital strategy, but its ability to implement it through a coherent architecture has been impeded by the relative lack of implementation authority (budgetary and organisational) in its main digital body, Defence Digital. The independence of the armed forces relative to Strategic Command has been a key constraint for the integration of digital technology across defence for MDO, although the ongoing Strategic Defence Review is likely to restructure command relationships in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MoD contracting challenges stem, in part, from its relatively short-term and risk-averse nature. They typically begin in the requirement-setting phase. The MoD selects solutions based on price point, instead of for a set mission and effect to be achieved. The lack of understanding about the objectives the MoD wishes its technology to meet – beyond the concepts outlined in high-level strategy – causes requirements to frequently shift, delaying delivery and increasing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the inclusion of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in numerous MoD strategies, the MoD struggles to incorporate them into its innovation and procurement cycles. Typically, the MoD can only benefit from these smaller firms when they are subcontracted through primes, which serve a gatekeeping function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a level of frustration in industry due to the difficulty of having consistent conversations between the MoD and industry. The MoD’s parochial structure limits coordination between its different departments, resulting in repeated discussions. Several companies mentioned that they must act as the “connective tissue” between MoD departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;FRANCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has been able to scale its digital capabilities beyond other countries in this paper with (and through) its emphasis on national sovereignty. However, the country faces continued challenges in multinational interoperability and procurement complications affecting major programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sovereignty-first&quot;&gt;SOVEREIGNTY FIRST&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French Ministère des Armées (Ministry of the Armed Forces, MINARM) views the notion of sovereignty through a national lens. For a capability or technology to be considered sovereign, it must be procured from a French company, with the relevant infrastructure controlled by the state. Such a model requires much greater state involvement in the management of industry, is time and resource intensive and often does not deliver the same level of capability and affordability as via more open markets. Yet, as detailed below, the French industrial system has demonstrated its ability to develop and deliver high-tier digital capabilities more efficiently and effectively than elsewhere in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MINARM’s success stems, in large part, from its relatively modest ambitions in procurement cycles. Given the historical understanding that sovereignty comes at a cost of capability, MINARM set its sights on achieving a moderate level of capability, say 70–80%, for a given system, as long as it still meets requirements, rather than striving (and failing) to achieve perfection. France’s armed forces have faced their own difficulties with digital procurements in recent years, most notably a lack of agility in long and continuous processes to allow for flexible procurement approaches; however, this has not stunted the delivery of capabilities to the same extent as comparable countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scaling-advanced-capabilities&quot;&gt;SCALING ADVANCED CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France’s networks should be understood through two overarching programmes: DESCARTES and the Système d’information des Armées (Armed Forces Information System, SIA). DESCARTES covers the fixed telecommunications infrastructure and services for MINARM, and has involved updating the SOCRATES IP network and rolling out a secure interconnection programme, telephony system and the air traffic control telephony system. Current DESCARTES objectives include phased obsolescence of various components and expansion of network capacity. DESCARTES delivers connectivity across the forces, but would benefit from increased automation to monitor and encrypt the massive throughput of the systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIA seeks to create a single information environment for operational and command information systems, replacing 17 disparate information systems. SIA includes a number of services from the three armed forces, from command and control (C2) to logistics management, along with data integration at operational levels. SIA is an ambitious project, seeking to incorporate algorithms to aid in automating many network processes and enhancing the capability of user data services. With more than €1 billion invested over more than 12 years, some government and industry actors have begun to doubt whether SIA will be delivered with the level of integration capabilities promised. Due to the centrality of robust data sharing to AI-based processing (see below), the armed forces and industry have begun exploring contingency alternatives to SIA, in the form of operational cloud-agnostic C2 systems and PaaS (platform-as-a-service), cloud-based variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative stagnation on cloud adoption has contributed to the desire to reimagine such programmes. MINARM has maintained its dedication to using domestic hosting solutions, although the lack of a French (or even European) provider of services comparable to US hyperscalers has reduced their ability to go “cloud-native”. A hybrid-cloud system also remains the focus of the MINARM, with various French tech and defence companies – sometimes in partnership with US hyperscalers – developing and testing a variety of solutions. Migration of unclassified data and services to a sovereign, public cloud has begun, but MINARM remains in conversation with industry about how best to store data at classified level and above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While enterprise-level cloud services are showing mixed success, there are also several combat cloud projects at different stages of completion. While not yet deployed at scale, the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), SCORPION and various naval experiments aim to create deployable, flexible cloud architectures with the aim of enabling MDO within the armed forces, with the vision of cross-domain integration to follow. However, these combat clouds are expected to integrate through SIA, making their full capability dependent on its development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MINARM’s main digital tech programme in terms of data processing and AI technologies is ARTEMIS.IA (Architecture de Traitement et d’Exploitation Massive de l’Information Multi-Sources et d’Intelligence Artificielle [Architecture for Massive Processing and Exploitation of Multi-Source Information and Artificial Intelligence]), delivered by a joint Thales/Atos venture. ARTEMIS.IA is intended to deliver big data storage, monitoring, processing and exploiting capabilities, and originated largely due to MINARM’s decision to not buy from the US-based Palantir. The programme has yet to be fully deployed for operational use, and has faced difficulties due to the complexity of the architecture required, the challenges of incorporating startups into the contracting process, the relative sluggishness of government decision and contracting cycles, and, according to some, the lack of competitiveness of its contracts. The programme’s final rollout should be outlined in the coming months (at the time of writing), but it demonstrates MINARM’s ability to leverage an integrated data-management system into operational insights with moderate success, and has been used to demonstrate the importance of cloud migration to the armed forces more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides ARTEMIS.IA, AI technologies are being incorporated in nearly every French tech programme across development and deployment functions. Examples include signals intelligence analysis, cyber defence, decision support, autonomous combat functions and predictive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security standards maintained by France are robust. The Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information (the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems, ANSSI), is the government body tasked with security IT systems across the whole of government, providing the accreditation for MINARM solutions. The French armed forces are also perceived as holding relatively restrictive data-sharing policies, which, while inhibiting advanced data-analytic functions, further improves the security of the cyber ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French governance structure for defence digitalisation is complex, with many agencies, directorates and programmes tasked with various elements of MINARM’s infrastructure, networks, applications and processes. This creates difficulty breaking down data siloes in a coordinated manner and reducing replication of functions and use cases. It is worth noting that despite its complexity, MINARM’s digitally relevant organisation has definitive authorities at each level and open communication between vertical and horizontal layers of the hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-challenges-1&quot;&gt;OTHER CHALLENGES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While France also lacks digital skills within its ranks, arguably the largest challenge is increased strain on multinational interoperability. Maintaining France’s desired degree of sovereignty in digital capabilities means that fewer systems are procured from common vendors, which puts constraints on easy technical interoperability. Yet as with several other countries in this research, France benefits from maintaining combined units with Germany and the UK, which forces each country to ensure a degree of interoperability between national systems to permit combined operations. Such units are often jumping-off points for wider multinational interoperability initiatives, but are not a substitute for wider NATO-interoperability. MINARM emphasises NATO Federated Mission Networking (FMN) in some of its networks, especially the French Operational network up to SECRET level (FrOpS), but the sufficiency of FMN for data-centric MDO functions remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;GERMANY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While possessing mature enterprise-level capabilities and burgeoning tactical-level capabilities, Germany’s Bundeswehr (armed forces) struggle to connect operational and enterprise digital efforts, and face numerous inhibitors politically, industrially and bureaucratically, all of which complicate their ability to enable large-scale MDO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;GOVERNANCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bundesministeriums der Verteidigung (Federal Ministry of Defence, BMVg) has published several policy and strategy documents outlining its perspectives on digitalisation, especially SDD, which is the key framework from the chief information officer (CIO) for advancing digitalisation. These documents demonstrate a holistic understanding of digitalisation at the enterprise level, as well as providing a detailed description of the governance mechanisms for such efforts. The focus on governance stems from historical political attitudes towards the armed forces, leading them to outline an increasing number of organisational structures to govern new capabilities. The result is a complex web of digital authorities, including: the Cyber- und Informationsraum (Cyber and Information Domain Service), a full service of the armed forces; the Digitalrat (the Federal Chancellery Digital Council); the Zentrum Digitalisierung der Bundeswehr (Digitalisation Center of the Bundeswehr); and digitalisation elements in each of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enterprise-capabilities&quot;&gt;ENTERPRISE CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s armed forces have some of the most exhaustive enterprise capabilities of the countries included in this paper. The BMVg uses SASPF as its core IT system, but is in the process of switching to SAP S/4HANA by the end of 2025. SAP S/4HANA will be used from the enterprise level to deployed platforms, and should streamline processes, enhance real-time data exploitation capabilities and create more flexible service integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of Bundeswehr services include Groupware Bw, the collaboration platform, which provides a number of advanced IT tools to users. Such services are being scaled at a faster pace than digitalisation programmes of other countries analysed in this paper, although this may reflect government-wide departmental digitalisations, rather than an ability to specifically field digital capabilities for armed forces. These services are currently slowly shifting towards being networked and digital, focusing on operations through deployable networks and IT, although the results of these efforts remain to be seen (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BMVg has adopted a multicloud model for hosting. While less reliant on US hyperscalers, due to fear of foreign interference, the model’s cloud infrastructure is in the early stages of development. Cloud services have yet to be rolled out across the enterprise, but projects are in progress. BWI (a private company owned by the BMVg) is jointly developing a private cloud called pCloudBw for the Bundeswehr, which should be approved up to classified level, but final approval, rollout and migration of platforms and services will take years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud limitations will hinder the widespread adoption of AI technologies, which are a current focus of innovation. Ongoing AI use cases include ISR, C4/C5 connectivity and situational awareness, and augmentation of support functions, but public and military hesitation have prevented the adoption of AI technologies for any functions related to killing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany has significant experience with cyber security due to frequent cyber attacks by state and non-state actors against it. Such experience is reflected in Germany’s defence cyber-security policies. There has been discussion within the defence sector of “secure by design” and “zero trust” environments, and progress on programmes such as the cryptographic modernisation of the Bundeswehr (KryptMBw), which is upgrading the encryption capabilities at SECRET and above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armed-forces&quot;&gt;ARMED FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s armed forces each face different priorities and challenges into the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest investment in a singular armament programme within a force is the Digitisation of Land Based Operations (D-LBO), which is intended to modernise C2 at the operational and tactical levels and create a core system architecture. Besides trying new contracting models that incentivise industrial cooperation, programme managers work with end-users to adapt systems throughout the programme lifecycle, instead of specifying all requirements at the beginning. D-LBO is providing badly needed capabilities to Germany’s technologically under-resourced land forces, using an open architecture (owned by the Bundeswehr) to connect radio and IT systems. However, the programme has already faced delays, and it remains to be seen how well these tactical capabilities will connect to other domains and partners. Alternatively, the Bundeswehr may see greater success with D-LBO’s basic variant, which is being rolled out to Germany’s Division 2025 as a test case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s air force is slowly modernising its networking ability, aiming squarely at achieving interoperability with allies, especially the US. Its procurement of advanced platforms such as the F-35 and development with FCAS are sure to increase its capabilities, but it faces a number of other challenges, such as foreign dependencies, timeliness of delivery and architectural complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s navy lags behind the country’s other forces, largely due to its historical underfunding, but it has set ambitious goals for its future capabilities, including better situational awareness and autonomous systems, alongside its notable German Mission Network project. While the size of the force means that progress has been modest, the navy has been searching for alternatives to its traditional cumbersome planning and procurement processes to develop new projects. Some experts believe that a programme similar to D-LBO will be necessary to meet current ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s armed forces exhibit a high degree of adherence to NATO standards, but they do not prioritise interoperability across their national forces to the same degree, instead focusing on maximising interoperability with their respective Allied forces, especially the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sovereignty-industry-and-innovation&quot;&gt;SOVEREIGNTY, INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany’s government has dedicated significant energy to promoting the concept of sovereignty across its broader digitalisation programmes, but the application of sovereignty towards the defence sector has been inhibited for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First is the lack of a singular definition on sovereignty, which complicates any unified vision of what a “sovereign” digital system would entail. Second is the relative lack of defence industrial capacity, stemming largely from historical underinvestment in the defence sector. The Zeitenwende fund has led to increased spending across defence, with about 20% specifically allocated to digitalisation programmes, but there has been little absorption of the funds so far. As such, budgets have been primarily focused on achieving a minimum capability, typically prioritising visible platforms that have the greatest industrial impact for German constituencies instead of digitalisation. In practice, the BMVg prioritises sovereignty when possible (especially with the onset of new digital defence companies), but has been willing to accept limitations on the sovereignty of its technology due to the irreplaceable nature of certain foreign firms, such as US hyperscalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides overall industrial capacity, the BMVg has yet to lay out a comprehensive framework for cooperation with industry, especially in the digital sector. It recently outlined a new defence industry strategy, but it is light on details about implementation for industrial innovation, accreditation, procurement and sustainment processes. Many of these failures stem from the dearth of digitally knowledgeable planning, as well as a disconnect between the enterprise and military operations. The Bundeswehr has struggled to describe its objectives below strategic level, especially regarding military performance, and often lacks concrete metrics against which performance can be measured. Commercial actor interviewees also described difficulty working with the BMVg’s outdated and lengthy accreditation processes, which constrains market access to key firms and further inhibits procurement and deployment of innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BMVg does possess innovation capacity in several hubs – especially the Cyber Innovation Hub of the Bundeswehr – but struggles to scale them. While possessing the necessary technological knowledge, these hubs lack financial and bureaucratic power and are typically insufficiently “embedded … with end users”, while the broader BMVg struggles to outline requirements and deploy the technology. German bureaucracy, especially defence bureaucracy, is also considered risk averse, further inhibiting the rollout of new innovations. The relative technological stagnation of the Bundeswehr contrasts sharply with the experience and dynamism of Germany’s commercial sector, reflecting both the bureaucratic hurdles to the innovation process and general political hesitation surrounding military capabilities. Politicising certain capabilities and procurement processes has hindered both the acquisition of technology and the willingness of private firms to expand into the defence sector. SMEs and startups face significant barriers to entry, including the complex governance structures discussed above, as well as a reputational risk due to the politicised nature of the armed forces in German society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poland&quot;&gt;POLAND&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland’s armed forces are rapidly modernising but lack an enterprise-level digitalisation strategy. Instead, digitalisation is viewed through the integration of modern networked platforms, alongside tactical digital capabilities and strong cyber-security capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;platform-centric-digitalisation&quot;&gt;PLATFORM-CENTRIC DIGITALISATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland’s Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej (Ministry of National Defence, MON) is in the midst of massive expansion and modernisation in its military platforms and capabilities, all of which increased in urgency following Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Instead of attempting to modernise in a whole-of-force manner, the MON drives modernisation through the procurement of advanced, largely Western systems. The purchase of C4ISR, air and missile defence systems, and the F-35 are enabling the expansion of digital capabilities, albeit in a piecemeal manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C4ISR systems at the tactical and operational levels, including the indigenous TOPAZ battlespace management system, provide battlefield connectivity and IT services to the end-user, alongside strike cueing and situational awareness. Such systems are necessary to achieving MDO, especially given the gradual integration of advanced algorithms for ISTAR tasks, but lack integration with higher echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland’s purchase of the Patriot air defence system and the Integrated Battle Command System has enabled a networked air and missile defence system that integrates a number of different missile defence systems. Such a system is further spurring the standardisation of data sharing across the many sensors and shooters that can drive wider digital connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing Poland’s defence digitalisation, nearly every interviewee mentioned the delivery of the F-35 as marking a step-change in the MON’s digital capabilities. Polish training on the aircraft began in 2024, with the delivery of 32 F-35As to begin in 2026. The F-35’s significant sensor and network features are expected to bring forward the development of the MON’s digital capabilities while ensuring network integration and data standardisation with the US and other F-35 NATO member users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland’s navy lags the country’s other armed forces in terms of digitalisation, although its Miecznik frigate programme is set to incorporate advanced integrated combat systems that would greatly enhance its multidomain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-capabilities&quot;&gt;OTHER CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new systems procured by Poland produce vast quantities of high-fidelity data to enable operations and support, yet the MON lacks the infrastructure to exploit this at scale. Instead, it has pockets of capability, mainly clustered close to the end-users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the MON’s centralised network and hosting capabilities are still nascent, it is likely that further development will be forthcoming. There seems to be a consensus that a hybrid cloud model is preferable, with lower-sensitivity material hosted by hyperscalers and private, nationally located clouds (almost certainly built by a US hyperscaler) operating at the classified and above levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MON provides modest enterprise-user services, including force readiness tools, collaboration platforms and even e-learning platforms. However, these solutions act more as one-off solutions to specific problem sets rather than part of a wider strategic digitalisation effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most developed of the MON’s enterprise-level digital capabilities are its cyber-security services, due to Poland’s status as one of the most frequently and intensively cyber attacked countries in the world. The Wojska Obrony Cyberprzestrzeni (Cyberspace Defense Forces, WOC) were created in 2022 to consolidate military cyber security, along with other technological innovation and implementation roles. The WOC provides active security for digital military systems and infrastructure, with its cyber-security tasks viewed as a wider commitment by the government to protecting Poland’s cyberspace from malign activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MON has deployed various AI technologies for specific tasks, to include battlespace management systems intelligence fusion, UAS enablement, cyber security and large language models for unnamed information analysis functions. Yet despite the MON’s creation of a ministry AI strategy, the implementation of AI technologies across defence lacks coherence and consistency. This can be attributed to many of the digitalisation challenges described below, but also to the MON’s failure to commit to a data-centric, cloud-native framework for developing, procuring and deploying digital technologies, especially AI. The lack of a “digital backbone” and supporting infrastructure exacerbates existing data siloes, preventing exploitation of the increasing number of data sources and sensors. The MON has recently announced the creation of an AI Implementation Centre under the WOC, although operational readiness dates, alongside tangible outcomes for this centre, remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integration-industry-and-sovereignty&quot;&gt;INTEGRATION, INDUSTRY AND SOVEREIGNTY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other major NATO armed forces, Poland’s armed forces operated almost entirely Warsaw Pact-era systems and platforms prior to recent modernisation, thereby limiting the quantity of NCW-era legacy systems requiring integration. Poland has thus avoided the scale of obsolescence challenges facing the other countries in this study, despite being further behind in most digital capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawback to a lack of legacy technology is the absence of the industrial base that provided those capabilities. Across the defence sector, Poland struggles to produce capabilities, instead finding it easier to procure from allies and modernise over time. Polish defence companies lack the experience, investments and (according to one expert) the will to compete with international firms. The organisational and cultural resistance to change further exacerbates these barriers: the MON cannot shake the perception of being weighed down by the conservative and rigid nature of innovation and procurement processes. Poland has a developing startup tech ecosystem, but the barriers to all but the most entrenched players cast doubt on whether these smaller firms will be able to scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poland’s platform-centric modernisation provides capability and interoperability with key allies, but it comes at a cost to non-hardware procurement. The political and military focus on mass, given the lessons from Ukraine, is understandable, but neglects software and infrastructure investments. Not only does this prevent the MON’s vision for MDO, but it also arrests the development of an industrial base within Poland capable of delivering SDD. While sovereignty remains an ambition, the MON appears to understand that it cannot produce all necessary capability domestically; however, this realism should not permit the ministry to neglect its domestic capacities. Overall, Poland is largely reliant on external technology and cooperation, especially from the US. Practical conversations about sovereignty aim at achieving a level of control over the country’s systems, rather than full control or sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decision-makers in the MON do not appear to value digitalisation by itself as a crucial military capability and enabler of modern operations. This is due, in part, to the relative lack of personnel with both digital awareness and strong digital skills. Poland has a number of relevant institutions, including military and civilian technical universities, but their graduates typically migrate to the more lucrative commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of clear, enterprise-driven digital strategies has been listed as among the most pressing challenges to the MON. Beyond enterprise digitalisation that can be attributed to government-wide digitalisation efforts, Poland’s armed forces are being pulled into digitalisation, rather than purposefully digitalising themselves. Absent a change to this policy, digitalisation is likely to continue in an ad hoc fashion, creating a patchwork of capabilities sown together that will struggle to act in an integrated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spain&quot;&gt;SPAIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the countries in this study, Spain lags the furthest in digital capabilities. The country is still digitalising its armed forces and lacks the financial heft, strategic vision or digitalisation enablers to scale modern digital innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-and-emerging-capabilities&quot;&gt;CURRENT AND EMERGING CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digitalisation of the Fuerzas Armadas de España (Spanish Armed Forces, FAS) is rooted largely in their “digital backbone” – the Infraestructura Integral de Información para la Defensa (Integrated Defence Information Infrastructure, I3D). The I3D has been developed as a single information environment to connect the disparate networks of the Ministerio de Defensa (Ministry of Defence, MINISDEF). The I3D was expected to reach full operational capacity in December 2024, and eventually integrate with combat platforms and sensors. Although it appears as the most centralised deployed digital backbone in this paper, it bears mentioning that the FAS’s networking does not need to account for the scale of legacy estate, nor does it require the scale of capabilities, as in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FAS are also seeking a hybrid cloud model, although enterprise capabilities are still nascent. The main applications and data used are on-premises, with cloud platforms only in pilot programmes. Many of the cloud investments are aimed towards combat clouds that are domain specific, with the vision that the various platforms will form an integrated combat environment. Combat clouds in the land domain are the closest to deployment, mainly due to the lack of technical integration with large, complex platforms in other domains. Naval cloud is in development, mainly through Navantia, although its capabilities and scalability will not be comparable to those of the US or the UK. The most significant cloud programme is FCAS, which is intended to serve as a vehicle for digitalisation and connectivity across the battlespace, although its delays indicate that cloud-enabled warfighting ability is some years away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MINISDEF has a unified governing body with appropriate budgetary and organisational authority for digital services and technology in the Centro de Sistemas y Tecnologías de la Información y las Comunicaciones (Centre for Information and Communications Systems and Technologies, CESTIC), a general directorate in charge of communication and information systems and technology, digital transformation, data and information security. CESTIC provides a number of digital services to the whole of the FAS, while maintaining the infrastructure for a significant legacy estate. Largely through CESTIC, MINISDEF has been able to deploy several advanced digital services, especially to streamline existing enterprise-level tasks. The most prominent example is ARGO, a harmonisation platform for the monitoring and management of processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, MINISDEF published a strategy for its development, implementation and use of AI, laying out a vision of an AI-enabled ministry and armed forces. The strategy describes the need for data infrastructure to underpin the technologies and safeguards for responsible AI deployment and a list of use cases. However, the rollout of AI does not match the coherence of this strategy. The FAS lack the integrated data infrastructure to enable the AI tech at scale, and many of their systems below the I3D are from an NCW, rather than SDD, perspective. Much of the work surrounding AI remains largely conceptual, especially with the superficial focus on the role of ethics and AI, and the AI technologies currently being deployed are mainly experiments for specific use cases. Full scaling and exploitation of AI tech are far off, especially until the FAS have deployed robust cloud, networking and data services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating AI tech into the I3D was a key objective, although the specifics of the use case and type of AI technology remain unclear. Given the I3D’s moderate success thus far, this could prove a key enterprise-level digital capability or may end up another dream without any solid plans for implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;constraining-factors&quot;&gt;CONSTRAINING FACTORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most glaring limitation of Spain’s digitalisation efforts stems from the scale of its overall military expenditure, which merits mention. As a share of GDP, it is among the lowest in NATO, even when considering the relative and absolute increases in spending over recent years. Lower defence spending leads to a more limited and rather consolidated military–industrial base, constraining domestic military innovation and disincentivising expansion into the military sector. Furthermore, the size of the budget prevents the FAS from investing significant capital in new technological capabilities after spending on maintaining current systems. Even while considering the caveats about calculating digital spending, Spain’s spending on digital capabilities as a proportion of overall defence spending is a fraction of other Western European NATO countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the FAS are procuring digital capabilities, they are not considered an effective buyer. The FAS’s processes prove difficult for industrial partners to penetrate, and act as a barrier for potential forays into the defence sector by other firms. The FAS also lack the coherence in their vision to avoid tensions between short-term operational need and wider digital transformation goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the other countries in this paper, Spain suffers from a lack of digital skills across its forces. The FAS struggle to recruit, train and retain digital skills at all echelons, but especially in IT expertise. Some of this stems from a lack of IT specialists within wider society, although Spain’s society has seen a higher level of digitalisation than the EU average. The government has been working on expanding technological penetration and development across society, particularly through programmes receiving at least partial EU funding. It is likely that continued digitalisation of commercial and government sectors would benefit both the defence industry and the commercial off-the-shelf capabilities available, and also enable commanders and MINISDEF actors to be savvier buyers, developers and deployers of digital capabilities. Nevertheless, Spain has yet to translate its current civilian digital advantage to defence digitalisation, so further developments may not benefit the armed forces equitably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain has committed itself to innovation and interoperability through both NATO and the EU, occasionally leading to a split focus, especially regarding funding. The government has invested significant sums in the European Defence Fund (EDF), including projects on digital transformation. The EDF might boost the strategic autonomy of Europe in defence, and is seen as offering better domestic industrial returns on investment than programmes such as NATO’s DIANA, but should ensure NATO interoperability by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has attempted to sidestep NATO criticism of its relatively low defence budget by claiming that Spain’s contributions cannot be viewed solely in monetary terms, instead pointing to the quantity of troops and platforms deployed across domains. And it is true that the FAS have benefited from their Alliance deployments to Iraq and along NATO’s eastern flank, and through hosting Allied naval and air units, leading to practical interoperability experience in deployed settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the other countries in this paper, Spain has emphasised the need to maintain a high level of sovereignty within its defence, and specifically digital defence, sector. Practically, such an ambition is unlikely, given the modest size of the military–industrial base and high degree of penetration by foreign companies. Focusing on a definition of sovereignty rooted in Europe would allow Spain to take advantage of wider innovation ecosystems, while leveraging its key firms (mainly Navantia, Indra and Airbus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain lacks a strategic vision for the digitalisation of its defence ecosystem. While strong strategies are not necessarily correlated with a capable force, the lack of an updated digitalisation strategy inhibits the FAS’s ability to create and implement a vision of what modernised armed forces will look like. The MINISDEF publishes the occasional short strategy through its official bulletin, but does not appear to have a cohering vision of what its armed forces and defence enterprise should look like when digitalised. The MINISDEF’S 2023 document on digital transformation and MDO demonstrated a clear understanding of the doctrinal and theoretical enabler necessary for digitally enabled MDO, but did not describe how such a vision could or will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cross-national-analysis-1&quot;&gt;CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple comparisons between the countries in this paper are not easy, due to the peculiarities of each country’s modernisation and/or digitalisation strategies and implementation methods, along with the state of their sovereign industrial bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, France demonstrated a higher level of scalability in its advanced digital technologies, especially for MDO enablement, while the UK, although possessing similar technologies, has struggled more to overcome its many procedural and organisational challenges to create integrated digital capabilities. Germany’s enterprise capabilities are arguably the most capable and advanced but are not mirrored in its ability – and political desire – to create an integrated, MDO-capable force. Poland’s platform-centric modernisation strategy is rapidly pulling its armed forces’ digital capabilities into the 21st century, but it will require a strong enterprise-level digitalisation vision to achieve full multidomain connectivity. While Spain has strong academic frameworks for digitalisation and MDO, it lacks strategic vision and implementation capacity, and the country is especially handicapped by the scale of defence spending and military–industrial base. Common challenges include a lack of digitally literate and skilled personnel, incompatible procurement processes, obsolescence, data silos and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sovereignty&quot;&gt;SOVEREIGNTY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country in this paper views the concept of sovereignty differently, and even often lack a common definition of the term internally. France sets the gold standard for sovereignty, but other states cannot, and should not, attempt to replicate this, as France has invested vast sums over decades in its military–industrial base. Instead, each country (hopefully in collaboration with one another) needs to define what it means by “digital sovereignty”. For example, taking one element of the stack, data, as sovereign, could include one or more of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;National data residency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allied/EU/European/NATO data residency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data services provided by an Allied/EU/European/NATO company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data services provided by a nationally headquartered company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data services created and/or owned by a national government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once defined, each country’s defence ministry needs to describe the feasibility of a capability to potentially achieving that definition of sovereignty, and how much this should be prioritised. Absent a definition and a candid feasibility analysis, sovereignty will continue to be banded as a rhetorical device that lacks any practical value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-skills&quot;&gt;DIGITAL SKILLS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence sector for each country described a lack of digital skills as a key inhibiter to the military’s ability to field modern digital technology. Some of these challenges cannot be divorced from broader recruitment and retention crises within European armed forces due to any number of factors. While the private digital tech sectors of some European countries face similar skills challenges, the pay discrepancy between public and private sectors was cited by interviewees as the key reason for the lack of IT specialists in the military. Each ministry is striving to upskill its overall workforce, but internal development of specialised IT skills alone cannot solve the skills gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond skills, defence decision-makers need to be technologically literate and understand the actual function of a given technology, as well as its specific use case. Failure to grasp the limitations of digital tech leads to ill-defined requirements, slow and costly procurements and incapable users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability&quot;&gt;INTEROPERABILITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert interviewees on each country described the desire to maintain NATO interoperability in their digital technology, although again, the exact meaning of this varies. Adherence to NATO standards acts as a baseline for multinational interoperability, but even they are often open to a degree of interpretation at the national level. British and French digital systems are not developed to be NATO-interoperable by design, despite neither country expecting to fight a major war on its own. The armed forces of Germany and Poland place greater emphasis on interoperability with Allies, especially the US, which is made easier by the procurement of platforms from Allied industrial bases. Due mainly to its Alliance deployments, Spain’s armed forces have been able to achieve a fair degree of interoperability with NATO, although their interoperability challenges with Allies are less due to standards, which are followed, and more due to differences in technological maturity. New concepts for modern systems have further hindered interoperability, such as the incompatibility of current security processes, with new ideas such as zero trust and software-defined cryptography making interoperable accreditation even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, adopting new or changing existing standards requires the acquiescence of all 32 NATO members, making compatibility with the rapid pace of digital innovations difficult. As discussed above, countries then often attempt to optimise interoperability with several key states, such as the US or countries with multinational units. This organic bilateral or multilateral interoperability is beneficial to the vision of an integrated force, but NATO must be clearer about its role in multinational standard-setting or standard-adoption. Adopting commercial standards has increased the speed of standard processes, but often still requires lengthy security verification and augmentation. The countries in this paper also often lack the political influence or desire to drive new standard-setting, leaving NATO interoperability a patchwork of integration platforms, application programming interfaces and duct tape across the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has sought to assess the digital defence priorities of five European countries – the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Spain – through their current capabilities and the challenges inhibiting their ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are mixed; the countries’ armed forces often possessed robust digital technologies but struggle to differing degrees on scaling and/or extending them to become genuine combat MDO enablers. Since these forces have committed themselves to MDO and SDD, requiring organic connectivity and strong digital enablers, they must either rise to the challenges posed by digitalisation or reduce their ambitions. European governments appear to be committing to investing large sums of money to mitigate such issues by stimulating domestic defence industry, but bureaucratic inhibitors, growing frictions with key allies, domestic political conflicts, and workforce skill shortages will limit any progress in achieving digital transformation. With this in mind, there appear to be three main paths forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay the course and continue to digitalise according to current strategies and methods.&lt;/strong&gt; The result will be pockets of advanced capability and connectivity, but also a lack of national technological autonomy, a struggle to integrate systems domestically and multinationally, and continued difficulty scaling capabilities. The dearth of digital skills seems unlikely to be solved in the near term, along with the many bureaucratic procedural challenges stunting digitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase dependence on non-sovereign technology providers.&lt;/strong&gt; By eschewing the need for sovereignty, countries could theoretically reduce their costs while making interoperability much more similar due to a greater number of shared systems. However, the price of strategic autonomy in losing control of data, intellectual property, system ownership and – crucially – industrial base, precludes this as a feasible option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce ambitions.&lt;/strong&gt; The exact goals of digitalisation differ across governments, from enabling MDO to enhancing enterprise efficiency, but armed forces might achieve more success if they set modest, measurable objectives for their various digitalisation efforts. Ambitions for idealised notions of sovereignty, perfect connectivity, integration or interoperability and world-class capabilities may have to be tempered, with “full digitalisation” (whatever forces might mean by this) replaced by quantifiable levels of digital capabilities to be achieved by set dates. Such an approach could include European collaboration on capability development and procurement, but this alone would not close the gap between ambition and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Europe’s path forward will depend on a clear-eyed assessment of its strategic priorities, resources and political will. The most realistic pathway, allowing armed forces to achieve focused, measurable advances, given resource constraints, may be achieved by tempering ambitions. However, such a shift will require making difficult decisions about what to prioritise, alongside a willingness to redefine success in digitalisation. Whichever path is taken, defence ministries, commanders and politicians must determine how digital technology fits coherently within their strategic modernisation frameworks. Navigating these challenges will shape Europe’s defence modernisation and potentially redefine the capabilities of its armed forces for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia) faces its most serious institutional crisis since 2001, when the largest Bosnian Croat party withdrew from the majority of the country’s institutions and attempted to establish an illegal parallel system in Croat-majority areas. Today, the threat comes from Republika Srpska (RS), a majority Serb region, whose leadership is actively trying to dismantle the foundations of the post-war state. While echoes of the past are unavoidable, today’s crisis also reflects new realities and changed dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;republika-srpskas-challenge-to-bosnias-constitutional-order&quot;&gt;Republika Srpska’s Challenge to Bosnia’s Constitutional Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 27 February 2025, RS lawmakers passed laws aimed at stripping state institutions of authority over the judiciary and law enforcement. These laws effectively declare that RS institutions no longer recognise the legitimacy of the state court and its central law enforcement agency. Another law, inspired by Russia’s foreign agent legislation, targets civil society organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these laws took effect on 7 March, the RS interior ministry tried to order the state-level police agency to vacate its premises, escalating tensions and increasing the risk of direct confrontation. The Constitutional Court swiftly suspended these laws, but RS authorities pressed ahead, introducing financial and employment regulations for individuals who are expected to shift to RS jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More alarmingly, RS has begun legislative activities aimed at forming its own border police and inteligence agency, and drafting a new constitution. The draft abolishes protection mechanisms for non-Serbs, asserts RS’s right to self-determination, allows for potential confederation with Serbia, and envisions an RS army – severing ties with Bosnia’s key state institutions established since the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;milorad-dodiks-gamble&quot;&gt;Milorad Dodik’s Gamble&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the centre of this crisis is Milorad Dodik, the RS president and a veteran of the country’s post-war politics. He calculated that geopolitical shifts – Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán blocking EU responses, and Serbia’s passive stance – would create the conditions for his strategy to succeed. As well as his grip over RS institutions allowing him to enforce compliance, declaring, “the winners will be those who have the force to implement laws. And in this case, that is Republika Srpska.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, events have not unfolded as he expected. The near-confrontation between police forces left him without Orbán’s public support for the steps which followed. The Trump administration, keen to avoid another European crises, pushed back. US secretary of state Marco Rubio reaffirmed Washington’s support for Bosnia’s constitutional order, urging regional partners “to join us in pushing back against this dangerous and destabilising behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU too has not remained passive. Germany signalled its readiness to impose sanctions, including for the first time those targeting individuals. Austria also, for the first time, called for sanctions against Dodik. The European Commission privately warned of cutting financial support to RS, while France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Turkey issued strong warnings. Turkey’s engagement is particularly notable, given Dodik’s past assertions of close ties with president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rs-opposition-and-institutional-resilience&quot;&gt;The RS Opposition and Institutional Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the crisis has not played entirely in Dodik’s favour. For the first time since 2006, the RS opposition has found a compelling narrative – arguing that this crisis is not about the well-being of RS or Serbs but about Dodik himself, who is jeopardising the economy, stability and autonomy. State institutions, while under immense pressure, have proven more resilient than expected. Serb civil servants and officials have so far not abandoned them en masse, and institutions under attack continue to somewhat operate on the RS territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodik and his inner circle, however, show no intention of backing down. With two criminal cases against him, he has little to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 26 February 2025, the state court convicted Dodik in a first-instance ruling to a one-year prison sentence and a six-year ban from public office for defying the decisions of the international high representative. Since 1997, the holder of this office, created under the Dayton Peace Agreement, has had Bonn powers enabling him to dismiss officials, impose laws, and annul decisions. In 2023, facing growing resistance, the current officeholder, former German politician Christian Schmidt, criminalised the non-implementation of his rulings – a law now being tested for the first time in Dodik’s case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate investigation into Dodik, as well as RS Prime Minister Radovan Višković and the current speaker of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, Nenad Stevandić, is for attempting to undermine constitutional order, and was initiated in December 2024. After the steps taken by the RS authorities in the aftermath of the Constitutional Court’s decision to suspend the RS legislation, and the refusal by the RS leadership to appear for questioning, the state court announced on 17 March that it ordered pre-trial detention for all three. In theory, all law enforcement agencies, including border police, are now required to enforce this order. However, due to Dodik’s influence over RS security structures and broader stability considerations by other institutions, this has not yet been implemented. This standoff is a test of endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serbias-role-and-two-visions-for-bosnia&quot;&gt;Serbia’s Role and Two Visions for Bosnia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, has met Dodik twice since 26 February, while his prime minister and deputy prime ministers travelled to Banja Luka in a show of support. At home, Vučić sought to use the crisis to deflect attention from the ongoing protests challenging his rule. Abroad, he insisted he is “doing everything possible to… keep Republika Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina.” But his actions embolden Dodik. In Summer 2024 – Vučić and Dodik orchestrated the All-Serb Assembly, which endorsed RS’s non-existing right to unilaterally reclaim all state-level competencies transferred since 1995, including defence, taxation, and law enforcement. Both knew these moves would be unconstitutional and would provoke a crisis. That was the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision of a stronger RS at the expence of the state – one which would allow for the eventual annexation of Serb-majority areas – existed among Serb intelectuals and politicians since Dayton was signed in 1995. A version of this vision had already fuelled the wars of the 1990s, displacing two million people, killing 100,000, and culminating in the genocide in Srebrenica. To prevent its realisation, Dayton aimed to restore Bosnia’s multi-ethnic character through refugee return, war crimes prosecutions, and special mechanisms of protection for the rights of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats across the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International engagement made progress possible. Today, almost 20 percent of Republika Srpska’s population are non-Serbs. But the other vision never disappeared. It was kept in check primarily by strong initial US leadership and the EU’s promise of full membership, which offered a vision of less visible borders and economic benefits. With the support of Serb politicians, including Dodik, Bosnia established key institutions such as a unified army, a tax administration, state-level police and judiciary, and a border police. These reforms succeeded because they ensured RS had a say in the newly established institutions and, more importantly, because they provided concrete advantages in relations with NATO and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2006 creation of a joint army came with a promise of full NATO membership – something that at that time most Bosnian Serb politicians embraced. Eventually, however, its realisation was blocked due to miscalculated conditionality set by NATO allies at the 2010 Tallinn Summit. By 2014, encouraged by Vladimir Putin and his illegal Crimea annexation, Dodik reversed course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other state-level institutions, from police agencies, to bodies in charged with issuing travel documents, had all been established to secure a 2008 free trade deal with the EU, and visa-free Schengen travel in 2010. But after that, the EU abandoned its momentum on integration. With no new benefits, there was no incentive to build or strengthen institutions. Bosnia entered political deadlock, and the vision of monoethnic territories and a stronger RS resurfaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-easy-way-out-of-the-current-crisis&quot;&gt;No Easy Way Out of the Current Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no easy way out of the current crisis – no quick fixes. But one thing is clear: it is up to the state-level institutions to show resilience and the EU to take the lead in supporting them. The EU must seize the unexpected but welcome window created by the Trump administration, recognising that sustained US engagement at the level seen in the past is unlikely. While public statements may continue, USAID and embassy cuts will limit US interest and influence. Meanwhile, the UK’s strategic dialogue with the EU and its readiness to engage in the Balkans make it a crucial partner. The EU must capitalise on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This EU’s lead starts with recognition that Bosnia and the Western Balkans region need a credible EU membership perspective. The new European Commission, led by its president Ursula von der Leyen and commissioner in charge for enlargement, Marta Kos, has pledged their ability to finalise technical aspects of membership negotiations with at least three Western Balkans states, Ukraine and Moldova by the end of the decade. As well as to make significant progress with other candidates, including Bosnia. Without full support from all member states, however, these promises ring hollow. Member states must therefore make a firm joint and public political commitment to prepare for EU’s institutions, policies and budget for enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they should explicitly state that any candidate meeting the necessary obligations and demonstrating a robust rule of law will gain full access to the single market and its four freedoms before full membership, and as soon as they fulfill conditions. This would give the European Commission the mandate to act and strengthen the EU’s credibility in the region and beyond, including in Ukraine and Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodik has gone further than ever before in challenging Bosnia’s constitutional order, creating real risks of institutional collapse and violence. This escalation is dangerous – but it is also an opportunity to finally halt a long-term agenda of undermining state institutions. A mere pause should not be enough; what is needed is clear evidence that all decisions of the state-level Constitutional Court are respected, that all laws and by-laws adopted by RS institutions in defiance of the constitutional order are annulled, and that all political declarations – including various conclusions – are withdrawn. The EU must also reaffirm Bosnia’s existing institutions as essential for its current level of integration, including the free trade flow, visa-free travel, and future accession. If requested, the EU Special Representative and EU’s military mission (EUFOR Althea) on the ground must support domestic institutions in upholding stability and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stronger EU commitment to Bosnia’s accession must be paired with clear expectations and guarantees. While Bosnia’s constitutional structure will remain in place and mostly unchanged, reforms are necessary to align it with EU standards and ensure it can effectively enforce single market rules. This includes ending the Bonn Powers of the high representative. Other key reforms, such as implementing European Court of Human Rights rulings, should be addressed through the EU accession process. A roadmap for democracy and the rule of law, established at the start of negotiations, would guide these discussions. Such perspective would allow stronger credibility to those who oppose Dodik’s activities – both within his own ranks and in the RS opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the EU must address security guarantees for Bosnia and Herzegovina. In particular the future of the EUFOR Althea military mission, which depends on an annual UN Security Council mandate vulnerable to Russian and Chinese vetoes. A sustainable solution might be to shift the mission under a joint EU-NATO agreement with Bosnian collective head of the state, the Presidency, potentially involving the UK and Turkey. This would preserve EUFOR’s mandate and authority, ensuring stability until Bosnia joins the EU and comes under its mutual defence clause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU and its partners have a choice: immediately push back against Dodik and Vučić, by drawing clear red lines and spelling out consequences, or risk Bosnia and the Western Balkans sliding into deeper crisis. The first step must be firm resistance to their destabilising actions, backed by tangible support for Bosnia’s institutions. This time, the EU must lead decisively – hesitation will only embolden those seeking to dismantle the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two months into President Trump’s tenure in the White House, his promised and highly publicised quick resolution of Russia’s war in Ukraine remains as unclear and confusing as ever. Following a controversial Oval Office meeting with President Zelensky, Ukraine took steps to mend relations with the US administration, first proposing a staged ceasefire, later accepting a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and most recently a ceasefire on energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s position – that it seeks a comprehensive agreement rather than interim measures – is a familiar tactic. Russia wants to signal that it is in no hurry, while continuing to use violence as leverage against Ukraine and, more importantly, against a US administration eager for a quick resolution. It remains highly uncertain whether any ceasefire will actually take hold and be upheld – and, crucially, whether the US will press for more concessions from Russia or from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the prospect of a sustainable end to the war is undoubtedly a commendable goal. There is no doubt that the country is suffering gravely from the violence, and peace remains its greatest aspiration. However, the credibility and reliability of any peace arrangements are absolutely critical to ensure – peace will only be as robust as the means by which it is protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-approach-to-negotiations&quot;&gt;Russia’s Approach to Negotiations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the uncertainty and contradictions surrounding the US-led peace efforts, as well as Washington’s shift to deprioritise European security, Russia’s fundamental objectives remain unchanged. Intelligence specialists and analysts widely agree that Russia continues to pursue its original strategy of undermining Ukraine and Europe’s security architecture. Every action Moscow takes is ultimately geared towards achieving these enduring goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling relatively secure in its current position and ready to exploit the US administration’s stated commitment to ending the war through diplomacy, Russia has two options. Either continue hostilities or attempt to gain an advantage through diplomatic manoeuvres. Any diplomatic breakthrough that Russia achieves will, however, be incorporated into its broader grand strategy. There is a high probability that the Kremlin will then use any cessation or reduction of hostilities to prepare for the next phase of its military campaign. If the US manages to broker a comprehensive ceasefire, Russia will likely treat it as an operational or strategic pause, a window of opportunity to strengthen its position before launching a decisive strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should this plan succeed, a renewed Russian offensive could deal a devastating blow both to Ukraine and to Europe’s security. Moscow views the current situation as a historic opportunity, where a convergence of favourable conditions creates the perfect storm. The US administration no longer considers the Russian regime an outright adversary and has repeatedly failed to condemn its numerous war crimes and genocidal policies. It refuses to identify Russia as the aggressor and openly discusses “enormous economic opportunities” and the prospect of normalisation – something that, until now, would have been unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-states-risks-facilitating-further-russian-aggression&quot;&gt;The United States Risks Facilitating Further Russian Aggression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the cornerstone of NATO and European security, the United States’ ambiguous position creates deep uncertainty about its response should Russian aggression expand into other European countries. If Moscow manages to negotiate the lifting of sanctions in exchange for a ceasefire, its militarised economy will quickly regain strength, and in a very short time Russia could once again emerge as a formidable military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Russia is exhausted and severely weakened by its military failures in Ukraine. It lacks the ability to amass the necessary mass of equipment, and it is visibly running out of personnel. Equally significant is the fact that its warfighting methods are no longer effective – even the brutal human-wave assaults that proved successful in 2023 and 2024 are now failing to deliver decisive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ceasefire would provide Russia with the time it needs to reassess its approach and rebuild a military force based on new operational concepts. The Russian war economy is too deeply entrenched to be quickly dismantled or converted back to a civilian model, but it is unlikely that de-escalation is even a strategic objective. Instead, Moscow is likely to be motivated by a drive to compensate for past underperformance coupled with a sense of strategic opportunity created by US policy shifts. A ceasefire is, therefore, likely to lead to a dramatic new phase of Russian militarisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical precedents support this possibility. Iraq’s military re-emerged in 1991 after enduring the hardships of the Iran-Iraq War, while revanchist ambitions fuelled Nazi Germany’s military expansion following early setbacks. Russia may well follow a similar trajectory, using the lessons of this war to rebuild an even stronger force and emerge from its war of attrition in Ukraine with a revamped military – its own version of a new “Grande Armée”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere presence of such a revitalised Russian force along Europe’s borders would constitute an existential threat to its neighbours, granting Moscow immense leverage over the region. Beyond direct military pressure, Russia would certainly employ a full spectrum of hybrid warfare tactics, including political coercion, cyber operations, and economic manipulation. It could also destabilise multiple regions, including the Arctic, the Baltic, Balkans, Poland, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean. Ukraine, of course, would remain at the highest risk, with a renewed Russian offensive highly probable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Black Sea Straits are reopened, it would enable Moscow to rebuild its Black Sea Fleet, once again posing a threat to freedom of navigation, endangering Ukrainian ports, and extending the threat to Moldova from the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-imperative-of-building-european-deterrence&quot;&gt;The Imperative of Building European Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to prevent this scenario is to recognise the severity of the threat and build a force capable of making Russian aggression futile. Given Russia’s demonstrated willingness to absorb significant losses, deterrence by punishment is unlikely to be effective. Instead, only deterrence by denial – ensuring that any future attack would be impossible or overwhelmingly costly – can secure lasting peace in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deterrence strategy must no longer be viewed as simply assisting Ukraine in isolation from NATO Europe. Russia has long been recognised as a pan-European threat – while Ukraine remains Putin’s primary focus, it is not his only target. Therefore, deterrence must be pan-European, treating Ukraine’s security as an integral part of the broader European defence architecture. While the Europeans are trying to persuade US administration to provide them with a backstop, the probability, extent and reliability of such support are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the existing structures of NATO and the EU cannot serve as the foundation for this effort, the only viable solution is the formation of a coalition of the willing, committed to ensuring that Russia is permanently denied the ability to wage expansionist war. Security arrangements must incorporate all fundamental elements of effective deterrence: they must be credible, rooted in capabilities proportionate to the threat, and clearly communicated to both Russia and the wider international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, they must be built on concepts of future warfare rather than outdated strategies. Legacy methods will prove ineffective against a Russian force that has adapted its doctrine based on lessons learned and technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key lessons from three years of war is that the most effective way for coalition governments and militaries to engage fully is to launch a dedicated operation aimed at countering the risk of a renewed Russian attack. Such an operation should be coordinated through a joint headquarters, with each participating state undertaking the necessary organisational steps within their respective ministries of defence to ensure its implementation. Those familiar with military structures understand that only an active, ongoing operation enables proper resource allocation, rapid decision-making, and the deployment of dedicated personnel. Military actions must be governed by structured operational planning, integrated command structures, and strict operational timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this article, such an operation will be referred to as the Eastern Frontier Operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integrating-ukraines-defence-into-european-deterrence&quot;&gt;Integrating Ukraine’s Defence into European Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition participants must recognise that Russia will be vocally opposed to this initiative from the outset. Moscow has a well-established pattern of justifying its aggression through victim-blaming narratives, claiming that the “true causes” of the war lie elsewhere. Every instance of international military cooperation with Ukraine has been framed by Russia as a provocation or justification for its own aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers must be fully aware of these tactics, resist falling into Russia’s narrative traps, and remain firm in establishing robust security arrangements. Any form of self-deterrence in setting up these measures would weaken the region and increase the risk of renewed hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian component of the Eastern Frontier Operation must be designed to enable Ukraine to withstand and successfully repel a potential future full-scale Russian attack. This comprehensive defensive capability should integrate the Ukrainian defence forces, the country’s full mobilisation potential, and dedicated resources provided by allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operational framework must be structured as a multi-domain effort, encompassing the generation, sustainment, and deployment of capabilities across land, air, maritime, cyber, and information domains. Implementing this strategy will be an extremely complex undertaking, requiring meticulous planning and substantial contributions from coalition participants. As of now, we can identify seven potential formats in which Western forces could participate in the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most committed form of participation would be the direct deployment of troops in Ukraine, with active engagement in the event of renewed Russian aggression. This scenario, often referred to as “boots on the ground”, has been widely debated. The presence of land forces may, however, be less effective compared to other strategic options. A more impactful approach could be “airmen boots” – the deployment of aerial and air defence units to protect Ukrainian airspace from Russian strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most compelling alternative proposals is a “Sky Shield over Ukraine”, a concept involving the air policing of Ukrainian airspace, particularly over its western and central regions, to defend against Russian missile and air strikes. This initiative could establish a large safe zone, enabling social stability and economic recovery, while allowing the Ukrainian Air Force to concentrate its resources on defending the eastern front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option for Western assistance could be monitoring the ceasefire. A dedicated monitoring mission, equipped with advanced technology and surveillance tools, would be essential to maintaining constant situational awareness. Past phases of the Russo-Ukrainian war have been marked by repeated ceasefire violations and mutual accusations, which the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission failed to address effectively due to its limited access and inadequate equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth option involves remote capability support, including the provision of real-time intelligence, training, technical advice, and maintenance. This could also extend to remote operations, such as defensive cyber operations and information warfare, which would strengthen Ukraine’s ability to counter Russian aggression without requiring a direct Western presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fifth option is the creation of strategic reserves for Ukraine in the form of pre-positioned military assets and capabilities. These resources would be immediately available, stored in secure locations in Eastern Europe, and operated by the coalition headquarters. Such facilities could function as a network of depots, housing weapons, ammunition, and essential military equipment near Ukraine’s borders. In the event of renewed hostilities, these reserves would enable the rapid mobilisation and rearmament of Ukrainian forces, allowing them to counter a large-scale Russian offensive effectively. These warehouses would store additional armaments, spare parts, ammunition, expendables, communication systems, and other critical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another crucial form of support would be the direct provision of modern Western equipment to Ukraine’s defence forces. The most pressing requirement is sufficient ground-based air defence systems and advanced tactical aviation to prevent Russia from establishing air superiority. If Ukraine achieves air dominance over its own territory, the likelihood of a renewed Russian offensive will be significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Ukraine must have long-range missile systems capable of striking deep into enemy territory, targeting command and control centres, logistics hubs, and supply lines. Precision strikes on these key assets would significantly weaken Russia’s capacity to sustain large-scale military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While warfare technologies continue to evolve, certain core military assets remain indispensable. Ukraine will continue to require artillery, MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles), and firearms, all of which are essential for sustained ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the allies can further strengthen Ukraine’s long-term defence capabilities by enhancing support for its domestic defence industry, particularly in areas where Ukraine is already technologically advanced. The development of Ukraine’s defence sector is well underway and should be expanded and accelerated. This includes investment in unmanned systems, electronic warfare technologies, and other critical defence innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a force capable of credibly deterring and repelling Russian aggression will be a formidable challenge. However, the coalition’s collective technological, industrial, and economic resources far exceed those of Russia, making this goal fully achievable. Through joint efforts, a unified threat assessment, decisive action, and resilience against Russian intimidation, the coalition can forge a security framework that ensures long-term peace and stability across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

Coordination is needed at the EU level to develop local value chains and to ensure that strong EV demand rebounds, providing continued support for the industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial transformation and competition with China in the automotive sector are key challenges for the European Union, but could also offer some opportunities. Policymakers in Brussels and European capitals will need to pursue smart policies to raise competitiveness and address growing competition with an eye to economic security. Although trade defense tools will continue to play a role in policy, the European Union is considering leveraging Chinese foreign direct investment. More active coordination will be needed at the EU level to develop local value chains and to ensure that strong electric vehicle demand rebounds, providing continued support for the growth of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that the European Union and its member states face a critical moment in economic, security, and foreign policy. Documents and speeches by high-level European policymakers over the past few years have pointed to the mounting need for strategic reforms to support industrial transformation and technological innovation, manage dependencies on and competition with China, balance the rapidly evolving relationship with the United States, and achieve progress on climate goals. These complex and overlapping priorities are evident in the European automotive industry, once seen as an example of Europe’s dynamism and now a source of growing concern. The metaphor is not lost in Brussels, as rapid growth in automotive exports from China to Europe contrasts with the disappointing performance of European automakers in China in recent years, and the bloc’s slow progress on electric mobility and digitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate over the automotive sector and electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe is shaped by two central issues that reflect the dual nature of the challenge: Policymakers need to increase European competitiveness, which has been declining in relative terms over the past several years, while addressing increasing competition from China. There is an open debate as to how much low production costs in China are attached to distortive subsidies and overcapacity as opposed to innovative and competitive dynamics. Exploring this distinction is still important, because manufacturing practices and innovation can be replicated, reproduced, and transferred, which means that embracing competition with China and foreign direct investment (FDI) in some areas may have potential benefits. In reality, it is difficult to distinguish where subsidies end and innovation begins, and even outside of China, the state is beginning to play a far more active role in supporting strategic industries. These dynamics complicate the use of trade measures, which for the most part under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules are meant to allow domestic players to catch up rather than to survive indefinitely in a protected market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a broader political and geopolitical dynamic at play: Governments are being forced to rethink their relationship with automotive companies that were, until recently, a source of pride, as their global value chains become potential geopolitical and economic liabilities. Part of the reason for the industry’s current woes is that many European manufacturers were slow to recognize the potential of EVs and make significant advances in digital integration in the face of increasing Chinese competition. Traditional Western automotive companies will need to catch up on digital platforms and autonomous driving capabilities as well, which tend to have strong performances on EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly politically influential companies in the automotive industry, especially in Germany, are also heavily exposed to the Chinese market and have continued to invest in China even as they consider shrinking their European footprint, further highlighting policymakers’ dilemma. Yet slow demand for EVs in Europe, which might seem like a relief for European carmakers, could further exacerbate competition with China—especially at a time when internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) exports from China could still increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totally dismissing automotive companies’ rationale for their supply chain organization would be a mistake. If policymakers want to achieve change in the supply chains, they must address the underlying incentive structure and recognize limits and trade-offs. Extensive industrial policy spending in China benefitting the automotive industry is well documented, but the industry also benefits from integrated value chains and cost advantages associated with production in China. For example, U.S.-based Tesla, the second-largest EV maker in the world, has leveraged its Shanghai factory in China to export hundreds of thousands of cars to Europe, rather than expand its U.S. or European production. Even if the Chinese industry were to consolidate and reduce manufacturing overcapacity, Europe will still have a competitiveness gap to breach in order to ensure it remains an attractive place to develop and make cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Chinese companies may increase investment in Europe to access the EU market—if demand for EVs holds. Much of Europe’s ability to shape standards, value chains, and company decisions on the location of production will hinge on continued and strong European demand for EVs. Increasing coordination across member states on FDI from China in the automotive sector and introducing stronger localization requirements could help develop a stronger domestic value chain—especially if other conditions are in place to ensure a certain level of diversification and long-term European innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-China relations will also continue to affect global value chains. For example, if current U.S. rules on connected vehicles remain in place as expected, cars containing certain components and software made in China or by Chinese companies may no longer be sold in the United States in the coming years, posing a challenge for several European auto companies. Indeed, Europe itself will also have to contend with the security implications attached to connected vehicles, although it appears increasingly less likely that this will happen in coordination with the United States. European auto exports will also face higher tariffs to enter the U.S. market if no agreement is reached between Washington and Brussels, which would further complicate the outlook for European companies that rely on complex global value chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenges outlined above, this policy brief provides context for how trade with and investment from China pose challenges and potential opportunities for Europe, offers suggestions for how to best navigate the current trends and discusses implications for the United States. The brief will first address the geopolitical and changing international economic environment, including Europe’s relations with China and the United States. Second, it will analyze how the traditional automotive industry has been disrupted by the rise of EVs and Chinese manufacturing. Finally, it will address current debates over Chinese investment in Europe, offer recommendations for European policymakers, and discuss implications for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-geopolitical-relationships&quot;&gt;Changing Geopolitical Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The industrial transformation required for the European automotive industry to regain competitiveness is complicated by the changing and increasingly adversarial global geopolitical environment. Europe’s relationship with China has shifted rapidly in recent years to an uncomfortable competition centered around economic security. As late as 2020, Beijing and Brussels were still negotiating the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), which would have linked the two economies even more closely. The agreement was put on hold by the EU parliament in 2021 after some of its members and European scholars were sanctioned by the Chinese government for their position on Xinjiang. The rapid shift in attitudes toward the investment deal with China mirrors a broader change in the relationship, which is far more tense today than it was a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 played a central role in reshaping European perspectives on economic security and bringing dependencies on China under closer scrutiny. Since then, relations between the European Union and China have deteriorated, as the European Commission has taken a more defensive stance and has launched multiple investigations targeting Chinese firms through several new tools aimed at protecting Europe’s economic security, including the Foreign Subsidy Regulation. Even more explicitly, the Anti-Coercion Instrument was developed to counter economic coercion after a diplomatic dispute with Lithuania led China to carry out a series of punitive economic measures. More broadly, 44 out of the 60 ongoing EU trade defense cases target China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-subsidy investigation on EVs made in China, which led to the imposition of tariffs in late 2024, is by far the most high-profile of these investigations and central to high-level discussions between Brussels and Beijing. Europe’s export surplus with China in the automotive sector has been rapidly declining over the past five years, highlighting how quickly markets are shifting in ways that confront Brussels and other European capitals with difficult choices on trade and economic policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brussels is now bracing itself for a more confrontational relationship with Washington under the Trump presidency on issues surrounding trade, defense, and the war in Ukraine. This shift comes with several challenges, including potential damages to the European economy due to tariffs, the need to reallocate more spending toward defense, and potentially more pressure to align with the United States on technology restrictions concerning China, should Washington decide to ramp up pressure on Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite significant wariness of increasing dependencies on China, changes in the transatlantic relationship may also entice the European Commission to strike a more conciliatory note on Chinese investment and trade to avoid fighting trade wars on two fronts at a time when the European economy is struggling to find its footing. Yet, growing exports from China will make that balance challenging, especially since they may be directly competing with European manufacturing. Despite commitments to increase domestic consumption in China in the latest government documents, the trend is unlikely to change in the short term, and if the United States continues to impose higher tariffs on goods from China, Europe may find itself having to absorb or deflect a growing number of exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade-and-innovation-in-the-automotive-sector&quot;&gt;Trade and Innovation in the Automotive Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to overstate the importance of the automotive sector to the European economy: 4 of the top 10 automakers globally are headquartered in Europe, and the automotive sector represents about 8 percent of manufacturing value added and over 6 percent of total employment for the European Union. The sector’s importance also varies significantly across regions (ranging from 16 percent of total manufacturing for Slovakia to less than 1 percent for Greece), complicating the political economy of the sector as some countries have much less to lose than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges in the automotive market come at a crucial time for Europe as it seeks to revive a stagnating economy, address long-term structural challenges to its competitiveness that could undermine its single market, and will likely have to rapidly increase defense spending. Within this context, the European Commission and member states have had to confront a rapid uptick in exports of EVs from China since 2020 that help fulfill demand given still-limited production in Europe of EVs, but that could upend current and future European production (see Figure 1). EV exports from China still comprise many Tesla and Western-branded vehicles made through joint ventures with Chinese firms, although the relative share of Chinese brands has been increasing rapidly. It is worth noting that exports of EVs from China to Europe may have peaked in the fall of 2024, after tariffs were introduced, although it is likely too early to tell whether this is a long-term trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariffs can have unexpected undesirable effects: For example, some Chinese manufacturers have indicated that they may pivot to exporting more plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) from China to Europe, since they are not subject to tariffs. PHEVs would still present a competitive challenge for European manufacturers, but their contribution to emission reduction is far less significant than that of battery electric vehicles, which are currently subject to tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although less significant in terms of value and volume, a significant uptick in exports of ICE vehicles from China to Europe, which are not subject to the additional tariffs levied on EVs since 2024, is now an established trend (see Figure 2). Although Europe still exports more ICE vehicles to China than it imports, the growth over the past two years merits attention, especially given how quickly the market has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global ICE automotive exports from China have surged over the past few years, outpacing EVs (see Figure 3). Unlike in the case of EVs, the main destination for these exports has not been Europe, but rather Russia and emerging markets including Mexico. However, this may change as the quality of Chinese-branded ICE vehicles increases and more western brands are exported from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Chinese consumers shift towards EVs, which including PHEVs accounted for almost half of new vehicle sales in China in the second half of 2024 (see Figure 4), growing overcapacity in ICE vehicle production is incentivizing producers to export more. Although some ICE vehicle factories in China are being repurposed or shut down, the shift in consumer preference has been so rapid that it may take years for production capacity to follow suit—especially if foreign markets remain available and companies producing domestically continue to receive some level of institutional support in the form of industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HgAEgwI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here too, in some cases, Western automakers may be tempted to use their Chinese joint ventures to export to Europe or elsewhere rather than close them as demand for ICE vehicles declines in China. Regardless, the trend could have disastrous implications for emissions globally by increasing the global supply of ICE vehicles at a time when some markets could be accelerating their transition to low-carbon transport. It also highlights how European manufacturing faces increased competition with China on all technologies domestically and in third markets. Focusing solely on competition in the EV sector or solely on Chinese brands would risk losing sight of the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of competing in electric mobility have led some to believe that by slowing down the deployment of EVs, traditional ICE vehicle manufacturers can improve their competitiveness. The argument in Europe is presented as a plea for either technological neutrality or for loosening requirements on car manufacturers. Few would buy the argument for delaying or avoiding technological evolution in other sectors. For example, hardly anyone would argue that to win the AI race, a country should slow down its digitalization and AI usage relative to that of a rival country. Ultimately, growing exports of ICE vehicles from China prove that hitting pause on the energy transition will not spare Europe the challenges of dealing with increasing competition with China. In fact, the European Commission may also want to consider how increasing imports of ICE and PHEV vehicles from China will affect its competitiveness strategy in the automotive sector and its decarbonization plans. Battery electric vehicles may have been the canary in the coal mine, but they are not the only or even the main challenge facing Europe when it comes to global trade imbalances or competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-to-investment&quot;&gt;Open to Investment?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Brussels and other European capitals, the debate is no longer whether to welcome Chinese investment, but rather how to best coordinate approaches and how Europe can leverage access to its market to secure more investment and technology from advanced Chinese companies in the automotive and battery sectors. Whether it was intended or not, the EU tariffs introduced in 2024 on EVs from China provided an incentive to move production to Europe to access the European market. Take the Volvo EX30: The vehicle was initially exported to Europe from China, but its strong performance on the European market led the company to announce it will start production in its Belgium plant this year. It’s worth noting that the announcement was made shortly after the European Union launched its investigation on subsidized EVs from China in October 2023. Europe is heading down a very different path from the United States, where trade and national security regulations have, so far, effectively pushed automakers to make plans to restructure their value chains with an eye toward de-risking from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In private conversations, interlocutors from China and Europe often refer to the Japanese automotive sector’s development in the 1970s and 1980s, which led to increasing trade tensions with Washington and was eventually ameliorated through direct investment in the United States. The story is somewhat more complicated insofar as Tokyo and Japanese manufacturers agreed to self-imposed export quotas, but perhaps even more importantly because U.S. automotive companies were able to regain their competitiveness by focusing on different segments of the market. Moreover, the challenges faced by U.S. companies seeking access to the Japanese market were never fully resolved. However, one of the most enduring legacies of that era was that competition with Japanese auto companies led to a wave of innovation in manufacturing practices; the question remains open as to whether the same types of lessons can be drawn from Chinese manufacturers or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of geopolitical tension, the path forward for automakers and governments would likely include a healthy combination of learning, cross-investment, and technology acquisition. Indeed, at least two major European automakers, Stellantis and Volkswagen (VW), have made investments in Chinese startups with promising technology, and several others have deals relevant for their production in Europe (see Table 1). For example, Stellantis became a strategic investor in Leapmotor in 2023 and reportedly began assembly of Leapmotor vehicles at the Stellantis factory in Tychy, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s greatest gap in the EV value chain remains batteries. The industry has largely been concentrated in East Asia until now, and Chinese companies excel in the production of low-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries. Chinese companies, whether in China or elsewhere, are also the leading refiners of the critical minerals required to produce batteries. In this segment of the value chain, some reliance on China and Chinese firms is inevitable, and given the increasing use of export controls by the Chinese government, the European Union would do well to adopt a strategy that balances long-term economic security concerns and immediate economic and climate objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reporting has suggested that the Chinese government may already be influencing corporate decisions in Europe and trying to leverage its economic power to shape European foreign policy decisions. The risk of political coercion and geopolitical risk highlights the core difference between Japan in the 1980s and China in the 2020s. Governments will need to ensure that foreign investments do not undermine the European Union’s unity, which is what gives European countries their leverage. To that end, the European Union will need better coordination mechanisms on investment screening and conditions tied to state aid funding. Ultimately, governments are less likely to risk losing investment opportunities by requiring more localization if neighboring countries in the European Union are not going to undercut them and offer more favorable terms. European officials have privately expressed concerns that internal competition to receive Chinese investment could lead to a “race to the bottom” with negative implications for everyone, but that without an EU-wide approach, they find themselves in a prisoner’s dilemma. The European Commission has been taking steps toward improved coordination, but the path forward will likely remain challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite risks of economic coercion, the presence of partnerships between Chinese and European companies in the automotive value chain can offer some opportunities for companies to access advanced technologies. European experts have been far more concerned about greenfield investment, which member states have incentivized without requiring anything in return. One recent report analyzed investments by South Korean and Chinese companies in Hungary and Poland backed by significant state aid, including from the European post-Covid recovery fund, and found that the governments did not secure commitments for local employment or technology partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coaxing-companies-toward-innovation&quot;&gt;Coaxing Companies Toward Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnerships could be a pathway to learning, technology sharing, and inherently reducing the share of foreign ownership. However, the question of technology transfers is complicated, as it is not clear that state-negotiated or imposed transfers of technology are always successful in ensuring that the beneficiary companies are then competitive. The case of ICE vehicle companies in China should be a cautionary tale. Decades of mandated joint ventures between state-owned Chinese automakers and foreign companies did only so much to transform China into an automotive technological leader. It was the shift toward electric mobility and the advancement of digital technologies that made China into the automotive powerhouse it is today. Certainly, foreign technology played an important role even in the EV sector. For example, lithium-ion batteries were not invented in China, but it was the acquisition and development of these technologies at a relatively early stage that gave Chinese firms a head start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology transfers were more successful in the wind turbine industry, where China also pursued aggressive localization policies. Requirements to localize production and components, combined with a very large and growing market, were also helpful to the development of an indigenous battery industry in China. Localization policies can be controversial; those pursued by the Chinese government have not always been WTO compliant, and the European Union has criticized the United States’ use of localization conditions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for example. However, the recently issued Industrial Action Plan for the European Automotive Sector makes clear that the European Commission now expects member states to take more proactive measures to ensure that FDI in the automotive industry brings added value to Europe and will produce a proposed set of conditions for inbound investment. Similarly, the Clean Industrial Deal published on February 26, 2025, addresses this question and provides a helpful recommendation that the European Council and European Parliament strengthen and harmonize the EU investment screening framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two lessons from China’s experience will be valuable for European policymakers to consider as they develop a new strategy toward FDI:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology transfers and joint ventures on their own can fail to develop domestic innovation if they do not provide incentives for companies to go beyond their comfort zone.&lt;/strong&gt; Localization requirements including hiring local staff, local training, and targets for sourcing domestically or from a third country can be more effective in enabling the development of an ecosystem in the medium to long term. However, these requirements will need to be part of a comprehensive plan to develop a local or diversified value chain for those segments that are deemed strategic and will require having a targeted strategic view of what levels of Chinese participation and technology are acceptable. One lesson of the IRA for Europe is that the stricter the approach to Chinese content, the higher the costs and the longer the time frames.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EV and battery sectors will need to experience growing demand in Europe in order for companies to succeed in their localization efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; That demand may risk accelerating the trade deficit with China in the short term, but will be necessary to ensure that companies have incentives to continue to invest in EV and battery manufacturing and research and development, that they can achieve scale, and that Europe has a say in shaping the technology itself through standard setting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission’s power to enforce conditions on investment and investment screening will always be dependent on member states, who are unlikely to hand over authority, complicating the path forward for enhanced coordination. However, there is urgency to ensuring that Europe reaches a consensus on how to approach current and future investments from China for two reasons: First, as more investments are confirmed, the European side will have less leverage in negotiations. Second, the more rules are in place, the less member states will be incentivized to compete against one another and be responsive to potential political pressure from China. Finally, as Chinese automotive companies make investments around the world, including potentially in the United States (although the likelihood of this happening is low), their latitude to make more commitments in Europe will decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordination should not mean blocking FDI, as more investment in Europe can have some positive effects, especially if it can boost local value chain development and training of local talent. Indeed, Europe should look beyond China to diversify sources of FDI in vehicle and battery production, including attracting more and supporting existing Korean and Japanese companies in Europe. Investment in home-grown companies is a sensitive topic in Europe following battery maker Northvolt’s filing for bankruptcy protection, which, among other things, suggested a need for more due diligence and discipline for recipients of state aid. Northvolt’s collapse also revealed the extent to which the company was still reliant on Chinese value chains, including for its machinery, highlighting how challenging it is to fully separate value chains in the short term. However, the failure of a single firm does not mean that production of batteries in Europe is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brussels would do well to learn from Washington’s own failure to view its industrial policy in perspective. The Department of Energy’s large loan to Solyndra, the solar panel producer that filed for bankruptcy in 2012, still receives equal coverage as the loan issued to Tesla, which has gone on to be a remarkably successful firm. The current U.S. administration’s dramatic reversal on electric vehicles and renewable energy could also have a devastating economic effect by undermining existing investments made because of the IRA’s incentives and expectations of growing demand and expanding charging infrastructure, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictability and long-term thinking will be an advantage for Europe as it provides clear signals and incentives for firms to make investments. Brussels and other capitals will also need to seriously consider security, especially when it comes to data and remote access of technologies, which are also key factors shaping company decisions. The Trump administration has not signaled any changes yet when it comes to restrictions on Chinese technology, including connected vehicles, but unpredictability in the White House may make it harder to achieve transatlantic coordination in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-forward-openness-industrial-strategy-and-global-governance&quot;&gt;Moving Forward: Openness, Industrial Strategy, and Global Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the energy transition can positively reinforce many of Europe’s existing economic goals; the bad news is that it will require significant political capital and resolve at a time when the external environment is changing at breakneck speed. Indeed, European policymakers will need to move quickly if they wish to shape the future of the automotive value chain, something that is difficult to achieve when multiple democratic countries need to find agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they move to operationalize the Clean Industrial Deal and other plans relating to the Automotive sector, European policymakers today should focus on four priority areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance European coordination on both the industrial strategy and the economic security side.&lt;/strong&gt; As stated by the Clean Industrial Deal, foreign companies should not be able to exploit inconsistencies in national policies when choosing their future location, especially if this undermines the bloc’s unity vis-à-vis other national actors, including China. This will be challenging given different interests and priorities at the member-state level, and the European Commission will need to continue to provide guidelines and coordinate actively between different interests. Coordination, however, can mitigate potential risks posed by FDI or increased dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Openness to investment and trade will have to continue to be part of Europe’s strategy in order to ensure companies are exposed to competitive pressure and engage in international value chains. Moreover, the European Union will need to address the competitiveness issues for its industry that have been identified, including issues not discussed in this paper in the digital sphere and industrial automation. Within this context, the European Union’s continued pursuit of free trade agreements—most recently with Mercosur and India—and international institutions will help ensure European companies retain an international footprint. Although challenging, the European Union should also strive to ensure that the newly proposed Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships are operationalized in ways that are effective and attractive for partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remain committed to engaging with the rest of the world on the basis of mutually agreed upon rules and fairness.&lt;/strong&gt; Actual negotiations with Beijing on addressing overcapacity produced by China’s energy transition and the lack of industry consolidation in the automotive sector could be beneficial. But perhaps most importantly, the European Union can work with other constructive partners to broker a broader conversation on global coordination on industrial policy spending and new rules of engagement on global trade and sustainability that may put more pressure on China. The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the EU Battery Passport show that climate-related conditions to accessing the EU market can actually have an impact on Chinese firm behavior, an important lesson for the future that should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure continued growth of the EV industry by supporting demand through strong regulation on ICE vehicles and, as the Industrial Action Plan for the European Automotive Industry suggests, increasing coordination at the member-state level on EV incentive schemes.&lt;/strong&gt; Research shows that automotive companies respond to stricter fuel and emission standards with more innovation despite potential up-front costs, which the government can under certain conditions help reduce. Ultimately, if Europe wants to compete globally in what is becoming the next generation of the automotive sector, it will need to engage in the race and leverage its internal market. Subsidization and market protection always works best when combined with strong incentives for companies to innovate, compete, and focus on efficiency. One of the key lessons from China’s experience is that competition (even if artificially generated through subsidies) is useful in propelling technological development forward, providing consumers with attractive options, and generating strong companies that can compete internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address head-on the risks posed by growing digitalization in all aspects of the economy, including personal vehicles.&lt;/strong&gt; To do so, the European Union could coordinate more closely with other democratic allies including Japan, Canada, Australia, and potentially some developing nations such as India to produce frameworks that can enhance trust in data security within a relatively open world with trade and investment. Cybersecurity and data protection will only become bigger concerns in the coming years, and the European Union would serve itself and the world well by providing continued regulatory leadership that enhances competition as well as trust in concert with other leading actors in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, there are some implications from the automotive industry transformation in Europe. First, the results of Europe’s confrontation and negotiation with China on economic security issues will prove instructive on what can and cannot be done bilaterally with Beijing. Although Washington’s position is significantly different, there will likely be lessons to be drawn from Brussels’ experience. Second, despite shifting U.S. foreign policy priorities, Europe is a large economic and diplomatic actor and market globally, so its long-term stability and prosperity is in the best interest of the United States. Third, if Europe is able to make reforms that improve its competitiveness, there may be long-term implications for effective policymaking, including the role of international trade and global governance. Finally, and more generally, the future of the automotive sector in Europe will likely shape and be shaped by evolving relations between the European Union and China, and the European Union and global institutions including the WTO, with long-term implications for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a head-spinning reversal of U.S. policy, President Donald Trump has set about engaging in negotiations with Russia, leaving Ukraine largely as an observer in efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Also apparently missing from the talks is any mention of North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not bode well for breathing life back into the U.N. sanctions against North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than a year, North Korea has supplied weapons and manpower to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine – a serious violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Ignoring such violations will only serve to further erode international norms against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and embolden North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s nuclear ambitions, deepening instability on the Korean peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any real prospects of reviving the U.N. sanctions regime will require Moscow to recommit to U.N. sanctions – a daunting, perhaps impossible, task. The bigger problem, however, is that neither Trump nor Putin has much incentive to address the North Korea issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;un-sanctions-in-decay&quot;&gt;U.N. Sanctions in Decay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of political consensus and continued flagrant violations by Russia have left the U.N. sanctions regime against North Korea in a state of severe decay. The 1718 Committee (formed by the U.N. Security Council in 2006 to oversee the sanctions regime) has been unable to move past political differences since 2017, which is the last time it adopted new sanctions. The effort to hold Pyongyang accountable for its violations of U.N. resolutions is effectively at a standstill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the end came in May 2022, when Russia and China vetoed a U.N. resolution that would have imposed additional sanctions on North Korea’s oil imports – for the first time since 2006 – following the country’s series of provocations, including its test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final blow came in March 2024 when Russia vetoed a U.N. resolution to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts, the independent eight-member body responsible for monitoring the implementation of sanctions and reporting instances of violations to the U.N. Security Council. China abstained. The vote effectively shuttered the only body responsible for monitoring and reporting on North Korea’s sanctions evasion activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzia, railed against what he called “open-ended” sanctions against North Korea that have lost their relevance and are “largely detached from reality.” He derided the Panel of Experts as “reduced to playing into the hands of Western approaches, reprinting biased information and analyzing newspaper headlines and poor-quality photos.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, the United States, France, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom called Russia’s actions “nothing more than an attempt to silence independent, objective investigations into persistent violations of [U.N.] Security Council resolutions by [North Korea] and by Russia itself,” alluding to North Korea’s alleged shipments of arms to Russia for use in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two years since it started supporting Russia’s war effort, North Korea increased its number of ballistic missile tests, made significant improvements in nuclear and ballistic missile technology, and significantly increased revenue-generating activities, including a major theft of cryptocurrency and the dispatch of IT workers in China and Russia. Just this past month, the Open Source Centre – a London-based nonprofit organization – uncovered a sanctioned Russian vessel that ferried arms from North Korea to Russia, making at least nine trips in the last five months. It also appears that North Korea’s global networks that previously supplied military equipment are once again active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These activities show how Russia and China’s abdication opened major rifts in the U.N. sanctions regime that North Korea exploited to its benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trump-and-putins-north-korea-dilemma&quot;&gt;Trump and Putin’s North Korea Dilemma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma is that Putin has few incentives to abandon his new strategic partner, North Korea, and Trump has few incentives to revisit one of his biggest foreign policy failures of his first term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Kim Jong Un has zero interest in returning to the status quo. His newly forged strategic partnership and increased economic cooperation with Russia is the lifeline needed to keep his nuclear weapons program running. Furthermore, according to some reports, North Korea’s losses in Ukraine have been steep – a factor that Russia would be hard-pressed to ignore and one that Kim is not likely to let Putin forget any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Trump has expressed little interest in re-engaging with Kim Jong Un – despite the billet-doux between the two leaders. There is no doubt the president saw the failure of the 2019 Hanoi summit with Kim as an embarrassment and personal affront. Ankit Panda and Vipin Narang pinned the blunder on two opposing demands: Washington insisted that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons before any concessions were made, while Pyongyang demanded that the United States lift all sanctions before discussing denuclearization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-comes-next&quot;&gt;What Comes Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a scenario where Trump is able to extract concessions from Russia, let alone force Moscow’s hand on North Korea. The U.S. president has already abandoned much of his negotiating leverage: within the last two months, Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator,” falsely suggested that Ukraine started the war, voted against a U.N. General Assembly resolution that condemned Russia’s aggression in Ukraine – breaking from U.S. allies – and publicly berated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office that led to a temporary pause in all US military and intelligence aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Washington should work to keep North Korea on the agenda with Russia. Pretending Russia did not violate its international obligations ignores the growing threat from North Korea that Moscow directly contributed to and only further emboldens Kim to grow his nuclear arsenal, further destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region. This past February, North Korea threatened the United States with nuclear weapons over its military cooperation with South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Trump should also keep in mind that reinvigorating the U.N. sanctions regime against North Korea provides a much stronger position for the United States, should he decide to pursue another summit with Kim Jong Un. Washington must find ways to erode Kim’s relationship with Putin if there is to be any chance of pursuing negotiations with North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, any ceasefire agreement should include the complete removal of North Korean troops from the Russia-Ukraine battlefield. As a second step, Russia must cease its imports of North Korean arms, a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and recommit to upholding its international obligations. This could include an assurance to unconditionally adopt a resolution that immediately reinstates the Panel of Experts, with the body free – without reservation – to investigate any potential Russian violations of U.N. sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressing Moscow to honor its international obligations would not only offer an off-ramp to Putin and salvage the U.N. sanctions regime, but would also help drive a wedge between Moscow and Pyongyang, ultimately providing leverage to the Trump administration to start negotiations with North Korea. Despite fair criticism that U.N. sanctions have failed to bring North Korea to the negotiating table, they did help enshrine international norms against nuclear proliferation. Failing to address Russia’s North Korea problem would spell disaster for the sanctions regime and further erode global nonproliferation norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI hosted a roundtable discussion with 32 participants from the public and private sectors, including blockchain analytics companies and virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The conversation focused on the challenges associated with the implementation of sanctions for the virtual asset industry. Primarily, the discussion centred on methods used by governments to target entities and individuals exploiting virtual assets for sanctions evasion. This conference report provides a summary of the key points from the roundtable discussion. None of the discussions at the event are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, during the roundtable discussion, participants deconstructed the steps involved with designating and tracking virtual asset entities and individuals, as well as attributable virtual asset addresses. Based on this, the discussion identified operational and regulatory gaps that persist and undermine the effectiveness of sanctions in the virtual asset industry. These points include the need for governments to define the objective of a sanctions designation, provide clarity for VASP market participants on sanction packages, and understand the tools that may further support the process of tracking and confiscating virtual assets tied to sanctions evasion. Furthermore, the public and private sectors need to develop a system where governments can feed back information to VASPs on infrastructure changes of sanctioned entities and individuals after the initial sanctions designation, to maintain the effectiveness of the original designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-concerns&quot;&gt;Identifying Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opening question focused on identifying participants’ primary concerns related to sanctioned entities exploiting the virtual asset industry. To illustrate these concerns, Iran was used as a case study, with discussions centred on the increased rate of virtual asset adoption in Iran to protect wealth from hyperinflation – in particular, via the use of stablecoins – and how the country may use virtual assets for sanctions evasion as well as to fund influence operations abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, services have opened to support individuals to illegally access VASPs that restrict Iranian customers. This point is evidenced by a December 2024 report from Crystal Intelligence, which focuses on a service that states it “provides authentication services, free static IPs, and open-layer files for Iranian users and sanctioned platforms with 5 years of experience and specialized support”. The report further outlines that a “deepfake tool” provided by the service can help Iranians bypass facial recognition used by VASPs and subsequently set up accounts. Such tools can support the country with evading sanctions, underlining how important it is for those designing sanctions to closely monitor developments in available technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant also drew attention to Iran recently approving virtual asset regulation. The regulation highlights a focus on “building a culture of using blockchain technologies and tokens to finance production and facilitate foreign trade”. This point aligns to Iran’s statement in 2022 on using virtual assets as a form of guarantee for small and medium-sized businesses that work in counterparts in other countries. With virtual assets increasingly being integrated into credit settlement in international trade, as discussed at the roundtable, VASPs’ compliance teams may encounter challenges similar to those facing financial institutions in identifying transactions tied to high-risk goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one participant highlighted that, when investigators are analysing sanctions evasion activity by Iran, they are often looking for a smoking gun but, as in traditional finance, individuals abusing virtual assets can also use shell companies and integrate formal and informal networks to reduce transparency. This is evidenced by information linked to a recent US sanction designation on an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force-backed Houthi financier. A report by blockchain analytics company Chainalysis provided insight on the sanctions evasion activity, noting that the addresses on the sanctions list show “little direct exposure to mainstream services”, and instead, the individual appears “to move and launder funds through more informal networks”. Therefore, investigators need to adapt their perspective to understand the full complexity of sanction evasion networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanctions-implementation-process&quot;&gt;Sanctions Implementation Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion then moved to how to tackle challenges with sanctions implementation. To support the dialogue, a proposed process for sanctions implementation for the virtual asset industry was developed prior to the meeting. This was shared with participants to determine additional elements that are involved and their associated challenges. Figure 1 shows this process as revised following the roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion touched on the elements of the process for sanctioning an entity or individual in the industry and identifying associated virtual asset addresses. After a virtual asset address is attributed to a sanctioned actor and the information is added to a government’s sanctions list, blockchain analytics companies will update their tools to display the designation. As a result of these tools updating information, retrospective alerts may be generated for VASPs that use those products to support sanctions compliance. Based on these retrospective alerts, a VASP may or may not – depending on guidance provided by the public sector – file a suspicious transaction report (STR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9rAuCdU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Simplified Process for Designation of Sanctioned Entities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with this process, the sanctioned actor may attempt to move their funds to separate themselves from links to the designated address on the sanctions list. Therefore, blockchain analytics companies and law enforcement investigate the movement of funds to identify subsequent addresses and infrastructure changes linked to the designated actor. Based on these investigations, blockchain analytics companies update their analytic tools with additional information on addresses and entities linked to the initial sanctions designation. Notably, small and medium-sized VASPs may not use blockchain analytic tools and therefore only monitor for incoming funds linked to the initial sanctions designation. Therefore, they may not detect alterations in approach by a sanctioned entity and may potentially be unaware of the risk level of incoming funds. This represents a systemic vulnerability that is further emphasised if such VASPs rely on larger VASPs to gain access to liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example provided by one roundtable participant was that the US Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list identified three virtual asset addresses tied to the sanctioned entity Garantex, a centralised exchange. For nearly three years after the announcement of the US designation, Garantex continued to operate and appear in public reports on financial crime investigations. This activity by Garantex was tracked closely by the public and private sectors to identify new shell companies or addresses used by the sanctioned entity. However, small and medium-sized VASPs may still have relied on monitoring for incoming transactions tied to the initial designation that did not include updated information. Solutions for such types of vulnerability are further discussed below. Notably, in the weeks after the roundtable, law enforcement seized the domain of Garantex, froze a portion of the assets, and released indictments for operators of the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;define-the-objective&quot;&gt;Define the Objective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One theme that came up repeatedly during the roundtable was the need for the public sector to pinpoint its objective prior to designating virtual asset addresses and entities. One participant emphasised that in the virtual asset industry, sanctions are an effective tool for spotlighting services facilitating transactions for illicit actors, but do not halt the activity, merely pushing it into areas with limited or no virtual asset regulation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also discussed the fact that sanctions designations in the virtual asset industry can have unintended consequences, and government representatives need to be aware of these and whether they might negate the intended objective of the sanctions designation. As noted at the beginning of this report, in countries experiencing hyperinflation, citizens are more inclined to convert fiat currency to virtual assets to reduce price fluctuation of held assets and retain wealth. To achieve this, services are needed to allow fiat-to-virtual asset conversion with domestic currency. For a high-risk or sanctioned country, the transfer of domestic currency into stablecoins – if options providing this service are available – can result in capital flight. Ultimately, this movement of funds out of the sanctioned country impacts its economy. However, if those citizens are cut off from purchasing virtual assets with their domestic currency due to the restrictions created by sanctions, the risk of capital flight for the sanctioned country via this route is reduced and these funds stay in the country and support the economy. Participants agreed that this balance should be considered by policymakers when determining virtual asset-related sanctions on a country such as Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion also outlined how government representatives can consider how stimulating the use of virtual assets via sanctions implementation can have beneficial consequences. For example, where a sanctioned entity or individual is cut off from traditional banking and turns to the virtual asset industry instead, the traceability of virtual asset transactions gives the public and private sectors insight into further sanctions evasion activity. In a case highlighted by The Wall Street Journal and discussed at the roundtable, a Russia-linked individual used stablecoins to wire funds to a supplier to pay for electronics. The individual, according to the article, used “Garantex, along with other intermediary firms, to convert customers” rubles into tether, moving the cryptocurrency on a blockchain system called Tron’. The article then notes that the individual converted the stablecoin for “yuan at over-the-counter brokers in Hong Kong, and then wired suppliers the money by a local bank transfer”. Although investigations such as this are far from simple, participants noted that the traceability of virtual assets allows a streamlined end-to-end process for detecting where funds are sent and converted to fiat currency, potentially providing sanctions policymakers with greater visibility of future sanctions targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;provide-clarity-to-market-participants&quot;&gt;Provide Clarity to Market Participants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that authorities need to provide clear, consistent guidance on how sanctions are applicable to the virtual asset industry. In cases where sanctions are designed as broad measures targeting specific technologies or devices, regulators must clarify the applicability of those sanctions within the diverse virtual asset ecosystem. Participants discussed the example of companies that manufacture and sell physical hardware wallets for self-custody of private keys: they may unintentionally fall within the scope of blanket sanctions, despite not offering virtual asset-related services explicitly targeted by such measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that sanctions regimes achieve their intended objectives without creating unnecessary uncertainty, greater clarity from the public sector is essential. One participant gave the example of the lack of clear guidance on the implications of sanctions imposed on Russia for businesses selling virtual asset-related hardware. Without explicit direction, such companies face challenges in adapting their supply chains and business practices to remain compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also discussed the additional layer of complexity in the EU arising from differences in how individual member states interpret and implement sanctions. Even slight variations in wording between national approaches can lead to significant inconsistencies, making it difficult for businesses operating across multiple jurisdictions to maintain compliance. These discrepancies not only increase regulatory burdens, but also create loopholes that could be exploited by entities seeking to evade sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, participants discussed the fact that countries often do not provide guidance on whether a VASP is required to file an STR if direct or indirect exposure is flagged from before the designation of the entity or individual and associated virtual addresses. One example that was raised centred on the fact that when blockchain analytic tools update to show activity tied to new sanctions designations, flags for previous direct or indirect exposure prior to the designation may be generated. In this case, the VASP needs clarity on whether it needs to file an STR with the designated authority in the jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also discussed how policymakers can support the private sector by providing clear guidance on sanctions implementation that reflects the difference between the virtual asset industry and the traditional financial system. One example discussed was that for financial institutions in the EU, for example, guidance for financial institutions that detect incoming funds tied to sanctions states that banks should not accept the deposit. However, due to the nature of the technology supporting virtual assets, VASPs cannot reject or block incoming virtual assets, so their main option is to return the funds, while using company assets to pay for transaction fees. Of course, in the case of sanctions, returning funds is not an option. Instead, VASPs restrict the user from accessing or transferring those assets further when activity linked to a sanctioned actor is detected. This means that the VASP has to hold custody of virtual assets tied to sanctions activity while waiting for law enforcement to respond with the necessary legal orders. VASPs need guidance on what to do with those assets after restricting the user’s access and while waiting for a response from authorities; some jurisdictions do not provide such guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understand--but-do-not-overuse--the-available-tools&quot;&gt;Understand – but do not Overuse – the Available Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants at the roundtable discussed how VASPs can monitor for sanctions evasion activity, including through scanning unilateral sanctions designations and UN-listed indicators (related to North Korea specifically), using geolocation tools and cross-checking devices. If any indication of sanctions evasion is shown, VASPs can file the necessary report to the necessary authority, which ultimately supports investigations into suspicious activity linked to, or indicative of, sanctions evasion. To carry out this process, law enforcement analyses data and works with VASPs to confiscate assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed additional tools to consider that can support authorities with improving detection and confiscation of virtual assets tied to sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;freezing-stablecoins&quot;&gt;Freezing Stablecoins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant shared the example of a prominent stablecoin issuer working with law enforcement in different jurisdictions to freeze stablecoins. Building on this, another participant developed a hypothetical scenario to show the consequences of overusing this access. If a government wanted to get rid of a VASP in a sanctioned or high-risk country, they could attempt to cut off their liquidity, thus neutering their ability to act as an exchange – for example by working with a stablecoin issuer to freeze stablecoins held by the sanctioned VASP. However, this may have severe second order consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the reputation of the stablecoin issuer would degrade and sanctions evasion would likely shift from stablecoins to virtual assets such as Bitcoin. When law enforcement looks to confiscate virtual assets such as Bitcoin, they need to work with centralised VASPs or identify private key information with a search warrant. This process does occur, but challenges persist, as the slow speed of bureaucratic procedures does not align with the quick pace of virtual asset cross-border transactions. Second, the sanctions evader may shift its money-laundering approach to incorporate new entities, requiring investigators to dig deeper and monitor platforms to identify infrastructure changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not to argue that sanctions should not be used in such a case, but all participants agreed that it is important to work through the longer-term implications of the actions policymakers and law enforcement agencies choose to take. Notably, the approach of authorities working with stablecoin issuers to freeze assets of Garantex took place in the weeks following the roundtable. On 7 March 2025, a stablecoin issuer announced that they had assisted the US Secret Service in freezing $23 million in illicit funds tied to Garantex. However, law enforcement also took down the domain of Garantex and released indictments to strengthen enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-travel-rule&quot;&gt;The Travel Rule&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed whether further adoption of the “travel rule” (the Financial Action Task Force’s requirement to collect information on the originator and beneficiary of transactions) would meaningfully impact detection of sanctions evasion. Consensus emerged that the travel rule may only have a minimal impact on identification of sanctions evasion activity while there are still some jurisdictions that lack regulatory framework for the industry and where enforcement for non-compliance is low. Under the travel rule, regulated entities share associated information, but currently any individual who owns virtual assets can continue to operate without touching VASPs that are compliant with such requirements, by taking advantage of services in jurisdictions without a regulatory framework for the industry and/or with unregulated services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further emphasise that the travel rule will not act as a key tool in supporting sanctions detection, one participant stressed that VASPs are only as good as their last counterparty – that is, if the previous counterparty did not collect verified information for the travel rule or implement strong compliance controls, the information chain will run cold for the subsequent services involved. Addressing this “weakest link” issue was an important vulnerability raised by participants, who suggested that government authorities could improve the process by issuing statements of non-compliance by VASPs that wittingly facilitate transactions for sanctioned entities and are unresponsive to law enforcement requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;look-at-where-the-funds-end-up&quot;&gt;Look at Where the Funds End Up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one participant, challenges are amplified by the fact that funds tied to sanctions evasion activity often end up in jurisdictions that are under-resourced, with limited capacity to investigate foreign requests for information, or those that do not have regulations specific to the virtual asset industry. In 2024, for example, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted that a payment company associated with a business headquartered in one Mekong country had engaged with Garantex. The movement of funds to countries with no regulatory framework has a negative impact on efforts to recover virtual assets tied to sanctions evasion activity. Therefore, governments can focus on supporting these jurisdictions with necessary resources to build a regulatory framework for the virtual asset industry and develop capacity to enforce legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;balance-the-responsibility&quot;&gt;Balance the Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants at the roundtable noted that the private sector takes on responsibility for identifying other entities, individuals and virtual asset addresses tied to sanctioned entities, and agreed this a very challenging task. This point was evidenced by the current approach to restricting activity by Garantex. A RUSI roundtable in May 2024 noted that Garantex set up shell companies in jurisdictions with limited virtual asset regulation to continue operations. In addition, the company produced “new virtual assets within a five-day period to move funds” and operated by using the services of VASPs that have higher liquidity, attendees noted. Participants in this latest roundtable underlined the need for VASPs and blockchain analytics firms to be constantly scanning the ecosystem to identify new entities linked to Garantex. As noted, a stablecoin issuer froze a percentage of funds tied to Garantex in the weeks following the roundtable discussion and the US released indictments for two individuals believed to act as controllers for the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This burden on the private sector can be alleviated by governments making updates to sanctions designations to reflect new virtual asset addresses and infrastructure changes. For example, on 14 April 2022, the US attributed a virtual asset address to a North Korean entity, and eight days later, authorities updated the list to add more addresses. Governments providing such rapid updates is, however, not common practice. Consequently, participants felt that a heavy reliance falls on the private sector to investigate and monitor shell companies set up by the designated actor to obfuscate continued activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as identified earlier, small to medium-sized VASPs may have neither capacity nor resources to detect updated information tied to sanctions, and therefore, rely on monitoring transactions tied to the initial sanctions designation. Participants recommended designing a process that balances the system by allowing for a consistently active role by the public sector. When designing the procedure, government authorities can take a similar approach to the process of designing the Russian oil price cap: government authorities met with representatives from the industry to define what needed to be achieved and how the process could be devised to ensure the objective was achieved while limiting unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants agreed that governments should consider how they can take a more active role in relaying updated information linked back to the sanctions actor to the private sector, whether through updated virtual asset addresses or new entity information. It was acknowledged that updating the relevant sanctions list with every subsequent address is probably not sustainable, but a focus on a strong partnership with blockchain analytics companies can support the identification of new shell companies, which can subsequently be flagged by the public sector to VASPs. One participant mentioned the possibility for governments to develop, operate and update a database of new virtual asset addresses tied to a sanctioned actor with an application programming interface (API) for VASPs to cross-check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows how, as new entities and virtual asset addresses are identified, the government can issue updated guidance or announcements to the private sector on linked shell companies and attributed addresses. According to the roundtable discussion, this would reduce the private sector liability for determining subsequent sanctioned activity after the initial sanctions designation. One participant said that a verification procedure needs to be implemented for listing a sanctioned entity or individual and associated virtual asset addresses that is evidence-based and impartial. A detailed reasoning procedure is needed, as a defective process can leave the government open to substantial legal liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8NWCvSg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Process Flowchart with Feedback Loop for Updated Sanctions Listings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this discussion, one participant argued that a database or guidance reflecting updated sanctions information provided by the public sector to the private sector may not be inclusive of all information, and thus generate a false sense of security for operators. Furthermore, such statements would not remove the requirement that VASPs need to implement a risk-based approach to detect and monitor sanctions evasion activity. Therefore, the only difference between the public sector providing updated information on new information on sanction designations versus the private sector investigating and listing risk information, according to the participant, would be a shift in liability when monitoring sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants proposed four recommendations that reflect the specific nature of the virtual asset industry, and can thus increase the effectiveness of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Sanctions policymakers should consider providing updated guidance or developing a database with an API that accounts for new virtual asset addresses and/or entities linked to a sanctioned actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a constant adding of virtual asset addresses to a sanctions list is not sustainable, governments can consider releasing updated guidance or developing a database with an API to support the private sector with identifying shell companies tied to sanctioned VASPs and new addresses attributed to the entity. This process could be supported by a strong public–private partnership between government authorities, law enforcement and blockchain analytics providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, one participant highlighted that an evidence-based, impartial verification procedure needs to be implemented prior to publicly identifying a VASP that may be directly linked to a sanctioned entity. A defective process could leave the government open to substantial legal liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Governments should provide further guidance to VASPs on what to do with frozen assets tied to sanctioned actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, VASPs fundamentally cannot, unlike traditional financial institutions, reject incoming virtual assets, so to “reject” funds tied to high-risk activity, their primary option would be to return the funds while using company assets to pay for transaction fees. If the incoming funds are linked to sanctions, VASPs restrict users from accessing an account and transferring those assets. That leaves the VASP holding custody of virtual assets tied to sanctions activity while waiting for a law enforcement response. Some jurisdictions do not provide guidance to VASPs on what to do with assets tied to sanctioned activity after restricting the user’s access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VASPs should not be liable for holding custody of sanctioned assets without clear instructions and documentation from government authorities on how to proceed after restricting access to such assets from the sanctioned entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Governments should provide guidance on whether VASPs need to retrospectively file STRs if activity is detected on their platform prior to the sanctions designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if an individual moved funds through an exchange prior to being sanctioned, that exchange then needs guidance on whether that activity should be reported after the designation. Such reports might help authorities to understand the wider sanctions evasion networks used by designated individuals and entities and lead to further sanctions activity and/or asset confiscation for facilitating sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The public and private sectors should prioritise building capacity in under-resourced jurisdictions which have limited investigation capability and/or lack virtual asset regulatory frameworks, in order to build a stronger ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial system is only as strong as its weakest link, and many weak links remain in the virtual asset arena. Funds from sanctioned entities often ends up in jurisdictions with limited capacity to investigate such activity, or those with no regulatory frameworks. This regulatory arbitrage can be mitigated by supporting such countries with building capabilities related to virtual asset recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the roundtable highlighted fundamental gaps in operational and regulatory capacities in both government and the private sector that undermine the effectiveness of sanctions related to virtual assets. As one participant put it “the authorities are applying an offline strategy to the online world without adapting their policies to reflect some fundamental differences”. By working with the private sector, sanctions policymakers can ensure that their use of sanctions is more clearly defined and, ultimately, impactful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>RUSI</name></author><summary type="html">This conference report summarises a February 2025 roundtable discussion on the implementation of sanctions for the virtual asset industry.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/DHw4meY.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/DHw4meY.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Military Strikes Against Iran</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2025-03-21-military-strikes-against-iran.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Military Strikes Against Iran" /><published>2025-03-21T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2025-03-21T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/military-strikes-against-iran</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2025-03-21-military-strikes-against-iran.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities are often cast in the light of avoiding escalation, underlying all considerations is the efficacy of military action to halt proliferation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, some of the outlines of the new administration’s approach to the Iran nuclear question are starting to emerge. The door to diplomacy remains open; however, there is also a clear determination to dial up the pressure on Tehran, including through military threats. Among many (though certainly not all) Iran-watchers it has become a truism that decisively destroying the Iranian nuclear programme using military means is not possible and that even limited strikes would be risky and of limited effectiveness. Yet, technical assessments of these claims remain limited. What would a military counterproliferation option look like in practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;potential-targets&quot;&gt;Potential Targets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterproliferation strikes against Iran could, in theory, target any number of sites associated with the country’s nuclear programme – including uranium conversion sites, centrifuge production plants and research centres. To have a major material effect, strikes would have to eliminate or seriously degrade Iran’s stocks of fissile material and associated production capabilities. As the programme currently stands, that would mean targeting of Iran’s uranium enrichment capabilities and stocks. Recent intelligence assessments warning of likely Israeli strikes against Iran’s nuclear programme reportedly named Fordow and Natanz – which host enrichment and centrifuge production facilities – as likely targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of key potential targets – including the Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) at Natanz and the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) – are located underground. A new facility – currently being constructed inside a mountain south of the main Natanz complex – is expected to house a centrifuge production facility (although some have suggested that it could also be used for uranium enrichment). Causing meaningful damage to these underground facilities would require significant firepower – which presents escalatory risks and practical challenges. The precise depths of Iran’s underground facilities are not publicly known; estimates drawn from public reporting and analysis are included in Table I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Oo7LvV1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table I: Summary of Iranian Underground Enrichment and Centrifuge Production Facilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sites hosting activities that could be relevant to any future weaponisation efforts may also be targeted in counterproliferation strikes. In a major operation against Iran in late October 2024, Israel attacked a facility at Parchin which had previously hosted Iranian weapons-relevant research and which may still have been operational. Much less is publicly known about where any weaponisation-relevant activity may take place; however, Israeli and US intelligence is likely to hold at least some of that information. Past Iranian weaponisation efforts also offer some indication as to facilities that could again play a role in a renewed coordinated pursuit for a nuclear weapons capability. It is reasonable to assume that at least some of that activity would also take place in underground or otherwise hardened sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of other key facilities are located above-ground and could, in theory, offer somewhat softer targets for potential Israeli or US counterproliferation strikes. These include – among others: the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant (PFEP) at Natanz, the as-yet-inoperative Khondab Heavy Water Reactor at Arak, and uranium conversion and fuel fabrication facilities at Esfahan. However, carrying out attacks on these sites would present their own challenges and escalatory risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;options-and-challenges-for-attack&quot;&gt;Options and Challenges for Attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a range of weapons available to both the United States military and to the Israeli Air Force that are designed to penetrate significant amounts of reinforced concrete and/or rock and then detonate to destroy or at least badly damage hardened, buried targets. However, the suspected depth of even the FEP would complicate attacks with all but the largest weapons. Furthermore, a number of complicating factors make a weaponeering solution for each facility difficult to arrive at without access to detailed information on the exact hardening measures and layout of each site, and to detailed performance information on each potential strike weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the penetration achievable with each weapon will vary greatly depending on the material covering each target. A weapon that can penetrate through tens of meters of packed earth or sand may only penetrate a few meters of standard civilian construction-grade concrete, and even less reinforced, high-density concrete. Furthermore, most of the Iranian facilities are likely to be covered by different layers of reinforced concrete, rock, packed earth and potentially other materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout of the facility in question is also important for assessing weapon designated point of impact (DPI), explosive payload and fuzing requirements to cause critical damage. For instance, a buried facility that has rooms connected by long narrow shafts with multiple sets of thick blast doors and multiple external entry and exit points would be much harder to guarantee destruction of than a buried facility that has a single large cavern and/or a single entry and exit shaft. A rough outline of the penetrating weapons available to both the United States and to the Israeli Air Force, with their estimated penetration capabilities against a given reinforced concrete layer is included in the table below for context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NRMPOK7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table II: Summary of Penetrating Weapons Capabilities Available to the US and Israel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach even the FEP, assuming that the site is located roughly 8 meters underground and that the covering is predominantly reinforced concrete and/or hard rock, all the weapons available to the Israeli Air Force, and all except the 30,000 lbs GBU-57/B and the 5,000 lbs GBU 72/B available to the United States, would likely require several impacts into the same crater to “burrow” down to the facility and get a weapon through to explode within it successfully. For the FFEP and new facility at Natanz at an estimated 80-100 meters, possibly with layers of reinforced concrete, even the GBU-57/B would likely require multiple impacts at the same aiming point to have a good chance of penetrating the facility. Strikes with lesser penetrating weapons could still collapse entry and exit tunnels given good intelligence about their exact layout and location (with some information already available in open-source satellite imagery analysis). However, unless a longer-term campaign were mounted with regular follow-up strikes, efforts to dig down to the facilities to re-establish access and supplies would likely begin almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical hardening, any sites that have significant importance to the Iranian nuclear weapons programme would almost certainly have layered ground-based air defences of various kinds stationed around them, especially if an attack was anticipated. Iran possesses a wide range of air defences – most notably Russian S-300PMU-2 long range, as well as indigenous Khordad 15 medium range, and Russian Tor M-1 short range SAM systems. However, the Israeli Air Force emphatically demonstrated its capacity to successfully attack and degrade Iranian air defences, and to successfully carry out a strike against Iran’s nuclear-related sites, in its October 2024 operation. During a more ambitious attack against Iranian nuclear facilities across the country, the IAF would likely be capable of fighting its way into the Iranian air defence system without major issues. With a much larger and more technically advanced set of capability options to bring to bear, the US Air Force (likely alongside the US Navy), would also be able to relatively rapidly degrade and ultimately destroy Iranian air defences to the point where strikes against nuclear facilities could be mounted with minimal risk to aircrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the presence of short range and medium range SAM systems near most key Iranian targets, some weapons might still be intercepted in flight, particularly free-fall bombs. The Tor M-1 has repeatedly demonstrated the capability to shoot down a range of precision guided munitions in Ukraine, for example. As a highly mobile standalone system with a low signature when not emitting, it is also relatively difficult to reliably track and target from stand-off distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential presence of pop-up point defence SAMs at each facility means that multiple weapon deliveries might need to be planned against each DPI to ensure the penetrating effects needed. To attack multiple targets across Iran, the IAF alone would almost certainly need to mount a campaign with numerous attack waves to ensure defences could be adequately suppressed and/or destroyed to enable each strike package to achieve the effects required. Even the US Air Force and US Navy might struggle to destroy all the necessary targets in a single attack, while suppressing defences and providing penetrating weapon redundancy in case of attrition from point defences at each target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limits-of-the-military-counterproliferation-option&quot;&gt;Limits of the Military Counterproliferation Option&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical challenges of carrying out attacks against dispersed and hardened facilities makes clear the infeasibility of relying strictly on a military solution to the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear programme, likely necessitating a major operation to penetrate hardened facilities and/or degrade Iranian air defences. As has been repeatedly argued elsewhere, the highly dispersed nature and advanced state of the Iranian nuclear programme – including extensive latent expertise within the Iranian scientific community – further complicates efforts to eliminate the nuclear programme by military means. For this reason, any comparisons with Israeli attacks against Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981 and Syria’s Al-Kibar facility in 2007 are highly misplaced. In both instances, the attacked countries’ programmes were highly concentrated and at a nascent stage, relying extensively on foreign assistance for their development. Following any military strike on its nuclear sites, Iran not only has the requisite indigenous expertise but will also have increased incentive to rebuild, and to rebuild deeper and more hardened facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While destruction of Iran’s nuclear programme by military means is not feasible and even limited strikes carry significant escalatory risks, this does not negate the value of issuing credible military threats as part of a broader effort to roll back the Iranian nuclear programme. Should Iran’s nuclear programme reach a stage where it poses a threat beyond what is acceptable to Israel or the US – for instance, if intelligence was obtained on an Iranian decision to rush towards a nuclear weapon, or even if Tehran decided to begin uranium enrichment to 90% – military attacks could be used to set the programme back to a more acceptable state and may be assessed as being worth the escalatory risks. Making clear the willingness to carry out such attacks – but only as an option of last resort – could help exert the necessary pressure to convince Tehran to cooperate with expectations not to cross certain thresholds or to reverse course on particularly destabilising activity. A thorough consideration of the challenges and risks that following through on any such threats would entail should serve as a sobering reminder that they should not be issued lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world of extraordinary geopolitical volatility, the threat to Western nations and interests from cyber attacks has, contrary to expectations, remained remarkably stable. Asked to name the leading anti-Western nation state actors in 2015, any expert would have listed Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Asked to do so in 2025, experts would give the same list. Moreover, in the 2020s, the sort of serious disruption to critical infrastructure – to energy facilities, healthcare and other sectors – long feared by governments have, insofar as they have materialised at all, been caused by Russia-based cyber-criminals. The biggest nation-state threat actors have, by-and-large, kept much of their cyber powder dry. Even in its invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s cyber forces underperformed as badly as their conventional ones in their illegal assault on Kyiv, and there was no serious attempt to use cyber disruption to deter western countries from backing President Zelenskyy’s fight for national survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, this relatively stable picture – one of significant threat but little actual change in that threat – has been accompanied by a steady drumbeat of commercial hype about how the cyber threat to anyone and everyone is getting worse all the time. That this is objectively untrue has not arrested the spread of the narrative. But such unrealised and unspecific scaremongering means we risk failing to notice when important shifts in the threat picture actually emerge. And there has been one profoundly important shift in the threat picture recently: over the past two years we have learned of a transformation of China’s cyber capabilities into a far more formidable strategic threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, by far, the most significant shift in the cyber threat landscape in well over a decade. As a cyber actor, China has changed in three ways. First, the objectives of its cyber capabilities have shifted from economic to political ones. Second, its operations have changed from being opportunistic to strategic. Thirdly, and most importantly, it has moved beyond being simply a passive actor to an being active one. In other words, it does not just spy and steal anymore; it has also laid the ground for hugely disruptive cyber operations against western critical infrastructure, which hitherto it had shown no signs of doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cyber-typhoons&quot;&gt;The Cyber Typhoons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two major cyber operations by China were uncovered in 2023 and 2024. They were, unhelpfully, given very similar codenames: “Salt Typhoon” and “Volt Typhoon”. But although only two letters distinguish them, they are profoundly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt Typhoon is a state intelligence service sponsored operation. It has comprehensively penetrated the United States’s telecommunications system, leading to panicked guidance from the US Government to the nation’s elite to use end-to-end encrypted messaging services, or else assume their data and message content are transiting to Beijing. Think of it, in effect, as China doing a “Snowden” to America; gaining vast access to the nation’s communications via a strategic spying operation of breathtaking audacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volt Typhoon, by contrast, is a military operation for strategic political and potentially military purposes. Run by the cyber unit of the People’s Liberation Army, it involves putting preparatory implants – “digital booby traps”, as some have called them, into all manner of American critical infrastructure. In its official assessment of the operation, the Biden administration listed manufacturing, utilities, transportation, construction, maritime, IT, education &amp;amp; government (though, interestingly, not healthcare) as the sectors affected. The implants are, in the view of US officials, not there to spy and great care was taken to avoid detection. The US view, endorsed by all the other Five Eyes countries, is that these implants were strategic assets to be detonated in the event of a major confrontation between China and the West, most probably over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Salt is a strategic spying scare story, Volt is a direct military threat to the western way of life. The consequences can be imagined thus: think of one of the major ransomware attacks the west has suffered, such as the Colonial Pipeline outage; or the 2019 attack on a private company which left English policing short of half its criminal forensics capabilities; or the small English local authority scrambling to restore its services for vulnerable children after an attack in the same year. Now think of dozens or even hundreds of them at the same time – “everything, everywhere, all at once” in the words of Jen Easterly, recently departed head of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Then think of this as ransomware without ransoms – the affected victims cannot pay their way out of trouble because the objective is political, not financial. The economic, social, and even public safety impact of such an operation would be huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a completely new and extremely troubling scenario. China, for all its many violations of international cyber norms over the years, has no history of disruptive cyber attacks that stop networks from working. It has spied and stolen. And it’s now much better, and more strategically focussed, at that too. That is why both Salt and Volt have Washington and other western capitals rattled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this happen, and what are the implications for western governments and those charged with its cyber defence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-cyber-attack-capabilities--a-third-phase&quot;&gt;China’s Cyber Attack Capabilities – A Third Phase?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell the story of how, in the words of the Wall Street Journal in January, “Chinese hackers graduated from clumsy corporate thieves to military weapons” it is necessary to look to the history of China’s cyber operations. These can broadly, and a bit crudely, be fitted into three different phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase ran from the dawn of the digital age till about 2013. The Communist Party regime was initially terrified of Internet based communications, and focused on developing “protections” for itself such as The Great Firewall. But it also, at this time of rapid economic expansion in China, spotted an opportunity. Insecure western corporate systems were easy pickings for major corporate theft (as indeed were lower classification government systems for more traditional espionage). Industrial scale hacking of research, designs and so on began. While all of this was sponsored by the state, only some of it was done by full state employees; groups of opportunistic hackers sprung up with loose relationships with the regime. Their hacking was noisy, clumsy, and easy to spot – but only after it happened. And the noise did not matter: even before the seminal Mandiant report of 2013, the first major public attribution of this activity, many in the cyber security community, spoke openly about China’s corporate theft. There were no consequences for such actions, and many rewards as a grateful state and corporate sector happily paid for the valuable stolen information. Thus, China’s cyber capabilities were born out of economic objectives, unlike Russia’s, which have always been political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This began to change with the dawn of the second phase of Chinese cyber activity, from about 2013 to about 2020, saw a centralisation and consolidation of China’s capabilities. Three individuals helped shape this, whether intentionally or not. The first, inevitably, was Xi Jinping. The messy, distributed and often chaotic web of actors licensed in some way by the Chinese state ran against his centralising instincts. So his institutional reforms to Chinese administration more generally extended to cyber, with the streamlining of both intelligence and military cyber command structures, and the establishment of a policy agency, the Cyberspace Administration of China, to work out more strategic objectives about what Beijing wanted from cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key player here was President Obama and his team. His interventions were prompted by the genuine fury in America’s business community about corporate IT theft. (Washington was also rattled by the extraordinary strategic reversal of the hack of the Office of Personnel Management’s security clearance database, when the sensitive security records of more than 20 million federal government officials went missing, reflective of the simultaneous focus by China on government espionage). Consequently, the Obama administration started publicising details of Chinese commercial espionage and threatening Xi’s government with sanctions. This forced an agreement in 2015 which, however imperfect, led to several years of relative quiet on the commercial espionage front, with some notable exceptions. By definition, the agreement required further centralised control over the nation’s hackers, adding further impetus to Xi’s centralisation of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, and arguably most important, cause of the shift was, however unintentionally, Edward Snowden. It is generally under-appreciated in the West just how important Snowden is in the history of China’s approach to technology. Beijing was stunned at the extent of the US operation revealed by the former National Security Agency contractor, triggering effectively a Sputnik moment in its approach to its technology strategy. According to the US Ambassador to China at the time, the distinguished former Senator Max Baucus, “the Snowden leaks dramatically changed Chinese policy towards the internet, its own people, the United States, and the world, with respect to the internet and cyber security”. Many Sinologists believe Snowden helped to precipitate the Made in China 2025 strategy, published two years after his leaks and setting out an extraordinary level of ambition for Chinese tech. Set against the Snowden era competition for geopolitical supremacy in technology, commercial hacking – the initial foundation of China’s cyber operations – was now, for Xi’s regime, a sideshow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the third phase of China’s cyber operations, running from about 2020 to the present, is a logical extension of the consolidation and refocussing of cyber operations in the second half of the last decade. It comes amidst the backdrop of the epochal geopolitical contest between the US and China for dominance in the technologies of the future. But unlike the “tech war” of mutual sanctions, industrial production expansion in both the US and China, the cyber aspect of the contest was designed to remain a covert part of China’s strategy. Both Salt and Volt Typhoon were in play for years before being detected. And they are strategic compromises of the west on a scale hitherto unseen by any other cyber power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These twin typhoon threats – one of massive scale strategic espionage, the other about military disruption of key services – are accompanied by other threats such as the large scale theft of strategic data and increasing, though at this stage mostly poor quality, attempts by China to undertake influencing and disinformation operations via digital means, attest to the most significant change in the cyber threat picture in recent years: China’s cyber capabilities are now more strategically and politically focussed, and in general it is much better at this than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-to-be-done&quot;&gt;What is to be done?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave western policy makers and cyber defenders? As always, the debate risks generating more heat than light, with outraged but incoherent calls for “imposing costs”, “striking back” and so on. The reality is more nuanced – there are fundamental issues for both the domestic defence of western economies and the organisations within them, particularly in the private sector, but also for statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, there are five issues to consider when framing a Western response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is about further development of our own cyber detection capabilities. The official US Government guidance to victim organisations for both Salt and Volt Typhoon are commendably honest and therefore make for difficult reading: they openly say how hard it is to detect these intrusions. One technique in particular, called “living off the land” in the trade, is hard to find as the intruder takes great care to look like a normal network user. This presents a significant challenge for the cyber security industry to develop effective mitigations, but it is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is about resilience. This is becoming a cliché, and plenty of more hawkish cyber defenders and geopolitical analysts push back on the notion that you can defend your way out of the problem. But when it comes to resilience, there seems to be little choice but to learn how to cope with the loss of a major network. The British Library in the UK is an instructive example: one ransomware attack by criminals crippled the basic functionality of a key UK institution for months. The essence of the Volt Typhoon threat is dozens or hundreds of such attacks at the same time. So, just as the Covid-19 pandemic prompted soul-searching about just-in-time supply chains, our cyber security vulnerabilities require the same self-examination about fragile services dependent on hackable IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is about the quality, age and sourcing of our infrastructure. What is now known publicly about the Salt Typhoon spying intrusion in particular is that central to the operation was the exploitation of out-of-date kit. This is a long-standing and well-known problem, especially in the telecommunications sector. Yet, most of the policy debate about telecoms security has been, for nearly a decade now, dominated, virtually to the exclusion of all other subjects, by banning Chinese companies, particularly in the United States. Indeed, Congress’s “response” to Salt Typhoon was finally to confirm a languishing $3 billion programme to replace the remaining Chinese kit in US telecoms infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the hack had nothing to do with Chinese kit. Every part of the Chinese campaign exploited vulnerable western manufactured infrastructure. The issue of the general security of often decrepit telecommunications infrastructure, as distinct from who built it, is too often forgotten, particularly in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to a more general fourth point about policy and regulation. The vast majority of the national security risk presented by Chinese cyber aggression is held in the private sector, in the US and elsewhere in the west. Absent specific rules, governments are relying on the companies voluntarily to foot the bill for expensive backup plans for the resilience challenge, or even more costly equipment upgrades for the infrastructure ones. Many will do their best, partly out of commercial incentives, and partly because of a sense of public duty and a desire not to be the cause of a national security crisis. But this will often not be enough. In 2022, the UK Parliament passed the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act, which explicitly requires Britain’s telcos to upgrade their infrastructure security. Importantly, this bill was enacted at the request of the industry, who explicitly told the government that requests from the state to spend on security was no longer a viable model for a highly competitive industry. The UK Government is, following a similar measure in the EU, also preparing to place into law more general cyber resilience obligations on critical infrastructure providers. There is no sign of the US going down this route, given the deregulatory zeitgeist in Washington at the dawn of the second Trump administration. But both Volt, and especially Salt Typhoon show how exposed the US is, and how difficult it will be to move the dial without some form of compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, what is prevalent in Washington is a narrative that the challenge can be met with a more robust response, including by direct action by the US itself against China. There is something in this, as the Obama administration’s success in quieting commercial espionage in 2015 showed. But the reason deterrence in cyberspace has not worked so far is not because we are not “striking back” hard enough. It is because it is very, very difficult. And in particular, like-for-like activity makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US on its own is, by some distance, the most capable cyber power on the planet, and, combined with its allies, further ahead still. Talk of “retaliation” for the Salt Typhoon espionage campaign makes absolutely no sense: the US gains considerable strategic advantage from its intelligence services and to call into question the legality of digital espionage against other states would work against its interests. Moreover, one assumes that the US is conducting extensive espionage operations against China, so “retaliation” for Salt Typhoon is oxymoronic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Volt Typhoon, China has not activated any of its digital booby traps yet, and according to the US Government, there is no sign that it intends do. So, there is no activity to “punish” or “retaliate” for yet. That is where deterrence comes in: the US should, as it has been, make it clear to China that the disruption of critical services in the US or allied territory would be absolutely unacceptable and would come with severe consequences. It is also important that Western offensive cyber capabilities are primed to engage properly should the need arise. But what is important is that policymakers of whatever persuasion are not seduced by a false narrative that there is an easy solution based on cyber power, deterrence and threats of retaliation that we have just been too timid to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-paradigm-shift&quot;&gt;A paradigm shift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these measures: improvements in detection, resilience and the quality of infrastructure; reforms to policy; and a realistic approach to deterrence, are needed if this new threat from China is to be met. But the challenges of domestic protection of critical private sector assets seems to be the most pressing, not least because, in the medium- to long-term, other actors with less cautious political calculations than China could exploit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, cyber security – reducing the vulnerabilities that have been so gapingly exposed – is hard power. And the starting point to getting there is realising that amidst all the noise and hype about cyber threats one thing has genuinely changed: the threat from China is significantly more serious than at any point in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the rise of this term, “toxic gamer culture” has emerged as a related concept, referring to systemic issues within gaming communities, including the cultural normalisation and perpetuation of even the most harmful behaviours within gaming spaces. While these terms are widely used in discussions about online harm, they have often been treated in isolation—examining only a single facet of toxic behaviour or focusing on one specific consequence of toxic gamer culture. This narrow approach overlooks the complexity of online interactions, which are shaped not only by gaming culture but also by a range of social, psychological, and structural factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent research project led by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), funded by the Canadian Resilience Fund, and conducted with members of the Extremism and Gaming Research Network (EGRN) offers a more comprehensive analysis of toxicity in gaming spaces as the first large-scale study to examine the intersection of gaming, social identity, gender, and geographic context (across seven countries, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Indonesia UK, US). Via a comprehensive survey of 2,244 players and analysis of 15 million+ posts on gaming-related platforms, this study examines how toxic behaviours, gamer culture, and socio-cultural influences intersect to create vulnerabilities. In particular, the research explores how these vulnerabilities can be exploited by malign actors seeking to radicalise, recruit, and groom young people for violence. By adopting a multi-faceted perspective, this new study sheds light on the deeper mechanisms that enable harm in gaming spaces and highlights how gaming spaces operate as sites of potential exploitation. In this Insight, we will discuss some key findings from this project relating to the prevalence of harm and gendered norms and socialisation processes across geographical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prevalence-of-harm&quot;&gt;Prevalence of harm&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that exposure to harmful content—including extremist material, hate-based discrimination, and harassment—is widespread in gaming spaces. Across the seven countries studied (Canada, the U.S., the UK, Germany, France, Australia, and Indonesia), a significant portion of gamers reported encountering such content. The kind of exposure varies, with most players reporting they encountered endorsements of violence against specific social groups (38%), images, videos or symbols promoting extremism (33%), or content suggesting they join extremist groups (25%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RiT7Xq4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Younger gamers (ages 18–28) reported higher exposure rates than older gamers (29–44), with men more likely to come across extremist content, while women were more frequently subjected to gender-based harassment. Misogyny was particularly prevalent, reinforcing toxic socialisation patterns that could lower resilience to radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographically, exposure trends varied. In North America and Europe, far-right narratives and anti-LGBTQ+ hate speech were more commonly reported, while in Indonesia, exposure to violent jihadist extremist content was more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings also highlight the normalisation of toxicity within gaming communities and the intersection of social identity factors—gender, nationality, and age—shaping vulnerability to radicalisation. While most of the respondents believe toxicity in games is unacceptable, 30% reported that they felt it was normalised. Males were more likely to find it acceptable than females.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to extremist sentiment can have significant consequences. First, individuals adjust to the norms of their culture (even across digital spaces). As such, the normalisation of extremist language in games puts players at risk of being socialised into extreme ideologies from the broader gaming community. The saturation of extremist language in gaming spaces also makes this environment more vulnerable to direct forms of exploitation, such as propaganda dissemination and recruitment efforts by organised groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cross-cultural-findings&quot;&gt;Cross-cultural findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While extremist content in games has been preliminary researched and discussed within a US or UK context exclusively, it is prevalent across jurisdictions. Looking across geographical contexts, Indonesia (44%) was found to have the highest proportion of respondents exposed to images, videos, or symbols prompting extremism, while France (22.7%) had the lowest. Germany (46%) led exposure to content endorsing violence against specific groups. However, the US had the highest rates of encountering content suggesting they join extremist groups (38%, as compared with 15-26% in the other countries). Further country-level differences are discussed in the full report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a forthcoming journal article, we also analyzed our survey data to assess the overall resilience of players against extremism and violence. In doing so, we found that the more complex a player’s “gamer identity” is – how well it reflects their many identity facets of age, religion, nationality, gender, and ethnicity – the more resilient they are against overall extremist approaches. Building communities that support diverse, complex gamer identities is key to supporting resilience; promoting singular, monolithic ideas of a homogenous “gamer identity” is not. Likewise, helping to create online gaming interactions across people from different backgrounds fosters resilience. We also found that a willingness to stand up for other people being targeted by hate online improves resilience against violent extremism. Conversely, supporting toxic hate and harassment-related beliefs and behaviours reduces that bulwark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gendered-norms-and-socialisation&quot;&gt;Gendered norms and socialisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From socialisation to radicalisation, this research also highlighted the overlapping importance of identity, exposure, and experience. Gendered norms play a prominent role in shaping socialization within gaming spaces, with male respondents reporting that they were more likely to engage in or be exposed to extremist content, while women face higher rates of harassment and exclusion. Female respondents were also more likely to deem “toxicity” in games as unacceptable (68%) than males (50%), and extremist content in games specifically (72% females, 63% males), reiterating gender differences in the experiences of harmful and hateful content in these spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on previous work in this space, we know that this kind of hostile environment can normalize misogyny, fostering an ecosystem where extreme ideas become more accepted over time. Additionally, every prior study to examine misogyny and support for violent extremism or terrorism has found a clear correlation. Prolonged engagement in this kind of environment can contribute to a socializing effect in which players are gradually exposed and indoctrinated to more harmful and extreme ideologies that promote violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-can-we-do&quot;&gt;What Can We Do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gaming industry is not equipped to adequately prevent, detect, or moderate extremist content in games. While the specific kinds of tools and strategies will likely need to be tailored to each particular organisation, studio, or gaming surface, there are commonalities across the space, making industry-wide conversations about these topics critical. Taking this into consideration, there are several strategies that companies could adopt. Building on recent guidance from the GIFCT Gaming Community of Practice Working Group, including threat one-pagers and a new prevent-detect-react framework, these include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prevent&quot;&gt;Prevent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;set-policy&quot;&gt;Set policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one is to concretely prohibit the use of terrorist and violent extremist language, iconography, and sentiment in gaming spaces. Several game-adjacent platforms have already specifically prohibited these actions in their games (e.g., Activision Roblox) whereas other studios do not yet directly note extremism in their terms of service or code of conduct. Clear community guidelines, rules that are well-defined and consistently enforced, are a necessary foundation for both community reporting and establishing cultural norms for gaming communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;build-community-support-models&quot;&gt;Build community support models&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of community management is critical in shaping community norms. Community management roles are consistently underfunded, undervalued, and excluded from trust and safety discussions. However, frontline moderators and community managers play a pivotal role in maintaining safe and positive (and fun) spaces in gaming and digital communities. Many of these digital community leaders report feeling underprepared to handle the complexities of managing online spaces. There is currently a dearth of preventative approaches that include educational support and training for community leaders in games, such as community managers (one notable exception being this new initiative from Discord).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;red-teaming-for-games&quot;&gt;Red teaming for games&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red-teaming is a term originally from info/cyber security used to describe efforts to exploit one’s own products via internal adversarial testing in order to develop mitigation measures (see previous GIFCT outputs on red teaming against terrorist and violent extremist actors). In gaming surface contexts, this would come in the form of built-in checks during the game design process around the leveraging of the content and community by extremist groups. Similar to sensitivity reads for content warnings and accessibility reads to ensure accessibility, we suggest a read dedicated to detecting vulnerabilities across both content and technical capacities in the game, and then make adjustments if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of what red-teaming can do can be seen in the marketing of Wolfenstein 2 (Bethesda). Wolfenstein 2 is a game whose content could have been leveraged by extremists for propaganda; however, the developers got out in front of that process with a marketing campaign that pushed a strong counter-narrative. This campaign, which has since come to be known as the “Punch a Nazi” marketing campaign, was hugely successful in preempting the leveraging of their content and demonstrating how marketing efforts can shape community expectations – and helping to promote the end product. Failing to do so, as Far Cry V did and subsequently saw dramatic exploitation of in-game content by white supremacist groups, also carries consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other prevention approaches include improving awareness of online extremist and terrorist exploitation of games for players, parents, and studios alike; designing influencer campaigns to help promote positive in-game behaviour and norms; and partnering with mental health and psychosocial support groups to help guide intervention, mentorship, and pro-social in-game behaviours. These are detailed in the Prevent, Detect, React framework, as well as in new prevention guidance (Implementing Positive Gaming Interventions: A Toolkit for Practitioners) from our research project team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;detect&quot;&gt;Detect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic moderation detection strategies, such as machine-moderated word lists of hateful and extremist terms, are the bare minimum for multiplayer online games; however, not all games even have these tools, and they rely solely on player reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While detection efforts have grown in the last few years, there is still room for improvement. For example, despite some automatic censoring measures implemented by Steam to filter out offensive language, it is still easy to find posts that convey hateful or extremist sentiments. Additionally, while these detection systems may partially censor slurs and other keywords, often the underlying intent of a message is only apparent to trained human readers, highlighting the limitations and strategic obfuscation of automated moderation systems. Linguistic challenges across geographics – different languages with inadequate ML tooling – also hinder machine-based approaches. Improving both machine moderation – via image, voice, and text detection – as well as trust &amp;amp; safety team training and easy user reporting tools that can be used in-game are critical. Equally, sharing signals and new techniques being used by organised threat actors across platforms and services should be prioritized: the GIFCT Hash Sharing Database and Tech Against Terrorism’s Terrorist Content Analytics Platform do this in part but can be improved. Free or affordable tools to help smaller studios and game creators keep their games safe should also be prioritised via initiatives like ROOST, a new set of AI open-source safety tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;react&quot;&gt;React&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games have an integrated player reporting (sometimes called user reporting) system where players can submit reports based on violations of the terms of service or code of content, which can include extremist content. However, estimates suggest that less than 10% of the active player base will submit reports. In our research, we found that while 90% of players know how to report on one platform, only one in three (36%) know how to report across all the platforms they use. And, worryingly, a similar share (33%) do not feel they are heard when they file a report. Easier reporting systems that provide feedback loops to users are a must, along with providing users categories to flag extremist, terrorist, or violently targeted hate attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know anecdotally that user reporting is necessary but is insufficient in and of itself to address platform, game, or service-level community norms. This does not mean we should not include these systems (we absolutely should), but rather we should consider other potential reactive approaches. For example, transparent feedback pipelines for the reporters and offenders. Research has found that when offending players are given feedback, there are large reductions in repeat offending behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations of reactive approaches also reiterate the need to prioritise the prevent and detect approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intersection of online games, offline identities, and cultural norms can create grounds for the reinforcement of toxic behaviours and the propagation of extremist ideologies, leading into targeted violence. The normalisation of these actions, coupled with the reinforcement of misogynistic stereotypes and harassment in games, highlights a pressing need for interventions that can address these dynamics. Understanding the scope and consequences of extremist behaviour in games and scaling up trust and safety efforts to prevent, detect, and react to it is crucial for fostering positive player experiences, protecting vulnerable users, and ensuring the long-term health of gaming communities. A well-designed trust and safety approach that includes moderation and clear content policies, alongside support for moderators and their communities, will not only minimize harm but amplify the positive experiences within gaming communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne electromagnetic warfare (EW) capabilities are critical to Western airpower, but they are also one of the areas in which NATO countries have the greatest dependence on the US military. The scale of this dependence represents a potential risk for the Alliance if Russian aggression occurs when American reinforcements and support capacity are either tied up with a concurrent crisis in another theatre or are otherwise unavailable at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No single European country has either the existing foundations or sufficient suitably qualified and experienced personnel to rapidly be able to add meaningful capabilities across all aspects of EW. Therefore, creating end-to-end capability within Europe will require genuine multinational partnerships and cooperative specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK has maintained world-class signals analysis and mission dataprogramming expertise, especially through the Joint Electronic Warfare Operational Support Centre and the tactical data-focused Typhoon Mission Support Centre. However, maintaining these vital and scarce capabilities in electromagnetic support measures (ESM) and electromagnetic countermeasures (ECM) in an era of rapidly evolving digital threat systems will require increased investment and rapid adoption of AI- and machine learning-enabled toolsets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key to rapidly increasing European NATO’s ability to collect electromagnetic intelligence data is to ensure that all the electronic support measures suites being carried by non-traditional ISR platforms – such as modern fighter aircraft and UAVs for other mission sets – are used to their full collection potential.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pooled multinational electromagnetic attack squadron procured and run by NATO could allow air forces that are too small to economically field dedicated EW capabilities to meaningfully contribute funding and personnel. There is precedence for this approach in other areas, such as the NATO Airborne Warning and Control System Force (AWACS), the Multinational Multirole Tanker Transport Capability fleet, and the Strategic Airlift Capability fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;European countries should increase funding for the (currently largely experimental) development of stand-in airborne electromagnetic attack (EA) capabilities using relatively cheap uncrewed autonomous systems that can loiter for significant periods over hostile territory, as a means of rapidly expanding EA capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UK has already made significant development progress in novel affordable stand-in EA capability development under the RAF’s Autonomous Collaborative Platforms strategy and the work of the Air and Space Warfare Centre. This represents an obvious route through which increased investment could deliver rapid national and potentially Alliance capability growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Procurement of more expensive but higher performance traditional air-launched stand-in EA capabilities such as ADM-160 MALD-J/X and SPEAR EW should also be pursued as a priority by at least some European countries to enhance the effectiveness of both fourth- and fifth-generation fighter fleets and strike munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic warfare (EW) is a critical and often overlooked facet of modern warfare across all operational domains, particularly as adversaries continue to replace legacy analogue threat systems with digital ones. It is also a particularly acute area of military reliance on the US by other NATO members. EW is perhaps most critical in the air domain, due to the high level of technological sophistication involved, and the degree to which fine performance margins between opposing sensors, effectors and platforms can determine the difference between successful engagements and denial of access to contested airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air domain is also where Western NATO countries have traditionally maintained the greatest degree of technological and tactical overmatch relative to other potential state adversaries. The manifest battlefield dominance conferred by successfully gaining air superiority in various conflicts has led most Western armed forces to double down on airpower as their key source of lethality and ISR. However, this reliance has led adversary nations such as Russia and China to prioritise the development of ground-based air defences (GBAD) and integrated air defence system (IADS) capabilities, as well as EW capabilities tailored around degrading key facets of Western airpower. NATO reliance on airpower for its conventional deterrence and ultimately warfighting edge also means that if air forces (and equally vital space forces) lose advantage in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS), this loss represents an even greater risk than it would in other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four key reasons why policymakers and defence planners in NATO, and especially in European NATO member countries, need to better understand and bolster the people and resources committed to EW programmes now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia is waging an aggressive war in Europe and its military–industrial output and hardened commitment to an adversarial posture towards NATO nations mean that it could rapidly become a direct threat in the coming years. This has led to a major shift in the priorities driving European militaries’ force structure planning and funding. However, forces optimised to provide credible defensive capabilities against Russian military threats have very different EW dependencies and vulnerabilities to manage than those optimised for counterinsurgency campaigns against irregular forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war against Ukraine has exposed Russia’s military to enormous evolutionary pressures, as well as to many Western weapons systems. The result has been a dramatic increase in the pace of Russian EW and sensor development, both in terms of new equipment and the rate at which existing equipment is updated. This has been driven primarily by the need to improve performance against innovative and rapidly evolving Ukrainian capabilities, but it also has clear implications for the pace at which Western forces would need to be able to adapt in the EMS in any future direct clash with Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The current degree of dependence by NATO members on the US creates risks for the Alliance as a whole in an increasingly unstable global geopolitical situation where the risk of wider conflict is growing in Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific simultaneously. Dependence on the US for key military capabilities is hardly a new issue, but few European defence gaps are as stark as for certain key aspects of EW, such as airborne electromagnetic attack (EA). Airborne EA is a crucial requirement for suppression and/or destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) operations and is currently only provided to NATO by periodic detachments from US Navy EA-18G Growler land-based expeditionary squadrons. It is important to understand these dependencies at the policy level. In particular, which areas can be relatively quickly fixed, and which will remain key support areas required from the Pentagon and other US agencies in a NATO context for the foreseeable future? Clarity in this regard is likely to be particularly important in the context of a second Trump administration that has strongly signalled an intent to force other Alliance members to increase their share of burden sharing and defence spending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is an important moment for policymakers to focus on EW due to the rapid changes in both threat and potential capability opportunities that are being brought about by AI- and machine learning (ML)-enabled technology. On the threat side, these techniques are already helping current and potential future adversaries to greatly increase the rate at which they can evolve their own sensor and EW capabilities. On the other hand, AI and ML tools are particularly well suited to enabling transformative increases in the capacity of medium-sized and even small countries to develop, field and maintain potent EW capabilities, given the correct support and resourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I of this paper explains the basic types of EW and the dependencies that they have in terms of electronic intelligence (ELINT) collection and mission data updates, and offers a brief outline of the distinction between EW and cyber warfare. Chapter II explores why the EW requirements for maintaining operational effectiveness are changing for Western air forces and militaries more widely and attempts to make them as easy to understand as possible for non-specialists. Chapter III explores specific areas of over-reliance on the US military by other NATO members and explains why these matter for policymakers. One of the reasons why the current gaps in European airborne EW capabilities have been allowed to develop is because the field has traditionally been seen as a niche where a few geeks or “boffins” work behind the scenes to develop clever gizmos for specialist tasks. In fact, as the paper attempts to explain, bolstering EW centres in multiple countries with skilled personnel and funding to expand and adapt their work to meet the new challenges NATO faces is vital for a host of capability areas across defence. The paper concludes with a summary and recommendations aimed at providing policy advice on how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For NATO’s air and space forces, enhancing European EW capabilities is vital, not only to enhance operational capabilities and reduce dependence on US forces for deterrence purposes, but also to prevent existing systems and weapons from losing their effectiveness against rapidly evolving Russian and potentially Chinese threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper draws on interviews with EW subject matter experts (SMEs) in several key NATO air forces, including the US Air Force, the RAF, the Swedish air force and the Italian air force, as well as industrial SMEs in both defence primes and smaller specialised defence AI and EW companies. The research phase also involved observation of a major air-led joint SEAD/DEAD exercise at NATO Air Command, and backseat observation of SEAD/DEAD sorties with specialist units of the US and Italian air forces. Due to the highly sensitive nature of many NATO EW capabilities and detailed information on adversary EW, radar and communications systems, much of the research activity cannot be directly quoted or attributed. However, where possible, visits and interviews have been cited. Information is sanitised throughout to avoid disclosure of any classified material, and as such the analysis is aimed at improving understanding of current EW gaps and potential solutions across the defence and the policy community, rather than contributing analysis to advancing the understanding of specialist practitioners already familiar with the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-electromagnetic-warfare-ew-basics&quot;&gt;I. Electromagnetic Warfare (EW) Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three primary categories of EW used in the air domain: EA, electromagnetic support measures (ESM) and electromagnetic countermeasures (ECM). All are vital components of modern air operations, and as such are important for senior officers and policymakers alike to understand – at least in general terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electromagnetic-attack-ea&quot;&gt;Electromagnetic Attack (EA)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA broadly refers to the use of electromagnetic energy to degrade the performance of hostile systems for offensive purposes. This is, in many ways, the simplest form of EW to understand and in non-technical terms would be referred to by many as “support jamming”. In its most basic form, EA can be conducted through so-called “noise” jamming, where an emitter is used to flood a given part of the EMS with energy. There are many more complex EA techniques, for example, using digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) jammers to transmit slightly modified variations of hostile radar signals to force them to display inaccurate range or position information. Whether through simple noise jamming or more complex techniques, the goal is to disrupt the ability of enemy radars or communications systems to receive the signals that they rely on to function. This can deny those enemy systems the ability to accurately detect and determine the range to friendly aircraft and incoming weapons, in the case of radars, or to reliably connect, in the case of communications systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at stand-off ranges, high power output levels are required relative to the signal strength of the target radar to achieve an effective jamming-to-signal ratio, which is a challenge to achieve using compact airborne emitters against large ground-based systems. Radars can “burn through” noise jamming signals, with their range in any given circumstances dictated by multiple factors, including relative output power and antenna alignment. Modern, frequency-agile digital radars can also rapidly change the frequency and pulse repetition patterns of their own emissions and filter out other signals to greatly reduce the effectiveness of jamming. Most modern radars also have good side-lobe interference detection and rejection capabilities, meaning that they are not particularly susceptible to jamming signals from emitters that cannot draw a direct line of sight to, and maintain alignment with, the main radar lobe. The consequence, in lay terms, is that conducting effective EA from stand-off assets such as the EA-18G Growler against the latest generation of Russian and Chinese ground-based and maritime radars requires much greater power output and more precisely tailored and agile jamming signals than were needed to provide effective stand-off support EA against previous generation threat radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electromagnetic-support-measures-esm&quot;&gt;Electromagnetic Support Measures (ESM)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second subset of airborne EW is ESM, which encompasses the exploitation of passively collected electromagnetic emissions to identify, track and possibly even target hostile systems. In its broadest sense, ESM refers to the process of using detection and analysis of electromagnetic energy to build an intelligence and situational awareness picture of hostile forces. As such, ESM includes the often-underappreciated but vital role of ISR assets and operators who use a range of (primarily airborne and orbital) platforms to collect and record the signals emitted by hostile systems for subsequent analysis. High-profile examples include the RAF’s RC-135W Rivet Joint ELINT/SIGINT (signals intelligence) flights in the Black Sea during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These sorties probably provided the UK and other NATO nations with invaluable information on the radar signals emitted by a variety of Russian GBAD and combat aircraft systems, at times at considerable risk to the crews. Simply intercepting and recording the signals in question is not enough, however. They must be noticed and isolated within the huge volumes of other signals present in the ever-more crowded EMS and subsequently analysed, tentatively identified and ideally cross-referenced to a geolocated specific enemy threat system to confirm the suspected identity. From that point on, the ELINT intercept can be used to either build a new entry in a national or NATO threat library of enemy radar and communications systems, or update the entry for an existing system that has been recorded emitting previously unseen waveforms. Such databases are crucial for not only detecting and mapping enemy radar and communications systems for operational assessment and planning purposes, but also for programming tactical defensive ESM suites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ESM suite is a vital component of every modern combat aircraft. The traditional active radar in the nose of an aircraft will only detect other airborne, ground-based or maritime assets that are in its cone of regard while it is actively scanning. By contrast, ESM suites enable Western aircraft to detect friendly, unknown and potentially hostile radar emissions of all sorts from multiple directions simultaneously, thereby building situational awareness entirely passively. In the same vein, any active radar emissions from Western aircraft during a state-on-state conflict will likely be rapidly detected by hostile ESM systems, some of which can obtain target-grade ranging and ultimately track information over time if the emissions are constant. In particular, stealth aircraft such as the F-35 must carefully control their own radar emissions to avoid being detected by hostile ESM sensors. This makes their own ability to detect and engage targets passively and using low probability of interception/low probability of detection (LPI/LPD) radar techniques a key determinant of their effectiveness. Therefore, not only are competitive ESM suites vital for warning pilots of threats as a self-protection function, they are also increasingly important as a source of competitive advantage in enabling pilots to operate effectively with minimal need to give away their own position with active radar emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electromagnetic-countermeasures-ecm&quot;&gt;Electromagnetic Countermeasures (ECM)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECM involves the use of electromagnetic energy by a platform to defend itself from enemy attacks, generally by degrading the signals received by enemy fire control radars, datalink connections or missile seekers. These techniques are also sometimes known as self-protection jamming or self-screening jamming. Whereas EA or support jamming is traditionally conducted from stand-off ranges to improve the survivability of other friendly aircraft and weapons, ECM is conducted by the platform under attack itself. As such, ECM techniques can generally assume that they will be able to achieve alignment with the main lobe of an enemy radar, since said radar will need to have the aircraft or weapon it is trying to engage within its main lobe to achieve a guidance-grade target track. ECM is also traditionally likely to be conducted from shorter distances away from the threat radar in question, compared with stand-off EA techniques. This main lobe alignment and potentially shorter range to the threat means that ECM systems can be effective in degrading a given radar threat using a significantly smaller antenna array with lower peak power output potential than an EA jammer would require, albeit probably only for a short period of time. Most modern combat aircraft carry a sophisticated ECM suite that either relies on externally carried pods or antenna arrays integrated into the airframe, as well as use of the main attack radar antenna itself to emit tailored jamming signals in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an on-board ESM suite detects and classifies radar emissions as a threat to the aircraft, the ECM suite can then be used to conduct focused jamming, using either older “noise”-based techniques or more sophisticated techniques such as spoofing using DRFM technology, to try to deny the attacking radar accurate ranging information for a short period. The aim is to break the kill chain on any missile that might be being guided towards the aircraft, and thus provide a window for the aircraft to either escape the missile engagement zone, or to destroy or disable the threat in question with its own weapons. ECM techniques can greatly increase the self-defence capabilities of modern combat aircraft when they are engaged, especially alongside other defensive countermeasures systems such as towed radar decoys, evasive manoeuvres and dispensing radar-reflective clouds of chaff. However, ECM suites rely on up-to-date mission data loads for their effectiveness. This is because aperture size and onboard power and cooling constraints mean that most fighter-mounted ECM suites have a relatively low peak power output capacity compared with large Russian or Chinese ground-based or maritime air defence radars. Therefore, a purely noise-based jamming approach is unlikely to be effective against these systems using onboard ECM systems. Furthermore, the closer an aircraft flies to a radar threat, the greater power it must use to prevent that radar from achieving burn-through against its EA or ECM jamming and achieving a lock regardless. This means that even with a highly capable ECM suite and other countermeasures, there are limits to how far any aircraft can penetrate into Russian or Chinese IADS coverage, especially if they lack high-end radar cross-section reduction features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ew-is-not-the-same-as-cyber-warfare&quot;&gt;EW is Not the Same as Cyber Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In very simple terms, EW can be thought of as techniques to create effects or gain intelligence on hostile systems through the medium of pulses of electromagnetic energy, whereas cyber warfare can be thought of as techniques to create effects or gain intelligence on hostile systems through the medium of digital code. However, in practice, the boundaries between the two are increasingly blurred, and since both take place in the EMS, they are often discussed together. For example, some more advanced EW techniques can use tailored signals to create subtle spoofing effects in enemy systems with a low probability of being detected compared with traditional “jamming”. However, crafting such signals successfully relies on a deep understanding of the code on which the enemy system is running, and how it interprets incoming signals and displays them to operators as information. One way of accessing the required data to gain the required level of knowledge of enemy systems would be through cyberattacks on the units that operate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if a cyberattack had been successfully conducted against an adversary state’s air defence system, it could enable the attacker to then produce a tailored EA signal that could be emitted by aircraft equipped with suitable EA or ECM systems in flight. The subsequent EW effects delivered by that airborne asset during an airstrike might cause the adversary air defence system to fail to display contacts correctly or display false contacts that would sow confusion among operators. The effects would appear similar to those that might be caused by a cyberattack but would technically be an EA/ECM effect achieved with a signal tailored using data obtained through a prior cyber penetration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-rapidly-evolving-requirements-for-effective-ew&quot;&gt;II. Rapidly Evolving Requirements for Effective EW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule, building and maintaining effective EW capabilities requires access to up-to-date and detailed databases containing information about enemy radar, communications and EA systems. For an ECM or EA signal to be effective at disrupting or suppressing enemy radars or seeker heads, it must be tailored to the way that the threat systems themselves emit. Likewise, for an ESM system to be able to reliably detect and identify threat radars, let alone perform more advanced functions, the ESM library must include accurate data on the signal patterns emitted by the threat system in question. For much of the 20th century, such databases might only need to contain the frequency bands, pulse repetition patterns and power levels associated with a given adversary radar system, for example. Collecting these could be very challenging until a system was encountered in actual combat and its emissions recorded, identified and catalogued. However, once a given analogue radar was in the threat database of a nation, any EA or ECM signal developed to counter it could remain effective for some time. Unfortunately, this is no longer true, due to the rapid digitisation of Russian and Chinese radar (and communications) systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, a majority of the most notable ground-based and maritime – and some airborne – radar systems fielded by Russian and Chinese forces can be, and are, regularly reprogrammed using a simple USB connection to change the signal patterns they emit. This means that to maintain accurate threat libraries of hostile systems, NATO must update them in orders of magnitude faster than in previous decades. Collection can be done through either intercepting and identifying novel signals from emitting radars using assets with good ELINT collection capabilities, or obtaining the information through covert means. In some ways, this part of the EW problem set is becoming easier, because many modern combat and ISR aircraft have potent potential ELINT detection and collection capabilities, thanks to sophisticated ESM suites. The F-35 is an obvious example, but most modern fighters, such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen and latest standards of the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18E/F family, also have sophisticated ESM and ECM suites that under the right circumstances will detect and can record novel radar signatures. What this means is that a huge amount of potentially useful ELINT data is gathered routinely by assets that are not performing dedicated ISR taskings, but rather are automatically recording radar signals detected by their ESM suites during more traditional combat air missions. In some ways, such data can be even more useful than that collected using dedicated ELINT assets, since enemy radar and EW system operators are likely to be more careful with emission control around known ELINT collection assets, compared with when monitoring potentially hostile fighters. Orbital surveillance and monitoring of the EMS is also becoming an increasingly important part not only of strategic ISR but even of day-to-day operational planning and targeting activities, in Ukraine and elsewhere. The problem, however, is that the resulting quantities of potentially significant ELINT data being gathered by a wide variety of dedicated and non-dedicated ELINT assets in the air and in orbit are far too great to analyse and exploit in a timely fashion using traditional methods, which rely heavily on manual analysis by intelligence analysts. It is no use having an asset that has detected and recorded a new signal pattern unless that novel signature can be spotted within the terabytes of ELINT data being gathered every day, analysed, correctly identified as coming from a specific threat system, and then exploited to produce updated mission data for friendly EA, ESM and ECM systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real-world example of the potential risks that are posed to air forces and other parts of the Joint Force when the ELINT collection, subsequent processing, exploitation and dissemination (PED) and mission data update cycle does not keep pace with changing threats was seen during the initial NATO response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. US Air Force F-35s from the 388th Fighter Wing deployed to Europe to take part in the enhanced deterrence and reassurance patrols that were mounted along NATO’s eastern border in the weeks following the start of the invasion. During that period, Russian air defence systems were operating using “war modes” that had previously not been observed or collected by NATO ELINT systems. As a result, despite having the most capable ESM suite on any NATO fighter on the Eastern border, the 388th Fighter Wing’s F-35s did not always recognise and correctly identify Russian GBAD systems. In the words of the Wing’s commanding officer, Colonel Craig Andrle: “We’re looking at an SA-20 [NATO’s name for the S-300 surface-to-air missile system]. I know it’s an SA-20. Intel says there’s an SA-20 there, but now my jet doesn’t ID it as such, because that SA-20 is operating, potentially, in a war reserve mode that we haven’t seen before”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, as Andrle made clear, the pilots and wider NATO Air Command mission planning structure had other sources of intelligence to draw on which meant that the SA-20 battery in question was already geolocated and positively identified, so there was no direct risk to the F-35s or their crews. In fact, in this case, the result was positive because the ability of the F-35’s ESM suite to detect and record the signals at a high level of fidelity, and geolocate their source, enabled that new “war mode” signal to be matched to a known SA-20 site. It is reasonable to assume that subsequently that new signal was added to Allied threat library entries for the SA-20 system and incorporated into the ESM mission data loads, not only for US Air Force F-35s but also for a wide range of other NATO aircraft. EA and ECM countermeasures could be developed and optimised against the new “war mode”, leveraging the ELINT collection capabilities of the F-35. However, in a direct clash with Russian forces, NATO forces would be likely to face similar challenges with previously unseen and rapidly changing “war mode” signal patterns from GBAD and airborne threat systems that had not been previously geolocated or positively identified. Pilots are at significantly increased risk if their aircraft cannot rapidly and accurately identify ground-based and aerial sources of radar emissions, and are therefore unable to identify what sort of threats they are facing and at what ranges they need to take mitigating action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the pace of change that adversary threat systems are now capable of requires changes to the way that the ELINT collection, PED and mission data update cycle is conducted by air forces, and at the Joint Force level across NATO. Fortunately, there are several promising opportunities offered for militaries looking to reform the PED cycle, and even the execution phase of EW operations. AI and ML processes are, in many ways, ideally suited to providing genuinely revolutionary improvements in PED capacity, as well as holding out the promise of novel tactics and techniques for EA and ECM. Broadly speaking, one way to think of the strengths and weaknesses of AI in its currently practical guises is that it is an increasingly powerful way to provide accurate and rapid answers to relatively simple questions that are asked across vast and complex datasets. However, AI and ML tend to be far less useful when the questions, tasks or instruction sets are complex or contain subjective elements. Speeding up and enhancing PED on ELINT data is, therefore, an application to which AI is well suited, since the instructions can be simple – for example, asking the program to strip out known signals and/or flag unknown signals, or subtly changed signals within a vast quantity of ELINT intercept data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatively simple AI processes can, in this way, be used to strip out the vast majority of data that is not of interest to human analysts, highlighting the few signals that are unknown or likely to be new variations on already known systems that have changed their signal behaviour. This allows scarce skilled human intelligence analysts to focus their analytical skills and time on these few unknown or altered signals, and on cross-referencing them with other sources of surveillance and geo-intelligence to generate a high-confidence attribution of each new signal detected to a specific hostile system. As a result, procuring and incorporating AI- and ML-enabled tools, either in-house or as a service from trusted industry partners, can dramatically increase the speed at which air forces (and other parts of the Joint Force) can produce updates to threat libraries and mission data files. The RAF recently found an increase of over 21,000% in the speed at which large datasets collected by one of its frontline platforms could be analysed, through the use of relatively simple AI-enabled tools from industrial partners. However, incorporating such tools into national and Alliance PED cycles requires the procurement flexibility and funding to contract with industry or recruit the necessary specialists at scale, and an approach to security and data management that enables such partners to work in the often highly classified spaces within which EW work traditionally sits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a hostile radar, communications or EW signal has been collected, isolated within other data, analysed, and positively identified, there is still more work to do before frontline EA, ESM and ECM capabilities can benefit. When a new signal is entered into either a national or Alliance threat library database, it must then be used to update the mission data on frontline weapons systems and platforms. For example, in the UK, most ELINT signals analysis, exploitation and threat library update work is conducted by the Joint Electronic Warfare Operational Support Centre (JEWOSC) at RAF Waddington, while the processing of “tactical data” from each sortie, and update work on platform-specific mission data loads, are conducted elsewhere. Examples include the Australian, Canadian and UK Reprogramming Laboratory (ACURL) for the F-35, or the Mission Support Centre at RAF Coningsby for Typhoon. Therefore, if analytical and exploitation work is greatly streamlined and improved by the use of new tools such as AI- and ML-enabled technologies, corresponding investment will still be needed to enable similar improvements in the pace at which mission data support centres can get the updated threat signals flying on frontline aircraft. If not, the risk is that platforms and weapons systems will not be able to have their mission data updated fast enough to benefit fully from a more rapid strategic and operational level collection and PED cycle, even if that is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have already been impressive demonstrations that point the way forward in mission data updates, relying on a mix of technological improvements and regulatory/certification process changes. One example is the rate at which Ukrainian forces and their international partners have been able to broadly keep pace with the rapid and accelerating pace of Russian EW and UAV control signal evolution, through attached specialists at relatively low tactical echelons conducting regular reprogramming of Ukrainian UAVs and EW equipment. Countries that have maintained close support links to the Ukrainian Armed Forces have benefited from significant learning opportunities inherent in exposure to the rapid pace of enforced mission data and control frequency adaptation in that theatre. An example more directly related to traditional air force business was the successful demonstration by the US Air Force of passing ECM and ESM system library updates to an F-16 Block 50 in flight in 2021, albeit in a flight test context, rather than a frontline unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holy grail of EW that many militaries are hoping AI will unlock is what is usually known as “cognitive electromagnetic warfare”. Cognitive EW aims to create systems that upon encountering previously unseen signals automatically analyse them and provide a likely identification, then configure and emit a tailored ECM or EA signal in real time, or at least close to real time. These techniques would reduce the degree of reliance on pre-programmed mission data files that contain accurate and up-to-date threat libraries. The US Air Force’s 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing has reportedly already been making progress on implementing at least some cognitive EW techniques for several years in a practical context. However, as with so many things where AI is seen as key to unlocking radical progress, fielding reliable and certifiable cognitive EW systems on frontline aircraft and weapons at scale requires overcoming major challenges at both the technical and organisational levels. For example, maintaining up-to-date “blue force” signal libraries is an important requirement for ESM techniques, because if there is high confidence that all radar and EW signals from national and Allied assets are known and programmed into ESM suites, then anything unknown across various signal categories can be theoretically presumed hostile. However, if cognitive EW techniques are used to develop novel ECM or EA signals “on the fly”, tailored in response to novel threats, then those AI- or ML-generated ECM/EA signals would also be being received by the ESM suites of Allied assets, and would be registered as unknown, and possibly hostile. Even if actual friendly fire can be prevented through various IFF (identification friend or foe) deconfliction mechanisms, the use of cognitive EW techniques for ECM/EA signal generation would still need to be carefully managed to avoid interference with blue-force sensors and the risk of compromising the capacity of national and Allied assets to distinguish between novel adversary signals and novel friendly ones. In other words, fratricide in the EM spectrum is a major risk that cognitive EA/ECM systems will need to overcome before they can be fielded at any scale in practical combat situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-nato-reliance-on-the-us-for-ew-in-the-air-and-space-domains&quot;&gt;III. NATO Reliance on the US for EW in the Air and Space Domains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many areas of heavy reliance on the US within NATO, but two of the most glaring and potentially serious are in the EW domain. The first is ELINT collection, distribution and analytical capacity, and resulting threat library data. While details are classified, and for good reason, in outline terms the US provides the vast majority of the current capacity in NATO. The US military operates by far the largest and most diverse fleet of both airborne and orbital ISR assets in the Alliance, and some of the most capable non-traditional ELINT-gathering platforms. The US also runs the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS), a global network architecture into which data from ISR platforms can be uploaded, transmitted to the appropriate military entities and intelligence agencies across the US government and the US Department of Defense for analysis and exploitation, and subsequently redistributed as intelligence products to frontline user groups. The US also maintains the most complete and up-to-date threat libraries in NATO, which many Allies rely on, either through direct access where security agreements allow, or through US-supplied mission data updates for American-supplied weapons systems such as the F-35 and the F-16. However, it is important to clarify that European reliance on the US is not total, and there are other states within the Alliance that have capabilities in the collection, PED and mission data generation fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, France and Sweden both produce highly capable ECM suites for the Rafale and Gripen fighter aircraft respectively, and both have a national capability to produce mission data updates for those systems. They also both have national ELINT collection capabilities. For Sweden, these include the ESM suites on the ASC 890 Erieye AWACS and its upcoming replacement the S 106 GlobalEye. French collection capabilities are fairly extensive, including the E-3F Sentry AWACS, the “CERES” ELINT satellites and the “ASTAC” pods for the Mirage 2000D that allow it to perform ELINT collection tasks. Germany and Italy both maintain small but highly skilled ESM- and ECM-focused analysis and mission data-programming teams to support their respective Tornado ECR squadrons and upcoming Eurofighter EK and EA-37B programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has purchased three RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft that it operates in close cooperation with the larger US Air Force RC-135W fleet – to the point that crews from each country routinely fly on both UK and US airframes. The arrangement is highly beneficial for the UK, since operating the RC-135W within a joint enterprise grants unique access into the US Air Force’s own highly secretive Rivet Joint “ecosystem”. However, it has also provided the US with major benefits beyond the additional three British airframes and crew capacity. During the war in Ukraine, British risk tolerance has been significantly higher than that of the US for crewed intelligence-collection flights, meaning that RAF RC-135W crews have flown tense missions in the Black Sea throughout the war, where US Air Force crews have not had political permission to operate. Consequently, through the RAF RC-135W fleet, the US system has probably gained access to ELINT data on Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) radars, EW equipment and other systems operating in war reserve modes that it might not have been able to collect itself. The UK has also maintained genuinely world-class signals analysis and mission data programming expertise through the JEWOSC, as well as at the tactical data-focused Typhoon Mission Support Centre and the F-35 ACURL. However, the scale remains distinctly modest, and much of the work of these organisations is conducted in close coordination and with significant enablement from the US intelligence system – which is both a significant force multiplier and a source of dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the areas of capability mentioned, most European NATO members lack dedicated ELINT collection capabilities and significant EW-focused analytical and mission data reprogramming capacity. This is largely a function of the fact that these comparatively specialised areas are difficult to grow and maintain in medium- to small-sized military forces that lack the economies of scale and career management flexibility that come from larger force structures. For many smaller countries, “covering the basics”, such as fielding a mechanised brigade, a squadron or two of fighter aircraft and a few naval vessels, is a major task within the personnel and funding available. It is, therefore, unsurprising that few countries have managed to generate or sustain significant modern ELINT collection and EW support centres. This means that the gaps that do exist in the capacity of larger non-US NATO member states such as the UK, France, Germany and Italy are more impactful in the EW domain than the overall size of the Alliance would suggest. It is an area where most NATO member states are simply too small to add significant capacity to the Alliance unless they choose to make it a specific area of national specialisation or cooperate in multinational programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differences in security standards and classification criteria between NATO member states also complicate the sharing and pooling of EW support capacity in many cases, especially outside the Five Eyes countries. The result is that in many cases countries rely on either the US or other European manufacturers of their various weapons systems to provide prompt mission data updates. This represents a level of sovereign dependency, and thus potentially risk, but for most smaller European states is likely to represent a better “product” in terms of access to relatively up-to-date mission data for their platforms than they would be able to achieve by trying to build EW collection, PED and mission data programming capacity at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second area of heavy NATO dependency on the US is in airborne EA, or support jamming, where almost all the Alliance’s capability resides in the EA-18G Growler squadrons of the US Navy, and to some degree (with a focus on disrupting hostile communications rather than radars) in the US Air Force’s EC-130H Compass Call and new EA-37B Compass Call aircraft. There are no comparable capabilities elsewhere in NATO air forces – although the Italian air force has ordered two EA-37B aircraft that should be in service by the late 2020s. The US F-16CMs at Spangdahlem, Italian Tornado ECRs at Ghedi and German Tornado ECRs at Schleswig are all SEAD aircraft with impressive ESM and some ECM capabilities. However, these types lack the capacity to perform the airborne EA to provide escort jamming to other platforms as a Growler would. “Step 1” of the German Eurofighter EK programme to replace the Tornado ECR in Luftwaffe service by 2030 will bring enhanced stand-off SEAD capabilities, but the ambition to add a “Step 2” with airborne EA support jamming capability is still in the planning phase, and will not be operational until at least the early 2030s. What makes the Growler unique is that in addition to its highly capable ESM suite for detecting and classifying enemy radar emissions, it carries three AN/ALQ-99 or new AN/ALQ-249 Next Generation Jammer pods to generate the power and provide the array aperture sizes needed for effective stand-off EA against ground-based radars. The Growler’s two-seat design also means that there is an additional crew member who can fully focus on monitoring the behaviour of enemy radars and adjusting the EA effects required accordingly. Having been derived from the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet airframe, the Growler also has fighter-class performance that helps it to reach the altitudes and speeds required to maintain alignment with the aircraft or weapons it is protecting, and the threat radar in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only existing European-made pod designed to increase fighter ECM capabilities towards the power levels and bandwidth coverage of the AN/ALQ-99 is made by Saab. Their EA pod was developed and tested on the Gripen C/D and uses the same “Aeraxis” EW architecture as their Gripen E/F fighter and the upcoming Eurofighter EK, but with additional power output and bandwidth coverage potential. However, the Aeraxis pod has not yet been purchased by the Swedish air force or the Luftwaffe, who remain focused on optimising ESM and ECM for platform self-protection over dedicated support EA. The UK is in a similar position with its plans to retrofit advanced ECM capabilities onto its 40 Tranche 3 Typhoons as part of the ECRS Mk2 radar programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of any European equivalent to replace the support EA role that is currently fulfilled by US Navy EA-18Gs is a serious risk for NATO’s defensive capabilities against any future Russian aggression. This is because airborne EA is a vital component of the composite air operations (COMAO) packages that NATO would need to employ to successfully degrade the Russian IADS in the first weeks of any direct conflict. Airborne EA is critical for enhancing the capability of traditional non-stealth combat aircraft such as the Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen and F-16 to operate on the outer edges of SAM engagement zones to provide stand-off weapons and other supporting effects, and also for degrading Russia’s ability to shoot down incoming precision-guided munitions. The US Navy has previously tried to withdraw funding for the expeditionary Growler squadrons, although at the time these plans were blocked by Congress. However, as the Growler is a critical component of all US Navy carrier air wings and demand for the type consistently outstrips the number available in all theatres, these are among the most likely US military assets to be unavailable for operations in Europe in the event of a concurrent crisis in the Indo-Pacific or US withdrawal from European defence deployments. The increasing numbers of F-35s present in Europe will reduce, but not remove, the degree of risk that this airborne EA dependency represents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-35 was designed to operate against Russian GBAD systems, and it combines reduced radar cross-section for passive stealth with its own stand-in ECM/EA capabilities. The details of these capabilities are classified, which prevents a detailed explanation of their strengths and limitations here. The author has observed these F-35 stand-in ECM/EA capabilities being used to significant effect in multiple NATO exercise and during multinational live training sorties to protect themselves and nearby aircraft from active threats. They are a key and often underappreciated part of the aircraft’s capability to operate in contested airspace. However, it is notable that the US Air Force still heavily draws on the US Navy’s five expeditionary land-based EA-18G squadrons for force protection in high-threat areas even where F-35 and F-22 are in use. Stealth aircraft also inherently benefit greatly from airborne EA support, since it further enhances the effectiveness of their signature-reduction features by degrading enemy radar performance that is already likely to be relying on minimal signal returns. It is also notable that, as with any EA/ECM capability set, the F-35 itself will rely on having up-to-date mission data files informed by accurate threat libraries to remain effective against rapidly changing enemy radar systems in any future conflict. For most Alliance members, these mission data updates will have to come from the US, although the UK and to a lesser extent Norway, Italy and the Netherlands have some national mission data reprogramming capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area of EW development where multiple NATO member states, including the US, are currently investing, and which might help mitigate the current reliance on US Navy Growlers, is stand-in EA systems. As side-lobe interference detection and rejection capabilities continue to improve on Russian and Chinese radar systems, the advantages of stand-in jamming as opposed to traditional stand-off airborne EA will continue to increase, since stand-in ECM and EA emitters have a much better chance of being able to maintain alignment with the main lobe of a given threat radar. Expendable stand-in jammers are already an established part of the NATO arsenal, in the shape of the ADM-160 Miniature Air-Launched Decoy-Jammer (MALD-J) and the upgraded MALD-X, albeit again provided by the US. The UK has a long-running stand-in jammer prototype in the SPEAR EW offshoot from the SPEAR 3 (Selective Precision Effects At Range 3) programme, with a compact EA payload in place of the explosive warhead in the primary SPEAR missile. However, while the SPEAR EW programme has continued to be funded at a limited scale, the UK has not yet committed to purchasing the system as a frontline capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less traditional approaches are also being actively explored, informed in part by lessons and operational data and experimentation in Ukraine, on ways to use uncrewed systems or even balloon-mounted EA emitters to provide loitering stand-in EA effects against air defences and other key Russian targets. As multiple states explore the potential of cheaper uncrewed autonomous systems to augment traditional combat air platforms, such as the US Collaborative Combat Aircraft or the UK’s Autonomous Collaborative Platform programmes, one of the most alluring potential early use cases is likely to be for stand-in EA. The latter could provide meaningful increases in Joint Force capabilities to penetrate and degrade a Russian or Chinese IADS, and allow novel autonomous platforms to be experimentally introduced into service without necessarily triggering the legal, regulatory and ethical challenges that arming such autonomous systems is likely to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, for novel uncrewed systems or decoys to successfully plug the current gaps in non-US airborne EA capability, they will need to be procured in reasonable numbers and distributed to the units that in wartime or during exercises would prepare and launch them. Even if autonomous stand-in EA assets can be made individually cheap enough to use repeatedly at scale, doing so will still require a logistics, command and control, mission planning and deployment architecture within the Joint Force to deploy them when and where they are needed in coordination with the COMAO. This will require people, funding and planning to be allocated to the problem at a scale significantly beyond that currently being devoted to innovative R&amp;amp;D and experimentation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian (and Chinese) threat systems are now evolving at a sufficiently rapid pace that ensuring a constant flow of accurate updates to EW mission data loads for weapons systems and platforms will be critical for ensuring combat effectiveness in any NATO Article 5 situation. This is particularly true in the air domain, due to the reliance by aircrew on ESM suites for situational awareness in many situations, and the need for effective ECM and EA options to keep platforms safe when engaged and to allow stand-off weapons to penetrate defences. In many cases, it may not be cost effective to replicate EW enablement provided by larger partner states at a national level. However, it is important for defence planners and senior leaders across NATO to be aware of which national EW dependencies are in this category, and which current risks are being held by their forces that could be mitigated with targeted investment. In some countries and armed services where such matters have traditionally been viewed as “niche”, senior leaders and planners may well be unclear about exactly what level of risk they are holding in the EW domain. This is especially likely given the rapid and ongoing evolution of both the threat and the technologies available to potentially help meet it. In such cases, senior leaders should be making it a priority to be thoroughly briefed both by national EW specialists (where available) and/or by experts from allies and partners, to allow centralised planning and budget allocation to be adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across NATO, the overall level of dependence on the US is very high for most EW capabilities, especially in terms of dedicated airborne and orbital collection assets, exploitation capacity for ELINT data once collected, and airborne EA to provide support jamming to Allied aircraft and weapons against high-end threat systems. This represents a potential risk for the Alliance in the event of Russian aggression when American reinforcements and support capacity are tied up with a concurrent crisis in another theatre or are otherwise unavailable at scale. In attempting to redress the balance and reduce this risk, European states should try to reinforce areas of comparative strength, rather than trying to replicate the full spectrum of American EW capabilities at a tiny scale in every country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are pre-existing areas of expertise that could be significantly enhanced with targeted increases in personnel allocation and funding, as well as contracted support from specialist defence industrial partners. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High-end hardware manufacturing capability for arrays in Italy, Sweden and France.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expertise and capacity in ELINT analysis and mission data update production in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expertise in Russian threat radar and tactics in the SEAD squadrons in the German and Italian air forces, and in elements of the UK armed forces that have worked most closely with Ukrainian partners since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ECM programming and fighter integration experience and capacity in France and Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list, nor does it imply that states not mentioned in relation to a given facet have no capability in that area. Rather, it is intended to demonstrate that there are solid foundations that could be built upon in multiple non-US member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK government, it is worth focusing on the fact that the UK has successfully maintained world-class signals analysis and mission data programming expertise, especially through the JEWOSC, as well as at the tactical data-focused Typhoon Mission Support Centre. However, maintaining these vital and scarce capabilities in ESM and ECM in an era of rapidly evolving digital threat systems will require increased investment and rapid adoption of AI- and ML-enabled toolsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it should also be clear that, even with increased investment, such comparatively small and specialised centres of talent and experience could only significantly reduce overall NATO reliance on the US military in the EW realm through greatly increased multinational cooperation and data sharing. No single European country has either the existing foundations or sufficient suitably qualified and experienced personnel to rapidly be able to add meaningful capabilities across all aspects of EW. Therefore, to create end-to-end capability within Europe will require genuinely multinational partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also unlikely that European NATO air forces will be able to replicate most of the dedicated airborne and orbital ELINT collection capabilities that the US contributes to the Alliance, given the huge costs and timeframes that such an effort would entail. For orbital capabilities, leveraging commercial SIGINT/ELINT constellations such as HawkEye 360 would seem sensible, but these would almost certainly be unable to fully replicate US capabilities such as Advanced Orion. Many NATO countries do operate significant numbers of fighter aircraft and other maritime and land-based systems that offer ELINT collection capabilities, at least in theory. The F-35, Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen and specialist SEAD aircraft such as the Tornado ECR all have sensitive ESM suites, and some can be fitted with specialised ELINT-gathering pods, as can long-endurance UAVs such as the MQ-9 Reaper. The key to rapidly increasing European NATO’s ability to collect ELINT data, therefore, is to ensure that all the ESM suites being carried by non-traditional ISR platforms for other mission sets are used to their full collection potential. This means an increased emphasis on getting tactical data off non-traditional ISR platforms and fed into either national, NATO or US systems such as DCGS for analysis and exploitation. It also means investing in technologies such as AI- and ML-enabled analytical tool sets that can enable relatively small teams of human analysts to find new and unknown signals or changes in known patterns within the vast ELINT datasets that modern combat aircraft collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For airborne EA capabilities to augment, and if necessary replace, the vital contribution of the US Navy’s EA-18G Growlers, options are limited in the immediate term. The European nation that is closest to having an existing fighter-mounted solution is Sweden, with the combination of Gripen C/D or the new Gripen E with the existing Aeraxis EA pod. Even a relatively small number of pods acquired and integrated into the existing Gripen fleet could allow the Swedish air force to make a uniquely valuable contribution to European SEAD/DEAD capabilities through specialising in airborne EA. Another option that should be seriously considered is the establishment of a multinational NATO airborne EA squadron, along similar lines to the existing NATO AWACS, Multinational Multirole Tanker Transport squadron and Strategic Airlift Capability C-17 squadron. A pooled multinational EA squadron could allow air forces that are too small to economically field dedicated EW capabilities to contribute funding and personnel meaningfully. It might also provide a vehicle to marginally ease classification and bilateral disclosure challenges for countries outside Five Eyes, by enabling the US to provide “black boxed” mission data updates and assign US nationals to the NATO unit to operate any particularly sensitive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recommendation is to increase funding for the (currently largely experimental) development of stand-in EA capabilities using relatively cheap uncrewed autonomous systems that can loiter for significant periods over hostile territory. Such relatively cheap platforms tend to be propellor powered and cruise at slow airspeeds to enable them to attain the required ranges and endurance with compact airframes. Therefore, these systems will also require novel and likely cross-domain and cross-service solutions for fielding, supporting and deploying them alongside traditional combat aircraft in any conflict with Russia (or China for the US).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final recommendation is that to reduce technical risks and increase the problem set that NATO can pose to adversaries, procurement of more expensive traditional air-launched stand-in EA capabilities such as ADM-160 MALD-J/X and SPEAR EW should also be pursued as a priority by at least some countries in Europe. In the long term, the ever-increasing side-lobe interference rejection capabilities of digital radar systems are likely to mean that stand-in EA has a longer developmental road to run than stand-off EA aircraft like the Growler. Therefore, investment in autonomous or at least automatic stand-in EA capabilities appears a wise choice for European states seeking to close the EW gaps in NATO’s European order of battle.&lt;/p&gt;

Russia’s primary targets have included transportation, government, critical infrastructure, and industry, and its main weapons and tactics have included explosives, blunt or edged instruments (such as anchors), and electronic attack. Despite the increase in Russian attacks, Western countries have not developed an effective strategy to counter these attacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is engaged in an aggressive campaign of subversion and sabotage against European and U.S. targets, which complement Russia’s brutal conventional war in Ukraine. The number of Russian attacks in Europe nearly tripled between 2023 and 2024, after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023. Russia’s military intelligence service, the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (or GRU), was likely responsible for many of these attacks, either directly by their own officers or indirectly through recruited agents. The GRU and other Russian intelligence agencies frequently recruited local assets to plan and execute sabotage and subversion missions. Other operations relied on Russia’s “shadow fleet,” commercial ships used to circumvent Western sanctions, for undersea attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data indicate that Russia poses a serious threat to the United States and Europe and that the Russian government, including President Vladimir Putin, cannot be trusted. Roughly 27 percent of the attacks were against transportation targets (such as trains, vehicles, and airplanes), another 27 percent were against government targets (such as military bases and officials), 21 percent were against critical infrastructure targets (such as pipelines, undersea fiber-optic cables, and the electricity grid), and 21 percent were against industry (such as defense companies). Many of these targets had links to Western aid to Ukraine, such as companies producing or shipping weapons and other matériel to Ukraine. Russia also used a variety of weapons and tactics. The most common (35 percent) involved explosives and incendiaries. Other weapons and tactics included blunt or edged instruments (27 percent), such as anchors used to cut undersea fiber-optic cables; electronic attack (15 percent); and the weaponization of illegal immigrants (8 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in attacks indicates that the West has failed to coerce Russia from stopping its campaign of sabotage and subversion. Russian attacks are not just a European problem, but a U.S. problem as well. The GRU and other organizations have conducted operations against U.S. targets, such as U.S. bases in Germany. The United States and European countries, including the European Union and NATO, have largely focused on defensive measures to counter Russian actions, such as sharing intelligence and strengthening resilience (including cyber defense). While these efforts are necessary, they are not sufficient. NATO countries should develop a calibrated offensive campaign against Russia that includes several components: escalating sanctions against Moscow; targeted offensive cyber operations against important Russian military and commercial targets; information and influence operations targeting the populations of Russia and its partners, such as Belarus; and more aggressive actions against assets valuable to Russia, such as its shadow fleet. In short, NATO should design a campaign to escalate the costs on Russia should the country continue such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand Russian actions, this brief asks several questions. What are Russian objectives in conducting these attacks? What are the main tactics and targets of Russian actions? And what should the United States and other Western countries do to better deter and counter Russian activity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, the analysis utilizes several sources of data. Most importantly, it builds and analyzes a database of Russian destructive attacks and plots between January 2022 and March 2025, including date, location, target, weapon, and other information. In addition, it supplements this database with an overview of historical Russian and Soviet activity. It also utilizes data from other sources, such as CSIS’s database of hundreds of cyber incidents since 2006. Finally, it uses information from interviews with U.S. and European government officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this brief is divided into five sections. The first provides an overview of actions below the threshold of conventional warfare, including their historical use by the Soviet Union and Russia. The second section assesses Russian motivations for conducting this type of warfare, including the benefits and drawbacks. The third examines the main Russian actors involved in planning and executing its shadow war, from the Kremlin to the GRU and local recruits. The fourth section analyzes the primary trends in Russia’s actions, including geographic location, targets, and weapons. And the fifth outlines policy implications for the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-shadow-wars-the-historical-context&quot;&gt;Russian Shadow Wars: The Historical Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions below the threshold of conventional warfare have long been an important component of statecraft. U.S. military doctrine refers to these types of actions as “irregular warfare” or “irregular activities,” while European governments have frequently referred to these actions as “hybrid warfare” or “hybrid threats.” Others have used different terms to capture some or all of these actions, such as gray zone activity, political warfare, asymmetric conflict, unconventional warfare, and low-intensity conflict. These types of activities involve using tools of statecraft below the threshold of conventional warfare to shift the balance of power in their favor. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information and influence operations, including psychological operations and propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offensive cyber operations and electronic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support to state and non-state partners, such as guerrillas and proxy forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Covert and clandestine actions by intelligence and special operations forces, including sabotage and subversion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and the Soviet Union have a rich tradition of conducting this type of warfare. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union developed an aggressive campaign to influence populations across the globe in ways that aided Soviet interests and undermined the United States and its allies, which was best captured in the phrase “active measures” (or активные меры). Led by the KGB, the Soviet Union’s premier spy agency, active measures included several types of activities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written and oral disinformation (or дезинформация), including “gray” (unattributed) and “black” (falsely attributed) propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of agents of influence, including foreign academics and media assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clandestine radio stations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of foreign political parties and international front groups to pursue Soviet national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for international revolutionary and terrorist organizations, including national liberation movements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Political blackmail and kidnapping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Targeted assassinations, including the killing of defectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet active measures focused primarily on the United States, which it referred to as the main opponent or adversary (or главный противник), though the KGB and other Soviet agencies, such as the GRU, also focused on Western European and other countries in order to undermine U.S. influence and alliances. As one former Warsaw Pact intelligence operative noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Target No. 1 was the United States. . . . The objective was to hurt the United States wherever and whenever it was possible, to weaken the positions of the United States and Western Europe, to create new rifts within the NATO Alliance, to weaken the position of the United States in developing countries, to cause new rifts between the United States and developing countries, to disinform the United States and the Western allies about the military strength of the Soviet bloc countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documents collected by Vasili Mitrokhin, an archivist for the Soviet Union’s foreign intelligence service who defected to the West just as the Cold War ended, provide some of the most illuminating insights into Soviet active measures. As one KGB analysis explained, “The main value of all Active Measures lies in the fact that it is difficult to check the veracity of the information conveyed and to identify the real source. Their effectiveness is expressed as a coefficient of utility, when minimum expenditure and effort achieves maximum end results.” In addition to active measures, the Soviet Union and more recently Russia also used such strategies and tactics as denial and deception (or маскировка) and information confrontation (or информационное противоборство).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-strategy&quot;&gt;Russian Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Russian active measures support the following types of foreign policy objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Influencing public opinion through psychological operations in Europe, the United States, and other countries to support Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coercing governments, companies, or individuals to stop taking specific actions, particularly curbing military and other assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterring countries, companies, or individuals from taking specific actions, such as escalating the type and amount of military aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deterring Russian soldiers, government officials, and citizens from defecting to the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creating fissures between governments, especially between NATO allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Undermining the democratic norms and values that underpin the West.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of operations have several benefits, which make them attractive to Russian leaders. First, they allow countries to conduct coercive activities against a state below a threshold that is likely to trigger a costly or risky conventional war. Countries generally do not respond to actions below the threshold of conventional warfare by declaring war on the perpetrator. For example, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that an armed attack against one NATO member is considered an attack on all members. But NATO governments typically do not consider active measures “an armed attack” that requires collective self-defense. This means that perpetrators, including Russia, know that they can conduct these activities without causing a conventional war. As a 2024 Norwegian intelligence assessment concluded, “Any act of sabotage would most likely be performed in a manner that would make it challenging to prove who was behind it. One important reason for this is that Russia wants to avoid any situation that could trigger Article 5 of the NATO Treaty regarding collective defense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, these types of actions are relatively inexpensive for perpetrators. Unlike conventional war, they generally do not require vast sums of money and do not cause the perpetrator to suffer substantial casualties. Some of these actions—such as offensive cyber, electronic warfare (including GPS jamming), and influence operations—can also be done from a state’s own territory, a third country, or virtual networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, these types of actions are often deniable, and targeted governments are frequently cautious—sometimes overly cautious—about attributing them due to fear of escalation. Since they may not be directly perpetrated by a government operative, countries can—and generally do—deny responsibility. Governments have frequently used a number of entities as cut-outs, such as local recruits, including criminal organizations or diaspora populations, non-governmental organizations, and companies. Russia has also used commercial vessels, such as the oil tanker Eagle S, which sailed under the flag of the Cook Islands, for sabotage operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these benefits, however, actions below the threshold of conventional warfare have limitations. To begin with, they often have a limited impact. For example, it is difficult to conquer a country using irregular or hybrid means. In addition, local assets recruited to conduct covert actions may not be professional operatives with extensive training in strategic sabotage and tradecraft beyond what their case officers can teach them, undermining the effectiveness of these operations. As the head of MI5, Ken McCallum remarked about Russian actions in Europe, “Russia’s use of proxies further reduces the professionalism of their operations, and—absent diplomatic immunity—increases our disruptive options.” MI6 chief Richard Moore similarly noted that Russia is “having to do it through criminal elements” in Europe, which has some costs. “Criminals do stuff for cash,” he noted. “They’re not reliable. They’re not particularly professional. . . . I think Russian intelligence services has gone a bit feral, frankly, in some of their behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing actions to non-state or quasi-state actors creates a classic principal-agent problem. If a group’s or actor’s goals are not closely aligned with that of its patron, the potential for agency loss is high and local recruits could go rogue. These types of actions can also trigger a response from the targeted government or governments, even if it is not a conventional war. Examples include economic sanctions, expulsion of government officials, the arrest and imprisonment of perpetrators, or even irregular and hybrid actions in response. Finally, these types of actions can backfire and cause a rally-around-the-flag effect in the targeted country by increasing resolve among the affected population, strengthening opposition to the sponsor’s policies, and driving up military spending, as well as increasing interest in balancing alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-actors&quot;&gt;Russian Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian covert operations against the West are part of its foreign policy, and decisionmaking for them is centralized in the Kremlin and led by an experienced hand in covert action, President Vladimir Putin. As an operative in the KGB, Putin served in the station (or резидентура) in Dresden, East Germany, and helped spearhead active measures against West Germany. He later became head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), a successor to the KGB involved in countering foreign intelligence services, combating organized crime, and ensuring economic and financial security. Putin has long supported strategies and tactics below the threshold of conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the Kremlin, there have been several reforms regarding the organization and implementation of active measures. Around 2022, Russian Presidential First Deputy Chief of Staff Sergey Kiriyenko established the Committees of Special Influence, which is responsible for assigning Russian special services with specific tasks in target countries. In addition, activities such as violent provocations are authorized by a committee of the National Security Council under the guidance of its secretary, Sergei Shoigu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main Russian organization involved in active measures is the GRU, headed by Admiral Igor Kostyukov. In addition, Andrei Averyanov, deputy head of the GRU, is likely responsible for overseeing all active measures other than those targeting Ukrainian territory. Averyanov established the Service for Special Activities, which includes three main entities: Unit 29155, Unit 54654, and a headquarters and planning department for coordinating the Service for Special Activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRU Unit 29155 is the most well known of these entities. It is also referred to as the 161 Intelligence Specialists Training Centre (Центр подготовки специалистов специального назначения), or 161 Centre. Soviet leaders established the unit in 1963 and brought together human intelligence and special operations personnel. Today, some evidence suggests that the 161 Centre is organized into a headquarters unit, three training units, an operational planning unit, three operational units, a financial and logistical unit, and a supply unit. It deploys personnel to Europe and other locations for active intelligence under partial legalization. For Russia’s special services, “legalization” involves the establishment of a cover identity that allows an individual to conduct covert activity in a target country or countries. Depending on the duration of the activity, Russia divides legalization into “full” and “partial” categories. Full legalization generally means that an operator stays in place for an indefinite period of time, while partial legalization assumes a short-term stay and basic levels of scrutiny by the target government’s intelligence or law enforcement services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRU Unit 29155 was linked to the March 2018 nerve agent poisoning in the United Kingdom of Sergei Skripal, a former GRU officer that had worked for British intelligence and then defected, along with his daughter. The unit was also likely behind the September 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny; a campaign to provide money to Taliban-linked militants in Afghanistan to target foreign forces, including potentially U.S. troops; a failed coup attempt in Montenegro in 2016; and the poisoning of Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev, his son, and his business manager in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRU Unit 54654 is designed to build a network of illegal operatives operating under full legalization. The unit recruits individuals with prior military service or other backgrounds—including foreign students studying at Russian universities. It also recruits contractors through front companies, keeps their names and personally identifiable information out of government records, and embeds its officers in Russian ministries unrelated to defense or in private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other GRU organizations involved in subversive activities—particularly cyber operations—such as GRU Unit 26165 (also referred to as Fancy Bear) and GRU Unit 74455 (also referred to as Sandworm). The United States and European Union have sanctioned a wide range of GRU operatives for their involvement in clandestine activity. For example, the European Union sanctioned Nikolay Alexandrovich Korchagin, Vitaly Shevchenko, and Yuriy Fedorovich Denisov from GRU Unit 29155 for their involvement in cyberattacks against Estonia. The United States also sanctioned GRU officer Valery Korovin for his involvement in influence operations targeting the 2024 U.S. presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), the Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI), and the FSB have also been involved in active measures in Europe, the United States, and other countries. SVR cyber units, such as Nobelium (also known as Advanced Persistent Threat 29, the Dukes, Cozy Bear, and Midnight Blizzard), have conducted a wide range of cyberattacks against U.S. and European targets. As Microsoft assessed in one attack, their cyber analysts identified “Russian threat actor Midnight Blizzard sending a series of highly targeted spear-phishing emails to individuals in government, academia, defense, non-governmental organizations, and other sectors.” The SVR’s Nobelium unit was involved in the massive data breach of SolarWinds, a company based in Austin, Texas, that made network monitoring software. The SolarWinds supply chain attack gave Russia the ability to spy on and disrupt more than 18,000 computer systems across the globe, including in the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, and the Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GUGI is a secretive Russian agency belonging to the Russian Ministry of Defense that operates submarines and vessels that can engage in sabotage, such as cutting undersea fiber-optic cables, collecting intelligence, and conducting other operations. There are currently 16 cables running under the Atlantic that connect the United States with mainland Europe. They are primarily operated by such companies as Google, Microsoft, France’s Alcatel Submarine Networks, and China’s Huawei Marine Networks. Submarine cables are critical for global communication and account for roughly 95 percent of all transatlantic data traffic. These cables are vulnerable to subversion and sabotage, even from the anchors on ships. When ships drag anchors on the bottom of the seabed, it can either completely sever cables or cause partial damage that over time leads to deterioration—and ultimate failure—of the cable. As a result, Russia does not even need to use GUGI’s specialized equipment to disrupt these cables.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Richard Moore, head of MI6, the United Kingdom’s foreign intelligence agency: “We have recently uncovered a staggeringly reckless campaign of Russian sabotage in Europe, even as Putin and his acolytes resort to nuclear saber-rattling, to sow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine, and challenge Western resolve in so doing.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ken McCallum, head of MI5, the United Kingdom’s domestic intelligence agency: “The GRU in particular is on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: we’ve seen arson, sabotage and more. Dangerous actions conducted with increasing recklessness.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Anne Keast-Butler, director of GCHQ, the United Kingdom’s main cyber agency: The United Kingdom “is increasingly concerned about growing links between the Russian intelligence services and proxy groups to conduct cyber attacks—as well as physical surveillance and sabotage operations.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thomas Haldenwang, head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, or BfV, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency: “We have been observing aggressive actions by the Russian intelligence services for some time now. Russia is using the entire toolbox, from influencing political discussions to cyber attacks on critical infrastructure to sabotage on a significant scale.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bruno Kahl, head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, or BND, German’s foreign intelligence agency: “Whether we like it or not, we are in direct confrontation with Russia.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Donald Tusk, prime minister of Poland, “Russia was planning acts of air terror, not only against Poland but against airlines around the world.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An analysis by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: “The Russian Federation is waging a hybrid war against Poland. This includes cyberattacks and assaults at Poland’s eastern frontier, which is also the Schengen areas’ border.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Radoslaw Sikorski, Polish foreign minister: “I have information that the Russian Federation is behind sabotage attempts both in Poland and allied countries.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tomasz Siemoniak, Polish interior minister, “We are facing a foreign state that is conducting hostile and—in military parlance—kinetic action on Polish territory. There has never been anything like this before.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An analysis by NATO: “NATO Allies are deeply concerned about recent malign activities on Allied territory, including those resulting in the investigation and charging of multiple individuals in connection with hostile state activity affecting Czechia, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the United Kingdom. These incidents are part of an intensifying campaign of activities which Russia continues to carry out across the Euro-Atlantic area, including on Alliance territory and through proxies. This includes sabotage, acts of violence, cyber and electronic interference, disinformation campaigns, and other hybrid operations. NATO Allies express their deep concern over Russia’s hybrid actions, which constitute a threat to Allied security.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vice Admiral Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS): “The risk level has changed. We believe sabotage is more likely, and we see acts of sabotage happening in Europe now which indicate that they (the Russians) have moved a bit on that scale.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kaja Kallas, prime minister of Estonia: “There’s a shadow war going on against our societies. The aim of Russia’s influence operations is to influence our democratic decision making. By making these events public, we raise awareness so that these operations would not have the effect Russia is hoping for.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia uses a wide range of non-state or quasi-state actors to conduct active measures. The significant expulsion of Russian spies from Europe since 2022 has, in part, forced Moscow to rely on other networks, though governments have long used non-state or quasi-state entities for actions below the threshold of conventional warfare. One example is criminal organizations. As Ken McCallum, head of MI5, explained, “The more eye-catching shift this year has been Russian state actors turning to proxies for their dirty work, including private intelligence operatives and criminals from both the UK and third countries.” In addition, the GRU and other Russian organizations have frequently relied on local recruits, sometimes referred to as “disposable agents.” In some cases, Russia has recruited these individuals on Telegram channels, through chat functions of popular online games, or through other online locations. The GRU and other organizations have recruited Russian-speaking, and on some occasions technologically savvy, young men between 20 and 30 years old. Some may be ideologically motivated and support Russia, while others may simply do it for the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also used commercial ships, including its “shadow fleet,” to conduct active measures such as sabotage. The shadow fleet emerged as a way for Russia to circumvent Western-imposed sanctions on Russian oil transported by sea. To skirt the restrictions, the Kremlin invested billions of dollars in a fleet of tankers whose ownership is difficult to trace to Russia. Many sail under the flags of other nations—such as Gabon, Liberia, the Marshall Islands, and Panama—and sell to buyers in countries like China and India. According to one assessment, approximately 70 percent of Russia’s oil is being transported by so-called shadow tankers. Russia has used other civilian vessels for intelligence collection and sabotage, including its vast commercial fishing fleet and marine research ships. Some of the ships are relatively modern, longer than 300 feet, and equipped with sonar and other technology that allows them to scan the seabed. Such vessels have mapped critical subsea infrastructure around Europe and identified potential targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-actions&quot;&gt;Russian Actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has conducted a wide range of active measures in Europe. This section is divided into four areas: (1) overall trends, (2) targets, (3) weapons, and (4) geographic area. It relies on several data sources. The first is a CSIS database of Russian subversive actions between January 2022 and March 2025, including date, location, target, weapon type, and other information. The data cover Russian attacks and plots that had (or were intended to have) physical effects, such as weapons and tactics using explosives, other incendiaries, firearms, and anchors for cutting undersea fiber-optic cables. Attribution is always difficult for active measures. To be included in the database, CSIS identified at least three credible sources for the direct or indirect involvement of the Russian government, interviewed government and non-government experts, and asked several experts to review the data and analysis. In addition, CSIS assessed the level of confidence for each incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS database excluded several types of activities. For example, most Russian cyber operations were excluded. It is virtually impossible to build a comprehensive unclassified database of cyber operations, since cyberattacks do not necessarily have a physical effect (such as a warehouse blowing up, an individual assassinated, or a cable cut) and the targets (such as foreign government agencies and companies) have numerous incentives not to publicly acknowledge the attacks. In addition, Russia and other state actors frequently perpetrate cyber operations to collect intelligence, not necessarily to impose a cost on a foreign state or other entity. However, the CSIS database did include those incidents where Russian cyber or electronic warfare attacks had an observable physical effect. These types of attacks are designed to disrupt critical infrastructure, such as power grids, water systems, and transportation networks that can lead to power outages, disruptions, or physical harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS database also excluded Russian disinformation campaigns, such as election interference and efforts to sow discord or otherwise influence the populations or governments in Europe, the United States, and other locations. Much like cyberattacks, it is virtually impossible to build a comprehensive unclassified database of information or influence campaigns since attacks frequently do not have a physical effect and the targets have numerous incentives not to publicly acknowledge the attacks. Nevertheless, Moscow has developed an aggressive campaign to interfere with democratic elections in individual countries and European Parliament elections, co-opt politicians for elite capture, and spread disinformation. As noted previously in this analysis, the Soviet Union and such organizations as the KGB have a rich history of disinformation campaigns and other active measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overall-trends-in-attacks&quot;&gt;Overall Trends in Attacks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant finding from the data is that the number of Russian attacks in Europe nearly tripled between 2023 (12 attacks) and 2024 (34 attacks), after quadrupling between 2022 (3 attacks) and 2023. As noted in more detail below, Russian agencies orchestrated attacks in 2024 against a wide range of targets, from critical infrastructure to transportation targets, using a variety of weapons and tactics, from explosives to blunt or edged weapons such as anchors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What factors caused this dramatic increase? While it is difficult to know with certainty, there are likely several factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it appears that Russia made a strategic decision to escalate its shadow war in Europe in response to U.S. and European aid to Ukraine. Many of the targets were linked to Ukraine in some capacity. Examples range from a Russian military defector assassinated in Spain to a series of companies—such as BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, German Diehl Group, and EMCO—that produce weapons for Ukraine. As a Norwegian intelligence assessment concluded, one of the primary Russian targets in Norway includes “actors involved in arms donations and the training of Ukrainian personnel. They are especially at risk of being targeted because arms deliveries could have a direct impact on the battlefield in Ukraine.” There were also no recorded incidents against several countries that did not provide significant aid to Ukraine, such as Hungary and Serbia, which suggests that Moscow was deliberate in where it conducted attacks—as well as where it did not conduct attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Russia may have increased its attack tempo because there were few, if any, costs for its actions. Russian leaders knew they could get away with attacks—including an escalation in attacks—without paying a major price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;targets&quot;&gt;Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s most frequent targets in Europe were in the transportation sector (27 percent), such as trains and airplanes (including through GPS jamming), and against government targets (27 percent), such as government officials, military bases, and border crossings. Russia also conducted attacks on critical infrastructure (21 percent), such as pipelines and undersea fiber-optic cables, and industry (21 percent), such as defense companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a5tai7v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Targets of Russian Attacks in Europe, 2022–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime, land, and air transportation targets were a major focus of Russian active measures. Germany experienced a railway cable-cutting attack in 2022. In addition, Russia conducted multiple attacks against Poland’s rail system. Russia also targeted airplanes through electronic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical infrastructure attacks were also a focus of Russian operations, including undersea cables and pipelines. Finnish investigators assessed that the Newnew Polar Bear, a Chinese-registered ship operated by a Russian crew, damaged two subsea data cables and a gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea with its anchor. The ship was trailed by the Sevmorput, a nuclear-powered merchant ship owned by the Russian government. In addition, the Eagle S, an oil tanker, apparently dragged its anchor and damaged a cable in the Gulf of Finland. The Vezhen, a Maltese-flagged ship, damaged an undersea fiber-optic cable linking Latvia and Sweden. Armed police parachutists from Sweden promptly boarded the ship. Finally, the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3, which had a Russian captain, cut an undersea cable on its journey through the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of some Chinese cargo ships, with Russian crew, is noteworthy because China has also engaged in attacks against Taiwan’s undersea fiber-optic cables. Taiwan has approximately 14 international underwater submarine cables and 10 domestic ones, as well as limited satellite access in low Earth orbit, making it vulnerable to a subversive campaign. In January 2025, for example, a Chinese-owned vessel cut an undersea fiber-optic cable near Taiwan’s Keelung Harbor. While it is unclear to what degree Russia and China have cooperated and shared lessons, both countries have adopted a similar tactic (the use of commercial vessels) against similar targets (undersea cables and pipelines).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private industry, especially the defense industry, was also a common target of Russian activity. The two largest European donors of military aid to Ukraine—Germany and the United Kingdom—experienced attacks on numerous defense manufacturing plants. In May 2024, for example, a major fire broke out at a Diehl Group factory in Berlin, which manufactures IRIS-T surface-to-air missiles used in Ukraine. A month earlier, there was an explosion at a weapons manufacturing site in South Wales belonging to BAE Systems, the United Kingdom’s largest arms manufacturer, which has supplied ammunition, weapons, and other defense equipment to Ukraine. A BAE investigation into the incident found no evidence of sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian sabotage occurred in other countries as well. There was an explosion linked to Russian services at a warehouse in Spain that stored communications equipment bound for Ukraine. Less than a year earlier, explosions went off in the ammunition warehouses of the Bulgarian arms manufacturer and trader EMCO, only days after Bulgaria announced it would officially join the coalition to supply shells to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also targeted several types of individuals that cut across government and industry sectors: corporate executives, including ones involved in supplying weapons and other matériel to Ukraine; journalists that investigated Russian activity; Russian defectors to the West, including a Russian soldier; and Ukrainian officials. Several were assassination plots that failed: one in Poland targeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; one in Austria against Bulgarian investigative journalist and director of the Bellingcat investigative reporting group Christo Grozev; and one in Germany targeting Armin Papperger, the chief executive officer of Rheinmetall, a large producer of artillery and tanks that had sent shells to Ukraine. The assassination plot against Papperger was one of the first instances in which Russia attempted to take lethal action against a Western citizen who had no previous connection to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several other attacks against individuals. One was the assassination in Spain of Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian helicopter pilot who defected from Russia in August 2023. Another was the 2024 assault in Lithuania on Leonid Volkov, a Russian citizen and former close aide of now-deceased Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The assailants, who Lithuanian intelligence assessed were likely “Russian organized,” broke Volkov’s arm but failed to kill him. Another incident involved the vandalization of a car belonging to Estonian Minister of the Interior Lauri Läänemets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, German prosecutors charged three Russian-German nationals—Dieter Schmidt, Alexander J., and Alex D.—with acting as secret service agents for Russia and plotting bombing and arson attacks against U.S. military bases in Germany. Dieter Schmidt also allegedly participated in other sabotage operations, including taking pictures of military installations with an aim to endanger national security. The U.S. bases had connections to Ukraine. At the U.S. base in Grafenwoehr, Germany, Ukrainian troops were being trained to operate M1 Abrams tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tactics-and-weapons&quot;&gt;Tactics and Weapons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most frequent type of weapon used in Russia’s shadow war were explosives or incendiaries (35 percent), including bombs; blunt or edged instruments (27 percent), such as anchors; and electronic attack (15 percent). The next most common were the weaponization of illegal immigrants (8 percent) and the use of firearms (2 percent). Russia’s use of weapons that kill, injure, or destroy property suggests that Moscow seeks to send a clear message to deter or coerce behavior, such as sending weapons to Ukraine. But the attacks had few casualties, indicating that Russia wants to keep the costs low and maximize deniability. The low level of violence has also allowed Moscow to escalate if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OUmnJ6r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Weapons Used in Russian Attacks in Europe, 2022–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most innovative weapons in Russian attacks was the use of electric massagers implanted with a magnesium-based flammable substance that exploded at DHL logistics hubs in Leipzig, Germany; Birmingham, England; and Jablonow, Poland. These plots may have been a test run to figure out how to get such incendiary devices aboard planes. Polish prosecutor Katarzyna Calow-Jaszewska concluded that Russia’s goal was to “test the transfer channel for such parcels, which were ultimately to be sent to the United States of America and Canada.” German police who tested models of the incendiary devices noted that that once the magnesium ignited, it would have been difficult to extinguish with the firefighting systems on most airplanes. Fires also targeted warehouses and other targets across Europe, from the United Kingdom to Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian agencies utilized electronic attack and cyber operations with physical effects against transportation targets. Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Norway, and Poland all reported specific incidents of deliberate GPS signal jamming from Russia, which led to navigation errors, flight deviations, and communication breakdowns—endangering the lives of those on board. Several countries, such as Poland, also reported cyberattacks against transportation targets, such as rail lines. More broadly, Russian-linked actors conducted hundreds of cyberattacks against targets in Europe, the United States, and other regions to collect intelligence, deface websites, orchestrate a denial of service, and occasionally conduct sabotage, according to a broader CSIS database of cyber incidents between 2006 and 2025 where losses were greater than a million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia and Belarus weaponized illegal immigrants against several border countries, such as Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Poland. In 2021, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko threatened to “flood” the European Union with “drugs and migrants,” and then his government sent thousands of migrants from Iraq and other countries to the borders of Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in 2021 and 2022. In November 2023, Finland closed its border with Russia following a surge of border crossings instigated by Russia; 900 third-country nationals arrived in Finland without valid documentation in November alone. In the summer of 2024, Poland experienced a surge to nearly 400 illegal border crossings a day. These border crises were likely orchestrated to pressure state institutions, drain resources, and fuel anti-migrant rhetoric exploited by far-right parties across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geographic-area&quot;&gt;Geographic Area&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia conducted attacks throughout Europe, as indicated in Figure 4. However, the attacks were largely concentrated in NATO’s eastern flank, such as Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, as well as waters like the Baltic Sea. In addition, Russia targeted countries that supplied weapons or other matériel to Ukraine or sheltered Russian defectors, such as Bulgaria, France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. There were no recorded attacks against countries with closer relations with Russia, such as Hungary or Serbia. Russia also did not conduct attacks against several other European states, such Greece, Portugal, Romania, and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dxKBwjE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Geographic Area of Russian Attacks, 2022–2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;going-on-offense&quot;&gt;Going on Offense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian active measures are not just a European problem, but a U.S. problem as well. The GRU and other organizations have plotted attacks against U.S. bases in Europe, including in Germany, and mapped undersea transatlantic fiberoptic cables that connect the United States and Europe. In addition, Russian military and intelligence agencies have also conducted offensive cyberattacks, disinformation, and other active measures against the United States both at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s escalation of its shadow war indicates a Western failure to impose sufficient costs on Moscow. Some European leaders have refrained from attributing attacks to Moscow because they fear further escalation. The United States and European countries have largely focused on defensive measures to deter or counter Russian actions. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing intelligence sharing among Western military, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies. In February 2023, for instance, NATO created an Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell to assess vulnerabilities and coordinate efforts between NATO governments and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Heightening patrols and surveillance. NATO established the Baltic Sentry operation to protect underwater cables and pipelines by enhancing the alliance’s surface, sub-surface, and air presence in strategic locations. The operation involved frigates, maritime patrol aircraft, submarine satellites, remotely operated vehicles, drones, and other surveillance assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthening national resilience by hardening critical infrastructure, including protecting oil and gas pipelines, warehouses, and cyber networks. For example, the European Union and NATO established an EU-NATO Task Force on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure. Several countries, such as Finland, Sweden, the Baltic states, and Poland, have also adopted measures to strengthen resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there have been some actions designed to impose costs on Russia. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closing Russian consulates, such as the one in Poznan, Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expelling Russian government officials, including over 750 diplomats and intelligence officials between February 2022 and October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Denying diplomatic visa applications to potential Russian spies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arresting and prosecuting perpetrators of attacks, such as Dylan Earl for allegedly sabotaging Ukrainian businesses in east London, Alexander Suranovas (also known as Igor Prudnikov) for his apparent involvement in the DHL bombing plot, Dieter Schmidt and his colleagues for plotting bombing and arson attacks against U.S. bases in Germany, alleged GRU operative Mikhail Mikushin (also known José Assis Giammaria) who was arrested by Norway for subversive activities, and Siergey S. for his apparent involvement in arson attacks in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Closing borders, such as the decision by Finland in November 2023 to close its 830-mile (1,340-kilometer) border with Russia in part because of Russia’s weaponization of illegal immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imposing limited sanctions on individuals, companies, and other perpetrators of active measures. For example, the European Union sanctioned Nikolay Alexandrovich Korchagin, Vitaly Shevchenko, and Yuriy Fedorovich Denisov—operatives in GRU Unit 29155—for their alleged involvement in cyberattacks targeting Estonia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense is necessary, but not sufficient. These actions are not particularly costly for Russia and are unlikely to coerce Moscow into ending, or even reducing, its active measures. Western countries have decided not to impose more significant costs for several reasons. First, some leaders have worried that a more robust response would cause further Russian escalation. As one analysis concluded, “Western leaders are reluctant to call for a larger military response to these attacks, which could trigger uncontained escalation.” Second, some have opposed a more robust response because they argue that the West is not “at war” with Russia. As one assessment summarized, “the West may be limited in the kinds of counteroperations it can launch in the face of continued acts of Russian sabotage. For one thing, the United States and its allies cannot easily respond in kind, because they are not officially at war with Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike authoritarian countries such as Russia, this logic assumes that democratic countries cannot—or should not—conduct forceful actions against Russia because they are not involved in a declared war. Yet these concerns are largely fallacious, and they reflect a mindset of self-deterrence. Russia, not Europe or the United States, chose to escalate a shadow war in Europe. In fact, a failure to respond will likely increase the likelihood of a protracted Russian campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, NATO should complement these defensive measures with a calibrated offensive campaign that focuses on several elements. These actions could be integrated into broader negotiations on a peace deal with Ukraine, in which the United States or European countries threaten—either implicitly or explicitly—offensive measures if Russia continues its sabotage campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, NATO should develop and communicate a clearer strategy that involves ramping up sanctions to stop Moscow’s shadow war in Europe. This approach might include increasing secondary sanctions against countries that import Russian goods, including oil and gas, as well as sanctioning additional entities and individuals involved in illegal Russian exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is an increase in NATO covert and overt actions. For example, Russia’s shadow fleet, which is illegally shipping oil and gas to overseas markets, is vulnerable to seizure. Russia also has oil and gas pipelines that are vulnerable to sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third is conducting targeted offensive cyber operations against important Russian military and commercial targets, including the networks of Russia’s energy sector that are vital to Russia’s economy. There was some reporting that U.S. Cyber Command briefly halted offensive cyber operations against Russia in an effort to draw President Putin into talks on Ukraine, though some Pentagon officials denied these reports. Offensive cyber operations against Russia remain an important stick that can be used if Russian sabotage and subversion continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, NATO countries should conduct a more aggressive offensive information campaign targeting the populations of Russia and its partners, such as Belarus, devised to counter state-run media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An offensive campaign should be designed to signal to Moscow that continued active measures in Europe will be costly. In short, a successful Western campaign needs to be coercive to change Moscow’s behavior, and the pain has to appear contingent on Russian behavior. But a strategy that does not include raising the costs on Moscow is likely to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of a draft peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan is a positive note during a tumultuous period for European security. This deal sets up the opportunity to bring an end to over four decades of conflict. However, tensions remain high and trust low. It is unclear whether the draft agreement sets up an enduring peace, or if remaining gaps will fracture this delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider implications of Armenian-Azerbaijani normalisation should not be underestimated. A successful peace deal would open up economic and diplomatic opportunities for the entire region, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors. The new “realist” reality emerging within the South Caucasus will necessitate external actors adapt their policy towards the region while Europe seems set to struggle to retain its remaining influence. Peace is not guaranteed and will require significant support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pathway-to-peace&quot;&gt;The Pathway to Peace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenian-Azerbaijani tensions stem from a long-standing territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but until recently has been under the control of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh. There has been an inter-ethnic rivalry over Karabakh for over a century, while suppressed during the Soviet period, it has intensified over the last few decades resulting a long-standing dispute with two major wars and frequent border skirmishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After four years of a shaky ceasefire following the Second Karabakh War, the draft agreement has been finalised, and both countries are preparing consultations on its signing. Negotiations have been fraught with problems with Russia and the West achieving little success in progressing the agenda. Instead, this draft agreement is notable, being achieved bilaterally, extraneous to third-party mediation, largely due to the dynamics of this dyadic relationship. Azerbaijan achieved a resounding victory in 2020, and its successful dissolution of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh in January 2024 solidified their dominant position at the negotiating table, allowing it to determine the agenda with Armenia taking the lion’s share of concessions. Azerbaijan has been vocal in wanting to limit Western involvement in the peace process and consequently Armenia has acquiesced to the removal of the EU monitoring mission from its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperative measures stipulated within the agreement include a joint request for the dissolution of the Minsk group and the withdrawal of each state’s international court case against the other. Hopefully, these unified measures are taken in good faith and can kickstart the trust-building process between these states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what appears to be a decision undertaken to expedite the peace process, several unresolved issues have been omitted. Firstly, neither side will seek to resettle refugees forced out of their lands due to any stage of the conflict. Both sides have had hundreds of thousands of displaced refugees throughout the conflict who will remain a significant political and societal pressure. Secondly, the Zangezur corridor, a proposed transport link between Azerbaijan and its exclave Nakhichevan through Armenia has been excluded from the draft. It is a primary source of contention for both sides that was removed from the peace agenda. However, it remains an issue that Baku will seek to address in the future. Leaving this friction unresolved risks the long-term success of this peace agreement, but Armenia may attempt to buy time through the normalisation process to find an acceptable solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there remains a significant roadblock to achieving peace. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan maintain that the other’s constitution contains territorial claims that infringe upon their own sovereignty. Azerbaijan has asserted that Armenia must alter its constitution before a peace deal can be signed. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has stated that Armenia requires a new constitution that represents “Real Armenia”, but the renouncement of a claim to Karabakh has received significant pushback from Armenian opposition. With upcoming elections expected in 2026, the population will be able to voice their support either way. However, it is hard to see how a different leader could shift Armenia’s negotiating position without instigating conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Armenia’s numerous concessions, this recent announcement has been denounced by Armenian opposition as a capitulation to Azerbaijan. This highlights an emerging split within Armenian society between those who desire peace at all costs, and those who believe this cost to be too great. Armenian Foreign minister Ararat Mirzoyan’s statement that a peace deal will help Armenia “emerge from a large and deep swamp” is indicative of the government’s perception of its position. However, conveying this message to its population will require delicacy to stem criticism, which has often been exploited by Russia’s propaganda machine, risking further destabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regional-impact&quot;&gt;Regional Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has historically considered the South Caucasus to be firmly within its sphere of influence, as such it has consistently sought to maintain its influence within the region. In a strategy very similar to its interference within Transnistria, Abkhazia and the Donbas (prior to 2022), the Kremlin has exploited regional tensions over Nagorno-Karabakh to insert itself as a security provider, increasing its leverage over Yerevan and Baku in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has struggled to retain its influence within the South Caucasus. The removal of Russian troops from Nagorno-Karabakh in April 2024 and from the Turkish-Armenian border in March 2025 have chipped away at its regional pre-eminence leaving it without a clear policy towards the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Russia is recalibrating its position within the South Caucasus, shifting from a security focus to a broader strategy utilising political, economic and primarily subversive levers while acknowledging the influx of other regional actors within this space. However, Armenia has made clear attempts to diminish Russian influence by freezing its participation within the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and intensifying national debate on aligning with the European Union. Russia has even less influence over Azerbaijan who maintains strong political and military links to Turkey. Following a peace treaty, Yerevan and Baku will be better positioned to enact further policy to limit Russian influence but will require support from other regional actors to facilitate this difficult transition away from Russian influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s relationship with its Northern neighbours fluctuates depending on the focus. Both Azerbaijan and Armenia have interests in improving relations with Iran, but each encounters significant roadblocks in achieving this aim. Iran has a sizable ethnic Azeri population within its North-Western region and both states have interests in facilitating the International North South Transport Corridor from Moscow to Mumbai, through their territory. However, Baku’s blossoming relationship with Israel is a point of serious contention between the two states. Armenia has benefitted from Iranian support of its territorial integrity but must be cautious in balancing its relations with Tehran and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral delimitation of the Armenian-Azerbaijani border is a positive step for Iran, that economically and politically benefits from its border with Armenia. Iran prioritises the de-westernisation of the South Caucasus. With the Zangezur corridor issue remaining unanswered, Iran’s proposed solution involving transit via its territory is a compromise that is mutually agreeable for now, but unlikely to prove to be a long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan would allow Baku to reapply focus upon other points of contention. The repression of ethnic Azeris within Iran may become an increasingly volatile issue. With no long-term connectivity solution that benefits Tehran, and a potential brewing ethnic conflict, Iran’s position within the South Caucasus has significantly weakened as it struggles to influence regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tandem with Turkish influence filling the vacuum left by a retreating Iran in the Middle East, a successful peace deal will provide Ankara the opportunity to weaken both Moscow and Tehran’s position within the South Caucasus. Turkey’s strategic partnership with Azerbaijan was instrumental in Baku’s rapid military development and eventual strong negotiating position. Its relationship with Armenia remains challenging, but according to Pashinyan, normalisation “will simply be a matter of time”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased stability within the region opens the door for the Middle Corridor initiative to flourish, limiting Russia’s role within Eurasian trade and providing Turkey with a stronger link to its Central Asian partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Turkey chooses to balance its relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan will be a strong determinant of a successful peace. Overall Turkey’s rising dominance in the region would be the most influential outcome of this peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-union&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Azerbaijan requesting the removal of the EU monitoring mission from the Armenian border, it’s likely that the EU will lose its last mediating tool within this peace process. This is not an unexpected shift; the EU’s mediation attempts between 2022 and 2023 failed to generate any significant momentum and was unable to prevent a cessation in hostilities during this period. Europe appeared to miss its opportunity to successfully insert itself within the mediation and as a result, has become a bystander to regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the stark shift in Transatlantic relations, instigated by the 2nd Trump administration, the EU has refocused upon its own security and with its attention drawn between the US, Russia, and China it will likely lead to a continued lack of focus upon peripheral regions such as the South Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a serious question over what the EU can do to regain influence within the region. Georgia’s pivot from the West is indicative of long-term problems with the EU’s waning attraction to its neighbours. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan are interested in pursuing multi vector foreign policy which other influencers have proven much better adapted to. Peace is beneficial for the EU, but without a renewed EU strategy towards the region, its influence will continue to diminish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement on terms of an Armenian-Azerbaijan peace deal is a significant development for the South Caucasus and the implications of greater stability within the region have wide reaching impact. However, if signed, the longevity of this agreement remains uncertain. Trust between signatories remains low and irredentism remains a significant risk. The South Caucasus’ location at the crossroads of Asia and Europe means that while the topic of connectivity remains unresolved, it is one that will dominate discussion over the next few years. Europe should not lose focus on this key region of its Eastern flank and should engage with this emerging opportunity rather than relying on outdated policy.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper examines the evolving landscape of bilateral cooperation in shaping India’s water future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safe water and sanitation are vital to human life. However, despite global efforts, as of 2022, 2.2 billion people still lack access to safely managed water services, and 3.5 billion are without safely managed sanitation services, resulting in conflicts and threatening global governance. The United Nations predicts that global water demand will increase by 20–30 percent by 2050. The annual economic value of water and freshwater systems is already estimated to be $58 trillion, or approximately 60 percent of global GDP, and is under threat from the freshwater ecosystem crisis. Climate change further exacerbates challenges for developing economies by causing floods, droughts, and extreme weather conditions, necessitating international and bilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India—an important strategic partner for the United States in terms of geopolitics, economic development, and international trade—long-term water security will be critical for national and human security, as well as economic development. However, water and sanitation fail to rank among the top bilateral priorities in the U.S.-India partnership, which should instead harness U.S. knowledge in areas of greatest impact for both countries while also capitalizing on the opportunities presented by India’s rapid expansion in the water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector. The sector should be prioritized given the vast potential to expand trade, private investments, and greater collaborations from U.S. service providers, such as business and technology groups and industry associations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. International Trade Administration (ITA), water and wastewater treatment is the largest environmental technology segment for U.S. exports to India, which has the fifth-largest water and wastewater market in the world, valued at $11 billion in 2024 and expected to grow to over $18 billion by 2026. This makes new technologies and innovation major areas of potential collaboration between the United States and India. In addition, India’s need for basic water and sanitation services will rise, especially in cities: In 2023, urban areas housed about 36 percent of India’s population, or 519 million people, a figure that is projected to increase to over 900 million by 2050, reflecting the largest urban growth globally. Despite public funds, India will require an additional $55 billion annually to meet urban demands, according to the World Bank. With only 2 percent of current global water investments currently coming from the private sector, there is ample opportunity for U.S. companies to leverage their financial capital and technical capacities to benefit India’s water and sanitation sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should prioritize water issues to demonstrate foreign policy leadership and promote market development for its firms. A strong U.S.-India partnership would not only improve India’s access to clean water but could also provide the United States a market for its technologies and technical expertise. Such opportunities would also expand trade between the two countries. The new U.S. administration should handle global water and sanitation challenges strategically since they are critical to national security, public health, and economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences of recent changes in foreign development assistance and announcements about closing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will become clearer in the coming months. However, U.S. government resources available for development aid are expected to be considerably reduced. Despite a significant shift in the foreign assistance landscape, U.S.-India WASH cooperation warrants attention given the bilateral benefits it can yield. If discontinued, some of these areas of past U.S. government engagement could be taken up by private philanthropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper analyzes the U.S.-India partnership on water and sanitation issues. It reviews the United States’ current Global Water Strategy (GWS), its water-related foreign assistance agenda, and India’s current water and sanitation objectives.1 It outlines a future pathway for bilateral engagement on water sustainability, considering India’s recent progress on UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 of clean water and sanitation for all. Drawing insights from desk research and expert conversations, this white paper aims to present an informed perspective and identify areas for strengthening U.S.-India collaboration. Such efforts could mobilize resources, technologies, innovation, capacity, and capital to help India achieve long-term water security and environmental sustainability—while providing the United States an important market for strategic alliances, new capital, and leveraging human capabilities. A focused framework spanning segments, partners, and programs is required to achieve water security for India and open market opportunities for the United States. The opportunity could yield real benefits for economic growth, job creation, manufacturing, and innovation, as well as expanded collaborations for both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-state-of-indias-water-security&quot;&gt;The State of India’s Water Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has 4 percent of the global water supply but 18 percent of the world’s population, making it extremely water stressed. The country’s expanding population, urbanization, and economic growth, as well as the exacerbating effects of climate change, make water security a primary issue for India, as indicated by the government’s increased spending across various national programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through India’s national schemes and missions, trillions of dollars’ worth of public funds have been allocated to develop water, sanitation, and urban development infrastructure. Over the past decade, India has progressed toward SDG 6 by increasing tap water connections and safe sanitation facilities. To achieve long-term goals, future challenges include maintaining said infrastructure, recovering operational costs, and preventing leakages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mandate for safe water and sanitation is shared across multiple ministries, departments, and organizations at the national and subnational levels, as outlined in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tkIlfo8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: India’s Key Government Organizations for Water and Sanitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;progress-over-the-past-decade&quot;&gt;Progress over the Past Decade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 years, India has exhibited strong leadership in the water and sanitation sector, with national programs prioritizing this agenda. These programs funded infrastructure development through a “mission mode,” resulting in objective-oriented programs that aim to provide safe water and sanitation to every home. Table 2 summarizes the various national programs, their priorities, and funding allocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NIeUmtN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Key Schemes on Water and Sanitation in India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, programs such as the National Urban Livelihood Mission and Smart Cities Mission aim to address job creation and upskilling in the WASH sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;results-achieved&quot;&gt;Results Achieved&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s most remarkable achievement has been the reduction of open defecation, with the national sanitation mission providing safe toilets to over 450 million people. Sustained toilet usage is crucial for attaining SDG 6, as are measures to ensure water is safely transported, treated, and reused—which both creates a circular economy and improves water security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)–Rural has facilitated the construction of over 117 million toilets. SBM–Urban has constructed 6.3 million individual toilets—as well as nearly 700,000 community and public toilets—and implemented scientific solid waste management practices across India. SBM 2.0 aims to make all cities garbage free, water secure, and capable of safely managing gray and black water. Studies indicate that SBM has considerably reduced infant and under-five mortality rates in India, saving 60,000–70,000 lives per year. Meanwhile, the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) has provided 122 million tap water connections since 2019, more than quadrupling the share of rural households with tap water (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q0RM7wi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indias-water-and-wastewater-treatment-market-and-challenges&quot;&gt;India’s Water and Wastewater Treatment: Market and Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the ITA, water and wastewater treatment is the largest environmental technology segment for U.S. exports to India. India has the fifth-largest water and wastewater market in the world, valued at $11 billion in 2024 and expected to reach $18 billion by 2026. This presents excellent opportunities for U.S. companies and innovators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New technology has been identified as a major area of collaboration between the United States and India, as underscored by the ITA and USAID in USAID’s India High-Priority Country Plan, part of the Biden administration’s Global Water Strategy. However—in addition to the Trump administration’s cessation of funding for USAID—several challenges for U.S. exporters persist, including high tariffs, intellectual property issues, an unpredictable regulatory and policy landscape, and market price sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-development-finance-institutions&quot;&gt;The Role of Development Finance Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development finance institutions such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and UN programs and specialized agencies—as well as several national development finance institutions—have played key roles in supporting India’s water and sanitation needs through technical assistance and project funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2025, the World Bank has mobilized $2.9 billion across 24 WASH projects in India, focusing on river basin management, sustainable water delivery, and climate resilience. For example, one of its largest projects was a $300 million plan in 2023 to upgrade Tamil Nadu’s water delivery systems, ensuring the quality and efficiency of water supply and sewerage services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Asian Development Bank supports and finances improvements to WASH infrastructure and services, facilitates upstream policy dialogue, and strengthens institutions and regulations. The Asian Development Bank’s Water Organizations Partnerships for Resilience program, for example, pairs local water management utility companies to help transfer knowledge, skills, and processes. In one such partnership, Singapore’s Public Utilities Board collaborated with the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board on energy efficient desalination plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the UN Development Program (UNDP) have also supported programs on water and sanitation in India. UNICEF has been an active development partner for the federal government of India, providing direct support for the Jal Jeevan Mission, and has implemented community-based solutions with the help of rural governance bodies. The UNDP focuses on water access, security, and quality; its projects empower rural residents and enable local water governance through community-based water conservation practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French Development Agency has also been collaborating with Indian state and municipal governments since 2012 to create sustainable and accessible water systems. The French Development Agency’s engagements with the municipal governments of Jodhpur and Puducherry highlight its commitment to regional engagement and sustainable solutions, for example through energy efficiency measures, leakage reduction, and tariffs rationalization to encourage more prudent water usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the German Agency for International Cooperation has facilitated projects focused on water security, river basin rejuvenation, and fecal sludge management in cooperation with two national ministries in four Indian states. Similarly, Germany’s KfW Development Bank has mobilized large-scale funding for numerous projects covering rainwater management, desalination, and sewerage infrastructure. In 2022, KfW contributed over $500 million to facilitate climate-resilient infrastructure and improve municipal water services in Tamil Nadu through the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-of-us-foreign-assistance-in-the-water-sanitation-and-hygiene-sectors&quot;&gt;Evolution of U.S. Foreign Assistance in the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Sectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 was among the first U.S. laws to make safe water and sanitation a goal of foreign assistance, emphasizing innovative international mechanisms based on best practices from other development sectors and calling for increased U.S. development assistance. The act amended the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize aid for water and sanitation programs in developing countries, recognizing that global cooperation on river basins, aquifers, and other watersheds is essential for U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2013, key developments included the creation of a joint framework between USAID and the U.S. Department of State for foreign assistance in the water sector, the appointment of the first Global Water Coordinator by the USAID administrator, and the announcement of USAID’s first five-year Water and Development Strategy, which aimed to improve health outcomes through sustainable WASH services development and enhance food security through better agricultural water management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act of 2014, built on the 2005 act, prioritized water and sanitation as critical for human life. It underscored U.S. leadership in ensuring sustained access to clean water and sanitation for vulnerable communities, making the secretary of state (or an appointed designee) the new special advisor for water resources. The act expanded USAID’s program to high-priority countries (as defined by share of a country’s population with limited access to clean drinking water or sanitation sources, the number of children under five years of age who died from diarrheal disease, and the government’s capacity and commitment to work with the United States to improve WASH services). It also highlighted the necessity for a government-wide global water strategy (GWS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the GWS, first issued in 2017, U.S. assistance for a water-secure world was guided by four interconnected objectives: increasing access to safe WASH services, sound management and protection of freshwater resources, cooperation on shared waters, and strengthening governance and financial systems. Over 17 U.S. government agencies and departments helped execute this strategy, coordinated by the Interagency Water Working Group and implemented by U.S. diplomatic missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the U.S. government outlined the vision of a water secure world in the White House Action Plan on Global Water Security, recognizing global water access as an essential element of U.S. national security. The action plan introduced an innovative, whole-of-government approach that would be implemented through the GWS to address direct and indirect consequences of water insecurity. However, through a presidential executive order in January 2025, the development assistance agency, USAID, and programs have been paused, and the future of development aid is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-2022-global-water-strategy&quot;&gt;The 2022 Global Water Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 version of the GWS aimed to implement a five-year strategic action plan. The U.S. government proposed to work through four interconnected and mutually reinforcing strategic objectives: strengthening WASH institutions, increasing access, improving water resource management, and reducing water-related conflict (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/60XCB2y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Strategic Objectives of the 2022 Global Water Strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20250108120939/https://www.globalwaters.org/sites/default/files/us_global_water_strategy_2022.pdf&quot;&gt;Global Waters, United States Global Water Strategy 2022-2027 (Washington, DC: USAID and U.S. Department of State, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government contributed by deploying tools and resources such as foreign assistance, diplomatic engagement, technical assistance, and investments. The strategy was operationalized through U.S. missions in partner countries and the Interagency Water Working Group, which collaborated monthly with the participating departments. The 2022 GWS continued the multidepartment approach of the 2017 version, bringing in—among other agencies and organizations—USAID, the Department of State, the ITA, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. In particular, the Millennium Challenge Corporation has invested over $2.2 billion globally in clean water, sanitation, and natural resource projects since its formation in 2004. It selects eligible countries based on available funds, needs, and the country’s commitment to democracy and economic freedom. However, it presently does not have any direct investments in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and independent groups—including the American Water Works Association, Water Environment Federation, and American Society of Plumbing Engineers—have actively advanced capacity building and knowledge exchanges in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-governments-india-focused-interventions&quot;&gt;The U.S. Government’s India-Focused Interventions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 1990s, the U.S. government supported the Financial Institution Reform and Expansion–Debt and Infrastructure Project (FIRE-D) in India, working with the country’s central, state, and city governments to develop sustainable urban environmental services and ensure accessibility among underserved communities. The program included technical support at the national level and in 15 Indian states for municipal reforms, system strengthening, and expansion of WASH services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, the United States provided project-based assistance on water and sanitation services, financing, climate resilience, and menstrual hygiene. During fiscal year (FY) 2017, the U.S. government identified 13 high-priority countries—including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Indonesia—based on the level of need, commitment to working with the United States, and opportunities to leverage U.S. private sector and donor partners. While India was not initially listed, Washington did align its strategy with its India missions and executed programs in India through USAID. As of 2018, India has been included as a high-priority country according to these criteria. Until USAID operations were suspended on January 20, 2025, the agency focused on expanding safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, improving water resource management, and making service delivery and water resources more resilient to climate stressors through programs such as Support for Water and Sanitation in India, Skill Development in Fecal Sludge and Septage Management, and the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Finance 2 (WASH-FIN 2) project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, Washington and Delhi signed a statement of intent to establish the Gandhi-King Development Foundation, first proposed under the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 2020. The foundation is expected to focus on India’s priorities to address pollution, tackle climate change, and sustain WASH services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key U.S. government agencies engaging in WASH-related activities in India include the Department of State, DFC, and ITA (see Table 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m5fsC7K.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Key Stakeholders Engaged in Executing the GWSs in India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other departments and agencies have also played a role in supporting the WASH sector in India. In 2019, the U.S. Geological Survey signed a scientific and technical cooperation memorandum of understanding (MoU) with India’s MoJS and DoWR, RD &amp;amp; GR to share water resource expertise. However, follow-up actions and activities under the MoU have been delayed. Similarly, since June 2024 the National Science Foundation has supported research on the interaction between climate change, food security, water security, and health in India. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has engaged with cities in India to issue municipal bonds for urban projects, many of which focus on water supply and sewer infrastructure. In 2017, Pune became the first city to utilize these municipal bonds, ultimately raising 2 billion rupees ($23 million) for water supply projects with the help of technical know-how from the Department of the Treasury, which has planned to expand its cooperation to six more cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indias-cooperation-with-non-us-partners&quot;&gt;India’s Cooperation with Non-U.S. Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has collaborated with several countries and international actors to advance the water and sanitation sector, resulting in the formation of strategic action plans on water, access to development financing, and participation in joint forums with country leaders and ministries. Initiatives include information sharing and capacity building programs, as well as private sector investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-european-union&quot;&gt;The European Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The India-EU Water Partnership (IEWP) was created in 2016 to enhance cooperation on mutual water interests following the first Indo-European Water Forum in 2015. It aims to strengthen technological and scientific capacities in India and foster business opportunities for EU companies. While phases I and II of the IEWP engaged in river basin management and the reuse of treated wastewater, phase III focuses on public-private partnerships in pursuit of priorities outlined in India’s Vision 2030 and the European Union’s Global Gateway strategy. The IEWP has hosted six Indo-European Water Forums as of 2024, enabling projects and technical assistance in sustainable river basin management and rejuvenation, groundwater use, wastewater reuse, capacity building, and research and technology innovations. As part of phase III, the partners have committed a combined $38.5 million across seven projects to be implemented in coming years. The IEWP has been among the most extensive and comprehensive of India’s partnerships, enabling strategic planning with the MoJS and sponsoring numerous water-related bilateral relationships, including with the Netherlands and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-netherlands&quot;&gt;The Netherlands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India and the Netherlands have collaborated on water management for over a decade. In 2013, the two countries established a joint working group on mutual water-related concerns and enabling public-private partnerships, which was extended in 2017 for five years. The relationship strengthened in 2021 with the launch of the Strategic Partnership on Water, a collaboration between the Netherlands’ Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and the MoJS. Both countries combined policy expertise and resources, enhancing cooperation between government agencies, universities, knowledge institutes, and the private sector. A key example is the tripartite public-private partnership between Stahl (a Dutch chemicals group), Solidaridad (a Netherlands-based global NGO), and the Uttar Pradesh government to introduce novel and environmentally conscious techniques to the state’s prominent tanning industry. The project focused on capacity building for processes that reduced effluent discharge into the Ganges and increased operational efficiency—further raising competitiveness and accelerating adoption of these practices. The partnership has also facilitated investment projects and technical assistance in six Indian states and four municipal corporations for river basin management, water body pollution, flood management, and urban water access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India and Japan have forged a strong partnership in water, wastewater, and sanitation through several MoUs between the MoJS and Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. The 2019 MoU focused on flood and stormwater management, leveraging Japan’s advanced technologies to conduct joint feasibility studies and pilot projects in flood-prone regions of India. The 2021 MoU emphasized sustainable irrigation and water resource management, promoting integrated water practices. Finally, the 2022 MoU focused on decentralized wastewater systems, introducing Japan’s Johkasou technology into rural and semi-rural areas. JICA has also supported key initiatives such as the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Project, which improved or expanded 400,000 household connections, covering 60 percent of all household connections in the city. The agency has also mobilized over $3 billion in development financing toward the water and sanitation sector in India. Through these initiatives, JICA has improved water access for 30 million people in India and sanitation for 15 million, all while greatly strengthening the institutional management of water in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India and Israel have a longstanding partnership in water management. Key agreements include a 2012 joint declaration on water technology collaboration and a 2016 MoU to establish the Joint Working Group on Water, which oversees infrastructure projects, pilot studies, and commercial demonstration centers. Israel continues to collaborate with the MoJS, state governments, and municipal authorities, including those of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana, on water and sanitation issues, focusing on development aid, technical assistance, and public-private partnerships. At least 12 projects have been signed between Israeli corporations and Indian state and municipal governments and Indian corporations, many valued over $50 million, including the Tahal group project in Karnataka and the joint venture between Israel’s Watergreen and India’s SMV Jaipura Group. In addition, India and Israel are collaborating to establish two centers of water technology in Madras and Roorkee. While India and Israel lack a formal strategic framework for cooperation, they have most notably engaged the private sector to mobilize millions of dollars through multiple public-private ventures across India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;denmark&quot;&gt;Denmark&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, India and Denmark created the Green Strategic Partnership, under which the Danish Environmental Protection Agency has partnered with the MoJS, with support from Arhaus University and the Danish water utility company VandCenter Syd. The partnership centers on water resource and drinking water management, leveraging Denmark’s expertise in capacity building and fostering research and private sector collaboration. Danish experts and water utility corporations have engaged with Indian states through webinars, field work, and site visits. One notable example is the establishment of the Smart Laboratory on Clean Rivers—a collaboration with the MoJS, Indian Institute of Technology–Banaras Hindu University, and the government of Denmark—to foster “excellence in small river rejuvenation and management.” A second phase of the Green Strategic Partnership is expected to run from 2025 to 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: Select Bilateral Engagements at the National and Ministerial Level&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partnerships in the WASH sector offer several lessons for expanding the U.S.-India relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment with national priorities:&lt;/strong&gt; Building a strategic framework requires aligning new initiatives with India’s existing missions and goals, ensuring coherence and complementarity. For instance, the IEWP engages directly with the MoJS, ensuring a more sustainable framework for tackling India’s water challenges. This includes multistate engagement for integrated river management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement at the state and local levels:&lt;/strong&gt; India’s decentralized governance allows for targeted partnerships and projects. Compared to short-term, project-focused engagements, long-term strategic partnerships with state governments can address broader challenges. The Indo-Dutch collaboration on water resource and river management was deepened through tailored state-level collaborations such as detailed strategies for flood risk management in Kerala and a comprehensive strategy for river basin resource management in West Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public-private partnerships (PPPs):&lt;/strong&gt; Successful water and sanitation projects in India often involve collaboration with private institutions from partner nations. For instance, Israel has facilitated numerous business engagements in India, such as at the Nemmeli desalination plant, which introduced new technologies enabled by private sector expertise. The United States is home to leading companies and innovators in water utilities, water technologies, and wastewater management and can further promote partnership opportunities in India through government-led delegations, trade missions, and development finance support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A focus on innovation and technology exchange:&lt;/strong&gt; India’s partnerships with other nations have thrived on integrating cutting-edge technologies. For example, the local treatment of urban sewage streams for healthy reuse (LOTUS-HR) program devised by the Indian and Dutch governments focuses on tailoring wastewater treatment strategies for urban areas. As part of this program, pilot facilities for testing novel treatment technologies were built in New Delhi in 2017. The United States could further enhance cooperation by integrating advanced technologies through joint research and development initiatives, innovation hubs, and knowledge transfer programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-opportunities&quot;&gt;New Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should deepen its strategic ties with India by aligning its capabilities, resources, and access to support water security and safe sanitation objectives. India is more than just a country partner for demand-driven technical assistance; it can also help expand strategic alliances and partnerships, drive innovation, deploy fresh capital, and foster knowledge exchanges. India’s future water and sanitation needs provide a substantial economic opportunity for the U.S. private sector and investors, making this a key topic for future bilateral dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic priority for water, wastewater, and sanitation should be established through a focused, long-term framework that addresses national goals, emphasizes scalable subnational projects, and capitalizes on India’s sectoral strengths. A program-focused strategy will not be sufficient to help India accomplish its WASH goals and regional security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should focus on several high-impact areas of cooperation that align with India’s requirements and are based on distinct propositions and capabilities, including through the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement a track 1 WASH strategic partnership:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing a strategic partnership centered on WASH will enable the United States to take a whole-of-government approach and consolidate its actions in India. This would improve resource planning, encourage the exchange of innovative solutions, and mobilize more private sector–led models and capital. It would also support better management of long-term partnership goals between the United States and India, for example to revive the 2019 MoU covering scientific and technical cooperation on water efficiency and management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up a center of excellence on water in India:&lt;/strong&gt; Such a center would facilitate the strategic partnership at the subnational level, emphasizing sustainable regional plans as opposed to project-based engagements and enhancing an integrated approach to water resource management. This platform could foster collaboration on areas such as governance, technology, and capacity building, ensuring actors work closely with state-level authorities, the private sector, associations, experts, researchers, and academia to enhance regional cooperation as they pursue India’s national priorities. This platform would also deepen engagements with think tanks, NGOs, and civil society organizations to inform policy action and industry engagements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a collaborative development fund for WASH in India:&lt;/strong&gt; This bilaterally financed fund—with the help of additional private sector capital—should promote the development of innovative technology pilots. Such pilots would increase suitable local technology demonstrations, help analysts explore the financial viability of their models, and incorporate lessons learned in the United States and other global markets. The collaborative fund would provide India-specific approaches to unlocking private sector investment and developing market-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore water-energy interdependencies:&lt;/strong&gt; The water-energy nexus will be crucial in the future, particularly with growing demand from data centers, artificial intelligence (AI), solar farms, green hydrogen, and critical minerals. The U.S.-India partnership should invest in this emerging field since it could change water consumption patterns in the future and pose a major threat to water security. The respective governments could mitigate these risks by facilitating policy dialogues, fostering private sector innovation, and conducting technology and knowledge exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 5: Focus Areas and Actionable Strategies for U.S.-India Cooperation on WASH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive and concentrated cooperation between the United States and India has the potential to lead to long-term water security, which is critical for India and the region—especially since it will experience extreme water stress due to climate change and rising demand. As India is a rapidly expanding market for new technologies, capacities, and financing, coordinated action in the WASH sector can mutually benefit both countries. The partnership could establish a forum for sharing resources, facilitating private sector participation, and developing innovation and knowledge platforms. To support India’s water security, the United States should identify a strategic approach that leverages its technological advancements and solutions in a way that not only ensures water security in India but also enhances bilateral trade and market opportunities for U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air in Helsinki is heavy with irony. Finnish attitudes towards NATO changed abruptly following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Just two months after the start of the invasion, almost 80% of the public had come around to support NATO membership. When Finland entered the Alliance on 4th April 2023, parts of the political establishment hailed this as the end point of the country’s long trek to join the West, finally making Finland a full member of a security community of like-minded liberal democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the re-election of Donald Trump. President Trump’s harsh treatment of Ukraine as well as a conditional commitment to NATO’s collective defence evaporated any lingering sense of complacency in Helsinki. Just 50% of the public now say they trust the United States. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told citizens that whilst he retained confidence in Finland’s most important ally, he also acknowledged that the United States had changed. Just two years ago, Finland’s NATO accession had seemingly cracked its century-old dilemma of surviving next door to its former overlord and great power neighbour, Russia. Now, according to an unconfirmed newspaper report, Finland has begun exploring a Plan B in case NATO’s Article 5 fails to function as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comment evaluates Helsinki’s options regarding its national security. We argue that a viable Plan B exists – the “Nordic Plus” – but, like all European defence initiatives, it comes with uncertainties and cannot compensate for potential US disengagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plan-a-american-led-alliance&quot;&gt;Plan A: American-Led Alliance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s Plan A builds heavily on its alliance relationship with the United States, which played a central role in supporting Finland’s path to NATO. President Biden affirmed America’s “ironclad commitment” to Article 5, directed his military to conduct nearly constant training missions in Finland, and visited Helsinki to mark the country’s “NATOzation”. Furthermore, in December 2023, Finland signed a Defence Cooperation agreement with the United States, anticipating American investments in Finnish military infrastructure as well as a regular presence of US troops and personnel in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, two months into his second term, President Trump has already made clear his interest-based and transactional approach to foreign affairs, as well as his tendency to shift his perception of US interests from one day to the next. For the next four years, the implementation of Article 5 relies on a somewhat whimsical American president who has on multiple public occasions expressed confidence in Russian president Vladimir Putin over America’s longstanding European allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, President Trump has noted that there is an ocean between America and Europe. Consequently, Russia’s territorial ambitions in Eastern Europe do not appear to pose a threat to the United States. To paraphrase Lord Ismay, NATO was established to keep America in, Germany down, and Russia out – a goal that previous US administrations largely upheld. By contrast, influential figures within the Trump administration have expressed indifference towards Europe’s security, support for Alternative für Deutschland, and sympathy for certain aspects of Russia’s foreign policy. As a result, at the time of writing, the credibility of Finland’s Plan A is undeniably eroding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nordic-plus-as-a-plan-b&quot;&gt;Nordic Plus as a Plan B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would a possible Plan B look like? It can be summed up as “Nordic Plus”. NATO membership has unlocked significant new potential for military cooperation between Finland and its allies. In this context, Finnish leaders will likely turn to Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, and, potentially, France. Logistically, the Scandinavian countries play a crucial role in supplying Finland in the event of war, and Finland has been advocating for major improvements in Nordic connectivity and infrastructure. Moreover, these countries can potentially provide considerable military capabilities. For instance, together the countries have an air force of 200 modern fighter jets. However, as affluent nations, Norway and Sweden could still allocate significant additional societal resources to collective defence, such as considerably expanding the conscription system for force generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to larger European powers, the United Kingdom, seen as a serious security provider with a genuine interest in Northern European security, could potentially offer a wide spectrum of military support on land, at sea and in the air, also providing special capabilities such as intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance. Moreover, France – an additional European heavyweight – could also contribute to Finland’s deterrence, particularly through its nuclear weapons. It is not inconceivable that Finnish skies could soon host training missions by nuclear-capable French fighter jets if Paris is truly prepared to introduce a European dimension to its nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Finland’s traditional support of the EU’s defence efforts will remain significant. Finland has given its full support to the European Commission’s recent efforts to foster European rearmament and strongly urged EU leaders to convene a defence-focused summit, which eventually took place on 6 March. Fiscally conservative Helsinki is also warming up to the idea of raising common debt to bankroll the building of an autonomous European military-industrial complex. It is also prepared to make the defence-related articles of the Lisbon Treaty more credible and concrete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lingering mistrust towards the United States, Finnish decision makers will strive to keep the transatlantic flame alive. Finland will do everything it can to present itself as a helpful partner to President Trump and thus avoid direct rupture in the transatlantic linkage. There is also the hope that America may recommit to playing the role of a backstop in NATO under a future administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-europe-able-to-muster-military-force&quot;&gt;Is Europe Able to Muster Military Force?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the key question for Finnish foreign policy today is whether Plan B will work if it needs to be duly activated. The key challenge for Finnish foreign policy is ensuring Western European commitment to the defence of NATO’s frontline states. However, Western European countries that are not directly threatened by Russia will be tempted to free ride by outsourcing defence costs to their Eastern European neighbours. Perceptions of the threat are inversely affected by a country’s distance from Russia. Even Finland’s closest neighbours, Sweden and Norway, enjoy the benefit of having a Finnish buffer between them and Russia, although they also have a considerable interest in Finland’s territorial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ongoing momentum for Europe to step up, the continent, lacking corporate agency in defence matters, will face significant challenges in coordinating its security in the absence of American leadership, if history is any guide. In the 1920s, America decided to disengage from Europe’s problems. Britain and France stepped into the breach and sought to ensure European security. Unfortunately, Britain and France were economically and militarily too weak to effectively deter the ambitions of revisionist states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These material limitations were amplified by arguments that questioned the relevance of Eastern European conflicts for Western European security. For instance, Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain wrote in 1925 that no British government would risk the bones of a British soldier over an Eastern European border dispute. Similar voices in the 2020s will undoubtedly be amplified by Russia. Russia will continue to assert that it has no territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine and seeks mutually beneficial relations with Western European countries, including Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-plan-b-fails&quot;&gt;If Plan B Fails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the follow up question of what Finland might do if Europe’s efforts to mobilise collective deterrence against Russia are unsuccessful. Currently, there is very little public discussion of a Plan C. Finnish decision makers are focused on reassuring a jittery public by underlining Finland’s efforts to foster European security coordination, day-to-day cooperation with the United States, and independent defence capability. These efforts undoubtedly ensure sufficient deterrence whilst Russia’s offensive capability remains engaged in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a scenario in which Europe’s efforts to mobilise collective deterrence against Russia fail is not inconceivable. This would significantly weaken Finland’s deterrence, as Ukraine’s experience demonstrates that Finland can only successfully deter Russia with external support. If maintaining allied support for Finnish security becomes increasingly difficult, it is possible that Finland will explore the possibility of a Plan C based on rapprochement with Russia. That said, Helsinki will take this road with considerable reluctance and only if forced by external circumstances and would still retain significant national defence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s two-year rollercoaster ride in NATO underlines the futility of predicting the future in international relations. The next two years in Finnish foreign policy will undoubtedly contain new surprises. Even so, it is likely that Helsinki will aim to keep its options open and has possibly already begun laying conditions for all eventualities. Though Finland is likely increasingly focused on a Plan B of fostering collective European deterrence, it will continue to extend its hand to America and, if other attempts fail, prepare ground for a possible exploration of détente with Russia. This balancing act will require a permanently heightened level of defence spending, considerable diplomatic dexterity, and a willingness to question received wisdom. After a short interlude, history has returned to Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;

This report explores the legal tools and policy frameworks shaping allied export controls and the challenges of alignment with U.S. national security requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it released two rules that added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued the AI Diffusion Framework and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, which directed an effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology . . . to strategic rivals and their proxies” on its first day in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, countries like the Netherlands, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan continue to control key chokepoints in the AI and semiconductor value chain, making unilateral action only so effective. Furthermore, the existing multilateral export control architecture is neither sufficiently flexible nor fast to allow for the kind of sophisticated, targeted controls that the United States has levied on China. The success or failure of the U.S. export control strategy is thus dependent on its allies’ ability to implement controls outside of this traditional architecture or U.S. extraterritorial regulations covering allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides an in-depth analysis of U.S. allies’ export control authorities related to AI and semiconductor technologies and does the same analysis for China. It demonstrates that U.S. allies often do not have equivalents to U.S. export control authorities and tools like the FDPR and Entity List, but that they generally do have the capability to introduce some controls on advanced semiconductor chips and related equipment not covered by multilateral export control regimes. As a result, lack of alignment with the U.S. export control regime cannot necessarily be attributed to a lack of authorities alone. Allies’ enforcement capacity and willingness to act are also key ingredients in the implementation of effective export controls and are crucial to the success of U.S. and allied technology competition with China. Accordingly, the recommendations section of this paper addresses each of these three elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper proceeds as follows. First, it identifies key export control authorities used by the United States to slow the progress of China’s AI and semiconductor industries and analyzes which other countries possess these authorities and are thus capable of implementing similar controls. It then surveys the export control policies of key actors, including the European Union, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China. It concludes by offering recommendations to U.S. and allied policymakers to make AI and semiconductor export controls more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, then–Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo clearly outlined the U.S. strategy for China and its AI ecosystem when she said, “America leads the world in artificial intelligence. America leads the world in advanced semiconductor design, period. . . . We’re a couple years ahead of China. No way are we going to let them catch up.” To achieve this goal, the U.S. national security enterprise has undertaken a massive, multifaceted effort to choke off China’s access to cutting-edge AI and related technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls on the high-performance semiconductors used to train and inference state-of-the-art AI models have been at the forefront of this effort so far. On October 7, 2022, the United States enacted a comprehensive set of export controls on advanced semiconductor technologies. Although these controls marked the reversal of nearly 30 years of trade policy, they did not achieve all of their intended goals. U.S. chip designers like Nvidia continued to provide Chinese customers with slightly lower-performance chips, which according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), provided “nearly comparable AI model training capability.” In October 2023, the United States updated these controls to cover a much larger set of chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). As noted in a previous CSIS report, “The United States is firmly focused on retaining control over so-called ‘chokepoint’ . . . technologies in the global semiconductor technology supply chain.” The United States issued major export control updates in December 2024 and January 2025 that continued in this vein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the significant resources successive administrations have devoted to restricting China’s access to AI and semiconductor technologies, China’s AI ecosystem remains competitive with the United States’. In May 2024, Chinese AI company DeepSeek released a best-in-class open-weight model reportedly trained on Nvidia A100 chips stockpiled before the October 2022 controls went into effect. The even more impressive Deepseek-R1 reasoning model was trained on Nvidia H800 chips, which were not restricted before October 2023. The performance of DeepSeek-R1 was so far beyond what the financial analyst community had expected a Chinese firm to be capable of that the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.1 percent in one day as a result of its release. This previous CSIS paper provides an in-depth analysis of DeepSeek and its implications for U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-us-ai-and-semiconductor-export-control-authorities-and-related-tools&quot;&gt;Key U.S. AI and Semiconductor Export Control Authorities and Related Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of the U.S. chip war strategy is a group of iteratively developed and highly sophisticated export control tools. Authorities granted in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA), Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and executive orders offer the U.S national security community a range of options to control the export, reexport, transit, or transfer of select military, dual-use, and purely commercial items and technologies. In the House Committee on Foreign Affairs markup of ECRA, then–committee chairman Congressman Edward Royce stated that ECRA “closes gaps in our export controls that could permit transfers of cutting-edge technology like artificial intelligence and advanced semiconductors to potential adversaries such as Beijing.” More accurately, ECRA represented the codification of U.S. export control powers that had previously relied on authorities in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and had a novel focus on emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. export control regime divides the responsibilities for administering and enforcing export controls on dual-use and military goods and technologies. The Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the flow of dual-use technologies and less sensitive military items, which covers advanced semiconductors and related technologies, through the BIS. Meanwhile, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) within the U.S. Department of State oversees and licenses weapons and munitions that are covered by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) at the Treasury Department oversees restrictions on exports based on financial sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four kinds of U.S. export controls most relevant to the Trump and Biden administrations’ efforts to choke off China’s access to AI are described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; List-based controls impose restrictions on specific commodities, software, and technologies. The United States primarily implements this kind of control through the Commerce Control List (CCL). The CCL includes dual-use items described by Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs), which may require licenses to export. Maintained by BIS, the CCL has played a crucial role in both the Trump and Biden administration’s controls. For example, in October 2022 BIS created four new unilateral ECCNs related to high-performance chips and related SME and software. Meanwhile, the January 2025 AI Diffusion Framework created ECCN 4E091 to control AI model weights, which had not previously been controlled. To determine whether a license is granted for an item on the CCL, BIS also takes into consideration its intended end-user, the destination of the export, and its end-use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; End-user controls impose restrictions on the export, reexport, and transfer of items destined for specific actors. BIS primarily implements this kind of control via the Entity List. The Entity List refers to people, companies, facilities, and government institutions that participate in “activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States” and are subject to a license requirement. With each export control update, the United States has added Chinese firms to the Entity List including major AI and semiconductor companies like Huawei, YMTC, and Naura Technology Group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; End-use controls impose restrictions on otherwise uncontrolled items for certain end-uses. For example, EAR sections 744.2, 744.3, and 744.4 impose license requirements on almost any item that might be used in the creation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). In the context of AI chips and related technologies, BIS created a new license restriction based on whether items would be used in the production of advanced node semiconductors—defined as logic chips at or below 16 nanometers (nm), DRAM memory chips at or below 18 nm, and NAND storage at or above 128 layers—as part of the October 2022 controls. This definition was changed as part of the December 2024 export control update and then again in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Services controls impose restrictions on the activities of companies or individuals when the underlying commodities, software, and technologies involved in the service are not otherwise controlled. BIS implements this type of control under the U.S. Persons Rule. This authority controls the activities of U.S. companies or citizens when they are in support of certain end-uses found in EAR section 744.6. Traditionally, the U.S. Persons Rule applied license requirements to “U.S. persons,” defined as both people and firms, if they were engaging in activities supporting the development, production, or use of WMDs, even in situations not involving items subject to the EAR (i.e., wholly foreign-origin technology). However, as part of the October 2022 controls, BIS informed all “U.S. persons” that any activities in support of advanced node semiconductor production in China required a license. In doing so, BIS made the novel judgment that the act of supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors and related equipment “could involve ‘support’ for . . . weapons of mass destruction-related end-uses.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these four export control types, there are three further export control features that require explanation to understand U.S. AI and semiconductor export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilateral regime-based versus unilateral or plurilateral:&lt;/strong&gt; Most allied countries’ export control systems are grounded in multilateral agreements primarily focused on WMD nonproliferation like the Wassenaar Arrangement, which is the successor to the Cold War–era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM); the Nuclear Suppliers Group; the Australia Group; and the Missile Technology Control Regime. These regimes provide lists of commodities, software, and technology unanimously agreed on by members that should be subject to license requirements, in addition to end-use and services controls related to WMDs. However, the Trump and Biden administrations’ AI and semiconductor export controls have focused on items not included in multilateral agreements and were initially implemented unilaterally, and then as a part of a plurilateral agreement (as in the case of the reported deal between the United States, Netherlands, and Japan).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country-specific application:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. list-based, end-use, and services controls also can apply on a country-specific basis. For example, the October 2022 controls introduced measures banning the sale of high-end AI chips to any entity operating in China. Similarly, the October 2022 controls introduced a U.S. Persons Rule that applied on a China-specific basis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraterritoriality:&lt;/strong&gt; In some cases, U.S. controls apply to foreign-produced items located outside the United States if they are a direct product of U.S. technology or software, or if they were produced by equipment that was the direct product of such technology or software. BIS implements this type of control through the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR). This authority allowed the United States to address a loophole in the pre-October 2022 controls. Namely, Chinese firms were accessing controlled SME, components, and spare parts from U.S. companies without a license via foreign headquartered and domiciled partners. By applying the FDPR more broadly with each export control update, BIS, at least in theory, addressed this challenge. In the December 2024 controls, BIS dramatically expanded the FDPR yet again, meaning that foreign-produced SME “that contain any amount of U.S.-origin integrated circuits” are subject to U.S. controls. Per this version of the rule, U.S.-origin integrated circuits includes any such chips manufactured with U.S. machines, meaning that effectively all chips on earth are considered U.S. origin. This authority was also central to the export control updates issued in January 2025. For example, the AI Diffusion Framework rule expanded the FDPR to AI model weights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has also employed a range of other economic security tools to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductor technologies. For example, in August 2023 the Biden administration used IEEPA to issue an executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department to establish a program to review outbound investments in national critical sectors such as AI and semiconductors. This measure followed reporting that U.S. firms were investing in Chinese AI companies that were on the Entity List. On October 28, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department issued its final rule on the implementation of the executive order, which went into effect on January 2, 2025, but is now subject to review as a result of the Trump administration’s America First Trade Policy memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-allies&quot;&gt;The Need for Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However vigorously the United States pursues its own export control strategy, it will be unable to achieve success without changing the behavior of other countries. While the United States holds a strong position in certain parts of the semiconductor value chain like chip design, other countries such as the Netherlands and Japan also play crucial roles in areas like SME. For example, Dutch company ASML is the sole provider of the latest generation of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines needed to make cutting-edge AI chips. The consulting firm Accenture estimated that the inputs to a typical semiconductor chip “could cross international borders approximately 70 or more times before finally making it to the end customer.” In other words, the United States does not control all the relevant chokepoints required to execute its export control strategy. In comments after the October 2022 controls went into effect, one U.S. official told Reuters, “We recognize that the unilateral controls that we are putting in place will lose effectiveness over time if other countries don’t join us.” At the December 2024 Reagan National Defense Forum, Gina Raimondo reiterated this sentiment, albeit more forcefully, saying, “When I set the rules, I have to make damn sure China can’t just buy this stuff from Japan or Korea or the Europeans, so that’s why we have to work with them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully aware of this reality, Chinese officials have repeatedly threatened countries considering going along with the U.S. controls. For example, in a March 2022 interview, Tan Jian, China’s ambassador to the Netherlands, said, “This will not be without consequences. I’m not going to speculate on countermeasures, but China won’t just swallow this,” in response to the Netherlands’s increasing alignment with the United States on export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, U.S. allies have not kept pace with the United States’ increasingly restrictive export controls vis-à-vis China. While the U.S. export control system is designed to be able to keep up with technological developments and to be responsive to changing geopolitical circumstances, the regimes of its allies are generally not. As noted in the previous section, other countries with significant semiconductor industries have export control systems grounded in multilateral agreements primarily focused on WMD nonproliferation. These arrangements are significantly less agile than the U.S. system. For example, to add items to a Wassenaar Arrangement control list requires consensus from all participating countries, and opportunities for additions typically occur only once per year. As Wassenaar also includes Russia, which has obstructionist geopolitical goals, finding consensus on issues with geopolitical implications is unfeasible. In total, it can take up to three years to add a new item to Wassenaar control lists, even under favorable circumstances. Furthermore, Wassenaar explicitly prohibits controls targeting an individual country, noting in its founding document: “This arrangement will not be directed against any state or group of states.” Limited improvements have been made to export control coordination between U.S. allies, such as the informal “Wassenaar minus one” approach, an effort by like-minded countries to harmonize controls on items and technologies not listed in traditional multilateral agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the existing multilateral export control architecture remains inadequate for U.S. national security requirements. As a result, understanding allied countries’ unilateral export control authorities is crucial to the success or failure of the U.S. and allied technology competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ai-and-semiconductor-export-control-authorities-landscape&quot;&gt;The AI and Semiconductor Export Control Authorities Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied countries possess significantly less comprehensive export control authorities than the United States. For the most part, they do not have an equivalent to key parts of the U.S. AI and semiconductor export control tool kit discussed in the previous sections like the FDPR, U.S. Persons Rule, Entity List, and restrictions that apply on a country-wide basis. This stands in radical contrast to China, which has passed no fewer than five laws since 2020 devoted to building a more sophisticated arsenal of economic security tools. In fact, China’s most recent update to its Export Control Law replicated several key U.S. export control authorities. The following sections compare U.S., allied, and Chinese export control authorities across list-based, end-user, end-use, and services controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;list-based-controls&quot;&gt;List-Based Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All U.S. allies implement the list-based controls found in the traditional four multilateral export control regimes. However, as shown in Table 1, they generally do have the ability to implement list-based controls outside of those regimes as well. For example, while the European Union does not have the power to require the imposition of export controls on semiconductor technologies, under Article 9 of 2021/821, EU member states are empowered to implement unilateral controls on otherwise uncontrolled items for “reasons of public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism,” or for “human rights considerations.” The Netherlands specifically referenced Article 9 authorities when it issued its Regulation on Advanced Production Equipment for Semiconductors in June 2023, which introduced a license requirement on the export of previously uncontrolled SME from the country. Similarly, when the Japanese government revealed its plans to place license requirements on 23 types of SME in 2023, it did so with authorities granted under its Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act that was originally passed in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yuGS5K8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: U.S., Allied, and Chinese List-Based Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although allied countries do have the demonstrated ability to implement list-based controls unilaterally, it is misleading to think of their controls as equivalent to those issued by the United States. For example, no allied country has a meaningful equivalent to the FDPR, nor do they have controls on advanced node semiconductors that apply on a China-wide basis, with the partial exception of Taiwan. On the other hand, recent changes to China’s export control system have given Beijing the authority to implement list-based controls that apply on both a country-specific and extraterritorial basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;end-user-controls&quot;&gt;End-User Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral export control regimes do not have an equivalent to the U.S. Entity List. As a result, allies have far less robust end-user restrictions than the United States. For example, the European Union and its member states simply do not have end-user restrictions and are forced to use sanctions authorities to impose controls on specific entities. Table 2 summarizes the end-user control landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ArYhFmG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: U.S., Allied, and Chinese End-User Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan all have the authority to impose end-user restrictions, their end-user authorities are more limited than the U.S. Entity List. For example, Japan’s end-user list only contains entities involved in the development, production, manufacturing, or storage of WMDs, or certain military end-uses. No allied country has put end-user controls on Chinese AI and semiconductor firms like the United States has, at least not publicly. As with list-based controls, allied countries lag far behind China when it comes to end-user controls. For example, in October 2024, China released its new dual-use export control regulation, which outlined a U.S. Entity List equivalent. Other regulations such as the Unreliable Entities List also give China options to target specific actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;end-use-controls&quot;&gt;End-Use Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral export control regimes contain end-use (often referred to as “catch-all”) controls related to WMDs and certain military applications. For example, the Missile Technology Control Regime requires members to have end-use restrictions “controlling the export of items not included on a control list when they may be intended for use in connection with delivery systems for WMD[s].” Meanwhile, the Wassenaar Arrangement contains a “catch-all” provision designed to control unlisted dual-use items destined for a country subject to an arms embargo and intended for “military end-use.” As shown in Table 3, allied countries’ end-use controls are thus confined to WMD and military applications, with the potential exception of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ivAiNhi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: U.S., Allied, and Chinese End-Use Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, in October 2022, BIS introduced an end-use restriction related to the production of advanced node semiconductors in China. This move marked a major policy change, as U.S. end-use restrictions had previously been limited to situations involving WMDs. China also has the authority to implement end-use controls for reasons unrelated to WMDs. China’s 2020 Export Control Law provides a catch-all for any end-use that likely would endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.” These terms are left largely undefined, providing Beijing with the ability to require licenses for a very broad set of unlisted items on an end-use basis if it desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;services-controls&quot;&gt;Services Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied countries surveyed in this paper only apply services controls for WMD end-uses. However, there is a key difference in how the United States interprets what is covered under WMDs compared to its allies. In October 2022, BIS informed all U.S. persons that the act of supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors and related equipment in China “could involve ‘support’ for . . . weapons of mass destruction-related end uses,” and thus required a license. On the other hand, allied countries do not consider activities supporting the development or production of advanced node semiconductors to be related to WMDs and, as a result, do not imposes services controls on such activities. Table 4 summarizes the services controls landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ak1N7LV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: U.S., Allied, and Chinese Services Export Control Authorities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite holding a more limited view of WMD-based export control restrictions than BIS, certain allies do restrict their citizens’ activities related to semiconductor manufacturing through other economic security tools. For example, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association, South Korea has used its Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology “on numerous occasions to prevent firms transferring to mainland China technology deemed detrimental to the industrial competitive capabilities of Korean companies even in the absence of direct links to national security concerns associated with WMDs or conventional weapons.” Taiwan also restricts its citizens and firms from supporting the Chinese semiconductor industry through a variety of regulations unrelated to its export control regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-gaps-between-us-and-allied-export-control-regimes&quot;&gt;Key Gaps Between U.S. and Allied Export Control Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in the previous sections, allied countries possess far less expansive export control authorities than the United States. Although they are all capable of implementing list-based controls on advanced AI chips and SME, their export control tool kit is far narrower than what is available to BIS. For example, while the list-based controls announced by the Netherlands and Japan as part of a reported trilateral deal with the United States were a legitimate breakthrough in allied export control coordination, their controls were weaker than the U.S. regime in at least three important ways. Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Kevin Wolf summed up these defects in his February 2023 testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which is quoted below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[The trilateral deal does not impose] controls on activities of Dutch or Japanese citizens in support of advanced node manufacturing in China. (The new BIS rules prohibit U.S. persons from providing support, even involving uncontrolled foreign-made items, to the development or production of advanced node semiconductors in China.) It will not involve any ally imposing end-user controls such as those related to the EAR’s Entity List. It will also not have controls specific to the . . . production of semiconductor production equipment in China. Thus, Japanese and Dutch companies will still be able to export to China items and services that U.S. competitor companies cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth adding to Wolf’s point that license applications for sales of U.S.-controlled chips to China generally face “a presumption of denial.” Thus, the U.S. policy imposes what is de jure a license requirement but de facto a ban. This is not always the case for U.S. allies. For example, in July 2023 Reuters reported that Japan’s controls would not be implemented on a presumption of denial basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only imposing simple list-based restrictions leaves allied countries vulnerable to the same failure modes that plagued earlier versions of the U.S. controls. For example, in July 2019, Japan issued an update to its export licensing policies, which removed South Korea from its “white countries” list of trusted trade partners and required individual export licenses for fluorinated polyimide, hydrogen fluoride, and related chemicals. A February 2023 World Bank analysis showed that in the absence of an FDPR equivalent, Japanese firms simply relocated production of the controlled chemicals from Japan to subsidiaries located in South Korea. While technically legal, these activities were in stark opposition to the intent of Japan’s controls and greatly limited their strategic impact. Similarly, for years the United States blocked direct sales of cutting-edge chips to customers explicitly affiliated with the Chinese military, while allowing those same chips to flow freely to commercial entities in China. While this policy ended direct sales from U.S. companies to the Chinese military, it was mostly ineffective at stopping indirect sales to the shell companies that helped the Chinese military evade export controls. The October 2022 controls addressed this by implementing restrictions that applied on a China-wide basis. Without equivalent measures, there are good reasons to think that allied countries’ controls will be susceptible to the same diversion risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Netherlands and Japan used existing authorities to implement unilateral controls on advanced semiconductor technologies also illustrates that analysis of authorities alone yields an incomplete understanding of international semiconductor export control dynamics. Whether Japan and the Netherlands’s reticence can be attributed to poor diplomatic coordination on behalf of the United States or a lack of political will on behalf of its allies is up for debate, but it cannot be entirely attributed to insufficient legal authorities. What is clear is that this delay harmed the U.S. strategic goals vis-à-vis China and its AI and semiconductor ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch and Japanese governments announced their plans to impose controls in line with the October 2022 update in March 2023, but enforcement did not take place until July 2023 in the case of Japan and September 2023 in the case of the Netherlands. This delay allowed Chinese firms to engage in a massive stockpiling effort. According to a Financial Times analysis of Chinese customs data, the total value of Chinese imports of SME increased from $2.9 billion in June and July 2022 to $5 billion over the same two months in 2023. The analysis further found that “most of the imports came from the Netherlands and Japan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The December 2024 export control update showed that while U.S. policymakers are providing incentives to allies to align themselves with the U.S. export control regime, they are willing to unilaterally restrict the activity of firms headquartered in unaligned countries. For example, South Korean SME and high-bandwidth memory will be restricted by the expanded FDPR even for sales from South Korea, with a possible future exemption if the country implements controls equivalent to those in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections survey export control policies for the European Union, Netherlands, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-union&quot;&gt;European Union&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union lacks the export control authorities to compel its member states to follow U.S. restrictions on AI chips and related technologies. By the European Commission’s own admission, the European Union “does not have the necessary legal provisions to adopt at EU level uniform export controls.” Yet in the past 18 months, EU leadership has demonstrated a desire for greater involvement in the geopolitics of AI. In November 2023, the European Commission identified AI and semiconductors as “critical technology areas” that it would like to place restrictions on as it attempts to “de-risk” its relationship with China. Věra Jourová, one of the key proponents of the European Chips Act, stated, “Technology is currently at the heart of geopolitical competition and the EU wants to be a player, and not a playground.” At the February 2025 AI Action Summit, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen reiterated this sentiment, saying, “We want Europe to be one of the leading AI continents. . . . Too often, I hear that Europe is late to the race—while the U.S. and China have already gotten ahead. I disagree. . . . Global leadership is still up for grabs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a major response in the form of what the EU Commission described as an “unprecedented and rapid expansion” of sanctions on military items and dual-use goods and technologies. The invasion also initiated a conversation about the role of Russia in obstructing the intended goals of the existing multilateral export control architecture. One European Commission export control strategy document noted, “Russia has blocked the adoption of important controls on emerging technologies in the Wassenaar Arrangement. . . . This raises serious questions on the capacity of multilateral export control regimes to deliver in times of serious geo-political tensions, and to ensure the security of the EU and the other members of the multilateral arrangements.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also began a discussion among EU policymakers about what economic security tools should be used against China, especially in light of China’s support for the Russian military. Furthermore, the 2021 U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council Export Control Working Group joint statement drew specific attention to the “civil-military fusion policies of certain actors,” a thinly veiled reference to China. For now, however, the European Union’s export controls vis-à-vis Beijing remain decidedly weaker than those of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-european-unions-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;The European Union’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union set up its export control regime for dual-use items in the 1990s with a focus on preventing the proliferation of WMDs. In 2011, the European Commission ordered a review of its export control system to respond to demands from member states for a more flexible export control system. In 2021, Regulation 2021/821, often referred to as the EU Dual-Use Regulation, entered into law and governs the EU export control system as it exists today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This regulation was designed to allow the European Union to better cope with “today’s evolving and new security risks, rapid technological and scientific developments as well as transformations in trade and economic processes.” Despite expanding the European Union’s export control tool kit for dual-use technologies, the final regulation was significantly pared down compared to the original draft text. The regulation allows for the following kinds of controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods, software, and technology subject to license requirements are listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation. This list compiles items from multilateral export control agreements including the Wassenaar Arrangement, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Australia Group, and Missile Technology Control Regime. Additionally, in Annex IV of the regulation, there is a list of high-sensitivity items that require licenses even to be transferred within the European Union. The European Union also maintains a common list of military items. However, this list is nonbinding, and member states are responsible for legislating and implementing their own controls on military items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU Dual-Use Regulation also includes catch-all controls covering use cases related to WMDs, military applications, and cyber surveillance. Notably, the cyber surveillance catch-all was implemented outside of the multilateral regime structure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU Dual-Use Regulation imposes license requirements on services related to three types of end-uses: “(i) weapons of mass destruction end use; (ii) military end-use in an arms embargoed country; or (iii) use as parts or components of military items exported without license or in violation thereof.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union requires member states to impose authorization requirements for controlled items. These requirements are a weak tool, however. Though the European Union may require member states to impose authorization requirements, national governments may choose to approve every application they receive. The challenge posed by the European Union’s narrow authorities is exacerbated by its limited enforcement capacity. The European Union’s role in implementing its export control regime is limited to administrative support; it does not process applications, investigate noncompliance, or prosecute violators. The limitations to its export control regime are the reason the European Union turned to sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While sanctions are a more agile tool than export controls (e.g., they allow for the targeting of a specific country), they require unanimity in the European Council to be implemented. The small set of countries and end-users under EU sanctions are also subject to export control restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the European Union does empower its members to implement unilateral export controls on items not covered by multilateral export control regimes. Article 9 of the EU Dual-Use Regulation provides EU member states with a legal mechanism to implement unilateral controls on otherwise unlisted items for “reasons of public security, including the prevention of acts of terrorism,” or for “human rights considerations.” Member states have been exercising these authorities with increasing frequency, particularly for restrictions on emerging technologies. The Netherlands, Spain, France, Germany, and Italy have all implemented unilateral export controls in the last two years. In an attempt to preserve the single market principle, the European Union publishes national control lists which in theory allow for export control coordination at the EU level. In practice, however, potential coordination is complicated by insufficient consultation between states and inconsistent national-level legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, the European Commission adopted five initiatives to “strengthen the EU’s economic security at a time of growing geopolitical tensions and profound technological shifts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They include foreign direct investment (FDI) screening, improved member state export control coordination, and enhanced security around research and innovation sectors to avoid unwanted leakage. That same month, the European Commission released the final version of its white paper on export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the pivot to more aggressive economic security measures, EU leadership has expressed concern over recent U.S. export control action. For example, in response to the January 2025 AI Diffusion Framework, European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Henna Virkunen and Maroš Šefčovič issued a statement noting, “It is . . . in the U.S. economic and security interest that the EU buys advanced AI chips from the U.S. without limitations: we cooperate closely, in particular in the field of security, and represent an economic opportunity for the U.S., not a security risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;netherlands&quot;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-2&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch company ASML is the world’s sole supplier of the EUV lithography machines necessary to manufacture advanced semiconductor chips. As a result, the Netherlands occupies a key chokepoint in the AI chip value chain. Yet, for most of the 2010s, the Dutch government allowed these advanced semiconductor technologies to flow to China unimpeded. In 2019, the first Trump administration reportedly persuaded the Netherlands’s leadership to impose limited controls on cutting-edge EUV machines by showing them classified intelligence reports about the dangers that China’s acquisition of ASML’s technology posed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2020, the Dutch Ministry of Defense published an internal memo which concluded that continued exports of advanced semiconductor technologies would increase the chance of a NATO member state having to defend itself against advanced weapons systems in the future. This document highlighted the key role U.S. diplomacy played in Dutch strategic thinking around semiconductors, noting, “Our most important strategic security partner, the United States, has made an emphatic appeal to the Netherlands not to export EUV technology to China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This internal memo—along with continued discussions with the Trump and Biden administrations—prompted the Netherlands to announce that it would impose further license requirements for advanced SME in March 2023, bringing the government’s policies in line with the U.S. October 2022 controls as part of the reported trilateral deal between the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. Furthermore, the Dutch government allegedly declined to renew ASML’s license to service and provide spare parts to its systems already in China. In September 2024, the Dutch government announced yet another update, this time on less advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the September 2024 controls, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Reinette Klever emphasized that the Netherlands’s leadership continues to view export controls on advanced SME as a significant national security priority: “I’ve made this decision for reasons of security. We see that technological advances have given rise to increased security risks associated with the export of this specific manufacturing equipment, especially in the current geopolitical context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-netherlands-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;The Netherland’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dutch export controls on dual-use items and technologies are grounded in two pieces of legislation: the 2008 Strategic Goods Decree and the 2011 Strategic Services Act. Articles 2 and 3 of the Strategic Goods Decree refer to Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation rather than maintaining a Netherlands-specific list of dual-use items subject to export controls. Article 4 of the decree refers to Article 9 of the EU Dual-Use Regulation, which permits member states to impose license requirements on items not listed in Annex I for reasons related to public security or human rights. The Strategic Services Act adopts the EU provisions on services controls. License applications are processed by the Central Import and Export Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dutch export control system allows for the following kinds of controls on dual-use items and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods, software, and technology listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation or added by the Dutch government unilaterally are subject to license requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The Dutch government enforces end-use controls through the catch-all authorities provided by the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As an EU member state, the Netherlands implements services controls related to end-uses specified in the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all EU member states, the Netherlands primarily controls dual-use items through Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation. Similarly to a smaller subset of EU member states including Spain, France, Germany, and Italy, the Dutch government has made use of provisions in the EU Dual-Use Regulation (and its own legislation) that permit member states to implement controls outside of traditional multilateral agreements. As discussed in the previous section, the controls the Netherlands announced in March 2023 (and in September 2024, October 2024, and January 2025) were implemented on a unilateral basis. For example, the announcement accompanying the March 2023 export control updates specifically referenced the Article 9 provision of the EU Dual-Use Regulation which permits member states to “institute a ban on, or make the acquisition of a permit compulsory for exporting dual-use goods that are not specified in appendix I of the Regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the U.S. restrictions, the Netherlands’s controls do not specifically target China. In April 2023, then–Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Liesje Schreinemacher noted, “The Dutch export control policy is country-neutral. When assessing an export permit application, considerations are made and tested against the additional strategic character for export control on a case-by-case basis, where among others the properties of the product to be exported, the use of the product, the end-user and destination country are taken into account.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is increasing awareness in the Dutch policy community that China poses a significant danger. For example, in April 2023, the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service noted in its annual report that “[China] poses the greatest threat to the Netherlands’ economic security . . . [through] legitimate investments, company takeovers, and academic cooperation, as well as illegitimate digital espionage, insiders, covert investments and illegal exports.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-1&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 15, 2025, the Dutch government announced another export control update, due to enter into force on April 1, 2025, expanding the types of SME subject to license requirements. These additions are reflected in the annex to the Regulation on Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment and include items such as measurement and testing equipment, as well as optimization software used in the production of advanced semiconductors. In an announcement accompanying the update, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Reinette Klever noted, “We are observing increased security risks associated with the uncontrolled export of this specific equipment. For this reason an export authorization will henceforth be required.” Consistent with previous controls, this measure did not specifically reference China. Nonetheless, this set of controls prompted an outcry from Beijing officials. The January 2025 controls followed unilateral measures announced in October 2024 that covered items related to quantum technologies, semiconductors, and additive manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has also recently demonstrated a desire to build a more robust economic security tool kit. For example, in June 2023 the government announced it was considering legislation that would require foreign doctoral students coming to the country to study in technical fields to undergo a screening process. While the announcement did not specifically mention protecting EUV and DUV lithography, these technology areas are likely the target of the proposed measure. Prior to that, in May 2023, the Dutch government implemented measures subjecting certain investments, mergers, and acquisitions in its semiconductor industry to review based on national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germany&quot;&gt;Germany&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-3&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, Germany believed that robust economic relations with China would achieve Wandel durch Handel, a German notion that roughly translates to “change through trade.” A central tenet in German foreign policy since the 1970s, the idea holds that trade with authoritarian regimes can induce political change. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China’s subsequent support of the war effort shook Germany’s confidence in the policy, as Germany’s extensive trade with both countries failed to prevent violent authoritarianism from spilling into Europe. In April 2022, the European Commissioner for Economy summed up the prevailing view in Europe when he stated that the “notion of Wandel durch Handel, of bringing about change through trade, has shown its limitations” and that Europe needed to “rethink [its] relations with autocratic regimes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, Germany’s Federal Foreign Office published its Strategy on China, further demonstrating an updated understanding of the Chinese threat. The document stated, “The Federal Government is committed to the adjustment of export control lists in international export control regimes as well as to reviewing national export control lists against the backdrop of new technological developments.” It further noted that the government was “also taking China’s Military-Civil Fusion policy into account in this regard.” Germany also pushed the European Commission to adopt an EU-wide investment screening mechanism to better protect member states’ economic security. This was widely seen as a response to the Chinese acquisition of German robotics national champion Kuka in 2016. In its 2024 annual report, Germany’s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution described China as Germany’s “biggest economic and scientific espionage threat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its increasingly wary rhetoric about the threat of China to its economic security, Germany has not kept pace with the United States, at least not in terms of export controls on advanced semiconductors and related equipment. In March 2024, Bloomberg reported that senior U.S. officials asked Germany to block shipments of optical components produced by Carl Zeiss, which are needed for advanced chip production and are used in ASML’s EUV machines, to China, but the German government was reluctant to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;germanys-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;Germany’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legal authorities for Germany’s modern export control regime come from the 2021 EU Dual-Use Regulation, as well as Germany’s Foreign Trade and Payments Act and Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance, both passed in 2013. Article 4 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act gives the government authority to restrict foreign trade transactions in order to carry out EU controls or other member state obligations. It also stipulates that Germany can restrict exports unilaterally if doing so guarantees “essential security interests,” prevents “disturbances to German foreign relations,” or ensures the “public order or security” of Germany. The Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance states that goods listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation are subject to export controls. License applications for listed items are processed by the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German export control system allows for the following kinds of controls on dual-use items and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods, software, and technology listed in Annex I of the EU Dual-Use Regulation are subject to license requirements. Items found in Part I, Section B of the German Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance, often referred to as its national control list, are also subject to license requirements. Importantly, the national control list contains 20 dual-use items not included in multilateral agreements. In other words, it contains items Germany has put in place unilaterally. In theory, restrictions on these items apply to all countries, but German export control officials told CSIS that EU members and other allies are effectively exempt from these unilateral restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The German government enforces end-use controls through the catch-all authorities provided by the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As an EU member state, Germany implements services controls related to end-uses specified in the EU Dual-Use Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite U.S. pressure, Germany has not publicly implemented China-specific export controls on advanced semiconductors. In fact, German export control officials told CSIS that they view their export control system as in principle applying to all countries. They noted that for restrictions to apply on a country-specific basis, they have to be implemented through a sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-2&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 17, 2024, Germany used its Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance to unilaterally add a set of items related to semiconductor manufacturing, including equipment for wafer inspection and dry etching, to its national control list. German government officials told CSIS this measure was undertaken to align Germany with the existing U.S. export control regime, and that additional unilateral controls could arrive by mid-2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BAFA has also undertaken a major effort to streamline its export control processing. In March 2024, the office announced its third tranche of policy changes in three years related to this effort. Sven Giegold, state secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, noted, “Procedural simplifications are contributing to significantly faster authorizations without compromising the scrutiny standards.” German export control officials told CSIS a fourth tranche went into effect in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-4&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, Japan announced plans to restrict exports of 23 types of advanced SME not controlled by multilateral agreements. This measure came after a reported deal earlier that year between Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States. However, Japanese officials insisted these controls were not targeted toward China. Japanese Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry Yasutoshi Nishimura stated in a March 2023 press conference following the announcement, “We do not have one particular country in mind with these measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These controls underline the emerging consensus in Japan’s national security community that export controls and advanced semiconductor technologies play a significant role in securing Japan’s economic security. In 2021, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that the goal of its semiconductor industry was “to ensure Japan remains strategically essential and strategically independent amid the conflict for technological hegemony between the U.S. and China.” Meanwhile, Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy recommended measures to “enhance investment screening and export control as well as response to forced technology transfer, and further advancing research integrity and measures against talent drain.” The 2023 Camp David pact, a trilateral agreement between Japan, South Korea, and the United States, demonstrated Japan’s desire to work more closely with the United States on economic security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the March 2023 controls, Japan remains a significant supplier of SME to China. For example, in the first three quarters of 2024, around 50 percent of Japan’s SME sales went to the country. As a result, over the past year, both the Biden administration and Congress called for Japan to further limit SME sales to China. In January 2025, Japan issued another export control update covering advanced semiconductor technologies, demonstrating the country’s continued willingness to implement controls on strategic technologies outside of multilateral export control regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;Japan’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation of Japan’s present-day export control system dates back to 1987 in the aftermath of the Toshiba Machine incident. In 1987, the U.S. intelligence community discovered that the Japanese Toshiba Machine Company was providing the Soviet Union with nine-axis propeller milling machines and related software to support the Soviet submarine program, in clear violation of the COCOM regime. In response to pressure from the United States and allied countries, the Japanese government implemented significant changes to its export control regime including major amendments to the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA), first passed in 1949, and the creation of the Center for Information on Security Trade Control (CISTEC), a nongovernmental body dedicated to supporting Japan’s export control system and economic security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FEFTA remains the bedrock of Japan’s export control regime today and was the basis for its March 2023 and January 2025 controls on advanced semiconductor technologies. FEFTA contains two key provisions—Article 25 and Article 48—which provide the legal framework for its export control system. Article 25 states that the export of specific controlled technologies to a foreign person or country requires a license, and Article 48 states that the export of specific controlled goods requires a license. Japan enforces the following kinds of export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Items specified in Attachment List No. 1 of FEFTA are subject to license requirements. Items on this list are based on multilateral agreements like the Wassenaar Arrangement, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Australia Group, and Missile Technology Control Regime, or are added unilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; METI maintains an end-user list that contains people and firms potentially involved in the development, production, manufacturing, or storage of WMDs. Japanese officials told CSIS that METI also plans to create a military end-user list focused on entities that pose a military end-use diversion risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; METI requires exporters to obtain a license for any item that may “be used for the development, manufacture, use, or storage of WMD[s].”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As a member of the four traditional multilateral export control regimes, Japan has the authority to implement services controls related to WMD end-uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japanese export controls are largely grounded in multilateral regimes, Article 48 of FEFTA allows for unilateral action when the export of an item “is deemed to obstruct the maintenance of international peace and security.” The Japanese government specifically referenced these authorities when it announced its March 2023 controls on SME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within METI, three specific offices deal with export controls and are housed in the Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureau under the Trade Control Department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these divisions, the Security Export Control Policy Division, administers export control policy and legislation and engages with international export control regimes. The second, the Security Export Licensing Division, is responsible for examining license applications and issuing licenses. The final division is the Security Export Control Administration Division containing the Security Export Inspection Office, which conducts company inspections and provides guidance for exporters, and the International Affairs Office, which engages with international export control regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-3&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2024, METI issued an interim report containing recommendations for significant changes to its export control regime. According to an English language overview of the document published by METI, the traditional framework for export controls is at a “turning point.” The report made the following four policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review the complementary approach to the list control;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a new dialogue framework on technology transfer between public and private sectors;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explore multilayered international collaboration for agile and effective export control;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Streamline and prioritize export control systems and implementations in accordance with the respective levels of security concerns, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, Japan imposed restrictions on several AI and semiconductor technologies to its control list. These included scanning-type electron microscopes and technologies used to design or manufacture gate-all-around field-effect transistor (GAAFET) structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these actions, U.S. lawmakers have continued to pressure Japan to increase restrictions on chip-making equipment destined for China. In October 2024, the ranking members of the House China Select Committee, Congressman John Moolenaar (R-MI) and Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), sent Japanese Ambassador to the United States Yamada Shigeo a letter requesting “urgent action to address the flow of Japanese semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 17, 2025, METI announced its intention to add 21 items to its control list including previously uncontrolled advanced SME, further aligning its export control policy with the United States. This proposed measure prompted the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) to release a statement noting, “For some time, certain countries have generalized the concept of national security and abused export control measures to suppress China’s semiconductor industry. . . . China reserves the right to take necessary measures and will firmly safeguard its legitimate interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this criticism, the United States-Japan Joint Leaders’ Statement following the February 2025 meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba noted the two countries would resolve “to continue discussions on aligning policies to further promote and protect critical and sensitive technologies, including through export controls,” showing the country’s intention to continue export control coordination with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;south-korea&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-5&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the twenty-first century, China was South Korea’s biggest trading partner. During this time, South Korean AI and semiconductor companies made significant investments in China. For example, SK Hynix and Samsung invested more than $20 billion to buy or build facilities in the Chinese cities of Dalian and Xi’an in 2020 and 2021, respectively. As recently as 2022, roughly 60 percent ($66 billion) of South Korea’s chip exports went to Chinese customers, though this includes companies such as Apple that do final assembly in China. South Korea is also the world’s largest supplier of memory chips and holds roughly half of global DRAM capacity, according to analysis by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). That same analysis found that South Korea ranks third behind China and the United States in AI patent applications and granted patents. The country has also played an important role in AI diplomacy, hosting the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its status as a global leader in strategic technologies, South Korea has been hesitant to implement strict export control measures due to its export-led economy and fear of retaliation from China. For example, South Korea originally refrained from joining the sanctions regime against Russia in 2014 after its illegal annexation of Crimea. However, South Korea aligned itself with international export controls and sanctions against Russia in March 2022, which many saw as a watershed moment for South Korea’s export control approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Camp David pact, a trilateral agreement between South Korea, Japan, and the United States, further committed South Korea to cooperation on technology and economic security issues. That same year, the United States overtook China as South Korea’s biggest export market. On September 10, 2024, Minister for Trade Dr. Inkyo Cheong stated, “Economic security requires more than unilateral action,” highlighting the government’s newfound openness to implementing export control outside of traditional multilateral frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, South Korea has yet to match its strategic thinking to concrete export control action, at least not to the same degree as the United States, Japan, or the Netherlands. In fact, the U.S. December 2024 export control update applied the FDPR to South Korean SME and high-bandwidth memory, as U.S. policymakers determined South Korea did not have “equivalent controls” for items specified in U.S. restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;south-koreas-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;South Korea’S Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the United States and South Korea signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Protection of Strategic Commodities and Technical Data to bring South Korea in line with guidance prohibiting the export of COCOM-controlled items to communist-bloc destinations. South Korea’s current export control authorities for dual-use technologies are grounded in its Foreign Trade Act, originally passed in 1987. In 2007, the Foreign Trade Act underwent a significant revision, establishing the Korea Strategic Trade Institute (KOSTI), which supports the implementation of export controls. South Korea enforces the following kinds of export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Dual-use goods and technologies subject to license requirements are listed in Annexes 2 and 3 of South Korea’s Public Notice on Trade of Strategic Goods and Technologies. These annexes reflect control lists in multilateral agreements including the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group, and the Missile Technology Control Regime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; South Korea also maintains a denial list, which includes people, companies, and institutions subject to restrictions based on UN Security Council sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; South Korea implements catch-all controls on items not included in multilateral control lists but which may be intended for use in the creation of WMDs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; As a member of the four traditional multilateral export control regimes, South Korea has the authority to implement services controls related to WMD end-uses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea’s export control system divides export control administration by item type across three bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (MOTIE) oversees dual-use items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) of the Ministry of National Defense (MND) oversees military items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) oversees nuclear items.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, South Korean police arrested two former Samsung employees for attempting to steal trade secrets reportedly worth $3.2 billion on behalf of a Chinese chip manufacturer. Industrial espionage has proven to be a major issue for Korean AI and semiconductor firms. According to the South Korean government, “The majority of the [industrial espionage] incidents [in 2023] involved cutting-edge semiconductor technologies, an area in which South Korean firms are among the world leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea has partly addressed this challenge through its national core technology list, authorized by the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology. This act requires companies who work with one of the 76 listed technologies to adhere to stringent facility security requirements. Furthermore, if a company intends to export a listed technology, it must obtain approval from MOTIE. Any foreign investment (including mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures) in a company that holds a listed technology is also subject to MOTIE review. The South Korean legislature significantly expanded the scope of the Act on Prevention of Divulgence and Protection of Industrial Technology in January 2023. The act was amended yet again in December 2024 to increase protections around national core technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-4&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 21, 2024, South Korea made several important changes to its export control laws by amending the Foreign Trade Act. First, South Korea renamed KOSTI to the Korea Trade Security Administration. While its English acronym KOSTI remains unchanged, the new Korean title reflects the agency’s expanded responsibilities including broader trade and technology security functions, and support for policymaking and industry analysis. Second, Article 19 of the Foreign Trade Act—which authorizes MOTIE to designate which goods require export licenses—added the phrase “or the equivalent multilateral export control cooperation” to the original text, which read, “in accordance with international export control regimes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This revision was significant because previously the law only allowed compliance with control lists established by consensus among member countries of the four international export control regimes. With the revision, the Foreign Trade Act potentially allows for the addition of items that have not reached a consensus in traditional multilateral fora but are controlled by an ad hoc set of countries (such as the reported deal between Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States or a Wassenaar minus one arrangement). Despite these authorities, South Korea has not yet joined the Netherlands and Japan in imposing restrictions on advanced semiconductor technologies not controlled by multilateral regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan&quot;&gt;Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-6&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan occupies a unique position in the semiconductor manufacturing landscape. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) produces over 90 percent of the world’s advanced semiconductor chips. Beyond TSMC, Nanya Technology Corporation (NTC), Winbond Electronics Corporation, and Macronix International are among the top 10 memory manufacturers in the world. MediaTek, ASE Group, and Unimicron also play important roles in other parts of the semiconductor supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor manufacturing industry is of such strategic importance to Taiwan’s national security, it is known as the huguo shenshan, which roughly translates to the “sacred mountain that protects the nation.” In 2021, Taiwan’s trade minister Wang Mei-hua stated, “This isn’t just about our economic safety. . . . It appears to be connected to our national security, too.” That same year, then–President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen noted, “Our semiconductor industry is especially significant: a ‘silicon shield’ that allows Taiwan to protect itself and others from aggressive attempts by authoritarian regimes to disrupt global supply chains.” Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, made this point more bluntly in a 2022 interview on 60 Minutes, saying, “because our company provides a lot of chips to the world, maybe somebody will refrain from attacking [Taiwan].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to manufacturing cutting-edge chips for U.S. chip design companies like Nvidia, TSMC was also the linchpin of the Chinese AI and advanced technologies ecosystem in the 2010s. For example, in 2019 Huawei’s first-generation Ascend 910A chip was manufactured by TSMC. This, at least in theory, changed in 2020 when the company officially halted its business with Huawei to comply with the first Trump administration’s export controls, causing Huawei to temporarily “exit whole lines of business,” such as its consumer smartphone operation. This action also had a significant impact on Huawei’s revenue, which dropped 23 percent between 2019 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TSMC-manufactured products continue to find their way to Chinese firms in an apparent violation of U.S. export controls. In October 2024, an analysis by prominent semiconductor research firm TechInsights found that Huawei’s Ascend 910B chip contained TSMC-made components. In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce launched an investigation of the relationship between TSMC and Huawei. The U.S. Foundry Due Diligence Rule—which went into effect in January 2025 and imposed stricter restrictions on chip manufacturers—was widely understood as targeting TSMC and its illicit support of Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwans-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s current export control regime for dual-use items is governed by Article 13 of its Foreign Trade Act, originally passed in 1993. This legislation establishes Taiwan’s export control program for strategic high-tech commodities (SHTC). The Foreign Trade Act allows for the following kinds of controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwan enforces five separate dual-use export control lists:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;High-Tech Commodities List for Exportation to Russia and Belarus;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sensitive Commodities List for Exportation to North Korea;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sensitive Commodities List for Exportation to Iran;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Export Control List for Dual-Use Items and Technology (based on the EU Dual-Use Regulation); and&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Common Military List (also based on the EU Dual-Use Regulation).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan also maintains a list of “restricted regions” subject to license requirements. These “regions” include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, China, Sudan, and Syria. China only qualifies as a restricted region for “12 categories of semiconductor wafer fabricating equipment for SHTC.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The Taiwanese International Trade Administration (TITA) maintains the Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List, which inventories people and companies subject to restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwan implements “catch-all” controls on end-uses for which there is a risk of WMD proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; N/A&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TITA, housed within the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), is the principal government organization charged with implementing the country’s export control regime. However, TITA coordinates with the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Finance, and other agencies with subject-matter-specific mandates on export control enforcement matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has also restricted the flow of sensitive AI and semiconductor technologies through economic security tools beyond export controls. In June 2022, Taiwan announced amendments to its National Security Act that created a national core technology list covering a wide range of SME including “manufacturing technology for chips (ICs) with processes of 14nm and below” and other packaging and chip security technologies. These amendments added increased protection for intellectual property related to listed technologies. In June 2022, the Taiwanese government also announced changes to the Cross-Strait Relations Act and the National Security Act that required employees of corporations and research institutions who work in national core technology areas or receive significant government funding to go through a strenuous review process to travel to China. Taiwan has also used its Trade Secrets Act to protect its semiconductor industry. For example, in May 2017, a former TSMC engineer who shared sensitive information with the Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation was charged under the act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Taiwan has a robust and long-standing outbound investment screening process for transactions related to the production of advanced node semiconductors. For example, in 2002 MOEA issued the Operational Guidelines for Key Technology Review and Supervision of Investment in Foundry, Integrated Circuit Design, Integrated Circuit Packing, Integrated Circuit Testing, and LCD Panel Plants in Mainland China, which limit the ability of Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers to invest in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incentivize Taiwanese semiconductor firms to remain in Taiwan, the country also amended Article 10-2 of the Statute for Industrial Innovation, informally known as Taiwan’s CHIPS Act, in March 2023 to provide tax credits to semiconductor companies to pursue research and development efforts in Taiwan. While this tax incentive scheme was not in and of itself new, the amendment to the statute tightened the eligibility requirement such that only semiconductor manufacturing firms were able to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-5&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the robust economic security measures Taiwan has implemented, a series of incidents over the past year demonstrated that Chinese firms continue to exploit loopholes in Taiwan’s export controls to gain access to sensitive semiconductor technologies. In October 2024, reporting in The Wire China found that TSMC was manufacturing chips for Chinese chip design company Xiamen Sophgo Technologies, which was then transferring chips to Huawei. A January 2025 teardown by TechInsights revealed that 5 nm chips in Huawei’s L540 series of laptops were manufactured by TSMC, further demonstrating TSMC’s far-from-perfect record of following U.S. export controls. Other gaps in Taiwan’s export control regime have also appeared. For example, an August 2024 report from the Taiwanese government-funded Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology (DSET) found that Chinese company Bitmain acquired access to controlled AI chips and related technology through a “remote poaching model.” In other words, Taiwanese engineers were teleworking for Bitmain. The study determined that Chinese company Bitmain leveraged Taiwanese engineers’ expertise, TSMC manufacturing, and ASE packaging to design and build controlled AI chips, without relocating any Taiwanese nationals to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-7&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, China employed a variety of economic security tools against the United States including banning the export of certain critical minerals to the country, announcing an investigation into Nvidia on anti-trust grounds, and adding major U.S. defense companies to a Chinese equivalent of the U.S. Entity List. While these measures arrived in rapid succession, they were the product of more than five years of China’s export control and economic security capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic turning point for China’s domestic semiconductor strategy came in April 2018, following the comprehensive export controls the United States imposed on Chinese telecommunications company ZTE. These controls prompted a series of Chinese government actions designed to make China less vulnerable to future U.S. export controls and sanctions, which included an assessment of China’s most vulnerable technology chokepoints, the stockpiling of chips and chip-making equipment, and massive domestic semiconductor subsidies. While these were primarily defensive measures, China also laid the groundwork for more offensive economic security tools in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2019, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping called for the acceleration of “the construction of our country’s legal system for extraterritorial application” in a speech at the second meeting of the Central Committee for Comprehensive Law-Based Governance. A little more than a year later, at the seventh meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, he stated, “We must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners.” China has passed a series of laws and regulations with these two goals in mind. These include the 2020 Regulation on Unreliable Entity List, the 2020 Export Control Law, the 2021 Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, and most recently the 2024 Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-export-control-regime&quot;&gt;China’s Export Control Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s modern export control regime can be traced back to the 1990s with the passage of the Foreign Trade Law in 1994, which focused on WMD proliferation. However, China’s export control system for dual-use technologies has undergone a significant reorganization in the last six months. On September 30, 2024, China announced its Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items. Using authorities granted in China’s 2020 Export Control Law, this move consolidated previous rules and regulations, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the 2007 Regulation on Export Control of Nuclear Dual-Use Items and Related Technologies;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the 2002 Regulation on Export Control of Missiles and Missile-Related Items and Technologies; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the 2002 Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Biological Agents and Related Equipment and Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this new regulation and previous laws, China has the following export control tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List-based controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items created a unified control list combining items on lists such as the 2023 Catalogue of Dual-Use Items and Technologies Subject to Import and Export Licenses Administration, the 2017 Export Control List of Nuclear Dual-Use Items and Related Technologies, and the 2002 Export Control List of Missiles and Missile-Related Items and Technologies. Items on this unified list are subject to license requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-user controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The new regulation also introduced the Control List. Similar to the U.S. Entity List, the Control List comprises people and firms that are judged to pose some kind of national security risk and are thus subject to authorization requirements and other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End-use controls:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s 2020 Export Control Law provides a catch-all for any end-use that could endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.” These terms are left largely undefined, providing MOFCOM with the ability to require licenses for a very broad set of unlisted items on an end-use basis if it desires.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services controls:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s 2020 Export Control Law provides the authority to impose controls on services for any end-use that could endanger “[China’s] national security or national interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulation announced on September 30 also allows for controls based on the destination country of a given export. In fact, MOFCOM issued a blanket ban on the export of certain critical minerals to the United States two days after the new regulation went into effect. Furthermore, Article 49 of the new regulation gives China the ability to impose controls on foreign-produced items located outside China if they are a direct product of Chinese technology or software. According to a January 2025 report by the National Bureau of Asian Research, this authority is analogous to the U.S. FDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOFCOM, in coordination with the Chinese Customs Bureau, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, is responsible for export control coordination and enforcement functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-6&quot;&gt;Recent Developments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Regulation on Export Control of Dual-Use Items entered into force, China has put its new (and previously existing) authorities to work in what is widely seen as a response to recent U.S. AI and semiconductor export controls. On December 3, 2024, MOFCOM issued a notice banning the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and other critical minerals to the United States. The December 3 controls were particularly significant as they marked the first time China had imposed critical mineral export control on the United States on a country-wide basis. Two days later, MOFCOM followed these controls up by sanctioning U.S. defense contractors including General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and RTX’s Raytheon under its Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 2025, MOFCOM continued its slew of restrictions against U.S. defense contractors, adding 28 companies to the Control List in order to “safeguard national security and interests,” including Anduril, Raytheon Missiles &amp;amp; Defense, and L3Harris. This action banned the export of any dual-use items to listed companies. That same day, MOFCOM placed an additional 10 companies on the Unreliable Entity List, preventing them from doing business in China and prohibiting their executives from entering or living in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same week as the U.S. December 2, 2024, export control update, the Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced it would investigate Nvidia for “suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.” More specifically, China’s competition regulator said it would revisit Nvidia’s 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. This is hardly surprising. China has a robust record of employing anti-trust measures in technology competition. A December 2022 analysis by the law firm Skadden finds that “of the thousands of deals that China has reviewed, only three (less than 0.01%) have been prohibited. . . . Nearly all of the prohibitions, conditional approvals, and abandonments over the past 10 years have occurred in the technology sectors that are important to China’s national growth, such as semiconductors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials have also indicated that further retaliatory measures are coming following the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion Framework and Foundry Due Diligence Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-us-and-allied-policymakers&quot;&gt;Recommendations to U.S. and Allied Policymakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three elements, shown in Figure 1, that must be combined for the successful implementation of export controls: authority, capacity, and will. This paper focuses on the first of these elements, authority. However, capacity and will are also crucial to the success of U.S. and allied technology competition with China. Accordingly, the recommendations in this section address all three elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SkAiD32.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: The Three Elements of Effective Export Controls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, former U.S government officials have said that allied governments do “not really understand why the US Government is imposing its new China-specific controls,” and “do not see the national or common security justification of the controls.” Even if allied countries possessed the same export control authorities as the United States, they would also need to be convinced that using those authorities is in the best interests of their countries and international security. This clearly cannot be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of capacity. If an allied country has the political will and authority to unilaterally control advanced node semiconductors and related SME, ensuring compliance with the restrictions that it imposes would also require significant enforcement capacity. The United States invests considerably more resources into export control administration than allied countries, but even the United States faces significant concerns about enforcement capacity, particularly in the new administration. In fact, on February 5, 2025, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justice (DOJ) memorandum that disbanded the National Security Division’s Corporate Enforcement Unit, which was “created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion, export control violations, and other national security-related economic crimes.” At the time of writing, the DOJ has not explained how any other part of the DOJ will perform this function or take over these critical responsibilities. Similarly, on March 2, 2025, the Treasury Department announced the suspension of the enforcement of the corporate transparency act which was “aimed at curbing the use of anonymous shell companies to conduct illegal financial activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report has detailed, U.S. allies have most or all of the legal authorities they would need to strengthen restrictions on export of technologies and services related to cutting-edge AI. To address the shortfall in political will, the key for the United States therefore is persuading these countries of the need for these controls and the viability of implementing them using their existing authorities. To address the shortfall in capacity, the U.S. government must persuade allies of the national security return on investment in effectively denying adversaries access to strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and allied policymakers should consider the following policy actions for more effective AI and semiconductor export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 1: Allied policymakers should restrict citizens’ support of advanced node semiconductor production in China using existing authorities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese semiconductor industry has been the beneficiary of technical assistance and consulting services provided by U.S. and allied individuals and corporations. For example, as noted in a previous CSIS paper, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) 7 nm chip found in the Huawei Mate60 Pro was supported by significant foreign technical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, BIS used the U.S. Persons Rule to impose controls on the activities of U.S. persons if they were in support of the development or production of advanced node semiconductors in China. This move restricted China’s access to technical assistance provided by U.S. citizens and companies. To address such assistance provided by the non-U.S. persons, U.S. allies should implement equivalent controls. Imposing such controls would not require legislative changes to the export control framework of most allied countries. For example, the European Union and its member states already have the authority to impose controls on services related to WMD end-uses and military applications. However, EU member states have not traditionally considered the development or production of advanced node semiconductors to fall under their existing WMD restrictions. But this is a political choice rather than a result of insufficient legal authorities. It is up to the Trump administration’s national security officials to make the case to allies that a different interpretation is in their best interests. There is a clear precedent for allies changing their tune when it comes to assessing the bounds of their own economic security tool kit. Allied government officials told CSIS that following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they used existing authorities to impose restriction on Moscow that they had previously thought would require new statutory authorities. In other words, they said they could not do something and then they did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 2: Allied policymakers should create China-specific restrictions for AI chips and related technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2015, the U.S. Department of Commerce blocked Intel from selling its Xeon and Xeon Phi chips to four Chinese firms working on China’s Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which was being used for military research related to nuclear weapons. The logic was straightforward. As these firms were working on Chinese military projects, they were “acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” From this point forward, the Department of Commerce generally restricted U.S. firms from selling advanced node chips to customers working with the Chinese military. However, China’s policy of civil-military fusion meant that shell companies designed to help the Chinese military evade export controls were able to access advanced chips easily. A 2022 CSET study found that the majority of advanced chips procured by the Chinese military were designed by U.S. firms, despite U.S. restrictions on military end-users. The October 2022 control addressed this, at least in theory, by introducing a blanket prohibition on the export of AI chips to all of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the partial exception of Taiwan, U.S. allies do not have China-specific controls, or at least have not publicly stated that they have such controls. In the case of the Netherlands, their export controls on advanced SME are explicitly “country-neutral.” There are at least two good reasons that allies might pursue this approach. First, restrictions that apply on a China-wide basis mean that allied firms miss out on valuable revenue from sales to commercial firms in the Chinese market. For example, between 2016 and 2024, ASML saw growth in sales of equipment to China that exceeded growth in the rest of the world. Secondly, as demonstrated by the recent anti-trust action against Nvidia, there are legitimate concerns about Chinese retaliation against countries who implement controls perceived to target Beijing. However, there is no reason to believe allied controls will be any less susceptible to the kinds of evasive tactics that rendered the United States’ pre–October 2022 controls, which did not apply on a China-wide basis, ineffective. If allied countries are serious about restricting Chinese military end-users’ access to advanced node semiconductors and related technologies, they will have to do so on a China-wide basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 3: Allied policymakers should develop FDPR equivalents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant loophole in the pre–October 2022 controls was the fact that Chinese firms were accessing controlled SME, components, and spare parts from U.S. companies without a license via foreign-headquartered partners. The October 2022 controls addressed this in part through an expansion of FDPR, which prohibited foreign-headquartered firms from exporting SME made using U.S. technology to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States made these changes over two years ago, allies are still lagging behind. In fact, all allies surveyed in this paper lack meaningful equivalents to the FDPR, limiting the effectiveness of their restrictions on AI chips and related technologies. As previously mentioned, China added these capabilities to its export control tool kit in its new regulation. If allies must pass new legislation to create these capabilities, then they should do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 4: U.S. and allied policymakers should ensure penalties for export control violations are significant enough to deter violations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and allied semiconductor firms are among the most valuable in the world. For example, as of January 2025, TSMC had a market capitalization of $899 billion. Given their financial prospects, these companies have significant capacity to weather fines. As a result, there is increasing awareness in the policy community that more significant fines are needed to deter export control violations. In October 2024, Chris Miller, author of Chip War, noted that “governments—including the U.S. and Taiwan—need to couple stricter enforcement with larger financial penalties for violations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic has also found increasing support in the U.S. government. In January 2024, then–Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod described a $300 million fine on Seagate Technology Holding as a mere “down payment,” and highlighted the need for heightened penalties, saying, “You can expect to see more big-ticket corporate resolutions going forward.” While acknowledgment of the gap in deterrence is an important step, more concrete action is needed. Other companies have gotten off relatively lightly for export control violations, at least compared to the revenue and profits of the illicit sale. For example, on November 1, 2024, BIS imposed a $500,000 fine on GlobalFoundries for shipments of semiconductor wafers to SJ Semiconductor, a company on the BIS Entity List. This fine only amounted to around 3 percent of the value of GlobalFoundries’ shipment. Given semiconductor firms’ massive financial resources, U.S. and allied policymakers should also consider jail time or personal fines for the perpetrators rather than just corporate fines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation 5: U.S. and allied policymakers should increase spending on export control processing and enforcement functions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the United States implemented its October 2022 export controls, the administration of the export licensing process and enforcement of controls has become significantly more difficult. BIS’s licensing workload has roughly doubled since 2012. Yet, the BIS budget for these activities has remained relatively flat in inflation-adjusted terms. Furthermore, BIS’s data analysis tools and other enabling digital technologies are inadequate for its broad set of responsibilities. In March 2024, in response to a question about whether BIS’s data analysis tools and infrastructure were sufficient, Alan Estevez, then–Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security, responded, “The answer to that is an emphatic no.” He went on to say BIS personnel are “relying on antiquated systems for both license adjudication and enforcement work that were put in service in 2006 and 2008, respectively.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, BIS must rely on private sector companies’ compliance programs and due diligence efforts. In fact, the majority of investment in export control compliance is in commercial firms, rather than BIS. But, as noted in a previous CSIS report, “The primary goals of U.S. companies are generally legal compliance and maximizing profits, not determining and advancing U.S. national security interests beyond what is stated in law and policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though U.S. export license processing and enforcement capabilities are clearly not adequate for the task at hand, U.S. investment in these areas dwarfs that of its allies. For example, in fiscal year 2024, the United States allocated $222.4 million for BIS, almost twice the amount Germany plans to allocate to its export control office, BAFA, in fiscal year 2025. Export control administration and enforcement functions are at the forefront of technology competition with China. The United States and its allies must treat them as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the October 2022 export control update, then–Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a speech in which he said, “We are at an inflection point. The post–Cold War world has come to an end, and there is an intense competition underway to shape what comes next. And at the heart of that competition is technology.” This reference to the Cold War was more than a rhetorical trick. Over the last four years, the United States has repeatedly used Cold War–era economic security tools against China, such as restricting commercially developed technologies via export controls. But there is also wisdom in how the U.S. national security community thought about the role of allies in technology competition during the Cold War period relevant to policymakers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1955, the Council on Foreign Economic Policy, a now-defunct body created by President Eisenhower to coordinate economic policy across federal agencies, conducted a study titled “NATO, SEATO, and the Economic Defense Program.” This study recommended merging two nascent military and economic security organizations: NATO, the transatlantic military alliance, and COCOM, the export control coordination forum. The authors concluded that the “tie in of the organizations . . . will increase the mutual understanding of the overall security effort of the free world.” While this proposal was never implemented, the study contained a key insight relevant to the contemporary debate about restricting the flow of AI and advanced semiconductor technologies to China. The study notes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even in the U.S., with its tremendous economic, scientific, and technological power, there was an increasing awareness that we need allies as much as allies need us. . . . More and more we look to other areas of the free world for many of the raw materials needed to supply our industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is equally true for U.S. leadership in AI today. State-of-the-art semiconductors designed by U.S. firms rely on technical partners located in countries like Germany, the Netherlands, and Taiwan to be manufactured. As shown in this paper, U.S. efforts to limit China’s access to the most advanced AI technology also require allied cooperation to be successful. While certain countries have made steps in the right direction, the reality is that allied cooperation on export controls has been either too slow (in the case of Japan and the Netherlands) or largely absent (in the case of South Korea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The America First Trade Policy released on the first day of Trump’s second term called for the “The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce . . . to identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology to . . . strategic rivals and their proxies.” To achieve this goal and maintain the U.S. advantage in cutting-edge AI technology, the Trump administration will require both a thorough understanding of what export control authorities allied countries possess and the willingness to ask hard questions when it comes to their alignment with U.S. strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week before reaching a deal, US President Donald Trump said he wanted $500 billion worth of Ukraine’s critical minerals as compensation for having supported the country following the full-scale invasion by Russia in February 2022. The offer, then rejected by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky, was followed by threats to cut the country’s access to Starlink’s satellite communications system if it did not reach a deal. At the core of the US government’s pressure lays, among other things, its desire to diminish US dependency on the country that holds almost half of the world’s critical minerals reserves essential for tech development: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 12 days following the inauguration of Trump’s second presidency, the administration announced a fresh set of 10% tariffs on imports from China—shortly thereafter increased by an extra 10%. China followed with a retaliatory set of measures including antitrust probes into US tech companies, 10-15% tariffs on farm products, coal, crude oil and farm equipment, and expansion of export controls on critical minerals that are essential in producing everything from smartphones to F-35s and solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s latest rush to secure critical minerals in Ukraine, a country that currently does not produce them (despite having them) and cannot ensure easy access to them during an ongoing war, raises the question of how ready they are to deal with pressures from their trade war with China – particularly in realms of high technology. How quickly and effectively can they respond to, and anticipate changes to critical supply chains feeding key sectors such as defence and technology? How effective have US economic deterrence measures been to stop Chinese tech?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-response-a-full-spectrum-digital-competitor&quot;&gt;China’s Response: A Full-Spectrum Digital Competitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington is grappling with the fact that China has emerged as a full-spectrum digital competitor. It has a commanding position in the global manufacturing chain for digital goods and dominates the production and refinement of rare-earth materials and critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite attempts from the US to stop Chinese access to critical technologies in AI supply chains, both Chinese companies and the government have taken action to respond. DeepSeek’s R1 model release and low training cost has shown that China’s tech company ecosystem could become more quickly and effectively resilient to export controls than expected. After years of having Apple’s iOS and Android as the main operating systems in China, a homegrown one, Huawei’s HarmonyOS, is finally starting to capture a significant slice of the Chinese market, perhaps providing a basis for future internationalisation. Chinese companies have also sought to find other ways to secure access to high-end technologies, especially chips – either rushing to buy high-end chips prior to the enforcement of export controls and tariff or curbing restrictions to access NVIDIA-banned chips (A100 and H100) through a growing underground market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to even the recent past, the Chinese government is responding far more quickly and with more alacrity. Within days of US tariffs being announced by Trump, China swiftly announced expanded export controls on critical rare earths and minerals, and retaliatory tariffs on a range of US imports, including coal, oil and gas products, as well as large-engine cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore. Chinese regulators are taking targeted measures against US businesses as well: competition regulators have launched an investigation into Google’s Android operating system as well as into US chipmaker giant NVIDIA over violations of anti-monopoly laws, and are reportedly considering probing Apple’s App Store. Not only has China’s Ministry of Commerce added more companies to its Unreliable Entity List – a countersanctions tool established right after the US 2019 addition of Huawei to its own Entity List – but it is going beyond its previous, symbolic approach. Hitherto, all listed businesses were US defence companies with little or no business operations involving China anyway. Now, apparel conglomerate PVH and biotech company Illumina have been added to the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-limitations-of-us-economic-tech-deterrence&quot;&gt;The Limitations of US Economic Tech Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions tend to have two potential objectives: denying certain capabilities to their targets and deterring them from certain conduct. US tech sanctions against China have, over the past few years, expanded from merely targeting companies such as Huawei and ZTE to covering the entirety of the country, and from a relatively limited range of high-end semiconductors to an ever broader scope that by now has come to encompass sales and distribution channels, as well as equipment manufacturers in a range of third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether those sanctions will achieve their primary goal, of putting a hard ceiling on Chinese semiconductor development and thereby the country’s ability to progress in cutting-edge applications such as AI, is subject to vociferous debate. Huawei has been able to advance the development of its mobile phone chips in the absence of access to advanced manufacturing facilities and equipment, albeit more slowly and at greater cost. Despite the labelling of DeepSeek’s R1 as a national security risk and OpenAI’s reference to it having been trained by “distillation” practices, China has since mounted a nationwide push for adoption across local governments, public services and even private companies such as Tencent – which have deployed DeepSeek as part of the famous WeChat app. International companies are adopting the technology too: DeepSeek’s AI models are now available through Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any demonstration of competence from Chinese firms or government authorities often meets with the response that they must have been cheating one way or another, whether by stealing intellectual property, bending international trade rules or, in this case, smuggling semiconductors. There is, of course, justification for those assertions, but at the same time, both the determination of Chinese policymakers and the growing ability of scientists, researchers, engineers and businesspeople to succeed should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Biden and Trump administrations have pursued a policy of economic deterrence using different tools in the toolbox such as sanctions, export controls, tariffs, among others. To the extent that these tools are meant to deny, reroute, and contain Chinese tech prominence, the results are still quite limited. They seem even to have been counterproductive, in the sense that they have galvanized an ecosystem of Chinese businesses to finally come on board with policy initiatives to indigenize high-end technology capabilities. The emergence of DeepSeek is one illustration of this, as well as of another trend that merits attention: the constraints that China faces, including a relative shortage of funds and the aforementioned technology sanctions. These incentivise developers to explore alternative technological paths that, at least in the case of DeepSeek, have led to a product that is closely comparable to its American counterparts, but far more efficient in terms of inference and training costs. As seen in this case, constraints can enable efficiency and innovation in model training as much as disable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the policy level, technological progress is a key element of government’s policy, both to realise its development objectives at home, as to better compete and defend itself on the global stage against a United States that Beijing (not wholly unjustified) perceives to be fundamentally opposed to its attaining near-peer status. Attempts to deter China from those objectives will probably strengthen resolve to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-domestic-challenges&quot;&gt;US domestic challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, US decision makers must also start considering the growing ramifications of sanctions against China on their domestic politics, as their cost will increasingly start hitting home. TikTok provides an illustrative example: it is one of the most popular apps among the US population, a significant part of which is less concerned about great power politics. Spotting a political opportunity with that broader part of the US population, Donald Trump provided the company with a stay of execution, delaying the application of the law mandating its divestiture or ban for 75 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But TikTok is far from the only dossier with a domestic impact. Both Biden and Trump administration have sought to boost domestic AI supply chain production in the US to diminish reliance on China and other countries by boosting and relocating fabs domestically – but strategies have so far been incremental and with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former president Biden’s CHIPS Act sought to address Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing chokepoint by encouraging TSMC to relocate to Phoenix, Arizona, but has fallen short of its promises. Firstly, production costs will remain at least 50% higher when fabs open following substantial delays. Secondly, the lack of US workforce skills for chip manufacturing can endanger the pace and sustainability of TSMC US. Thirdly, in seeking to onshore to lower the risks of a semiconductor supply chain crisis in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the US also lowered the strategic protection that market concentration provides to Taiwan – as any small disruption to TSMC as a result of a China-driven blockade, for example, could be catastrophic for the global economy, including for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic chipmaking industry returns on investment will take longer than expected and there is a risk that Trump’s volatile policymaking can further slow the pace of AI supply chain economic growth and robustness. While, on the one hand, Trump recently announced Stargate – a $100 billion private joint venture led by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and others – to build AI infrastructure in Texas, on the other he has threatened to end the CHIPS Act after a massive onshoring effort of TSMC – who relies on the North American market for 70% of the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contradictory policies come at a time where the US might not be able to afford miscalculations in the AI competition. In 2022, the US represented less than 1% of the global fabrication capacity in advanced logic chip manufacturing. Even though there is an expectation of it growing up to 28% by 2032, the prospects look tricky. US chipmaker Intel Corp has been struggling to maintain its side of the bargain to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing after a drop in revenue in the fourth quarter and the abrupt departure of its CEO in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CTGxgou.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Trump’s overreliance on tariffs is a short-lived strategy that could further exacerbate the inflation and cost-of-living issues that did much to bring him back to the White House in the first place. Following tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, it is expected that the average middle class US household annual costs could rise anywhere from $2,500 to $3,900—something that is arguably not “America first”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the use of tariffs as a political tool since Trump’s first presidency has reflected on the fall China’s total share of total US imports – making it more prepared to endure additional tariffs and readapt supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, tariffs will continue to create disincentives for global supply chains and increase prices of goods in the U.S. Given that consumer electronics amount for 27% of China exports, the US will still be selective and potentially reluctant to target that sector. Moreover, as mentioned, diversification of imports away from China does not mean less exposure to Chinese industries. Since the early days of the trade war, in 2018, Chinese manufacturers have moved production lines to Vietnam – a country that has been largely benefitting from the rerouting of US imports – showing that derisking goes beyond reduction of direct reliance but also includes indirect reliance through other trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-ahead&quot;&gt;The road ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Trump’s hawkish approach to China persists, it might backfire or lose steam, if not backed by a well-calibrated assessment of the consequences domestically and internationally. In his previous administration, US pressure on EU member states concerning China led the bloc to name the country as a “systemic rival” back in 2019. Threats to impose tariffs on EU goods, and the US decision to initiate “peace talks” with Russia, have been far from well-received in Brussels. The regional bloc does not have a unified position on China, with some, such as Spain, favouring a pragmatic approach: “Europe must make its own decisions, and on its own. And we have to decide when China can be a partner and when China is a competitor”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the key problem of the US deterrence strategy against China’s emergence as a tech power is that it is maximalist, and therefore unattainable. It includes objectives such as preventing harmful uses of technologies, but also capping China’s further economic growth potential. As China itself faces a critical juncture in its development path, it will double down on technological innovation as an engine for future prosperity. It may be difficult for people who spent their entire careers in the post-Cold War environment to accept, but it seems the notion of US primacy in the technological field is impossible to sustain. The practical point here is that economic deterrence is not a silver bullet nor a sustainable long-term strategy domestically or internationally if not followed by other actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, Washington must accept the existence of China as a near-peer power. Isolating it can only increase its independence form US-linked tech supply chains (or move towards indirect dependence) and stimulate China to work towards a more effective strategy with Global South countries as done in infrastructure development through the Belt and Road Initiative, for example. As argued by Australia’s former cyber and tech Ambassador, if China “redefines cost structures by offering AI at a fraction of Western subscription costs” then DeepSeek and the likes will disrupt AI business models and market expectations. In other words, the goal of US technology policy should not be to deny technology wholesale, but to recognise that technology will be diffused anyway, calibrate long-term economic deterrence expectations, and to collaborate in curbing harmful uses of some of these technologies – especially the average consumer-facing AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

This report outlines how the United States and its partners can confront China’s dual-use shipyards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s shipbuilding sector has undergone a striking metamorphosis. Twenty years ago, the country was a peripheral player in the global shipyard business. Today, it dominates the industry. At the heart of this transformation is the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), the world’s biggest shipbuilding group. The firm built more commercial vessels by tonnage in 2024 than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has built since the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC’s reach extends beyond powering global commerce. It is also the driving force behind China’s bid for a “world-class navy” that is increasingly capable of projecting power farther from China’s shores. Over the past two decades, CSSC has churned out advanced warships at an alarming clip, upgrading the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) from a modest coastal force into a regional juggernaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating under the firm grip of China’s top political leadership, CSSC has become a poster child of Beijing’s “military-civil fusion” (MCF, 军民融合) strategy, which seeks to eliminate barriers between the country’s commercial and defense sectors. Driven by this initiative, CSSC has deliberately blurred the lines between its commercial and military shipbuilding operations, leveraging its extensive commercial network to support China’s naval modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much attention has been paid to how MCF has helped upgrade China’s military, there has been considerably less focus on the ways that companies located outside of China are supporting its defense industrial ecosystem. China’s deliberately opaque dual-use shipbuilding network makes it hard for foreign companies to gauge how their ship orders, technology transfer, and other activities ultimately bolster China’s military development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report demystifies the intricacies of China’s shipbuilding ecosystem, offering U.S. policymakers, business leaders, and other stakeholders a clearer perspective on the strategic challenges it poses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tiered-risk-system-assessing-the-dual-use-threat&quot;&gt;The Tiered Risk System: Assessing the Dual-Use Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CSIS report explores the close ties between commercial and military shipbuilding in China, focusing in particular on the role that foreign firms are inadvertently playing in facilitating the expansion and modernization of the PLAN. Utilizing data accessed through intelligence platforms S&amp;amp;P Global and Datenna, as well as satellite imagery and other open-source materials, this study categorizes each of the 307 Chinese shipyards active from 2019 to 2024 into four tiers that reflect their degree of integration with the country’s military industrial ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 1 (Very High Risk): CSSC-owned shipyards known to produce warships for China’s navy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 2 (High Risk): CSSC-owned shipyards that build commercial ships but maintain close ties to military projects, personnel, and state funding mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 3 (Moderate Risk): Shipyards owned by other state firms besides CSSC, which can be mobilized to support national security needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tier 4 (Lower Risk): Private or foreign-owned shipyards that have limited documented military involvement but are subject to China’s regulatory and political control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tiered categorization clarifies how commercial shipbuilding is distributed across China. While all Chinese shipyards operate under state directives, those in higher tiers demonstrate closer ties to the country’s military and national security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WXSIYwC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Tiered Breakdown of China’s Shipbuilding Industry, 2019–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis reveals that a disproportionate share of China’s commercial shipbuilding occurs at shipyards that are closely intertwined with the country’s sprawling defense industrial base. Tier-1 and Tier-2 yards represent just 15 percent of active shipyards in China but produce a striking 40 percent of its total commercial output by tonnage. Private shipyards, although far more numerous, combine for just 36 percent of the country’s commercial production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyers are responsible for the vast majority of shipbuilding production across China’s industry, but especially at Tier-1 and Tier-2 yards. Over 75 percent of the production at these shipyards was destined for firms based outside of China or Hong Kong. This includes U.S. military allies like Denmark, France, Greece, Japan, and South Korea, as well as other partners like Qatar, Singapore, Switzerland, and—most strikingly—Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By purchasing vessels from these yards, foreign firms have funneled billions of dollars of revenue into entities that are central to China’s naval modernization. Given the substantial overlap in material inputs, production techniques, personnel, and infrastructure required for both commercial and military shipbuilding, commercial revenues effectively subsidize China’s naval expansion. By offsetting fixed costs, these earnings enable Chinese shipyards to scale military production more efficiently and at lower marginal expense. Even when military and commercial production is not co-located, the shared ownership structures between many of the leading commercial and military shipyards enables assets and processes to be easily transferred across the civil-military divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign firms have also provided China’s defense contractors with key dual-use shipbuilding technology through joint ventures, licensing agreements, and direct purchases. These transfers have been essential to enabling the PLAN to overcome important technical hurdles in areas like marine propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s key naval shipbuilders continue to benefit from access to financial markets in the United States and its allies. Foreign capital flows, including from U.S. institutional investors, help fund CSSC and its subsidiaries despite their central role in China’s military industrial ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-risks-and-global-implications&quot;&gt;Strategic Risks and Global Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing dominance in global shipbuilding presents critical economic and national security challenges for the United States and its allies. The country’s rapid naval expansion, enabled by its dual-use shipbuilding model, is closing the gap with U.S. naval forces. The PLAN now fields more warships than the U.S. Navy and is on track to deploy a 425-ship fleet by 2030, sustained by an industrial base capable of replacing and repairing vessels far faster than U.S. yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economically, China’s industrial policies are marginalizing U.S. and allied shipbuilding industries. Japan and South Korea, once dominant, are losing market share, even in advanced sectors like liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker production. European shipbuilders also face growing competition as China expands into high-value markets like cruise ships. The U.S. commercial shipbuilding sector has been nearly eliminated, with its market share falling to just 0.11 percent of the global total in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bmerPy3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Global Commercial Shipbuilding in 2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ calculations; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The erosion of U.S. and allied shipbuilding capabilities poses an urgent threat to military readiness, reduces economic opportunities, and contributes to China’s global power-projection ambitions. Addressing these disparities is essential not only for military deterrence but also for maintaining economic and strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time to act is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s naval buildup and its commercial shipbuilding dominance are not distinct challenges. Policy measures to address these threats must simultaneously factor in both the economic and security dimensions. Policymakers must balance both short-term responses and long-term strategy, addressing immediate security concerns while anticipating the broader implications of China’s expanding military-industrial reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, Washington needs to take actions—along with its partners and allies—to level the playing field and disrupt China’s murky dual-use ecosystem. In the long term, the United States needs to invest in expanding shipbuilding capacity outside of China by rebuilding U.S. industry and by leveraging the existing strengths of key like-minded nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report offers concrete policy recommendations to achieve these objectives. They are summarized below, with more detailed recommendations located at the end of the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impose scalable docking fees on global shipping companies operating Chinese-built vessels. Work is already underway in Washington to devise a scheme to impose docking fees on Chinese-made vessels when they call at port in the United States. The authors recommend tailoring those fees so that they impose higher costs on purchasing ships from the most concerning shipyards, such as Tier-1 and Tier-2 shipyards. Taking a weighted approach would allow for more effectively targeting China’s shipbuilding ecosystem to achieve not just economic objectives but also national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sever remaining U.S. financial and business ties with CSSC and its subsidiaries. The U.S. government has already blacklisted CSSC, but there are still loose ends to tie up. Tightening financial restrictions would better prevent U.S. capital and technology from supporting China’s naval expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monitor Chinese shipyards and remain flexible in enforcing actions. China’s shipbuilding ecosystem is opaque, and private firms can be co-opted for military purposes. Some shipyards may shift production strategies to bypass measures, necessitating a flexible enforcement approach. Ongoing industry and intelligence assessments will help ensure U.S. measures remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use targeted diplomacy to encourage other countries to limit ties with China’s dual-use shipyards. Many non-U.S. companies rely on Chinese shipbuilding, making global coordination crucial. Targeted measures—rather than blanket bans—will make it easier to secure allies’ buy-in. Diplomatic efforts should emphasize the shared risks of supporting shipyards tied to China’s military ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make targeted investments in long-term shipbuilding capacity in the United States. Docking fees and other measures can help raise funds to reinvest into U.S. shipbuilding capacity. Policymakers should maintain realistic expectations for the short term, but targeted investments can help set the foundation to build a minimum shipbuilding capacity needed to meet national security and strategic requirements. Strengthening domestic capacity will also create high-skilled jobs and bolster national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attract foreign investments into the U.S. shipbuilding industry. Washington should encourage and incentivize key global players—especially South Korea and Japan—to invest in U.S. shipbuilders. Policymakers should also look for investments from European companies that are global leaders in high-tech areas of the shipbuilding industry. As Washington courts investments, it should offer reciprocal investments in other areas as an incentive and strengthen economic and security ties with key partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinate with partners to build additional shipbuilding capacity outside of China. Given U.S. constraints, reducing China’s dominance in global markets will require friendshoring. Shipyards in Japan, South Korea, and Europe can be strengthened through coordinated investment and policy incentives. Prioritizing emerging technologies—such as clean energy vessels—may provide opportunities to compete with China more effectively in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-approach-to-shipbuilding&quot;&gt;China’s Strategic Approach to Shipbuilding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generations of Chinese leaders have prioritized shipbuilding as a foundational pillar of economic and military power. The industry has benefited from decades of state support and industrial policy, initially focused on spurring economic development and modernization. As China’s geopolitical environment has evolved, however, the strategic and security dimensions of shipbuilding have come to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Xi Jinping’s ascent to power in 2012, Beijing has accelerated efforts to transform China into a “strong maritime power” (海洋强国). This concept encompasses not only naval power but also economic influence, scientific discovery, and technological innovation in the maritime domain. Under Xi, the shipbuilding sector has been directed decisively toward serving national objectives, producing a fundamental shift in the global market in favor of Chinese shipbuilders—many of which play a key role in China’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-civil-fusion&quot;&gt;Military-Civil Fusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meteoric rise of China’s commercial shipbuilding industry is closely tied to the relentless pace of its military modernization. Rather than establishing firewalls between civilian and military production, China has actively sought to integrate these activities. This aligns with China’s military-civil fusion (MCF, 军民融合) strategy, a national strategy elevated and spearheaded by Xi Jinping to fuse together the country’s national security and economic development policies to simultaneously level up the defense industry and broader economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maximizing the overlap between commercial and military production through MCF provides a key channel for the exchange of resources, technology, and personnel between sectors. China’s 13th Five-Year Plan for the Development of Strategic Emerging Industries highlights “military-civilian common standardization projects [that] promote two-way transfer of military-civilian technology.” The prominent role of sprawling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in strategic industries further facilitates this process, as it consolidates commercial operations, research and development, and military production under direct government control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, shipbuilding has emerged as a poster child of MCF in action. Policies such as the 2015 Technical Standards for New Civilian Ships to Implement National Defense Requirements intentionally blur the lines between military and civilian production by requiring civilian vessels built for China’s commercial fleet to conform to military specifications. In 2017, Xi established the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development and elevated MCF to a national strategy. At the commission’s opening plenary session, he called for the country “to make military-civilian integration better and faster,” and sea power topped the list of priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Beijing’s MCF ambitions in shipbuilding lies the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), an expansive conglomerate of shipyards, factories, and research institutes overseen by China’s top political and military leadership. CSSC is the world’s largest shipbuilding group, and in 2024 alone, it produced more commercial vessels by tonnage than the United States has since World War II. Yet, the company is also responsible for building warships for the ever-expanding People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), which is rapidly amassing the world’s largest fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China State Shipbuilding Corporation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is the world’s largest shipbuilding conglomerate by both revenue and market share. It boasts 84 subsidiaries and employs over 200,000 people across shipbuilding, marine engineering, research and development, and various other portfolios. The firm calls itself the “main force” in developing China’s naval forces, and “undertakes the scientific research and production tasks of all the main combat equipment of the Chinese Navy.” Similar to U.S. firms like Boeing or Lockheed Martin, it is a major defense contractor with significant commercial operations. However, CSSC has fewer lines separating its commercial and military operations, creating inherent risks for companies seeking to do business without inadvertently contributing to China’s military development. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed 25 CSSC subsidiaries on its Entity List, restricting the transfer U.S. technology to those entities. In 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury added the company to its Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, restricting certain financial transactions with the firm.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior executives at China’s leading shipbuilders have openly embraced the push to integrate commercial and military production. In 2017, Hu Wenming, then-chairman of CSSC, described Xi’s MCF drive as a “mobilization order” to accelerate fusing the civilian and military sectors. Hu Keyi, chief engineer at CSSC’s Jiangnan Shipyard and a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, urged the industry to “focus on the transfer of civilian technology to military technology, especially the transfer of shipyard civil shipbuilding methods.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCF offers China’s commercial shipbuilders a significant competitive advantage in global markets. The shipbuilding industry is prone to volatile boom-and-bust cycles driven by shifts in international trade flows. After the 2007–08 global financial crisis, for instance, many shipyards worldwide faced severe downturns and closures. During such rough patches, Chinese shipyards benefited from counter-cyclical investments through naval contracts. This practice continues today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a direct comparison between commercial and military vessels is difficult due to their differing labor and material requirements, one reliable estimate suggests that a single aircraft carrier can generate as much work for a shipyard as 10 bulk carriers or supertankers. In fact, the difference may be even more stark. Unofficial estimates put the cost of China’s third aircraft carrier a roughly $6–$8 billion compared to the $130–$140 million price tag for a new supertanker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This steady demand has enabled Chinese shipyards to maintain high capacity levels, allowing them to ramp up production quickly when commercial markets rebound—unlike many of their foreign competitors, which are often forced to downsize or exit the industry entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Integrated Civilian and Military Production Visible at Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base and Longxue Island Shipbuilding Base&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it ranks among the world’s leading defense contractors, CSSC generates a uniquely large share of its revenue from civilian production (see Figure 1). In 2023, just 23 percent of CSSC’s revenue came from defense, well below the global average of 56 percent for major defense firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Boeing, one of the world’s leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, depends on defense for over 40 percent of its revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Boeing, which largely separates its defense and commercial business units, CSSC can readily redirect its commercial revenue toward bolstering naval production. In 2016, an entity within CSSC transferred the assets of one of its most prolific commercial shipyards, Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Heavy Industry, to Wuchang Shipbuilding, another subsidiary shipyard that builds warships, particularly submarines, for the PLAN. A spokesperson for the company stated that “the integration (of Qingdao and Wuchang) will have complementary advantages. The new shipyard will be capable of producing not only military ships, including the next-generation frigates and amphibious warfare ships, but a wide range of commercial ships.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCF in shipbuilding has been further accelerated by state-driven consolidation efforts. In 2019, Beijing orchestrated a merger between CSSC and its largest domestic rival, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), which had been separated since 1999. The merger placed the two giants’ dual-use shipyards, as well as nearly 100 subsidiaries and research institutes, under one corporate umbrella. This has helped further streamline financing, technology sharing, and personnel transfers across civilian and military lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At major shipbuilding hubs—such as Changxing Island in Shanghai, Longxue in Guangzhou, and facilities in Dalian—commercial and naval production lines have been increasingly co-located, further reducing barriers between merchant and military shipbuilding across China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that state-directed consolidation, coupled with the prioritization of military demands, can stifle competition and impede transparency. This has facilitated systemic corruption in China, exemplified by the high-profile fall from grace of former CSSC Chairman Hu Wenming. In 2023, Hu was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his role in a graft scandal in which the state alleged he received $8.4 million of personal kickbacks. Hu’s conviction followed a 12-year sentencing of another shipbuilding executive, Sun Bo, who was imprisoned several years earlier for accepting millions of yuan worth of bribes during his tenure. Such corruption inflates costs and can slow technological progress as resources are diverted toward personal gain or politically directed projects rather than market-driven innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, Beijing’s continued promotion of MCF reflects the leadership’s confidence in the approach. Xi Jinping’s ongoing, far-reaching anti-corruption campaign, which targets top figures in the military and defense industrial base, suggests that Xi and the Chinese Communist Party are confident they can combat corruption while still driving forward MCF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beijings-policy-push&quot;&gt;Beijing’s Policy Push&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s emergence as a global shipbuilding powerhouse gained momentum in the early 2000s, driven by major policy shifts. Recognizing that the rapid growth of containerized maritime trade would be a boon for global shipbuilders, Beijing began developing ambitious plans to position Chinese firms at the forefront of the industry. In 2002, Zhu Rongji, China’s premier and chief economic architect at the time, visited the headquarters of CSSC, where he declared that China would seek “to become the largest shipbuilding country . . . by 2015.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year, the State Council published the Outline for the Maritime Economy Development, which laid the groundwork for three major shipbuilding industrial clusters in Bohai, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. These regions remain the powerhouses of the country’s shipbuilding output today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bR14k1k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Selected Chinese Shipbuilding Policies, 2000–2020.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2003, China has issued at least 25 national-level plans involving the shipbuilding sector. Each successive Five-Year Plan, widely regarded as the government’s principal economic blueprint, has included directives to bolster shipbuilding. China’s influential Made in China 2025 plan also designated shipbuilding as a strategic priority. An array of lower-level sectoral guidance and implementation documents published by various ministries and party organs sets specific development benchmarks and outlines policy support measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surge in policy attention has translated into a wellspring of financial and regulatory support for China’s shipbuilders. Recent academic estimates suggest that between 2006 and 2013, government subsidies for shipbuilding totaled $91 billion, accounting for a startling 46 percent of the industry’s total revenue during that period. These measures directly increased China’s global market share by an estimated 42 percent, predominately at the expense of shipbuilders in South Korea and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct state support continued through the 2010s, even as the global shipbuilding market suffered a significant downturn following the 2007–08 global financial crisis. Research by CSIS estimates that from 2010 to 2018, China’s government provided at least $132 billion to the shipbuilding and shipping industries, predominantly through preferential financing from state banks. Massive subsidies funneled into China’s steel industry helped artificially suppress the cost of steel plates, a critical input that accounts for as much as a quarter of shipbuilding costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshaping-market-forces&quot;&gt;Reshaping Market Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, China’s ability to leverage its massive scale and industrial capacity to manipulate global markets fundamentally reshaped the shipbuilding industry. Having produced less than 5 percent of the world’s tonnage in 2000, Chinese shipyards today account for more than half of total commercial production. Formerly dominant Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders have experienced declining production since 2011 as shippers from around the world place more orders with Chinese yards to upgrade their fleets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I8fA8K0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shifts began at the turn of the twenty-first century, when policy signals from China’s central government kicked off a surge of entrants into the industry. Between 2000 and 2010, hundreds of new shipyards sprung up across China, attracted by booming global demand and generous government subsidies. Data from S&amp;amp;P reveals that the decade saw the number of active shipyards in China explode from 46 to 296. Production rose even more dramatically, with annual output jumping by over 3,700 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This frenetic production quickly outpaced global demand, leading to substantial overcapacity worldwide. The influx of low-cost Chinese vessels drove down prices and eroded industry profits, forcing many competitors to scale back or exit the market. Japan and South Korea, both industry leaders in 2000, saw their share of global shipbuilding output rapidly fall as Chinese shipyards clamored to ramp up operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/paANBKB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Share of Global Commercial Shipbuilding Production, 2000–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global financial crisis of 2007–08 proved to be another massive shock to the industry. As global trade faltered and demand for new shipping vessels fell, orderbooks in shipyards worldwide dried up. Global shipbuilding production peaked in 2011 before falling dramatically as order backlogs cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China’s budding industry, this sudden collapse in demand was an existential challenge. Production in the country was dispersed across hundreds of small, inefficient shipyards that had few tools to weather the crisis, making them highly vulnerable to unexpected demand shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent the industry’s collapse, China’s State Council imposed a moratorium on new shipbuilding firms and launched a series of measures to spur consolidation. Preference was given to larger shipyards that could benefit from economies of scale and more efficiently allocate central funding. Most notably, the government channeled resources to companies included on a “White List” of handpicked shipyards. Initially comprising 51 (mostly state-owned) companies in 2014, the list grew to 70 by 2019. These yards received directives to increase investment and production, even though global demand remained sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surviving shipyards were, on average, larger, more efficient, and more likely to be backed by the state. They were also more globally competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/T2CxY1q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Chinese Shipyards by Number and Output, 2000–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidation efforts culminated in the 2019 merger of CSSC and CSIC, creating by far the largest shipbuilding group in the world. The new behemoth oversaw $120 billion of assets after its merger, dwarfing the $33 billion owned by its main rival, South Korean builder Hyundai Heavy Industries, which had just executed its own merger with a major domestic competitor. Hyundai Heavy’s chief executive at the time remarked that the industry was “consolidating to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of these policies, authorities also began to push shipyards to expand into higher-end segments of the shipbuilding market such as LNG tankers, cruise ships, chemical carriers, and roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) car-carrying vessels. These more complex vessels had historically been dominated by technologically superior South Korean, Japanese, and European shipyards. Their higher profit margins contrast with the relatively simple bulk carriers that formed the lion’s share of China’s early output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, China’s use of state-driven industrial policy to stabilize its industry, reduce overcapacity, consolidate production, and ascend the value chain was often a blunt force that created significant waste and inefficiency. Yet when measured against the strategic goal of wresting market share from global leaders, it has proven ruthlessly effective. Other major industrial powers such as Japan, South Korea, and the United States have also provided significant government support and protection to their own shipbuilders but still have failed to keep pace with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s hold over the global shipbuilding market is poised to deepen over the next decade. As of January 2025, it held roughly 62 percent of the global orderbook for merchant vessels through 2033. This includes over 80 percent of orders for new containerships and 30 percent of orders for LNG carriers. If these trends continue, a substantial majority of the world’s merchant fleet put to sea in the coming years will be built in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rise-of-the-plan&quot;&gt;The Rise of the PLAN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s commercial shipbuilding industry was racing past its rivals, the country was also undertaking a breakneck expansion and modernization of its naval forces. In just 30 years, the PLAN has evolved from a modest regional force into the world’s largest navy by number of vessels, surpassing even the U.S. Navy. As of 2022, the PLAN operated a battle force fleet of 351 ships, compared to the U.S. Navy’s 294.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of naval shipbuilding at China’s key shipyards has been astounding. The growing shipbuilding base at Shanghai’s Changxing Island alone has churned out not just large cruisers and destroyers but even bigger vessels. The expansive facilities there are nearly finished constructing China’s third aircraft carrier as well as the first of an all-new class of drone-carrying amphibious assault ships—the largest of its kind in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the north, the storied Dalian Shipyard refitted and built China’s first two aircraft carriers, along with several other surface combatants, and the nearby Bohai Shipyard has produced a growing fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. All of these—and other warship builders—are owned by the state-owned defense giant CSSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QfM35eD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new assets have transformed the PLAN into a veritable “blue water navy” capable of projecting power farther from China’s shores. Chinese naval doctrine is evolving accordingly. The country’s 2019 defense white paper asserted that it was “speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas,” reflecting an expanding vision of power projection toward a globally capable force. In its 2024 report about China’s military power, the U.S. Department of Defense assessed that China’s naval modernization efforts are aligned “with [its] growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands for the PLAN to operate at greater distances from mainland China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QWErpn0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: PLAN Fleet Composition.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: O’Rourke, China Naval Modernization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s naval buildup is part of a much broader military modernization project. In the medium and long term, Chinese leaders have set their sights on “basically complet[ing] national defense and military modernization by 2035” and possessing a “world-class military by mid-century.” Achieving these goals would both afford Beijing much greater military capability to achieve its broader ambition of pushing the United States farther from China’s periphery and strengthen China’s hand with respect to key contested issues like control over Taiwan and the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demystifying-chinas-dual-use-shipbuilding-network&quot;&gt;Demystifying China’s Dual-Use Shipbuilding Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the global shipbuilding industry becomes increasingly dependent on China’s shipyards, it is essential to scrutinize how these commercial relationships fuel the rapid expansion of the Chinese navy. The integration between China’s commercial shipyards and its military industrial complex is deliberately opaque, with political elites and business leaders often masking the extent of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some shipyards openly engage in both naval and commercial production, others maintain ambiguous or indirect ties to military entities, and still others appear to have no defense involvement at all. This deliberate lack of transparency complicates efforts to fully assess the national security implications of China’s dominance in global shipbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify this risk landscape, CSIS compiled a comprehensive dataset of 307 Chinese shipyards active between 2019 and 2024. Drawing from data accessed through two intelligence platforms, S&amp;amp;P Global and Datenna, as well as open-source Chinese-language material, this study classifies each Chinese shipyard into one of four tiers based on its level of integration with the country’s defense industrial base and broader national security enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mJv0Ml5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: Tiered Categorization System.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 1: KNOWN NAVAL CONTRACTORS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tier includes 12 CSSC-owned shipyards that are responsible for constructing virtually all of China’s modern naval fleet. However, several are also commercial shipbuilding powerhouses. While there are only a dozen Tier-1 shipyards in China, representing a small fraction of the hundreds of shipyards spread across the country, they produce over 17 percent of China’s annual commercial output by tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of activity at some of these shipyards is mind boggling, with their production lines rapidly churning out some of the largest and most advanced merchant hulls in the world. On average, the vessels produced at these shipyards are nearly twice as large as those constructed elsewhere in the country, underscoring their outsized importance in China’s shipbuilding industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to their foundational role in China’s naval modernization, Tier-1 shipyards receive substantial state funding and contracts, ensuring a steady stream of resources to fuel rapid production. These dual-use facilities blur the line between commercial and military activity, leveraging their infrastructure and output to accelerate naval production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lion’s share of Tier-1 shipyard production occurs at just four shipbuilding epicenters: Dalian, Guangzhou, Jiangnan, and Hudong-Zhonghua (the latter two of which are now co-located on Changxing Island). These shipyards rank among the most prolific in the world, excelling in both naval and commercial production. Between 2019 and 2023, these four facilities launched at least 39 warships, totaling over 550,000 tons of displacement—equivalent to a fleet larger than the United Kingdom’s entire Royal Navy. Among these vessels are some of the largest and most sophisticated in the PLAN’s arsenal. During the same period, these shipyards also produced an astounding 19 million gross tons (GT) of commercial vessels, a figure that rivals the annual output of South Korea, the world’s second-largest shipbuilding nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/O7F42cd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: Average Ship Size (GT).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dual-focus production model underscores the immense capacity and versatility of Tier-1 shipyards, where commercial and naval production occur in tandem. The opaque nature of these operations allows these shipyards to attract foreign clients who inadvertently pour billions of dollars into commercial ship orders that are often constructed alongside advanced surface combatants for the PLAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2019 and 2024, upwards of 72 percent of the commercial output of Tier-1 shipyards was destined for foreign buyers. Top purchasers included firms from Singapore, a critical U.S. defense partner in the Indo-Pacific, and Switzerland, a U.S. treaty ally, which together accounted for 34 percent of Tier-1 exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ANqe82A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 10: PLAN Warships Built Alongside Merchant Vessels at Tier-1 Shipyards (See Appendix for Additional Imagery)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s position as a top client of China’s naval shipyards is particularly striking, given the direct threat the PLAN’s rapid expansion poses to the island’s security. Evergreen Marine Corporation, one of the world’s largest shipping companies and a cornerstone of Taiwan’s economy, has invested heavily in expanding and upgrading its container fleet. Many of these orders have gone to Tier-1 shipyards like Hudong-Zhonghua and Jiangnan—the same facilities producing warships explicitly designed to support the PLAN in conducting amphibious assaults or other military operations across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cQsCJNt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: Top Buyers from Chinese Tier-1 Shipyards, 2019–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS calculations reveal that fully 15 percent of Evergreen’s current active fleet was built at Tier-1 shipyards, with more on order. The symbolism of Evergreen’s distinctive green hulls built just beside the PLAN’s Fujian aircraft carrier—named for the province from which China would launch an invasion of Taiwan—is eye-catching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even two U.S.-based companies, Pangaea Logistics Solutions and Seabulk Fleet Management, acquired six hulls from these shipyards during the period investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that these companies, and many others that buy vessels from China, are simply responding to market incentives. Thanks in part to subsidies and other state support, China’s shipyards are often able to deliver high-quality vessels faster and at lower costs than competitors, making them a preferred supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, governments should balance the potential benefits of cost savings with the risk of contributing to China’s naval development. Many of these firms are based in economies that have signaled concern over China’s rapid military modernization and assertive foreign policy, like Taiwan or Japan, creating a misalignment of market incentives and strategic interests. Even for countries like Greece or Switzerland, which are home to major global shipping firms and face little immediate threat from China’s military expansion, Beijing’s track record of coercive behavior should raise eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 2: CSSC COMMERCIAL SHIPYARDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category comprises shipyards fully or partially owned by CSSC but not clearly identifiable as producers of warships. There are 23 shipyards in Tier 2. Among them are some of China’s most productive commercial shipbuilders, including Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding and Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding HI. Together, Tier-2 shipyards account for approximately 24 percent of China’s annual commercial ship production by tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While CSIS found no direct evidence of naval production at these facilities, they remain strategically significant due to their ties to CSSC. These shipyards may still provide dual-use technologies, build components or modules, and transfer personnel or expertise to Tier-1 yards. They also benefit from CSSC’s access to state financing and industrial policy support, raising questions about their indirect contributions to China’s naval modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not building naval vessels directly, Tier-2 shipyards are structurally tied to China’s defense industrial base through their affiliation with CSSC. For example, the Shanghai Waigaoqiao shipyard openly acknowledges on its website that it has undertaken research projects for military entities such as the State Administration for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (formerly the Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense) and CSIC. This dual-use potential, combined with access to state resources, underscores the latent risks associated with Tier-2 shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, Tier-2 shipyards are co-located with Tier-1 yards, further complicating the distinction among CSSC entities. For example, two major Tier-2 shipbuilders, Shanghai Jiangnan Changxing Shipbuilding and Shanghai Jiangnan Changxing Heavy Industry, are located alongside the Tier-1 Jiangnan Shipyard and Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard on the massive Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base in Shanghai. Similarly, in the country’s south, several Tier-2 yards are based within the Longxue Shipbuilding Base in Guangzhou, home to naval shipbuilders Guangzhou International Shipbuilding and Huangpu Wenchong Changzhou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aQL8krC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5: Top Buyers from Tier-2 Shipyards, 2019–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier-2 shipyards have also swept up billions of dollars in contracts from foreign buyers seeking to upgrade their commercial fleets, despite their physical proximity and organizational integration with China’s naval industrial base. These close ties have done little to deter international clients, who purchased over three-quarters of the total production at Tier-2 shipyards—the highest share among all four tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top customers have included major shipping companies from France and Singapore, as well as other shipping heavyweights, such as Germany and Greece. This strong international demand highlights the global reliance on these facilities, even as their strategic ties to China’s defense industry raises critical security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 3: OTHER STATE-OWNED SHIPYARDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipyards in this tier are fully or partially owned by state-owned enterprises other than CSSC, such as COSCO and China Merchants Group, or by provincial governments like Jiangsu or Fujian. They may play supporting roles in supporting MCF by supplying equipment or materials, but their primary portfolios center on commercial production. Although not directly linked to China’s military industrial ecosystem, they remain important conduits for state-led economic and technological initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 41 active Tier-3 shipyards account for approximately 23 percent of China’s commercial ship production. However, the average size of vessels built in Tier-3 shipyards is significantly smaller than those produced in Tier-1 and Tier-2 facilities. This disparity highlights the comparatively smaller scale and limited capabilities of Tier-3 yards, especially when contrasted with the massive CSSC shipyards, which are capable of constructing vessels exceeding 200,000 GT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier-3 shipyards generally represent a lower—but not absent—risk of integration with China’s military production ecosystem compared with Tier-1 and Tier-2 yards. State ownership means that these companies are directly managed by central government authorities through the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC). SASAC’s primary responsibility is ensuring that state capital is channeled according to national strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it chose to, Beijing would have considerable latitude to leverage the capacity and assets of any state-owned shipyards for military or broader security purposes. For example, in a wartime scenario, Chinese authorities would face few obstacles to mobilizing these shipyards to build, repair, or service its naval forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, at present, Tier-3 yards are physically and organizationally detached from military production, meaning Beijing cannot as easily leverage their capacity for dual-use purposes. The lack of necessary infrastructure, cleared personnel, and security requirements at these shipyards could raise the costs of tasking them with sensitive military projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyers represent a considerably lower share of production at Tier-3 shipyards than their counterparts in Tiers 1 and 2, with 58 percent of production at these yards being ordered by overseas firms. Notably, Japan is a leading foreign buyer of vessels built in Tier-3 shipyards, despite having its own strong domestic shipbuilding industry. This underscores the difficulty Japanese shipyards face in competing with lower-cost ships built by Chinese state-owned entities, compounded by capacity limitations within Japan’s own domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TIER 4: PRIVATE OR FOREIGN-OWNED SHIPYARDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These yards are majority-owned by private Chinese companies or by corporations headquartered outside mainland China or Hong Kong. They primarily focus on commercial shipbuilding and generally have limited or no direct involvement in defense-related activities. Informal or indirect ties to China’s military industrial ecosystem remain possible through joint ventures, component sourcing and procurement, or technology transfers, but are far less robust than at higher tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tier-4 shipyards comprise the largest group of Chinese shipbuilders by both number and share of production. These 210 privately-owned yards together account for 36 percent of China’s annual commercial production. Many are small firms focused on niche sectors of the market, like refrigerated cargo carriers and passenger ships. Yet, several are highly prolific, boasting sophisticated operations that rival or even surpass the production of CSSC’s largest shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ySBAMFE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 7: Top Buyers from Tier-4 Shipyards, 2019–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research; and S&amp;amp;P Global Sea-web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two largest Tier-4 shipyards, New Times Shipbuilding Co. and Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding, rank first and third, respectively, in production among all Chinese shipyards. Together, these two behemoths account for 15 percent of China’s total production. Both firms are investing millions of dollars into expanding capacity to keep pace with demand, including in state-of-the-art shipbuilding production technologies, such as smart manufacturing and energy efficient construction techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding is one of the few major Tier-4 shipyards owned by a company listed outside of China. The yard is owned by Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Group, a Singapore-listed enterprise that also controls two other Chinese shipyards, Jiangsu Yangzi Xinfu Shipbuilding and Jiangsu Yangzi-Mitsui Shipbuilding. Other foreign owners of Tier-4 shipyards include major Asian manufacturers, including South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries and Japan’s Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While large, foreign-owned shipyards have a degree of separation from the Chinese government, private ownership alone should not shield these yards from scrutiny. Ultimately, private Chinese companies are still subject to state regulations and oversight, including laws that mandate cooperation with national security objectives when requested. Private companies are also often under the state’s indirect influence through partial ownership by the central or local governments, and many firms have internal party committees, which allow the Chinese Communist Party to influence corporate decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one infamous example of risk at Tier-4 shipyards, the privately owned Fujian Yihe shipyard was named in a 2021 UN Security Council report for violating international sanctions by helping to obscure the identity of a ship after it engaged in illicit trade with North Korean vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Tier-4 yards openly promote their ties to Chinese entities involved in military activities. Jiangsu Huatai Shipbuilding Co., for example, claims to have established technical cooperation partnerships with several CSSC research institutes known to support military projects. Another private yard, Jianglong Shipbuilding Co., reports that it builds vessels for quasi-military Chinese entities like the Chinese Coast Guard and the Ministry of Public Security. These cases reflect the fluidity of China’s shipbuilding ecosystem and underscore the need for greater transparency into how private shipyards interact with the country’s sprawling security state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign buyers account for nearly 70 percent of the production at Tier-4 yards (see t. Notably, the two largest private shipyards mentioned above—New Times Shipbuilding and Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding—were responsible for nearly half (46 percent) of the output contracted by foreign buyers among all Tier-4 shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;KEY TAKEAWAYS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reveal key insights about China’s shipbuilding industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privately owned yards dominate in numbers, but not capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; While 74 percent of the 307 surveyed shipyards are privately owned, production capacity is heavily dominated by state-backed enterprises. The 81 shipyards in Tiers 1, 2, and 3 collectively account for more than 64 percent of commercial output by tonnage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry consolidation drives output.&lt;/strong&gt; Half of China’s total shipbuilding output since 2019 has come from just 10 shipyards. New Times Shipbuilding, China’s top-producing privately owned yard, produced more tonnage than all of Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand combined. Still, only three of China’s top 10 shipbuilders are privately owned, while 5 are CSSC subsidiaries—including 3 Tier-1 yards that also construct warships for the PLAN.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overseas buyers dominate demand.&lt;/strong&gt; Foreign companies headquartered outside China or Hong Kong accounted for nearly 70 percent of the commercial tonnage built in China between 2019 and 2024. Major buyers included countries such as Singapore, Greece, Switzerland, and Japan, home to leading global shipping companies with increasing demand for large oceangoing vessels. However, these nations are also key U.S. partners that have voiced concerns over China’s military expansion and its potential impact on Indo-Pacific stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foreign-entanglements&quot;&gt;Foreign Entanglements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast size and growing sophistication of China’s shipbuilding industry has provided it with tremendous market power. It is now nearly impossible for competitive international companies looking to purchase vessels or sell subcomponents to avoid China’s market. Firms from around the world have flocked to the country, building up close relationships with Chinese shipyards, including by signing shipbuilding contracts worth billions of dollars and transferring critical technology and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this close embrace has been lucrative for major multinational companies, it has also directly benefited China’s naval development. By providing capital and technology to China’s dual-use shipyards, foreign firms have helped to subsidize the country’s naval industrial buildup and allowed the PLAN to overcome important technological hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section discusses the specific ways that foreign capital and technology have diffused across the civil-military divide to support China’s naval shipbuilding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-ship-orders&quot;&gt;Foreign Ship Orders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, foreign companies headquartered outside of China and Hong Kong account for roughly 70 percent of commercial tonnage produced in Chinese shipyards. Detailed financial information about these transactions is rarely made public, making it difficult to calculate the total revenue generated from these sales. However, sporadic public announcements reveal that China’s major shipyards regularly win contracts with overseas buyers reaching billions of dollars in value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the largest deals have flowed to Tier-1 shipyards owned and operated by CSSC. In 2024, for example, Hudong-Zhonghua signed a world-record contract worth nearly $6 billion with QatarEnergy to build 18 LNG carriers by 2031. The previous year, France’s CMA CGM signed a deal worth nearly $3 billion with CSSC to build 16 dual-fuel container ships in what was then the largest single shipbuilding order at Chinese shipyards. The vessels are set to be built at Jiangnan, Dalian, and Hudong-Zhonghua—all Tier-1 dual-purpose yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those deals are just two prominent cases of a much wider challenge. Data analyzed by CSIS shows that, in total, between 2019 and 2024 foreign firms purchased 304 hulls from Tier-1 shipyards alone, collectively bringing in tens of billions of dollars in revenue and pushing China’s naval yards further into the forefront of the global commercial shipbuilding market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/budZUT0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to annual announcements by China’s national shipbuilding industry association, the country’s commercial ship exports have pulled in a combined $165 billion between 2019 and 2024 (see Figure 13). While no publicly available information specifies how much of this revenue went into CSSC’s coffers, a conservative estimate based on the company’s share of China’s total production (roughly 40 percent) suggests it made at least $66 billion from ship exports over that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XGIFI8y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 14: Major Expansion Underway at Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base and Longxue Island Shipbuilding Base (See Appendix for Additional Imagery)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC’s high share of revenue from commercial operations means that these funds likely help absorb much of the fixed costs at its shipyards, including maintenance, infrastructure, R&amp;amp;D, and logistics costs. At shipyards where commercial and naval production is co-located, as is the case at many of CSSC’s most productive yards, this likely indirectly reduces the per-unit costs for military vessels, making China’s naval production more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC’s public filings and other financial documents provide few details on how the profits from these sales are allocated; however, major expansion projects underway across CSSC’s main shipyards suggest that the company is spending heavily to boost its long-term capacity and efficiency. In Shanghai, builders have nearly completed a $2.6 billion project to relocate the Hudong-Zhonghua shipyard to the sprawling Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base, alongside the recently expanded Jiangnan shipyard. The facilities will cover 7.7 kilometers end-to-end and encompass an area twice the size of midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar investments are underway in CSSC’s yards in southern China, where the company is spending $2.3 billion to expand the Longxue Shipbuilding Base in Guangzhou. Once complete, the colossal facility is expected to have the capacity to produce 10 million deadweight tons each year—equating to roughly two-thirds of Japan’s entire shipbuilding output in 2023. Chinese state media has proudly touted the effort in Guangzhou as helping “to build a military-civilian integrated marine science and technology industrial city” (军民融合海洋科技产业城). In recent months, the Guangzhou shipyard has been the center of a flurry of concerning construction activity, including an experimental large drone carrier, an unmanned combat surface vessel, a new set of special barges likely designed for amphibious landings, and a novel sail-less submarine or large unmanned underwater vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revenue provided by CSSC’s commercial shipbuilding contracts with foreign firms will likely continue to be key to offsetting some of the massive costs of upgrading and expanding China’s naval forces. The U.S. Navy estimates that China is seeking to build a modern battle force fleet of 425 ships by 2030, an unprecedented procurement effort that will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to build and maintain. In the face of slowing growth and considerable economic headwinds that may constrain China’s budgetary environment, maintaining its access to revenues and financing from foreign sources will be critical for the PLAN to keep pace with its ambitious modernization goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technology-transfer&quot;&gt;Technology Transfer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business ties are just one of the ways that foreign firms have facilitated the rise of China’s naval industrial base. Perhaps just as importantly, global companies across the shipbuilding supply chain have helped supply China with world-class technology and expertise that has found its way into PLAN warships and production lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of the world’s most advanced industries, shipbuilding has a highly complex and globalized production ecosystem. Modern vessels require intricate design and construction processes and are made up of thousands of components, including specialized engines and propellors, navigation and control systems, integrated electronics, and radar modules, among many others. Many of the advanced construction techniques, design software, and critical subcomponents used to build complex commercial vessels are also applicable to the production of warships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r5BX7dw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 10: Selected Technology Transfers from Foreign Companies to China’s Shipbuilding Industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has capitalized on the dual-use nature of these technologies to circumvent rules put in place by many countries to restrict the export of defense-related equipment. Companies like CSSC have leveraged their commercial success to gain access to foreign technology through licensing agreements and joint ventures. Despite clear evidence that Chinese firms have used these technologies for military development, overseas companies—often based in the United States or allied countries—have proven to be willing partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gaztransport &amp;amp; Technigaz SA (GTT)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;is a leading multinational marine engineering firm headquartered in France. The company specializes in designing and building membrane containment systems, which are critical for the transport and storage of LNG. The firm has signed several significant technology-sharing agreements with CSSC, including a 2023 strategic partnership that “provides for cooperation between GTT and twelve subsidiaries of the CSSC conglomerate.” Among these are three of the largest Tier-1 shipyards in China, Hudong-Zhonghua, Jiangnan, and Dalian, which are explicitly authorized to build GTT technologies under a special arrangement known as a technical assistance and license agreement. Notably, GTT also has contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense to build fuel storage facilities in the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues are perhaps best on display in China’s pursuit of advanced propulsion technologies, namely marine diesel engines and naval gas turbines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MARINE ENGINES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s shipbuilders have historically struggled to develop domestically produced marine engines on par with those built by their European counterparts. The PLAN has long preferred to outfit many of its warships with imported engines, even with the added risk associated with relying on foreign suppliers for key defense platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these engines have been supplied by two European firms, German-based MTU and the former French firm SEMT Pielstick (now part of Germany’s MAN Diesel &amp;amp; Turbo). Starting in the early 2000s, these companies began licensing their high-performance diesel engines for manufacture within China. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), between 2001 and 2022, no less than 528 MTU and SEMT-Pielstick engines were built under license in China and supplied to China’s rapidly growing navy. This included some of the PLAN’s most important and lethal platforms, including Type 055 cruisers, Type 052D destroyers, Type 054/A frigates, and Type 039 diesel-electric attack submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iwmL2tF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 15: French and German Marine Engine Exports to China, 2001–2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Arms Transfers Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their end use in Chinese naval systems, MTU and SEMT Pielstick engines were permitted for export to China under German and EU law due to their status as dual-use technologies. In 2013, a spokesman for Man Diesel &amp;amp; Turbo explained that the arrangements were legal because “none of these engines is specifically designed for military purposes. There is a broad variety of civil applications for these engines, too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GAS TURBINES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas turbines are another critical component in high-performance propulsion systems, particularly for large surface combatants. China’s earliest turbine-equipped warships relied on technology provided by the U.S.-based firm General Electric beginning in 1985. Following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, however, the United States placed restrictions on exports of sensitive military technology to China, including gas turbines. In response, China turned to a Ukrainian supplier, Zorya-Mashproekt, which in 1993 agreed to license its UGT-25000 gas turbines to China and transfer full technical documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China reverse engineered the technology, and by 2004, CSIC subsidiary Longjiang GH Gas Turbine (GHGT) introduced a domestically produced variant named the GT-25000 (also known as QC-280). The power and efficiency enabled by GT-25000 turbines was key to China’s ability to develop many of its modern surface combatants, including the Type 055 cruiser and Type 052D destroyer. Still, China’s initial GT-25000 turbines remained reliant on advanced cooling blades and other components sourced from overseas, leaving China vulnerable to export restrictions and supply chain disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSC and its subsidiaries have persistently worked to reduce their reliance on foreign technology, including by tapping commercial markets. In 2011, CSSC’s 703rd Research Institute, a subsidiary focused on gas turbine development, made targeted investments in Wuxi Yongda, a Chinese manufacturing company. Wuxi Yongda had recently signed a joint venture with a leading UK firm specializing in advanced alloy casting technology needed to build turbine cooling blades. The 703rd Research Institute’s investment was likely intended to gain access to the technology to improve its own naval turbine design and production process. State media cheered the venture as “a typical case of the defense industry achieving military-civilian integration through mixed ownership reform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts like these have paid off for China’s military shipbuilders and the PLAN. In the 2018 edition of its annual report on China’s military power, the U.S. Department of Defense assessed for the first time that China had reached near-total self-sufficiency in naval gas turbine technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This success, however, has not slowed China’s pursuit of cutting-edge gas turbine technology from overseas. In 2019, GHGT inked a licensing agreement with Japanese firm Mitsubishi Power to produce its H-25 series compact gas turbines in northern China. These advanced turbines are designed to be capable of running on green fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia—a capability that China has sought to integrate across its shipbuilding industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, in 2023, GHGT was nearly successful in an attempted purchase of the gas turbine division of Germany’s MAN Energy Solutions, which was set to shutter operations. The sale was initially approved, but Berlin moved to block the transaction in July 2024 due to concerns that the technology would be used to support China’s naval development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-capital-markets&quot;&gt;Foreign Capital Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from direct revenue flows and technology transfer, CSSC has gained access to foreign capital markets through its listing on various stock markets under a subsidiary, CSSC Holdings Ltd. As of March 2025 CSSC Holdings Ltd. remained accessible to investors in the U.S. through major China ETFs held by leading institutional investors like Blackrock and Vanguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in spite of CSSC’s inclusion on a list of firms tied to China’s military that then-president Donald Trump blacklisted from U.S. investments through a 2020 executive order. CSSC is also included on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List (CMIC), which is aimed at curtailing U.S. entities from engaging in transactions involving publicly traded securities of listed firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source reporting also suggests that China’s naval shipbuilders have raised billions on global stock and bond markets. Between 2004 and 2015, publicly listed arms of CSSC and CSIC raised a combined total of $22.3 billion from selling stock and bonds on global markets, including on the foreign investor–friendly Hong Kong Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, CSIC successfully raised at least $1 billion in capital from a bond issued on its behalf by a Cayman Islands–based firm called Poseidon Finance 1 Ltd. This bond was available to American investors, who may have contributed significant funding to its sale. These transactions may have helped CSSC and CSIC fund large naval shipbuilding and shipbuilding expansion projects, including the construction of the Shandong, China’s first domestically produced aircraft carrier launched at Dalian shipyard in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the continued structural consolidation underway within CSSC’s labyrinth of subsidiaries, holding companies, and research institutes, it will likely continue to grow easier for Chinese authorities to direct the transfer of privately raised capital between sub-entities of the company to meet strategic requirements. In September 2024, CSSC announced that it was undertaking an internal restructuring to bring CSIC’s financial holdings fully under CSSC, placing all of the companies’ expansive assets under the control of one mega-entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-security-and-economic-implications&quot;&gt;National Security and Economic Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increasingly dominant position in global shipbuilding presents significant challenges for the economic and national security of the United States and its allies. As now-U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said at CSIS in 2024, “The industry is really decimated over time here in the United States, but it’s not as though it shifted to a friend of the United States. . . . It shifted to our greatest adversary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as emerging technologies like drones and artificial intelligence change the character of warfare, the ability to build ships at scale remains a core facet of military power. This is particularly true in a largely maritime theater like the Pacific, where U.S.-China competition is most acute. China’s breakneck naval buildup—enabled in large part through the success of its commercial shipbuilding industry—is rapidly shifting the balance of power in Asia and undermining the ability of the United States and its allies to check Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security-concerns&quot;&gt;National Security Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapidly modernizing navy has emerged as a major area of concern for U.S. military planners. The PLAN has already overtaken the U.S. Navy by hull count, and it is rapidly closing the gap in qualitative measures like fleet tonnage and vertical launch system (VLS) missile cells. A comparison of net tonnage shows that the PLAN has shrunk its tonnage gap with the U.S. Navy from roughly 4 million tons in 2010 to under 1.6 million tons today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has similarly managed to rapidly reduce the disparity in VLS cells deployed on its surface combatants, reaching half the number boasted by the U.S. Navy in 2024—up from just a quarter in 2019. Compounding these concerns, the overwhelming majority of China’s naval forces are concentrated close to home in the Indo-Pacific, whereas U.S. forces are dispersed globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WNWN0TO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are poised to worsen. U.S. naval shipbuilding has been hampered by years of delays, backlogs, and cost overruns at its major shipyards. In 2024, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that less than 40 percent of U.S. Navy ships completed maintenance on time, compromising readiness and raising costs. A 2022 GAO report similarly found that a 20-year, $21 billion effort to modernize and optimize the U.S. Navy’s shipyards launched in 2018 had already seen its scheduling goals slip by three years and was 400 percent over budget after just the first 3 of 17 dry docks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant labor shortages in the U.S. industry are compromising production capacity as well. In a 2024 speech at CSIS, then-U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the United States needed to fill a gap of “an additional 140,000 more skilled workers . . . to meet submarine production demand over the next 10 years.” These bottlenecks have direct implications for U.S. naval procurement: in 2025, the navy was forced to reduce its annual order of new Virginia-class attack submarines from two to one due to delays and ballooning costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is magnified even further by China’s use of its deep reserve of commercial vessels to augment military operations. For example, China is accelerating its production of “roll-on/roll-off” (ro-ro) ships, which are designed to carry commercial vehicles but can also be called on to transport troops and military equipment during a conflict. The PLA has actively incorporated civilian ro-ros into amphibious assault exercises and retrofitted some to meet military requirements, a practice that is explicitly prohibited in the U.S. Navy’s operational guidelines. More broadly, China has used a wide range of nominally civilian ships, including fishing vessels, research vessels, drilling vessels, and containerships, to operate in service of Beijing’s military and strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these dynamics are helping the PLAN grow its quantitative advantage over U.S. forces, creating a “quality all its own.” In 2022, U.S. STRATCOM commander Admiral Charles A. Richard remarked: “as I assess our level of deterrence against China, the ship is slowly sinking. As those curves keep going, it isn’t going to matter how good our [operating plan] is or how good our commanders are, or how good our forces are—we’re not going to have enough of them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ability to vastly outpace the U.S. industrial base in the production of naval and quasi-military vessels presents a concerning challenge to deterrence. A robust shipbuilding sector signals the capacity to sustain operations during a protracted conflict, particularly one one with the high losses that would almost certainly result from a full-scale U.S.-China kinetic war. Leaders in Beijing may calculate that China’s vastly greater ability to mobilize its shipbuilding ecosystem to surge production or restore and replace sunk and damaged vessels would allow it to continue a conflict to victory despite heavy losses. Even short of all-out war, this disparity could alter Beijing’s risk perceptions and shift escalation dynamics in unpredictable ways. Addressing this disparity is thus as much about preventing a war as it is about winning one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond a near-term conflict, China’s shipbuilding capabilities will be key to supporting the PLAN’s transformation into a blue water force capable of operating anywhere in the world. China has rapidly expanded its expeditionary forces in recent years, building the first of a new class of aircraft carriers (the Type 003), launching four modern Type 075 amphibious assault vessels, and introducing the Type 076, a brand-new class of assault ship outfitted with an electromagnetic launch system likely optimized for unmanned platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities will allow China to project joint combat power farther from its coastline into areas such as the Western Pacific, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean. As the PLAN’s capabilities improve, political leaders in Beijing may be emboldened to act more aggressively to assert China’s expanding global interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-challenges&quot;&gt;Economic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an economic standpoint, China’s anti-competitive practices and growing hold over global shipbuilding threatens to further undercut the industrial capabilities of the United States and its allies, marginalizing them from important emerging markets. This will foreclose important economic opportunities offered by an emerging wave of new shipbuilding orders driven largely by an industry-wide push to decarbonize fleets and transition to green technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and South Korea, once dominant players in shipbuilding, are experiencing shrinking market shares due to China’s aggressive expansion. In recent years, several major Japanese shipbuilders, including Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Mitsui E&amp;amp;S, and Sasebo Heavy Industries, have closed or reassigned their shipbuilding facilities due to rising costs and falling profits. Japan has seen the number of technical and engineering staff employed at its shipyards tumble to below 10,000, down from over 15,000 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While South Korea’s industry has proven more resilient due to its strong position in high value-added sectors like LNG carriers and dual-fuel vessels, it also faces challenges from China’s booming shipyards. In 2024, South Korea’s market share in global shipbuilding fell below 20 percent for the first time in nearly a decade, despite strong demand and full orderbooks. A major contributing factor is that China’s share of global LNG tanker orders—where South Korean builders were previously dominant—has more than doubled since 2020, rising from 14 percent to 32 percent in 2024. This trend is partly driven by capacity limits at South Korea’s major shipyards, forcing buyers to look increasingly toward Chinese yards. Some Korean shipbuilders, like Samsung Heavy Industries, have even begun to outsource production to Chinese shipyards to help fill in gaps in capacity due to labor shortages and lack of dock space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries, traditional leaders in specialized shipbuilding sectors like cruise liners and icebreakers, face similar challenges as Chinese shipyards expand into these high-value markets. In 2024, CSSC’s Waigaoqiao shipyard delivered China’s first domestically built cruise ship, the Adora Magic City, to Adora Cruise Lines, a joint venture between CSSC and the U.S.-based company Carnival Cruises. The delivery represented a significant first step in challenging Europe’s dominance over the $117 billion passenger ship industry. This trend raises concerns about the sustainability of Europe’s shipbuilding industry and its ability to compete globally. In 2022, a German shipbuilding association said in a press release that “without a decisive response from Europe, the loss of substantial capabilities in this industry could turn out to be irreversible in the coming years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has maintained a negligible share of the global commercial shipbuilding market for decades, the rise of China’s shipbuilders has further hollowed out its commercial industry. Between 2014 and 2024, U.S. market share fell from 0.33 percent to 0.11, and since 2010, at least three major U.S. shipyards (Bender Shipyard, Avondale Shipyard, and Alabama Shipyard) have either closed down or suspended operations. Employment in the sector, which offers wages nearly 50 percent higher than the average private sector wage, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration, dropped by nearly 15 percent from 2008 to 2022, foreclosing high-quality economic opportunities for workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-countering-chinas-dual-use-shipbuilding-empire&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Countering China’s Dual-Use Shipbuilding Empire&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-objectives&quot;&gt;Policy Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to take decisive action to address the multifaceted security and economic challenges posed by China’s shipbuilding industry. New policies should be framed around the following objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actively counter China’s MCF strategy by severing the flow of foreign capital and technology into Chinese shipyards.&lt;/strong&gt; Given measures already in place to limit U.S. ties with China’s defense industrial base, the focus needs to be on reducing the flow of capital and technology from other countries into Chinese shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce China’s dominance in the global shipbuilding industry.&lt;/strong&gt; Past experiences in industries like solar panels and electric vehicle batteries, where U.S. and allied firms were nearly completely pushed out of the market by low-cost Chinese manufacturing, offer sober warnings of what can happen without intervention. Taking action to limit China’s outsized influence will promote the economic security of not just the United States but also key U.S. allies like South Korea and Japan. Eroding China’s market dominance will also indirectly support the first objective of limiting Beijing’s ability to leverage its commercial shipbuilding industry to support its naval modernization through its MCF strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage friendshoring to key U.S. allies—namely South Korea and Japan—as a counterweight to China.&lt;/strong&gt; It will be impossible to completely shift commercial order books away from Chinese shipyards. There is too much global demand and not enough capacity outside of China (Chinese shipyards currently claim 62 percent of the global orderbook through 2033). It is similarly unrealistic to expect the United States to become a major player in the global shipbuilding market in the short-to-medium term. Achieving even a 5 percent market share would require a nearly 50-fold increase in domestic production. While the United States can take steps to scale up its industrial capacity, it should also prioritize enhancing the competitiveness of South Korea and Japan against their Chinese counterparts. This represents the most efficient and viable strategy for expanding alternative market options outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nurture U.S. domestic shipbuilding capacity in key areas.&lt;/strong&gt; Washington should set realistic goals for enhancing its domestic shipbuilding capacity. As noted above, even capturing a small share of the global market in the near-to-medium term would be a significant challenge. Rather than striving to become a global shipbuilding power, the United States should prioritize developing a commercial shipbuilding industry that meets critical national security needs. Investments should focus on these priorities rather than direct competition with China. This could also include developing specialized capabilities, such as icebreaker construction, and fostering technological innovation to strengthen the broader maritime industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit costs to the United States and its key international partners.&lt;/strong&gt; There are implicit tensions in the goals outlined above. The optimal set of policies will achieve important strategic and national security objectives while not overly burdening consumers and firms in the United States and allied countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-lines-of-effort&quot;&gt;Existing Lines of Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nascent efforts underway in Washington to address some of these objectives. In April 2024, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) initiated a Section 301 investigation of “China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Targeting the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance.” The USTR launched the investigation at the request of petitioners comprising several labor unions seeking to protect the U.S. shipbuilding industry from unfair Chinese economic practices. Those petitioners sought several remedies, including a request that the government impose a fee on every Chinese-built vessel that docks at a U.S. port. They also recommended that the money collected from those fees be redirected to a “U.S. Commercial Shipbuilding Revitalization Fund” which could help support U.S. shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the USTR released a public report based on its investigation, finding that China’s non-market practices in the shipbuilding, marine engineering, and logistics sectors had harmed U.S. commerce. It proposed a set of remedies, including an expansive docking fee regime on not only Chinese shipping companies, but also on any global shipping firms that operate Chinese-built vessels in their fleets (see Table 11). The proposal also calls for requirements to gradually increase the share of U.S. exports that should be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels, starting at 1 percent immediately and rising to 15 percent after seven years, at which point 5 percent must also be transported on U.S.-built vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also movement within Congress. In December 2024, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the SHIPS for America Act, which is the most significant legislation on U.S. maritime industrial revitalization in decades. It has the support of major U.S. shipbuilding industry groups and key figures in the Trump administration, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who played a key role in drafting the bill in his previous role as a member of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SHIPS for America Act offers numerous provisions to fund the growth of a U.S. commercial fleet and includes other incentives—such as substantial tax credits, loans, and loan guarantees—to invest in U.S. shipyards. Among its many different prospective programs, one of the most notable is the establishment of a “Strategic Commercial Fleet” of 250 privately owned U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-crewed oceangoing vessels. Crucially, the program would provide funding to cover the difference in costs that accrue from building and operating a U.S.-made and U.S.-flagged hull instead of buying a ship from a foreign shipyard or flagging it under another country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another crucial provision of the act is a series of incentives for recruiting the maritime workforce needed to sustain efforts to build up U.S. shipbuilding capacity. The bill offers loan forgiveness and educational assistance and funds recruiting programs for relevant U.S. government agencies. These steps will be essential to reducing the massive workforce deficit—a gap of over 100,000 in submarine production alone—while benefiting communities across the country with high-paying job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-1&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following suite of policy recommendations offers a detailed road map for achieving the aforementioned objectives. Several of these recommendations build on and refine the existing lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Impose scalable docking fees on global shipping companies operating Chinese-built vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should adopt many elements of the USTR’s proposed docking fee scheme, but with notable changes. The primary issue with USTR’s proposal is that it is designed to impose costs on buying any Chinese-made ships; it does not differentiate between which Chinese ships are being bought. As a result, the scheme only achieves economic objectives. A better-designed proposal could achieve the same economic objectives while also achieving key national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taking even a limited sample of the types of activities impacted under USTR’s proposal reveals the wide-ranging impacts it could have on the shipping and shipbuilding industry. Table 12 provides an estimate of the annual docking fees that would apply to the top 10 container ship operators servicing U.S. ports, based only on the share of Chinese-built ships in their fleet (additional fees would apply based on their orderbooks and other factors). At a minimum, fees assessed on these 10 firms, which collectively represent roughly 70 percent of the container ship traffic at U.S. ports, would combine to over $8 billion per year. Top firms like MSC, Maersk, and CMA CGM would pay over $1 billion each.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rather than assigning docking fees based only on the share of total Chinese-built ships within a company’s fleet, the authors recommend designing the fees so that they are partially weighted according to which Chinese shipyards made those ships. This would allow for imposing greater pressure on China by targeting specific shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The tier system proposed in this report offers the most streamlined system for organizing and prioritizing fees. A company’s docking fees should be higher if it has a greater proportion of ships made at higher-risk shipyards. This could be achieved in several ways, and U.S. policymakers will need to fine-tune the fee structure. However, one general method would be to impose a blanket baseline fee along the lines proposed by USTR while layering on additional surcharge fees that are weighted according to the percentage of the fleet that comes from each of the tiers of Chinese shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The two tables below offer an example of how such a system could be designed. In these examples, a different multiplier value is assigned to each of the four tiers, and that multiplier is applied to each tier’s proportion of the company’s Chinese-made fleet to calculate the accompanying surcharge. Those surcharges are then summed to calculate the total percent surcharge that would be applied to the baseline USTR fee.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Table 13-A shows what a surcharge might look like for a hypothetical Chinese shipping company that has a higher percent of Tier-1 and Tier-2 ships in its fleets. Table 13-B depicts how a surcharge might be calculated on a hypothetical European shipping company that has fewer Tier-1 ships and more Tier-3 and Tier-4 ships. In this example, the Chinese company would face a significantly higher surcharge: 93 percent compared to 39 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This fee structure ensures that companies purchasing from high-risk shipyards bear the highest costs, encouraging them to shift orders elsewhere. For example, if a hypothetical Chinese shipping company (Table 13-A) acquired 60 percent of its fleet from China, it would have a baseline fee of $1 million per port call. With 2,000 annual port calls, its total fees, including surcharges, would reach about $3.9 billion per year. In contrast, if the European company (Table 13.B) got only 26 percent of its fleet from China, it would have a lower baseline fee of $750,000 per port call. With the same 2,000 annual port calls, its total fees with surcharges would be significantly lower, at $2.1 billion per year (see Table 14).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasizing that if the surcharges recommended here are adopted, the underlying baseline fees proposed by USTR could be scaled down to retain an optimal overall fee burden for the industry. Ultimately, this approach favors flexibility in enforcement to achieve the desired national security objectives while minimizing broader economic disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The proposed USTR docking fees could also be modified in another important way. As currently designed, the existing USTR proposal essentially creates fines for behavior that has already taken place. That is, it imposes fines for Chinese-made ships already in companies’ fleets plus ships already on order (to be delivered in the next 24 months). Yet, the goal of the fees should ultimately be to deter that behavior from taking place in the future. As such, future orders of ships from Chinese shipyards should result in greater fees than ships already bought or ordered. The simple solution for this is to impose higher docking fees if a company places an order from Chinese shipyards after a certain date.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Incorporating these changes has several advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First, the United States would get more bang for its buck. Much of the costs imposed on shipping companies through docking fees are likely to be passed on to U.S. consumers. An optimal policy would impose more costs on China while not increasing the costs for U.S. consumers. This approach achieves that by raising the costs of supporting China’s defense industrial base while imposing the same overall costs on U.S. consumers as a blanket approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Second, a more tailored approach could make the financial burdens more manageable for the companies of U.S. allies and partners. As shown above, merchant shipping companies headquartered in Europe, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and other allied countries buy heavily from Chinese shipyards. Imposing blanket fines based on operating any Chinese-made ships creates costs without offering a clear remedy in the short term. If, however, companies have a clearer sense of which Chinese shipyards are most concerning, they can avoid Tier-1 and other higher-risk shipyards in the near term and buy from lower risk Chinese shipyards as a stopgap in the near term. This would ease the transition away from Chinese shipyards, making the policies more sustainable in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third, weighting fees based on tiers would more directly undermine China’s MCF ambitions in the shipbuilding sector. If foreign orders decline at Tier-1 and Tier-2 shipyards, it will undercut Beijing’s ability to maximize the benefits of sharing resources between commercial and military production lines. In this scenario, Tier-1 shipyards may opt to become dedicated naval shipyards with little to no commercial production, while Tier-2 yards would be discouraged from being converted to military production. It is possible that China could avoid this scenario by simply replacing foreign commercial ship orders at these yards with ship orders by Chinese-owned shipping companies, but this would still be a policy success from a U.S. perspective because it would mean that foreign companies will no longer be funneling resources directly into shipyards producing warships for China’s navy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, CSSC-owned yards (i.e. those in Tier-1 and Tier-2) and other state-owned shipyards (i.e., in Tier-3) have likely received more direct support through state-driven industrial policies. They are also, by definition, under more direct supervision by the Chinese Communist Party and the state than private firms, meaning they are most aligned with Beijing’s strategic interests. Accordingly, ships built in their shipyards should come at a premium for foreign buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In short, China will continue to build commercial vessels and military vessels, and it will try to continue to integrate those production lines to support its MCF ambitions. The United States cannot stop China from doing so, but it can put in place policies that help level the playing field and incentivize Chinese shipbuilders to change their behavior—all while mitigating the negative economic fallout for the United States and like-minded countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sever remaining U.S. financial and business ties with CSSC and its subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On national security grounds, the U.S. government should restrict U.S. companies from conducting any financial transactions with the 35 Tier-1 and Tier-2 shipbuilders owned by CSSC. Tier-1 shipyards directly build warships for the PLAN, and Tier-2 yards have clearly defined links to China’s defense industrial base and broader national security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are precedents for such moves. In September 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would prohibit the sale or import of connected vehicles integrating specific pieces of hardware and software (or their components) if they have sufficient ties to Chinese or Russian companies. In 2021, President Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which presumes that goods manufactured in China’s Xinjiang Region are made with forced labor and therefore bans their importation into the United States, unless proven otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Monitor Chinese shipyards and remain flexible in enforcing actions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As Washington takes these actions, regulators should periodically monitor activity at Chinese shipyards and evaluate whether additional companies need to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The tiered system outlined in this report is a useful first step toward assessing the relative level of threat and concern posed by Chinese shipyards, but as previously noted, China’s shipbuilding ecosystem is murky. Firms not directly building warships can still provide significant support for China’s ongoing naval modernization, and private firms can be co-opted by the party-state to support national security objectives. To make U.S. measures as effective as possible, analysts from various U.S. government agencies—including the intelligence community—should coordinate to vigilantly monitor the evolving situation and adjust course as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use targeted diplomacy to encourage other countries to limit ties with China’s dual-use shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Measures to dissuade firms from buying from or transferring technology to Tier 1 and 2 Chinese shipyards will be far more effective if coordinated with key countries that also share concern over China’s military modernization. The vast majority of firms that engage in these kinds of transactions are based in key U.S.-allied nations in Europe and Asia. In addition, much of the dual-use technology transfer into China’s shipbuilding ecosystem has occurred through companies based outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Parallel measures by like-minded governments would reduce the opportunity for China to exploit loopholes to help its firms circumvent penalties and undermine the effectiveness of U.S. actions. While these measures may rankle some allied governments that are home to companies benefitting from business deals with China’s dual-use shipyards, they also will bring about opportunities for their own shipbuilding industries to benefit from the growth in global demand for ships built by shipyards outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;President Trump has made clear that he expects U.S. allies and partners to increase their own investments and other efforts to compete with China in the security and economic domains. His administration should incorporate discussions on shipbuilding into its broader strategy to rally allies and partners in pushing back against China’s MCF efforts and unfair economic practices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most other nations will not be as forward-leaning as the United States on this issue, as they will be worried about the potential costs for their companies and any diplomatic blowback from Beijing. Nevertheless, as a baseline, Washington should encourage its allies to take quiet, informal actions to discourage their companies from buying from Tier-1 shipyards. This is particularly true of Taiwan, as it stands to lose the most from China’s ongoing naval modernization. At a minimum, the United States should work with other countries to better align their technology restrictions to ensure key dual-use technologies are not directly helping upgrade China’s naval capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, taking the more tailored approach outlined above (i.e., focusing on the most concerning shipyards rather than all Chinese shipyards) will present a far more palatable offer for allies and partners. In the past, Washington has been able to better rally other countries to its side when it can demonstrate that it is taking targeted measures to address specific issues rather than a broader pursuit of strategic containment against China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make targeted investments in long-term shipbuilding capacity in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The punitive and protective measures outlined above will help reduce China’s dominance over the shipbuilding industry, but building up even a minimally viable commercial shipbuilding capacity in the United States will require significant investment. Given fiscal and budgetary constraints, alongside limited political appetite for major public investments, the U.S. government will need to find creative funding mechanisms to spur investment in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One clear path to establishing a funding baseline for maritime revitalization is through the imposition of the proposed targeted docking fees collected from shipping firms operating Chinese-built vessels. As indicated above, a conservative estimate of a tier-focused fee regime could raise tens of billions of dollars per year—funding that can be reinvested in jumpstarting U.S. shipbuilding activity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should be clear-eyed about what can be achieved through public investment in the industry. Washington should not seek or expect to make the United States a global shipbuilding powerhouse. The U.S. shipbuilding industry currently accounts for just 0.11 percent of global production, meaning even a 50-fold increase would bring it to just 5.5 percent. Still, these investments can help the United States build up a minimum shipbuilding capacity needed to meet national security and strategic requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attract foreign investment into the U.S. shipbuilding industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Investments in U.S. shipyards need not only come from U.S. coffers. Washington should encourage and incentivize key global players—especially South Korea and Japan—to invest in U.S. shipbuilders. Policymakers should also court investment from European companies that are global leaders in high-tech areas of the shipbuilding industry. Doing so would bring much-needed jobs, expertise, and capital into the U.S. industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In 2024, South Korean company Hanhwa purchased a leading U.S. shipbuilder, Philly Shipyard, for $100 million, and there are indications that Hanhwa could significantly expand its capacity there and potentially also expand its footprint to include other U.S. shipyards. Such investments should be encouraged going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government can also take steps to facilitate educational exchanges, technical trainings, and knowledge-sharing efforts between its workforce and those from allies like South Korea and Japan. While these exchanges can be hampered by language and cultural differences, the U.S. government can take steps to mitigate these challenges by providing translation support and cultural trainings.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Understandably, even with allies there can be national security concerns about foreign ownership and investment in strategically important industries. However, these deals can be constructed to include provisions to protect national security while still allowing for foreign ownership or investment. U.S. investment screeners, namely the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), should avoid being overprotective when reviewing investments from two of the United States’ closest and most important Indo-Pacific allies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the Trump administration signaled it would take steps along these lines with the America First Investment Policy memorandum. The policy aims to streamline the investment review process for allied and partner sources, while placing heavier restrictions on investments from Chinese firms or companies that support China’s MCF activities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Beyond reducing barriers to investment, Washington should identify areas in which the United States can offer reciprocal investments in partner economies. Failing to do so would risk foregoing needed investments in the United States and alienating close U.S. partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Coordinate with partners to build additional shipbuilding capacity outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Beyond implementing the proposed penalties on companies operating Chinese-built vessels, the United States can help incentivize investment in allied shipbuilding capacity by creating market demand for ships built outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One approach is to require that a certain subset of U.S. goods be transported on a list of trusted vessels that were built in the United States or select partner countries. The USTR proposal includes a far more expanded restriction, requiring that a progressively increasing share of U.S. exports be transported by U.S.-flagged vessels. To limit broader economic impacts, this requirement could be narrowed to apply only to critical strategic goods essential to national security, like LNG or critical minerals, or be adjusted to allow some cargo to be carried by vessels built in trusted shipyards outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another model is to directly collaborate with other countries on the development of specialized shipbuilding technologies needed for strategic applications. This approach has shown some promise. In July 2024, the United States, Canada, and Finland came together to establish the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact. The trilateral partnership focuses on bolstering the shipbuilding capacity of all three countries, including promoting the exchange of information and expertise in the field of icebreakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;President Trump had likewise signaled the importance of a U.S. icebreaker fleet to secure U.S. and allied interests in the polar regions. In 2020, he issued a memorandum calling for “a ready, capable, and available fleet of polar security icebreakers that is operationally tested and fully deployable by Fiscal Year 2029.” President Trump has since signaled his dislike of the Biden administration’s ICE Pact, instead preferring to go it alone. Yet given the limitations on U.S. shipbuilding capacity, the ICE Pact’s multilateral approach may offer the best chance of fielding a capable icebreaker fleet in the near term. If the existing ICE Pact does not meet President Trump’s expectations, his administration should look for ways to revise it rather than scrapping it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More broadly, the Trump administration should remain open to multilateral cooperation on shipbuilding, as it offers the best opportunity to quickly and successfully erode China’s dominant position and achieve lasting gains in the shipbuilding industry. The United States and its allies and partners would bring different assets to such efforts. South Korea and Japan possess raw shipbuilding capacity as well as decades of expertise and experience in high-capacity, advanced shipbuilding techniques. South Korea, in particular, is a global leader in producing LNG tankers, which are some of the most technologically complex commercial vessels in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;European companies are also prominent in developing technologies and subcomponents that support the global industry. For its part, the United States is limited in its experience in producing massive oceangoing vessels, but its shipyards are relatively more proficient in building smaller ships optimized for regional trade.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even without a major presence within the industry itself, Washington does have immense convening power and market potential. If it puts its diplomatic and economic heft behind multilateral efforts, it could help to create and lead a network of builders and suppliers that can collectively be more competitive vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Crucially, as Washington works with its allies and partners, it should look for specific areas where they can make targeted gains. In some areas, such as massive containerships, China’s lead may be insurmountable in the near and medium term. In other areas, however, the United States and its partners may be able to make greater headway. Efforts should focus on identifying less-mature technologies—such as autonomous navigation or future-fuel engines—where opportunities remain to leapfrog China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Sir John Chilcot published the “Report of the Iraq Inquiry”. The 2.6-million-word forensic investigation covers the political and military dimensions of the 2003 Iraq War and all UK government departments that were involved. He concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The decision to use force – a very serious decision for any government to take – provoked profound controversy in relation to Iraq and … continues to shape debates on national security policy and the circumstances in which to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) adapted the magnus opus into “The Good Operation” handbook “to prompt its readers to ask the right questions as they plan for and execute a military operation”. Contained within is a 10 point “Chilcot Checklist” which explicitly invites challenges to the plan where concerns are held. If applied retrospectively to recent UK operations in Afghanistan from 2006 (when the UK led the decision to significantly expand the NATO operation to a country-wide strategy) or Libya in 2011, it is clear – especially with hindsight – that they should not have even been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, it is highly unlikely that Ukraine will receive US security guarantees and therefore it is increasingly likely that a European military force will be required to deploy to Ukraine to deter Russia and support a ceasefire and subsequent attempts to forge a path to conflict resolution, if not peace. Russia – and the US under its current leadership – would not agree to a NATO operation. The EU lacks the capabilities, experience and maturity to do it, even if the Berlin+ agreements were activated to allow the EU the use of the NATO command structure. This leaves some form of a “coalition of the willing” as the only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not yet know the requirement, but potential options range from a small “tripwire” force, to a multinational Division, initially of 20,000 troops, a 30,000-40,000 strong “reassurance force”, or at the top end a 100,000 plus “traditional peacekeeping force”. Europeans might be able to do the first three on their own – especially with Turkish support – but a global force would likely be required to sustain the latter option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sir Keir Starmer is already leading on building a coalition of up to 20 countries. In doing so, it is imperative that the Prime Minister makes the Chilcot Checklist front and centre of the decision-making. While very familiar to military officers and MoD civil servants, it must be brought out of the dark and into all government departments and internationalised to coalition partners. With key New Labour figures from 2003 back in government - UK Ambassador to the US Lord Mandelson and National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell – the Prime Minister can call on valuable and rare institutional memory of how the UK government got decisions between 2001 and 2003 drastically wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the potential mission for the UK in Ukraine though the checklist, currently only two are satisfied, a further two are developing, and six are not even close to being satisfied. Time is also against Europe, but the Prime Minister must not cut corners. The full list should be satisfied before he takes the decision to Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-for-intervention&quot;&gt;The Case for Intervention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two principles are the strongest case for intervention and are arguably already satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, “Vision: Why do we care?”: The Prime Minister is clear that “the future of Ukraine is vital for our national security” and is firmly in UK national interest. He is supported by his electorate with UK public concern and support for Ukraine still very high. Supporting a ceasefire and path to peace in Ukraine is also morally right and firmly within UK values as Russia is the clear aggressor and continues to deliberately target Ukrainian civilians across the country. Moreover, it is also consistent with long-term UK strategy which has supported Ukraine militarily since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the UK’s current role as the third largest provider of military, humanitarian and economic assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, “Analysis: What is happening now?”: Unlike in 2003 – where flawed intelligence and its management were ultimately responsible for the policy failure - the situational awareness now is much clearer. Indeed, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine reclaimed public trust in the UK-US intelligence relationship which was lost after 2003. The Prime Minister is acutely aware of the gravity of the situation and described it as a “pivotal moment” for Europe when he announced a recent uplift in defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral imperative is clear, and similar arguments were made for intervening in Afghanistan and Iraq, alongside other post-Cold War “humanitarian” operations. However, the decision to deploy military force must be grounded in the reality of what is militarily achievable, by when this can be done, and, crucially, what to do if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-developing-situation&quot;&gt;The Developing Situation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principles 3 and 4 are being developed in real-time between the US and Russia, who are bilaterally setting the requirements, with European countries struggling to influence matters from the outside. Therefore, it is critical that the UK and European allies have a stake in the negotiations to shape a ceasefire which they can protect. This should be the Prime Minister’s leading request to President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both “Scenarios: What might happen next?” and “Options: What should we do?” are fundamentals of defence planning. It is the process of assessing the situation and developing “courses of action” and a “concept of operations” for the mission. These will change and be refined not only up to a potential deployment, but also when deployed in theatre, as the situation changes. Critical to a successful coalition of the willing is a broad agreement of the risks, opportunities and costs of an operation, and the equal burden-sharing among contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OouDU0q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;The ten points of the Chilcot Checklist.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: “The Good Operation” handbook / MoD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk is that governments in 2025 might have to sign up for an open-ended commitment. While not completely analogous to the situation in Ukraine, 28,500 US troops are still stationed in the Republic of Korea – 72 years after the armistice was signed. In addition, the NATO Kosovo force (KFOR) is still active 26 years after the intervention and the UK still periodically reinforces the mission such as in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no clear end in sight, the Prime Minister would be asking Parliament – and his partners – to take an unprecedented leap of faith. Before he does this, the scenarios and options must be crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-against-intervention&quot;&gt;The Case Against Intervention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final six Chilcot principles – on a current understanding of the potential operation – provide very strong arguments and challenge against deploying a UK-led force to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, “Legal Implications: How do we ensure action is lawful?”: Securing a UN Security Council mandate for the operation would be challenging, but not impossible, especially with Trump’s bending of the knee to Russia since his inauguration. Moreover, in a coalition of the willing there is always the danger that each participating country brings with it legal definitions – especially if they are not exclusively European states. Moreover, caveats to deployment can also hinder effective working and risk profiles, which plagued operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere. It is an important consideration that a UN mandate might give the mission legitimacy, but it is not a guarantee of mission success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, “Policy and Strategy: What does success look like?”: This is fundamental as, simply put, the mission cannot fail. If it did, the loss of credibility for Europe, and by extension to NATO and the EU, would likely undermine European security to the point that it would completely unravel and hand decisive strategic advantage to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key requirement for the Prime Minister is the master principle of war - “selection and maintenance of the aim”. However, three years after the invasion, none of the four UK Prime Ministers have been able to articulate exactly what Ukrainian victory – and Russian defeat – looks like. A favoured tagline is that the UK will support Ukraine “as long as it takes” without actually defining what “it” is. Therefore, the Prime Minister must develop, agree, and ruthlessly enforce the mission objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, “Resource: what do we need to Deliver?”: The minimum contribution for the UK would be a Brigade (5,000), alongside a lion’s share of the command and control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance assets and logistics enablers. But it would require 15,000 to sustain this force indefinitely (one in theatre, one recovering and one training) or 20% of the total British Army strength and approximately 50% of the Field Army. Committing this force to an open-ended operation would effectively be permanently removing these troops from the British Army order of battle. As such, it would put a UK “NATO first” strategy in jeopardy and the commitment to be the Alliance’s strategic reserve. Moreover, it is not just a question of numbers – this force are not peacekeepers. They need to have the full heavy suite of military equipment available to deter Russian attacks, and – if required – to fight and fix Russian forces in Ukraine if a wider war between NATO and Russia originated in the Nordic or Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, “Planning and Doing: How should we do it?”: The UK cannot lead alone and a Franco-British political and military leadership team appears to be emerging. The UK and France are extremely close allies, both backed by nuclear forces, both deployed at Brigade level previously (UK in Afghanistan, France in the Sahel), and have the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF) as a crucible of interoperability between the two militaries. As such, they remain the only two true framework nations of Europe which are capable of commanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while this construct sounds feasible, if challenging, it is likely insufficient. A Two-Star Headquarters would be too small for such a deployment and the CJEF is optimised for crisis management – not defence and deterrence. Therefore, it would have to both scale – to a Divisional level - and re-role to defence and deterrence prior to any deployment which would take a significant amount of time. The potential political pitfalls are greater than the military challenges. If Le Pen wins the 2027 Presidential Election and then withdraws the French contingent from the mission, it will put the UK in a lonely command position, regardless of the hit to resources. Such an eventuality could be fatal for mission success and is something President Macron cannot guarantee, no matter how committed he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, both “Policy Performance: how will you monitor performance?” and “Evaluation: Is the policy working” are ultimately about measuring performance and success criteria. Without knowing the mission, it is impossible to evaluate these. However, once the UK is committed it cannot withdraw, vastly reducing the options available to it. As the leading country, the UK will be impacted by failure the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-worst-case-scenario&quot;&gt;The Worst-Case Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prime Minister is in an invidious position. He must prepare for a potential UK-led mission. However, in preparing for it, he also makes it more likely, as Trump will regard it as an option available to him. However, the consequences of mission failure would be fatal to European security. It would be better to not even attempt an operation at all, rather than get bounced into a poorly defined mission by Trump and be left with the consequences. Wanting to finalise the blueprint for the coalition of the willing this week, ahead of any US-Russia-Ukraine deal, only increased the risk of a poorly developed operation from deploying and therefore also succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent memories than 2003 also cast a long shadow. The 2021 chaotic fall of Kabul was a direct product of a bad Trump Doha deal with the Taliban. Yet, Afghanistan was always a discretionary operation, with peripheral interest to the UK – loosely recognised as support to the US. However, this support did not stop Vice President JD Vance’s recently disrespecting UK and French troops by saying a US minerals deal was a “better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years”, demonstrating how fickle the US can be in its leadership and outlook. Over-committing UK troops to uphold US foreign policy was as bad a policy after 9/11 as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a truism of military planning is that “the enemy gets a vote.” Indeed, putting static and open-ended European forces into Ukraine – that are explicitly not covered by NATO’s Article V – provides Putin a delicious opportunity to weaken the Alliance. It is anything but a deterrent. He will use the full levers of his military and special services to undermine the operation with an inability for the Europeans to respond in fear of escalation. At its most dangerous, he might choose to deliberately target European forces but insist that such attacks were the result of technical failures or misunderstandings, challenging the Europeans to respond. Each event would serve to undermine the strength of European commitment in the face of Russian aggression and would indirectly cut away at the credibility of Article V even when it was not enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, few in the West aside from obsessive AI professionals had heard of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI research lab founded barely more than a year and a half ago. Today, DeepSeek is a global sensation attracting the attention of heads of state, global CEOs, top investors, and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of its R1 model on January 20, 2025—the same day as President Trump’s second inauguration—DeepSeek has cemented its reputation as the top frontier AI research lab in China and caused a reassessment of assumptions about the landscape of global AI competition. By January 27, DeepSeek’s iPhone app had overtaken OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on Apple’s U.S. App Store. The stock prices of some U.S. tech companies briefly tumbled, including the AI chip designer Nvidia, which lost more than $600 billion off its valuation in a single day. (AI chips are also known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the terms are used interchangeably in this report.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT has again overtaken DeepSeek in app store rankings, and Nvidia’s stock price has since mostly recovered. However, investor interest in Chinese tech companies has grown significantly and remains elevated. DeepSeek is now even reportedly seeking investment from venture capital firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sector, AI is prone to overreactions and wild swings in perception. One might think that the story of DeepSeek is just another overblown AI hype cycle. However, the extraordinary attention focused on DeepSeek is justified, even if the conclusions some have drawn from its success are not. It would be a great mistake for U.S. policymakers to ignore DeepSeek or to suggest that its accomplishments are merely a combination of intellectual property theft and misleading Chinese propaganda. Policymakers need to understand that—even while DeepSeek has in some cases simply implemented innovations already known to U.S. AI companies—DeepSeek has also demonstrated genuine technological breakthroughs of its own. These facts deserve careful consideration as the second Trump administration sets its AI policy agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides an overview of DeepSeek’s origins and achievements, their geopolitical implications, and the key challenges facing U.S. and allied policymaking as a result. The paper pays particular attention to DeepSeek’s implications for the future of AI and semiconductor export control policy. It concludes that—while DeepSeek’s success does partly reflect failures of earlier implementations of U.S. export controls—these controls can continue to play a critical role in supporting the United States’ strategy for winning the AI race against China. Success is not guaranteed and will require two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing large-scale AI chip smuggling and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preventing the team of Huawei and SMIC from providing a viable Chinese AI chip alternative to the leading incumbent international team of Nvidia and TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both will be exceedingly difficult, and in both cases export controls can at best slow and disrupt Chinese efforts, not stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second point, Chinese sources and leaders are expressing renewed optimism. At a meeting on February 17 between Chinese Community Party (CCP) Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives (including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng), Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies who are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously. While China’s economy faces many challenges, Gerard DiPippo of RAND is correct to argue,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even if overall economic growth remains comparatively weak and many Chinese firms continue to struggle, China’s central and local governments will keep supporting high-tech industries and emerging stars like DeepSeek. . . . Western policymakers shouldn’t make the mistake of believing China is down and out, and they shouldn’t be surprised when China continues to catch up or make breakthroughs in critical and emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows are a series of 21 key judgments regarding DeepSeek, Huawei, export controls, and the future of U.S.-China AI competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Readers are advised to pay special attention to the discussion of Huawei and SMIC, as this report contains a great deal of new and previously private information regarding Huawei’s progress toward indigenizing China’s AI and semiconductor technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-deepseek-did-not-come-out-of-nowhere-its-parent-company-high-flyer-capital-management-has-roots-in-ai-enabled-high-frequency-trading-that-provided-a-strong-technical-foundation-in-terms-of-both-computing-infrastructure-and-workforce-talent&quot;&gt;1. DeepSeek did not come out of nowhere. Its parent company, High-Flyer Capital Management, has roots in AI-enabled high frequency trading that provided a strong technical foundation in terms of both computing infrastructure and workforce talent.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek is a subsidiary of High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund focused on algorithmic trading powered by deep learning. Deep learning is the core technology paradigm underlying the past two decades of rapid AI advancements. Cofounded in 2015 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder and CEO of DeepSeek, High-Flyer was already ranked as the top Chinese hedge fund in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s heritage via High-Flyer in the algorithmic trading world helps to explain its success in frontier AI research and especially its success with its most recent model releases. Algorithmic trading firms frequently own and operate their own data center infrastructure, which they use to develop proprietary investment strategies powered by machine learning artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Flyer has admitted that its activities include “High-Frequency Trading,” though High-Flyer de-emphasizes this work since it is politically controversial (and was for a time banned) in China. High-frequency trading firms race against each other to be the fastest asset traders reacting to new market developments and are obsessively focused on optimizing and accelerating their computing infrastructure. These efforts routinely include intense research on developing proprietary and unorthodox data center engineering methods for improved speed and efficiency. Firms can justify making these expensive investments in computing and network infrastructure optimization because the success or failure of trades collectively worth billions of dollars depends upon reducing the time between learning of a fact and making a stock trade based on that new fact by mere nanoseconds (billionths of a second).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-Flyer is among the leaders of such firms in China and has long been among the most focused on both AI algorithms for trading and data center engineering. The Financial Times reported that, by mid-2022, High-Flyer had already acquired more than 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips (which at the time were the most advanced AI chips in the world) and spent more than 1.2 billion RMB (roughly $180 million at the time) to build two data centers. These infrastructure investments distinguished High-Flyer from most other Chinese companies: Only four other companies in China possessed such a large quantity of chips at the time, and all were major tech companies, not finance companies. In a 2023 interview, Liang said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We always wanted to carry out larger-scale experiments, so we’ve always aimed to deploy as much computational power as possible. . . . We wanted to find a paradigm that can fully describe the entire financial market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another 2023 interview with a Chinese media outlet, Liang provided a timeline for High-Flyer’s AI chip compute reserves as a gradual “progression from one GPU in the beginning, to 100 GPUs in 2015, 1,000 GPUs in 2019.” He stated that, from the day of DeepSeek’s 2023 founding onward, High-Flyer had both the computational power and “ample R&amp;amp;D budgets” to support DeepSeek’s mission of “research and exploration” in pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s heritage from High-Flyer’s machine learning research and intensive computing optimization techniques are evident in some of the strategies that it has pursued to develop its AI models. More broadly, the synergy of technical skills between the world of algorithmic trading and AI research is well known. For example, industry sources at leading U.S. AI labs told CSIS that they have also focused on recruiting talent, especially compute infrastructure engineers, with experience in the high-frequency trading industry. Both sectors pay such talented individuals handsomely.&lt;/p&gt;

DeepSeek’s technological achievements in terms of performance and cost were not surprising. They reflected a continuation of longstanding trends. However, the fact that such achievements came from a Chinese lab was a surprise.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s recent technological achievements (reflected in the DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek Math, and Native Sparse Attention technical papers) can most easily be understood through two basic facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, DeepSeek has demonstrated a suite of algorithmic and architectural improvements that significantly reduce the amount of computing power (and therefore financial investment) required for any AI model to reach and operate at a given level of performance. This is true for both the training stage (in which AI models are created) and the inference stage (in which their capabilities are used to serve internal or external customers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, DeepSeek has now developed AI models in China that are broadly comparable to the best U.S.-developed AI models introduced in mid-2024 (e.g., OpenAI’s o1 or Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two demonstrations, the fact that these advances came from China is more surprising than the fact that they happened at all. DeepSeek’s improvements in technical performance were consistent with preexisting trend lines of AI performance improvements. They represent expected performance breakthroughs, not shocking ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why, it is helpful to consider an analogy in the form of Moore’s Law. In economic terms, Moore’s Law essentially means that computer chips improve to be roughly twice as good in performance for the same amount of money roughly every two years. Though the nature of that performance improvement has changed, this trend has been consistently observed for almost six decades (with some caveats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Moore’s Law has been repeatedly validated since the 1960s, it has become steadily easier to confidently predict that computing performance per dollar will continue to double every two years. But, as the fortunes of Intel vividly demonstrate, that is not synonymous with being able to state with confidence which specific company or which specific technical innovations will deliver that improved performance. The same is true of AI today: It is easier to forecast the degree of AI performance growth than to forecast who will invent that performance growth or how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has its own versions of Moore’s Law that are driving exponential growth in both absolute performance and performance available at a given cost. At a high level, these sources of improvement can be grouped into three types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increasing available computing resources (either by using better computer chips, more chips, or both);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving algorithms and architectures (for example, to deliver more “intelligence” for a given compute budget); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improving the quality and/or quantity of available training data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epoch AI, an AI-focused nonprofit research institute, has estimated that, while the amount of human-generated training data will likely plateau in 2028, algorithmic and architectural improvements and increased computing resources have been improving at 3x per year and 4.6x per year respectively—for a combined multiplier effect of 13.8x per year. In short, AI performance is increasing at a rate far faster than the familiar (though still extraordinary) pace of exponential progress described by Moore’s Law. Even ignoring the possible remaining improvements from harvesting additional training data, a (highly oversimplified) back-of-the-envelope estimate of future performance based on the compute trends and algorithmic architectural trends would suggest that AI performance at the end of 2028 will be more than 36,000 times better than at the beginning of 2025, rather than just the four or eight times better that would be true if improvement were only occurring at the familiar pace of Moore’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who only began paying attention to AI with the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT, this pace of progress can be both breathtaking and difficult to believe. However, for those familiar with the AI industry’s history over the past two decades, the fact that an AI model that requires a massive data center one year can run on a laptop or a single AI chip a few years later is well-known as a recurring, though still quite incredible, phenomenon. The dramatic reduction in cost-per-performance DeepSeek demonstrated is not a surprise to Western AI researchers. They have been leaders in driving—and benefitting from—the exact same trend for more than a decade. One might ask: “If that is the case, why are U.S. AI labs still building ever larger and more powerful data centers?” Put simply, such companies are reinvesting all efficiency gains toward improved overall performance. Dario Amodei, CEO of the U.S. AI lab Anthropic, put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because the value of having a more intelligent system is so high, this [reduced cost] shifting of the curve typically causes companies to spend more, not less, on training models: the gains in cost efficiency end up entirely devoted to training smarter models, limited only by the company’s financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, AI researchers are clearly nowhere near the absolute ceiling of computational performance and efficiency. The human brain is a real-world existence proof of human-level intelligence that requires only 20 watts of electricity, compared to the megawatts or gigawatts contemplated for future AI data centers. Despite the many differences between human brains and machine intelligence, the existence of the brain hints at future intelligence efficiency possibilities in much the same way that bird wings inspired the Wright brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is not at all surprising that somewhere on earth, an AI research lab managed to deliver the improved AI performance-per-dollar that DeepSeek’s technical papers demonstrate. The only surprise is that the research lab that discovered some of the relevant technical innovations is a Chinese one, and notably one whose technical team appears to have been educated and trained almost entirely in China, rather than at Western universities or Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese researchers have been at or close to world class in many domains of AI research for many years, DeepSeek represents the first time that a Chinese AI lab has demonstrated breakthroughs at or near the absolute frontier of foundational AI research. Many of the techniques that DeepSeek demonstrated are now the new state-of-the-art. Of note, this is exactly what the Chinese government set as a goal in China’s 2017 official AI strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By 2025, China will achieve major breakthroughs in basic theories for AI, such that some technologies and applications achieve a world-leading level and AI becomes the main driving force for China’s industrial upgrading and economic transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DeepSeek’s technological innovations are real, not propaganda. They have been in all cases proven to work by Western researchers who replicated DeepSeek’s approach.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first week after the publication of DeepSeek’s R1 paper, some commentators argued that DeepSeek’s results were fabricated as part of a Chinese propaganda effort or “psyop.” This is simply false. Researchers at U.S. universities have already reproduced some of the research results described in the DeepSeek V3 and R1 papers, and U.S. AI firms are already working on adapting DeepSeek’s novel techniques to utilize them in their own AI efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be discussed further in this paper, essentially all DeepSeek’s technical innovations relate to algorithmic and architectural improvements. DeepSeek did not have superior computing hardware, nor did they have access to uniquely important datasets (excluding synthetic data) that might have provided an advantage over Western researchers. The key technical innovations that DeepSeek demonstrated across the DeepSeek-V2 (May 2024), DeepSeek-V3 (December 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (January 2025), and other research papers are significant. Some of these innovations had already been independently discovered by U.S. firms (and not disclosed publicly), but others were genuinely new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-deepseeks-success-in-large-part-reflects-the-lagging-impact-of-the-flawed-first-package-of-us-ai-chip-export-controls-in-october-2022-the-us-government-acknowledged-and-partially-remedied-these-flaws-in-its-october-2023-update&quot;&gt;4. DeepSeek’s success in large part reflects the lagging impact of the flawed first package of U.S. AI chip export controls in October 2022. The U.S. government acknowledged and partially remedied these flaws in its October 2023 update.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many media and policy commentators in the United States and China have argued that DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are evidence that U.S. export controls have failed to restrain China’s AI sector and that DeepSeek proves that huge numbers of cutting-edge U.S. AI chips are not required for developing and serving high-performance AI capabilities. There is some merit to aspects of the first claim, but the second is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, DeepSeek’s V3 research paper states that their models were trained on 2,788,000 GPU-hours using Nvidia H800 chips, which, at an estimated cost of 2 dollars per GPU-hour, equates to $5.576 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H800 is a degraded version of the H100 chip that Nvidia specifically developed for the Chinese market to comply with the U.S. export controls imposed on October 7, 2022. In particular, those controls restricted the sale of chips that exceeded performance thresholds across two metrics: total processing power and interconnect speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government sources told CSIS that the U.S. government knew that these restrictions would prevent Nvidia from shipping its (at the time) market-leading A100 chip and upcoming H100 chips. They inferred that Chinese customers would be restricted to using the V100, which was first introduced in 2017 and has significantly lower performance than its successors. Additionally, the U.S. government assumed that, if Nvidia were to develop a new chip specifically for the Chinese market that exceeded export control performance thresholds in one metric but not the other, this would require the typical multiyear AI chip development timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the U.S. government architects of the October 2022 export control policy did not realize, however, was that Nvidia had a mechanism for post-manufacturing modification of its existing chip products. Specifically, each Nvidia chip is designed for redundancy, recoverability, and defect tolerance to minimize the impact of manufacturing defects. Such defects are a significant concern in the advanced node semiconductor industry, and designing chips to mitigate their potential impact is near universal. Nvidia can blow one or more strategically placed electrical fuses on the chip so that a manufacturing defect would usually only reduce the chip’s performance or deactivate a redundant component, rather than rendering the entire chip nonfunctional. Industry sources confirmed to CSIS that Nvidia blew fuses on A100 chips to reduce their interconnect speed (but not their processing power) below the export control performance thresholds, thus creating the A800 product lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, the A100 was born with the capability to become an A800 if needed, via fuse settings. The H800, by contrast, did involve some minor Nvidia re-engineering and design optimization in the face of export controls. This allowed Nvidia to continue shipping large volumes of advanced AI chips (with performance near the global state of the art) to China without violating export controls and without taking multiple years to design new chips specifically for the Chinese market. According to reporting by The Information, the performance of the A800 and H800 chips was close enough to the performance of the originals that there was effectively no demand for large-scale AI chip smuggling to China during the period in which A800s and H800s were available. Why smuggle when the legally purchased chips are good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration ultimately realized that continued sales of the A800 and H800 meant that their policy would not have the intended impact on China’s AI ecosystem. Former government officials told CSIS that this was clear internally by December 2022. However, it took the administration 12 months after their initial package of export controls to act. The U.S. government modified the export control performance thresholds in October 2023 to block exports of A800s, H800s, and any non-Nvidia chips with comparable performance to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the year-long period in which A800 and H800 chip exports to China were legal, an enormous number of them were sold to China. Precise sales figures are not available, but Nvidia’s disclosed sales to China between October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2023, exceeded 9 billion dollars. This does include revenue for chips that were not widely used in AI training or inference, however. See Table 1 for Nvidia’s quarterly revenue by billing locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uX1FE1d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Nvidia Quarterly Revenue by Billing Location.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Nvidia Quarterly and Annual SEC Filings; CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If DeepSeek were to admit that it used H100s in its data center to train its models, it would be confessing to activity illegal under U.S. law, since the H100 has never been legally available in China and cannot even legally be purchased by Chinese-firm subsidiaries outside of China. Thus, if DeepSeek did engage in illegal activity, it would have an incentive to conceal this fact. This raises the question of whether DeepSeek lied in its publications when it claimed to have used H800 chips exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry analyst Ben Thompson has pointed to strong evidence that DeepSeek did in fact use H800s as it claimed: Many of DeepSeek’s algorithmic and architectural improvements are ideal for maximizing the effective use of computing resources under conditions of limited interconnect bandwidth. At a minimum, this strongly suggests that DeepSeek uses many H800s in its computing infrastructure and that a model with the performance of V3 can indeed be trained exclusively on H800s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not prove, however, that DeepSeek exclusively uses H800s in its overall computing infrastructure. Indeed, some reporting in Chinese news media claims that DeepSeek did train its slightly more recent R1 model on Nvidia H100 chips that are banned from China under U.S. export controls. The semiconductor consulting firm SemiAnalysis, citing anonymous industry sources, recently wrote that DeepSeek has a total of 50,000 Hopper generation GPUs, a category that includes H100s, H800s, and H20s. SemiAnalysis specifically claimed that it has evidence that High-Flyer’s/DeepSeek’s computing infrastructure includes at least 10,000 H100s, 10,000 H800s, 30,000 H20s, and 10,000 A100s as part of its total computing stack. SemiAnalysis further estimated that High-Flyer/DeepSeek spent $1.63 billion in GPU server capital expenditures alone (i.e., excluding other data center construction and operating costs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nathan Lambert, a machine learning researcher at the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence, has correctly pointed out that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tracking the compute used for a project just off the final pretraining run is a very unhelpful way to estimate actual cost. It’s a very useful measure for understanding the actual utilization of the compute and the efficiency of the underlying learning, but assigning a cost to the model based on the market price for the GPUs used for the final run is deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it is not DeepSeek that is being deceptive, however, since their paper was extremely clear about what was and was not included in the $5.6 million figure. It was only the final, successful pretraining run. It did not include the compute cost of the hundreds of experiments that were run beforehand to generate the insights necessary for that final run, nor did it include the compute costs associated with post-training fine-tuning or inference compute workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no public evidence that large-scale Nvidia chip smuggling occurred prior to October 2023, industry sources told CSIS that, by early 2024, large-scale H100 chip smuggling operations were underway. In mid-2024, journalists at The Information interviewed participants in eight distinct H100 smuggling networks, each of which provided evidence that they had completed Chinese transactions worth more than $100 million. These networks continue to be active, with increasingly sophisticated techniques for evading detection. For example, a December 2024 investigation by The Information found that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When notified of an upcoming inspection, smugglers have duplicated the serial numbers of the servers with Nvidia chips they’ve purchased from Supermicro [and already smuggled to China] and attached them to other servers they had access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence that governments are becoming more serious about cracking down on AI chip smuggling. Singapore was the billing location for 18 percent of Nvidia’s revenue in the most recently concluded fiscal year but the shipping location for only 2 percent of revenue. Officials in Singapore recently arrested three individuals accused of facilitating AI chip smuggling to China. The Singaporean government’s increased emphasis on cracking down on smuggling may reflect its concerns about being relegated to tier 2 status under the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-however-deepseeks-challenges-also-reflect-the-successes-of-the-ai-chip-export-control-policy-which-deepseeks-ceo-has-described-as-the-greatest-challenge-facing-his-company-and-the-wider-chinese-ai-ecosystem&quot;&gt;5. However, DeepSeek’s challenges also reflect the successes of the AI chip export control policy, which DeepSeek’s CEO has described as the greatest challenge facing his company and the wider Chinese AI ecosystem.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the introduction of Huawei’s Mate60 Pro 5G smartphone in August 2023, many commentators were quick to highlight how DeepSeek reflected the failure of U.S. export controls. This included Chinese state-owned media, one outlet of which, GlobalVision, broadcast that “DeepSeek and Huawei join forces! . . . breaking through U.S. tech restrictions is not impossible!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angela Zhang, a professor at the Gould School of Law, went further, arguing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s achievements in efficiency are no accident. They are a direct response to the escalating export restrictions imposed by the US and its allies. By limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips, the US has inadvertently spurred its innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument is in one sense true: Chinese firms like DeepSeek prioritized innovation in efficiency—and particularly efficiency innovations that are useful given the limitations of the H800—because that was the most attractive AI research path available to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this argument is deeply flawed for three reasons. First, every leading AI firm, including both U.S. and Chinese ones, is pursuing enhanced efficiency. As mentioned above, DeepSeek’s efficiency improvements represented a continuation of preexisting industry trends in AI computation efficiency improvements, not a drastic acceleration of them. Even before DeepSeek was founded, and even before the U.S. imposed export controls, DeepSeek’s parent company was obsessively focused on improving computing efficiency (though more focused on optimizing latency). It is strange to say that export controls caused AI firms to do something that they—both U.S. and Chinese—were already doing (and already had a massive financial incentive to do) before export controls were imposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the argument is flawed because it does not engage with the question of “how much further along might China be in the absence of export controls?” The largest AI computing cluster currently operating on Earth is xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, which was recently upgraded to use 200,000 H100 chips. Given that leading Chinese firms were already producing more AI-related patents, publishing nearly as many highly cited research papers, and spending nearly as much on data center capital expenditures before the export controls went into effect, it is entirely possible that China would already be ahead of the United States in AI in the absence of export controls. Jimmy Goodrich, a non-resident senior associate at the Wadhwani AI Center, put it well when he said, “It’s been long known that DeepSeek has a really good team, and if they had access to even more compute, God knows how capable they would be.” Goodrich’s statement on DeepSeek applies to China as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, this argument does not take account of the benefits of reallocating the supply of high-performance chips that would otherwise have gone to China. Nvidia, which is estimated to have 90 percent global market share in AI chips, is supply constrained, not demand constrained. For every Nvidia chip that TSMC has been able to manufacture since 2022, there are many customers willing to buy them. Larry Ellison, the cofounder of Oracle, colorfully described how Nvidia’s customers have to beg for greater chip allocation in September 2024 when he recounted a dinner between himself, xAI CEO Elon Musk, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would describe the dinner as Oracle—me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs, [saying] “Please take our money. Please take our money. By the way, I got dinner. No, no, take more of it. We need you to take more of our money please.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that, since the AI chip shortage began in 2022, all the chips that Nvidia would have sold to China in the absence of export controls would have come at the expense of customers elsewhere, which in this case is overwhelmingly the United States. In other words, eliminating the export controls would have not only helped China, it would have also hurt the United States, at least in terms of Nvidia chip allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his part, DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng is under no illusions that the chip export controls have helped China or DeepSeek. In a July 2024 interview, he said, “We do not have financing plans in the short term. Money has never been the problem for us; bans on shipments of advanced chips are the problem.” Liang has also said in an interview with a Chinese media outlet that U.S. restrictions on AI chips mean that Chinese companies must use two to four times the computing power to achieve the same results, referring to the penalty of using the H800 instead of the H100 for large model training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further evidence of the impact of U.S. export controls comes from the fact that DeepSeek experienced widespread outages and had to halt new user sign-ups in the wake of its massive user adoption growth. While DeepSeek claimed that the outages were the result of cyberattacks, the far more likely explanation is that they simply lacked sufficient computing capacity to serve their growing user base. There is a big difference between the amount of computing power required to serve an AI large language model to a small number of users and doing what OpenAI does, which is serve its AI models to 400 million active users every week. More recently, DeepSeek has once again reopened new user sign-ups, which likely reflects the company successfully purchasing or renting additional computing capacity. Nevertheless, the point remains: Compute capacity matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-deepseeks-discovery-of-techniques-for-increased-ai-computational-efficiency-could-benefit-us-firms-more-than-chinese-ones-as-us-firms-can-apply-such-techniques-to-their-much-larger-computing-resources-and-thus-deliver-better-ai-to-more-customers&quot;&gt;6. DeepSeek’s discovery of techniques for increased AI computational efficiency could benefit U.S. firms more than Chinese ones, as U.S. firms can apply such techniques to their much larger computing resources and thus deliver better AI to more customers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In describing its goals toward creating AGI, a recent DeepSeek job advertisement said that “We believe AGI is the violent beauty of model x data x computing power.” Though a bit oversimplified, that formula is still essentially correct and helps explain why having larger computing resources is a useful advantage at any level of computational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of DeepSeek’s innovations were algorithmic and architectural. DeepSeek appears to have described all or nearly all of them in great detail in its research papers. That means that U.S. AI labs are free to apply these same innovations in training and deploying their own AI models. Indeed, U.S. firms are already doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while DeepSeek’s algorithmic innovations are replicable by U.S. firms, DeepSeek will struggle to replicate U.S. AI chip and compute advantages. In the absence of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology, China’s most advanced AI chip designer and logic chip manufacturer, Huawei and SMIC, respectively, will most likely remain stuck at 7 nanometers (nm) or perhaps a flawed 5 nm technology node for many years. The CEO of ASML, which is the sole firm in the world manufacturing EUV lithography machines, said “By banning the export of EUV, China will lag 10 to 15 years behind the West. That really has an effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, U.S. chip firms such as Nvidia will in coming years press forward past the 4 nm era into the 2 nm and beyond future, delivering chips that might be thousands or tens of thousands of times better performing integrated into data centers using tens or hundreds of times more chips. While there are still many ways in which the U.S. government could bungle export control implementation and enforcement—which will be discussed later in this paper—the greatest potential for impacts from the export controls are still well ahead in the future as the United States races forward and China’s progress continues to slow. Implemented properly, they offer the opportunity for a meaningful, though far from permanent, edge over China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-just-as-the-past-six-decades-of-moores-law-have-driven-increased-demand-for-computer-chips-deepseek-and-other-ai-efficiency-innovations-will-continue-to-do-the-same-for-ai-chips-there-is-no-ceiling-on-the-demand-for-intelligence&quot;&gt;7. Just as the past six decades of Moore’s Law have driven increased demand for computer chips, DeepSeek and other AI efficiency innovations will continue to do the same for AI chips. There is no ceiling on the demand for intelligence.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the initial commentary on DeepSeek suggested that demand for AI chips might plummet, as efficiency improvements meant that fewer chips were needed to achieve the same level of intelligence. While this is a generally accurate description of efficiency, it is a terrible description of how computing economics works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Moore’s Law has driven a more than billionfold improvement in computing efficiency over the past seven decades. Does this mean that all of the world’s computing needs are handled by a single computer that costs only a fraction of a penny? Of course not. Instead, the increased efficiency has made applying digital computation throughout the economy far more attractive, and so more governments, businesses, and consumers have invested in more computation across countless applications and use cases. This is the essence of Jevon’s Paradox, which describes how increasing efficiency can increase aggregate demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is obviously going to be true of increased AI computational efficiency. Indeed, after the DeepSeek revelations, the largest data center buyers in the world—Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon—announced that they were going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in 2025 on AI chips and data centers, up by nearly 50 percent over the already record amount invested in 2024. Chinese firms such as Alibaba have announced that they too will make massive chip purchases in the wake of DeepSeek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is this merely a long-term phenomenon. Even in the short term, rental prices for H100 chips hosted by Amazon’s cloud computing spiked upward in the wake of DeepSeek’s publication as customers worked to incorporate DeepSeek models into their operations. More recently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that OpenAI would have to temporarily limit usage of its GPT 4.5 model because the company did not have sufficient GPUs to meet all of the demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is almost certainly no “ceiling” for a desirable amount of intelligence and the computing required to power that intelligence. Miles Brundage, who previously led policy research at OpenAI, described it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To make a human-AI analogy, consider [Albert] Einstein or John von Neumann as the smartest possible person you could fit in a human brain. You would still want more of them. You’d want more copies. That’s basically what inference compute or test-time compute is—copying the smart thing. It’s better to have an hour of Einstein’s time than a minute, and I don’t see why that wouldn’t be true for AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This again relates to how the most significant impacts of the export controls are likely in the future, as the evermore extremely scaled deployment of evermore powerful chips begins to bear fruit. It is the next few rounds of increasing AI computation—by tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold—where China will be most severely blocked and the impact of the export controls will be most severely felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Chinese AI researchers have made similar points. On February 13, 2025, Li Guojie, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, told Chinese media outlet ChinaFund that DeepSeek’s success represents a step-change in Chinese AI capabilities but said that “due to the blockade of the U.S. government, China is currently unable to obtain the most advanced chip process technology.” Li went on to say [machine translation]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The success of DeepSeek does not deny the key role of computing power in the development of artificial intelligence. In fact, since there are much more equipment for reasoning than for training, the computing power required for reasoning [aka inference] will become the main requirement in the future. It is very important to improve the efficiency of the model through algorithm optimization. It is our basic choice to take the green development path of saving computing power, but computing power is definitely a necessary condition for solving artificial intelligence problems and cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

DeepSeek’s success in distilling U.S. AI models and replicating closed source algorithmic innovations does raise strategic questions about the nature of competitive advantage in AI in the absence of strong intellectual property protections. A worst-case scenario would be if AI is structurally similar to pharmaceuticals.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 29, OpenAI told the New York Times that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We know that groups in the P.R.C. are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to replicate advanced U.S. A.I. models. . . . We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distillation is a well-known technique that allows “the transfer of knowledge from a larger, more complex language model (the ‘teacher’) to a smaller, more efficient version (the ‘student’).” In short, the inputs and outputs from the teacher model are used as very high-quality synthetic training data by the student model. Distillation is utilized by every major U.S. AI lab to offer smaller, more efficient versions of its models that are faster and cheaper to serve to customers. For example, GPT-4o-mini is the distilled version of GPT-4o, and both were made by OpenAI. There are multiple types of distillation, however, and the more advanced types, which AI labs use to distill their own models, require access to the internals of the models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a firm distilling its own models is clearly harmless, there is a strategic consideration if one firm can distill another firm’s models, incurring most or all of the benefits of acquiring a highly capable AI model while incurring far fewer of the costs of creating such a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of OpenAI and DeepSeek, the distillation evidence appears quite strong: DeepSeek’s initially released models, when asked by users “what model are you?,” will often respond, “I’m ChatGPT.” DeepSeek’s updated versions of the model, likely modified using fine-tuning techniques, no longer produce such responses, but this does not reduce the strength of the evidence that DeepSeek relied on distillation. Such unauthorized distillation would be a violation of OpenAI’s terms of service, but the law firm Fenwick has written that “whether remedies against such [a Terms of Service] breach would sufficiently protect teacher-model owner’s IP remains to be determined.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If OpenAI were to file a lawsuit against DeepSeek, for example, perhaps it would win in U.S. courts. But how would the size of judicial penalties compare to the strategic benefit for DeepSeek as a firm or for China as a country? And the access to judicial remedies is almost certainly limited to the United States and other countries with strong intellectual property protections. Even if DeepSeek were hypothetically clearly guilty of not only distillation but an even more extreme case of outright corporate espionage, Chinese courts would likely find OpenAI guilty of stealing IP from DeepSeek rather than the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happened to U.S. chipmaker Micron when it accused China’s Fujian Jinhua of stealing memory chip trade secrets and when U.S. prosecutors charged Fujian Jinhua with economic espionage. In retaliation, Jinhua sued Micron in a Chinese court for patent infringement in early 2018. The Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court in Fujian province sided with the Chinese side and issued an injunction blocking Micron from selling 26 chip products in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when U.S. semiconductor equipment firm Veeco found that a Chinese competitor, Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), was using Veeco’s proprietary designs, Veeco secured a preliminary injunction in a U.S. court to stop a supplier from providing parts to AMEC. However, in response, AMEC filed a patent suit in China, and the Fujian High Court (the same province as above) acted with remarkable speed. On December 7, 2017—just weeks after AMEC’s filing—the court granted AMEC a preliminary injunction without even hearing Veeco’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, one should separate the questions of what is “fair” or “true” from what the strategic consequences are likely to be. Neither geopolitics nor business is a contest where first prize always goes to the most innovative. Many companies, including U.S. tech companies, have a perfectly viable business strategy of closely monitoring their innovative competitors and then either buying the competitor or replicating its innovation. Chinese firms can do the same, including in ways that both do and do not violate intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the meaningful strategic question for OpenAI and other U.S. AI firms is not whether DeepSeek is failing to play by the rules, it is whether U.S. firms have a mechanism for effectively preventing DeepSeek or any competitor from extracting the benefits of an AI lab’s investments without bearing the costs. What enduring sources of competitive advantages could the large U.S. AI labs secure if Chinese companies or other copycats (potentially even U.S. ones) can simply piggyback off their work to build cheaper and equivalently good models while incurring only a fraction of the costs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible answer comes in the form of Meta’s strategy, which is to invest in developing open-source AI models justified not by the direct benefits of increasing monthly subscriptions, but by the indirect benefits of enhancing their existing social media and advertising business lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the worst outcomes for U.S. AI companies would be if the fundamentals of AI research and development were structurally similar to those of the global pharmaceutical industry. In 2023, the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies invested approximately $2.4 billion over 10 to 15 years into developing a typical new drug from start to finish. The costs of research and development dwarf those of drug manufacturing, marketing, and distribution, so the final price of the product must reflect the costs of research and development for pharmaceutical firms to have any hope of recovering their investments and earning a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incentivize drug R&amp;amp;D, the U.S. government offers companies 20-year patents that allow them the exclusive right to sell their products in the United States at a monopoly premium to recover upfront R&amp;amp;D costs. However, once a patent expires, so-called generic manufacturers can reproduce and sell the same drug for a far lower price—avoiding the burden of R&amp;amp;D costs altogether. Generic manufacturers can thereafter compete by selling identical drugs while incurring only a tiny fraction of the costs faced by the original drug developer. In a world where there was no patent protection on new pharmaceuticals, investment in new drug discovery (and thus the pace of innovative new drugs) would be radically limited because governments and philanthropic actors might be the only ones willing to invest, and they would almost certainly do so at far lower levels than the current private sector does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government and business-makers alike must now ask the question: What if frontier AI model research is structurally identical to that of the pharmaceutical industry, meaning extremely high upfront R&amp;amp;D costs and very low replication costs? The implications for AI investment and for U.S.-China AI competition could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China AI race is very likely not one in which gentlemanly concepts of “fairness” matter. Chinese companies have systematicallystolen American IP for years and will almost certainly continue to do so. Beyond Chinese firms, the Chinese government has a very clear history of either not enforcing or outright supporting Chinese firms that illegally violate U.S. patents in cases where the Chinese government has identified the industry as strategically significant. AI certainly falls into that category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kai-Fu Lee, arguably the top venture capitalist in China’s AI sector, wrote in his 2018 book AI Superpowers that imitation does not have the same stigma in China that it does in the United States. He went further to argue that China’s unabashed willingness to copy innovation and even ignore intellectual property makes its companies more competitive, not less. In describing the post-2010 rise of hypercompetitive and cutthroat Chinese tech firms as “copycat gladiators,” Lee’s writing on this topic is worth quoting at length:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley may have found the copying undignified and the tactics unsavory. In many cases, it was. But it was precisely this widespread cloning—the onslaught of thousands of mimicking competitors—that forced companies to innovate. Survival in the internet coliseum required relentlessly iterating products, controlling costs, executing flawlessly, generating positive PR [public relations], raising money at exaggerated valuations, and seeking ways to build a robust business ‘moat’ to keep the copycats out. Pure copycats never made for great companies, and they couldn’t survive inside this coliseum. But the trial-by-fire competitive landscape created when one is surrounded by ruthless copycats had the result of forging a generation of the most tenacious entrepreneurs on earth. As we enter the age of AI implementation, this cutthroat entrepreneurial environment will be one of China’s core assets in building a machine-learning-driven economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking Lee’s argument one step further: If the future global competitive landscape for AI is one of ruthless copying in the absence of robust intellectual property protections, that is an environment where Chinese entrepreneurs ought to do extremely well, because it resembles the domestic Chinese tech ecosystem in which they grew up and thrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-unfortunately-developments-in-recent-years-do-not-give-confidence-that-traditional-approaches-to-protecting-intellectual-property-and-technology-secrets-are-likely-to-be-effective-when-it-comes-to-china-and-ai&quot;&gt;9. Unfortunately, developments in recent years do not give confidence that traditional approaches to protecting intellectual property and technology secrets are likely to be effective when it comes to China and AI.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even over just the past three years, a diverse set of examples suggests that robustly protecting key knowledge in the AI field is likely to be extremely difficult:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2025, a federal grand jury charged a Chinese national and former Google employee with “seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets in connection with an alleged plan to steal from Google LLC (Google) proprietary information related to AI technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2023, ASML, the most important provider of the lithography equipment used to manufacture advanced chips, accused a former employee in China of stealing proprietary technology data in an attempt to circumvent export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Eindhoven University of Technology, a school only five miles away from ASML’s headquarters and with close ties to the company, had to suspend all activities as it worked to analyze the impact of a Chinese cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2022, WIRED reported that a group of cyber criminals breached Nvidia and stole “a significant amount of sensitive information about the designs of Nvidia graphics cards, source code for an Nvidia AI rendering system called DLSS, and the usernames and passwords of more than 71,000 Nvidia employees.” Nvidia claims to have since significantly upgraded its cybersecurity, and this particular attack does not seem to have originated in China. However, it is concerning that a hacking group got so close to the technology crown jewels of such an important U.S. AI company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Chinese intelligence services successfully hacked the email accounts of then-Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and other U.S. officials, apparently looking for intelligence related to U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2025, The Information reported that DeepSeek CEO Liang had visited San Francisco in mid-2024 and “met with researchers he knows, including some OpenAI employees, to stay up to date.” This is consistent with Center for AI Safety Director Dan Hendrycks’ claim that&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you know which research dead ends to avoid (e.g., MCTS) and roughly know what research direction to pursue, replication is much easier. These algorithmic insights likely slowly leaked through SF party conversations and other channels. It probably takes a few months once you have the idea for [OpenAI’s reasoning AI model] o1 to replicate it. That’s how DeepSeek did it without much compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is ongoing research into techniques to prevent model distillation, and AI companies will no doubt increase these efforts in the wake of DeepSeek, this remains an open question with significant implications. In an interview published in ChinaTalk, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like all problems in cybersecurity . . . [distillation is] going to be an ongoing issue. That’s why some companies have chosen to kind of hide the chain of thought in their reasoning models, because it makes it much harder to distill. Those can be jailbroken. But folks are working on antidotes to jailbreaking. We just released something today that makes it much harder to jailbreak models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in a case where distillation and more explicit cases of technological espionage are difficult or impossible to prevent, however, there will remain the issue inference computation, which involves applying more computational resources so that the model can “think” harder about the answer to a question or so that the model can be used more times and serve more users. One way of thinking about this is that the nature of competitive advantage in AI could be shifting from a secret that one keeps (i.e., the model weights) toward an asset that one controls (i.e., massive data center compute infrastructure). This means that export controls—if implemented and enforced effectively—still have an opportunity to have a strategic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the U.S. government and U.S. AI firms need to take a tough look at whether and how they can remain competitive in a world where China does not respect intellectual property and is committed to devoting enormous state resources to technical espionage in the AI and semiconductor sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-the-effectiveness-of-export-controls-will-depend-upon-effective-implementation-and-enforcement-to-prevent-chip-smuggling-there-is-cause-for-significant-concern-on-this-point-if-the-trump-administration-reduces-relevant-government-resources-and-staff-or-causes-allied-countries-to-not-cooperate&quot;&gt;10. The effectiveness of export controls will depend upon effective implementation and enforcement to prevent chip smuggling. There is cause for significant concern on this point if the Trump administration reduces relevant government resources and staff or causes allied countries to not cooperate.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the U.S. Department of Commerce is the agency charged with adjudicating license applications and enforcing export controls, not just on semiconductors bound for China, but for all U.S. dual-use technology exports that might end up in Russia, Iran, North Korea, and many other restricted destinations. To implement its work overseeing trillions of dollars in economic activity and policing smuggling operations worldwide, BIS has fewer than 600 employees and a relatively paltry budget of just under $200 million. Semiconductors are just one technology category out of hundreds that this organization is responsible for enforcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting by The Information found at least eight Chinese AI chip–smuggling networks, with each engaging in transactions valued at more than $100 million. More recent reporting by the Wall Street Journal suggests that this smuggling now includes the latest generation of Nvidia Blackwell AI chips. China is betting that its network of smugglers and shell companies can find the leaks in the BIS export control enforcement barrier. As long as Congress continues to neglect BIS by providing grossly inadequate resources compared to the size and importance of its mission, China has a reasonable expectation of success. BIS needs not only more money, but also more skilled staff, more enforcement agents, and better enabling technology, especially in data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Department of Commerce needs more help from the rest of the government, in particular the U.S. intelligence community. Declassified Central Intelligence Agency documents show that the intelligence community was deeply involved in assisting export control enforcement during the Cold War and delivered solid results by doing so. These are capabilities and priorities that have significantly atrophied in the post–Cold War era but urgently need to be restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent efforts by the Trump administration to reduce government spending risk making a bad situation worse. On February 5, 2025, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi signed a Department of Justice memorandum that, among many other actions, disbanded the National Security Division’s Corporate Enforcement Unit, which was “created with the goal of investigating and prosecuting corporate actors involved in sanctions evasion, export control violations, and other national security-related economic crimes.” The memo did not provide any explanation for how the duties of the unit would be performed elsewhere in the Department of Justice, which could mean that this will be implemented as a straightforward reduction in U.S. government capacity to enforce export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the choices available, the worst policy choice that the U.S. government could make is to regulate aggressively but with large loopholes and weak enforcement. Such an approach—which fairly describes the approach taken in the first Trump administration and large chunks of the Biden administration—incurs nearly all the costs of an aggressive export control policy but does so without providing any of the possible strategic benefits in terms of slowing Chinese progress in semiconductors and AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-beyond-smuggling-the-greatest-strategic-challenge-for-the-united-states-is-the-potential-for-china-to-produce-ai-chips-domestically-at-sufficient-quantity-and-quality-to-build-ai-data-center-infrastructure-that-is-competitive-with-the-united-states&quot;&gt;11. Beyond smuggling, the greatest strategic challenge for the United States is the potential for China to produce AI chips domestically at sufficient quantity and quality to build AI data center infrastructure that is competitive with the United States.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described above, the nature of AI geopolitical advantage appears to be moving away from software secrets that are difficult to protect and toward hardware chip and data center assets that are (hopefully) easier to protect. In this sense, DeepSeek is not in and of itself the most significant threat to U.S. leadership in AI. Instead, the greater challenge arises from the possibility of China having a domestic ecosystem for producing its own AI chips at large scale and integrating them into Chinese data center training, as well as running inference for DeepSeek and other AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. technology firms are planning hundreds of billions of dollars in AI data center infrastructure investments, it is worth remembering that—for those investments to be possible—companies like TSMC must manufacture enough AI chips to fill those data centers. In the case of companies such as Nvidia, their revenue growth in recent years is less than it would have otherwise been due to shortages of TSMC production capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration took many steps designed to definitively cut China’s AI chip designers off from TSMC production capacity. Most recently, on January 15, the Commerce Department announced the final tranche of Biden administration export controls, often referred to as “the Foundry Rule.” The Foundry Rule moved advanced chip production to a white-list system that will likely make it impossible for Chinese AI firms to access TSMC capacity to produce chips above export control performance thresholds even when operating through complex shell company arrangements. However, as discussed below, TSMC manufactured a strategically significant quantity of chips on behalf of Huawei via shell companies prior to the rule going into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That effectively means that China’s long-term future in AI is closely tied to its ability to produce AI chips domestically. The Biden administration sought to hamstring China’s domestic production of advanced chips by restricting the sale of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-deepseek-stands-out-among-chinese-ai-model-developers-because-of-its-demonstrated-ability-to-make-architectural-innovations-below-the-level-of-nvidias-cuda-software-ecosystem-if-deepseek-were-devoted-to-strengthening-huaweis-ascend-chips-and-cann-software-ecosystem-it-would-pose-a-much-more-significant-threat-to-nvidia&quot;&gt;12. DeepSeek stands out among Chinese AI model developers because of its demonstrated ability to make architectural innovations below the level of Nvidia’s CUDA software ecosystem. If DeepSeek were devoted to strengthening Huawei’s Ascend chips and CANN software ecosystem, it would pose a much more significant threat to Nvidia.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, one of the biggest sources of competitive advantage for Nvidia has been its CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software ecosystem. CUDA makes it much easier for programmers to write massively parallelized software (as all modern AI software is) and ensures backward and forward compatibility so that older chips can still run newer software and vice versa. Any customer who seeks to stop using Nvidia chips has to leave the CUDA ecosystem, which requires solving a lot of incredibly hard software problems for which CUDA already provides free answers. Those free answers reflect billions of dollars of investment in the CUDA platform by both Nvidia and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek stands out among AI model developers because it implemented software changes below the CUDA level. Most AI researchers rely on CUDA, a higher-level programming language for NVIDIA GPUs, because it simplifies the development process. However, CUDA does not allow fine-grained control over GPU operations at the level DeepSeek required. DeepSeek modified software instructions written in a language called PTX (Parallel Thread Execution). By programming directly in PTX, DeepSeek engineers were able to optimize how the GPU handled specific workloads, particularly in managing expert specialization in the Mixture-of-Experts model and improving memory efficiency. This is an “assembly-level” approach to GPU programming—one that is both extremely difficult and (at least historically) rarely attempted. The trade-off, however, was a major increase in performance efficiency, particularly for large-scale AI training tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests that DeepSeek may have both the technical knowledge and the open-source community enthusiasm to finally start generating momentum around Huawei’s competitor to CUDA, which Huawei refers to as its Compute Architecture for Neural Networks (CANN). The greater maturity of the CUDA software ecosystem currently makes Nvidia chips more attractive, but this could change over the next few years. If it does, it would have major implications for Nvidia’s competitiveness both inside and outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the combination of Ascend chips (discussed more below) and CANN software appears far from being competitive to CUDA. A Financial Times report from September 2024 found that even Huawei employees found the product “difficult and unstable to use” and prone to crashing frequently. Industry sources told CSIS that DeepSeek’s more recent evaluation of CANN was very negative and that DeepSeek assessed that it would be years before the combination of Ascend chips and CANN-compatible software was a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, this could change with time, effort, and investment. Huawei recently joined the open-source PyTorch foundation in an effort to increase Ascend and CANN compatibility of the PyTorch AI development framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is at least one meaningful precedent regarding the difficulty of leaving the Nvidia CUDA ecosystem, which is Google’s shift from TensorFlow on Nvidia GPUs to JAX on their proprietary chips, called TPUs. In this case, it took several years for JAX to mature and for a critical mass of software libraries to appear—even with heavy Google investment and the payoff opportunity in terms of both efficiency and competitive differentiation. Even by 2023, Google was still heavily investing to improve JAX (for example, addressing pain points like multi-host setup and memory efficiency) and encouraging its use through education (tutorials, conference workshops). For a company like DeepSeek, migrating all AI workloads from CUDA to CANN would likely be a multiyear project. Google’s internal shift took 2–3 years to bear significant fruit, and even then Google maintained support for both for a long while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-chinas-alliance-of-huawei-ai-chip-designer-smic-ai-chip-manufacturer-and-cxmtxmc-high-bandwidth-memory-manufacturers-have-recently-made-strategically-significant-progress-in-advancing-domestic-production-of-ai-chips&quot;&gt;13. China’s alliance of Huawei (AI chip designer), SMIC (AI chip manufacturer), and CXMT/XMC (high-bandwidth memory manufacturers) have recently made strategically significant progress in advancing domestic production of AI chips.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically producing large quantities of AI chips will require China to domestically replicate multiple segments of the AI chip value chain. The most important links are AI chip design, advanced node logic chip manufacturing, and advanced node high-bandwidth memory (HBM) manufacturing. Each of these will be addressed in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;14-huaweis-ai-chip-design-has-long-been-strong-before-the-2020-export-controls-it-was-poised-to-meaningfully-challenge-nvidia-in-china-with-tsmc-manufacturing-and-chinese-government-pressure-to-purchase-huawei-products-over-nvidia-ones&quot;&gt;14. Huawei’s AI Chip design has long been strong. Before the 2020 export controls, it was poised to meaningfully challenge Nvidia in China with TSMC manufacturing and Chinese government pressure to purchase Huawei products over Nvidia ones.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the United States, China has many different companies working on AI chip design, including Huawei, Cambricon, Biren, and more. However, Huawei is unambiguously in the strongest position with its Ascend AI chip product line. Industry sources also told CSIS that Huawei—due to its highly influential position with the Chinese government and its size as a customer—has the greatest leverage over SMIC. In other words, even if Huawei were not the best AI chip designer in China, it would still be the most important since it is in a position to restrict the share of SMIC manufacturing capacity that goes toward its domestic competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei has been a player in the AI chip market for longer than is generally realized. Huawei had a 7 nm AI Accelerator chip planned for production at TSMC in 2020. At the time, Huawei was preparing to capitalize the so-called 3-5-2 policy, in which the CCP’s Central Office ordered all government agencies and many state-owned enterprises to eliminate the use of all non-Chinese technology within three years. However, Huawei was unable to fulfill demand because of the first Trump administration’s updated 2020 entity listing, which temporarily cut Huawei’s Ascend and Kirin lines off from TSMC. In this instance, Nvidia was the beneficiary of these early U.S. export controls, which delivered a setback to Chinese efforts to eliminate dependence on U.S. AI chip technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Huawei’s Ascend product line is focused on the Ascend 910B and the Ascend 910C, the latter of which includes two Ascend 910B logic dies per integrated unit (meaning more real estate on each silicon wafer is required for manufacturing an Ascend 910C than a 910B). DeepSeek has reportedly evaluated the Ascend chips and found that they are unattractive for training AI models but that each Ascend 910C delivers roughly 60 percent of the performance of an Nvidia H100 for inferencing AI models. This matters greatly since more and more of the computing requirements for advanced AI models are expected to be devoted to inference in the coming years. Barclays, an investment bank, estimates that by 2026, 70 percent of AI compute demand will come from inference. In February 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that utilization of its chips was “40 percent inference, 60 percent training,” compared to 90 percent training-focused in the 2016 timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15-sources-told-csis-that-huaweis-use-of-shell-companies-to-gain-access-to-tsmc-manufacturing-capacity-allowed-them-to-acquire-more-than-2-million-ai-chip-dies-and-that-huawei-has-also-stockpiled-more-than-a-years-worth-of-hbm&quot;&gt;15. Sources told CSIS that Huawei’s use of shell companies to gain access to TSMC manufacturing capacity allowed them to acquire more than 2 million AI chip dies and that Huawei has also stockpiled more than a year’s worth of HBM.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese firms like Huawei have historically had two major options for manufacturing their AI chip designs: outsource production abroad to TSMC of Taiwan or produce chips domestically in partnership with SMIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a time, it seemed as though the 2020 entity listing of Huawei definitively cut the company off from accessing TSMC advanced node manufacturing capacity. The October 2022 and October 2023 export controls were supposed to have done the same for all advanced node AI chip designers in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TSMC manufactured large quantities of Huawei Ascend 910B chips on behalf of Huawei shell companies and shipped the chips to China in violation of U.S. export controls. In an interview with the New York Times, an unnamed Taiwanese official acknowledged that these chips “ended up in the hands of Huawei.” Government officials told CSIS that TSMC manufactured more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies and that all of these are now with Huawei. If true, this is enough dies to make 1 million Ascend 910C units. However, the advanced packaging process by which two Ascend 910B dies and HBM are combined into a unified Ascend 910C chip also introduces defects that can compromise the functionality of the chip. Industry sources told CSIS that roughly 75 percent of the Ascend 910Cs currently survive the advanced packaging process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strategically significant stockpile of AI chips. For comparison, Nvidia reportedly shipped 1 million H20 chips (which are inference specialized and targeted at the Chinese market) to China in 2024. Nvidia’s January 26 SEC filing states that it generated $17 billion in revenues from Chinese customers in the most recently ended fiscal year (which would obviously exclude revenues from chips later smuggled to China). Presumably, the vast majority of these revenues are from H20 sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though Huawei likely has the more than 2 million Ascend 910B logic dies made by TSMC, there is a question as to whether it has enough HBM to integrate with those dies in manufacturing 1 million Ascend 910Cs. It seems likely that Huawei does, however, since the U.S. plan to restrict all advanced HBM sales to China on a country-wide basis was leaked to Bloomberg in August 2024 and did not go into effect until December of that year, giving Huawei ample time to legally acquire HBM chips as part of a stockpiling strategy. Industry sources told CSIS that Huawei has stockpiled enough HBM to meet their internal expectations for at least a full year’s worth of production, mostly in the form of purchases from Samsung of South Korea, potentially via shell companies, that occurred before the December controls went into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is as though the U.S. government was having an internal debate about whether or not to have a surprise attack, and in the spirit of compromise, the slow interagency process settled on attacking without the surprise. This was an egregious failure with strategic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the adoption of the Foundry Rule, it will hopefully be impossible for Huawei or other Chinese AI chip designers to ever again access TSMC manufacturing capacity, even when using sophisticated shell company tactics. Huawei will instead be restricted to what Chinese domestic logic chip manufacturers can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the potential risk that an existing chip design company on the Foundry Rule white list could be tempted by massive revenue opportunities to act as a pass-through to give Huawei access to TSMC. Guarding against this risk will require making clear to TSMC that the negative consequences of continuing to supply Huawei with advanced AI chips would be colossal compared to the revenue and profit opportunity. Similarly, Huawei may attempt similar tactics with other chip foundries such as Samsung or even Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;16-huaweis-ai-chip-manufacturing-partner-smic-has-been-struggling-with-low-production-yield-20-percent-and-20000-7-nm-monthly-wafer-production-due-to-us-and-allied-export-controls-smic-has-a-difficult-and-uncertain-path-toward-producing-at-nodes-more-advanced-than-7-nm&quot;&gt;16. Huawei’s AI chip manufacturing partner, SMIC, has been struggling with low production yield (~20 percent) and 20,000 7 nm monthly wafer production due to U.S. and allied export controls. SMIC has a difficult and uncertain path toward producing at nodes more advanced than 7 nm.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most advanced logic chip manufacturer in China is SMIC. SMIC’s SN2 facility in Shanghai is the sole facility in China with an active 7 nm logic chip production line and has been producing 7 nm chips since July 2021, more than a year before the first tranche of the Biden administration’s semiconductor equipment export controls went into effect. SMIC and Huawei are now working to bring a 5 nm node into scaled production but must do so without access to EUV lithography equipment, since China has no local producer of EUV lithography machines and since export controls have prevented such machines from ever being exported to China. Industry sources told CSIS that, in early 2020, ASML was poised to ship EUV tools to China and that SMIC was planning to work with key research labs in Europe, such as the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), to help develop their EUV-based manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, industry sources told CSIS that SMIC currently has enough immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment supplied by the Dutch company ASML to produce 85,000 FinFET wafers per month (WPM) across both SN1 (which focuses on 14 nm node production) and SN2 (which focuses on 7 nm and 5 nm production). This acquisition of lithography tools reportedly took effect before Dutch DUV lithography export controls went into effect in mid-2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the bottleneck in expanding 7 nm (which in SMIC’s node naming system is called “N+2”) production capacity has not been lithography but rather U.S. tools for etching, deposition, inspection, and metrology. The shortage of inspection and metrology tools has also been an important factor preventing SMIC from improving its yield. SMIC acquired lithography equipment as a stockpiling measure in anticipation of future export controls by the Dutch government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low production rate also has an impact on yield, since manufacturing technicians and engineers tend to improve their techniques based on experimentation and observed results from production. Thus, more production is helpful in accelerating the pace of learning and thus improving the yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the Ascend 910B die size of 665.61 mm², CSIS estimates that each 300-millimeter diameter silicon wafer produces roughly 80 chip dies. This is simply counting the number of small rectangles (chip dies) that can fit inside the large circle (the wafer). A source told CSIS that of these 80 chip dies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roughly 20 percent (~16) are fully functional with either no defects or no defects that negatively impact performance. This is the same as saying that SMIC has 20 percent yield when making these chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unknown share of chips are functional with degraded performance, though customer demand for such degraded chips (in Huawei’s case, though not Nvidia’s) is low.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unknown share of chips are completely nonfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMIC’s 20 percent yield when producing Ascend 910Bs is quite low, but it is not as low as it might seem. In 2020, when Nvidia moved its GPU production to TSMC’s 7 nm process, the defect-free yield rate was roughly 41.5 percent. Since manufacturing defects occur randomly on a defects per square centimeter of chip area basis, larger chips (such as AI chips) are more susceptible than smaller chips (such as smartphone application processors) to a high defect rate. Using TSMC during roughly the same time period and with roughly the same defect rate, Apple’s A12 processor enjoyed 90 percent+ yield. SMIC also makes the application processor for Huawei’s Mate smartphone line, and its yield when making these smaller chips is somewhere in the 50–70 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a February 24, 2025 report by the Financial Times, citing two anonymous individuals, claims that SMIC’s AI chip yield has increased to roughly 40 percent. Industry sources told CSIS that the Financial Times report is not correct and that Huawei/SMIC’s true yield remains at 20 percent. One explanation for the discrepancy would be if the Financial Times’ sources were mistakenly including both the fully functional chips and the chips that are functional but with degraded performance when estimating yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;17-sources-told-csis-that-huawei-smics-most-important-customer-has-successfully-managed-to-move-stockpiled-us-built-equipment-from-sien-芯恩-pensun-鹏新旭-and-huaweis-fab-in-dongguan-to-smic-sn2&quot;&gt;17. Sources told CSIS that Huawei, SMIC’s most important customer, has successfully managed to move stockpiled U.S.-built equipment from SiEn (芯恩), Pensun (鹏新旭), and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan to SMIC SN2.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, SMIC’s shortage of deposition, etching, inspection, and metrology semiconductor manufacturing equipment also been an important factor preventing expanded production capacity of its SN2 facility. Some of this equipment is restricted on a country-wide basis, meaning that it cannot be legally sold anywhere in China. However, other types of this equipment were restricted only on an end-use and end-user basis. This means that the equipment can be sold to some customers in China but not others. In some cases, this even means that it can be sold to some facilities of a particular customer, but not others. In such cases, relocating the equipment from one facility to another would require a new export license in order to be legal. But SMIC’s production of 7 nm chips using U.S. equipment is already illegal, and both SMIC and other Chinese firms always have the option to choose illegal activity, particularly since such activity frequently enjoys the active support of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry sources told CSIS that SiEn, Pensun, and Huawei’s fab in Dongguan all were able to legally acquire the needed etching, deposition, and inspection/metrology equipment that SMIC needs for two reasons: (1) the equipment was not restricted on a country-wide basis to all of China and (2) the equipment was restricted on an end-use and end-user basis, but SiEn and Pensun told U.S. firms that it would exclusively be used for producing chips less advanced than 14 nm. These firms also denied any affiliation with Huawei. Government officials told CSIS that in such circumstances, the equipment can often be sold under a no-license required status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the sources, SiEn and Pensun, however, did not have sufficient customers providing demand for using all of the equipment they had purchased, and so some of it was never used operationally in their fabs. They purchased the equipment as a stockpiling move in anticipation of future export controls. The source described this as a “buy everything you can, while you can” strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SMIC SN2 facility needed the equipment. Since SiEn and Pensun were not making economically productive use of the equipment, they were amenable to a sale. This sale was negotiated in Q4 of 2024 and completed in Q1 of 2025. The sources are under the impression that all of the desired equipment is currently either installed at SMIC SN2 or on-site awaiting installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;18-as-a-result-of-the-successful-in-country-equipment-transfer-smic-expects-to-achieve-50000-7-nm-wpm-by-the-end-of-2025-if-all-of-this-capacity-was-devoted-to-manufacturing-ascend-ai-chips-which-is-unlikely-that-would-imply-the-production-of-millions-of-ascend-910c-chips-annually&quot;&gt;18. As a result of the successful in-country equipment transfer, SMIC expects to achieve 50,000 7 nm WPM by the end of 2025. If all of this capacity was devoted to manufacturing Ascend AI chips (which is unlikely), that would imply the production of millions of Ascend 910C chips annually.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This equipment will eliminate the near-term U.S. equipment bottleneck facing SMIC for SN2 7 nm production. SMIC’s new 7 nm production bottleneck is the overall size of the facility. Prior public statements from SMIC indicated that the SN1 and SN2 facilities combined have a maximum capacity of 85,000 WPM and that SMIC intended to split production evenly between the two facilities, implying SMIC was targeting ~42,500 WPM of lithography capacity at SN2. Sources told CSIS that SMIC was targeting 50,000 WPM of 7 nm specifically by the end of 2025. It is unclear whether this means that 7 nm production will now also take place at SN1 or whether SMIC has figured out a production process and equipment configuration that allows them to squeeze more production capacity than expected into SN2. If, hypothetically, SMIC were to devote all 50,000 WPM to Ascend 910C manufacturing, this would imply producing 4 million Ascend 910B dies per month, of which 800,000 would be fully functional. 800,000 910B Ascend dies is enough to manufacture 400,000 910C chips, though the advanced packaging process would reduce yield further, and it is unclear how much HBM Huawei has on hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMIC is unlikely to devote all of its 7 nm capacity to Ascend chips. Huawei needs that 7 nm capacity for its chips for smartphones, laptops, data centers, and telecommunications equipment. Moreover, SMIC has other customers besides Huawei. Still, the point remains that Huawei is likely poised to dramatically expand Ascend production in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, SMIC’s 7 nm yield will likely improve significantly above 20 percent due to the additional equipment and the increased production rate. It will likely not match the best TSMC 7 nm yields for AI chips, however, since TSMC’s best 7 nm yields used EUV, and China has no credible near-term path for acquiring EUV technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the mid and long term, however, Huawei is working aggressively to produce a domestic alternative to ASML EUV technology. Huawei currently has two semiconductor manufacturing equipment tool research facilities, one in Shanghai and one in Shenzhen. According to a report by Nikkei Asia, Huawei is investing $1.66 billion in the Shanghai facility alone and has hired a large number of chip industry veterans with experience working at companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, KLA, ASML, TSMC, Intel, and Micron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor Ogan, a venture capitalist based in Shenzhen, China, focused on investing in Chinese technology companies, described Huawei’s EUV efforts as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are teams at Huawei in two different parts of China that are working around the clock. . . . They are literally cut off from their friends and family just because the work they are doing is so sensitive, and imagine how quickly they’re going to accelerate Chinese complete domestic chip development. . . . One of them is in Shenzhen. That’s the bigger [EUV lithography] breakthrough lab, and you can look on Google Earth. There was nothing there and now there is something there, and there are thousands of people working there. The other one is around Shanghai and that is more for the next chips in the next phones. So, yeah, the bigger lithography breakthroughs are [being worked on] in Shenzhen. . . . They’re working their asses off. . . . This is like some of the smartest people in the space, and they’re all Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, these secretive efforts underway at Huawei are extremely likely to be benefitting from state-backed industrial espionage, including the cyberattacks on ASML and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;19-huaweis-ascend-chips-continue-to-face-challenges-in-terms-of-a-lack-of-compatible-ai-software-that-is-driving-low-utilization-of-purchased-chips-however-this-could-change-if-deepseeks-open-source-community-enthusiasm-improves-huaweis-cann-software-ecosystem-competitiveness-with-nvidias-cuda&quot;&gt;19. Huawei’s Ascend chips continue to face challenges in terms of a lack of compatible AI software that is driving low utilization of purchased chips. However, this could change if DeepSeek’s open-source community enthusiasm improves Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem competitiveness with Nvidia’s CUDA.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-quality recent analysis by Nicholas Welch, Lily Ottinger, and Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk concludes that China’s current compute shortage has more to do with practical challenges and suboptimal deployment—many idle small and medium data centers rather than fewer fully-utilized superclusters—than it does with an absolute shortage of chips. A combination of recent Chinese government policy changes, such as “hand[ing] over their idle computing resources to cloud providers” and strategic moves by China’s largest tech companies to favor DeepSeek models even over their in-house ones, suggests that this could change in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reporting by Caijing Magazine, the chips in China most likely to be underutilized are Huawei’s Ascends, which have benefitted in terms of government pressure to buy domestic but remain underutilized because of a lack of useful AI models that are Ascend-compatible. This could change if DeepSeek adapts its models to run on Ascends, which it is reportedly working toward for model inference, though not model training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-between-the-chip-dies-acquired-from-tsmc-the-stockpiled-hbm-and-smics-increasing-ascend-production-huawei-and-deepseek-have-a-credible-path-to-a-million-ascend-chip-ai-supercluster-should-they-seek-to-build-one-though-they-will-face-challenges-in-large-scale-chip-integration-and-software-frameworks&quot;&gt;20. Between the chip dies acquired from TSMC, the stockpiled HBM, and SMIC’s increasing Ascend production, Huawei and DeepSeek have a credible path to a million-Ascend-chip AI supercluster should they seek to build one, though they will face challenges in large scale chip integration and software frameworks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, sources told CSIS that TSMC has supplied Huawei with enough chip dies to manufacture a million Ascend 910C chips, each of which has roughly 60 percent the performance of an Nvidia H100 when used for inference. With the help of Huawei and the Chinese government, DeepSeek could plausibly succeed in driving a reallocation of the Nvidia H800s and H100s already in China toward itself for construction of a new AI model training data center. This could then be augmented by an additional, much larger cluster of Huawei Ascend 910Cs (or Nvidia H20s) to be used for AI model inference. Such a combination is a plausible, perhaps even likely, path for China to continue making significant progress in its AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, a million-chip cluster of Huawei Ascends would face the challenge of a shortage of AI models, software, and developer tools that are compatible with Huawei’s CANN software ecosystem. A second challenge is in integrating all of the chips as part of a single cluster where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Financial Times reporter Eleanor Olcott interviewed one Beijing-based chip investor who said “The bottleneck at the moment isn’t getting the chips but figuring out how to make them work in a cluster. This is really complicated work.” Evidently the true attractiveness of the Huawei Ascend 910C chips is worse than the “60 percent of H100” figure might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-us-firms-are-still-ahead-of-china-in-the-race-toward-human-level-artificial-general-intelligence-and-beyond-human-level-artificial-superintelligence-however-the-gap-has-narrowed-significantly-and-it-is-unrealistic-to-expect-a-lead-of-more-than-a-year-or-two-even-with-extremely-aggressive-export-controls&quot;&gt;21. U.S. firms are still ahead of China in the race toward human-level artificial general intelligence and beyond human-level artificial superintelligence. However, the gap has narrowed significantly, and it is unrealistic to expect a lead of more than a year or two, even with extremely aggressive export controls.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, in the absence of export controls, it is plausible that Chinese firms would have already surpassed their U.S. competitors in developing and deploying frontier AI models. It is likewise plausible that China might have already succeeded in driving widespread adoption of the Huawei Ascend chips, just as Huawei’s smartphone division, bolstered by internal chip designs, was looking poised to overtake Apple’s iPhone in China prior to the introduction of effective export controls in 2020. The export controls have done much to slow and complicate China’s technological rise and march toward their longstanding objective of technological self-sufficiency. They are still having a significant effect even now and are poised to have even greater impact in the future as U.S. firms benefit from Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips and as China likely remains stuck at the 7 nm technology node until and unless they develop a domestic EUV lithography capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s successes in substantial government investment, chip smuggling, exploiting gaps in U.S. export control coverage, completing in-country transfers of equipment, hiring talent with experience from leading international firms, reverse-engineering foreign technology, harnessing state-backed economic espionage, and producing genuine domestic innovation are a formidable combination. U.S. firms, working at maximum effort and with the benefit of all their own advantages, will still likely be the first to develop artificial general intelligence or artificial superintelligence. This should not, however, be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a meeting on February 17 between CCP Chairman Xi Jinping and Chinese technology executives, including DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told Xi that his previous concerns about the lack of domestic advanced semiconductor production and the damaging impacts of U.S. export controls had eased because of recent breakthroughs by Huawei and its partners. It is possible that he is referring to the aforementioned domestic equipment transfer to SMIC’s facility. Ren further said that he is leading a network of more than 2,000 Chinese companies that are collectively working to ensure that China achieves self-sufficiency of more than 70 percent across the entire semiconductor value chain by 2028. These predictions should be taken seriously and have enormous strategic implications beyond just the AI sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for AI, the key question remains the one that Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, has succinctly posed: “whether China will also be able to get millions of chips.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s success to date suggests that, at least for Huawei Ascend chips, the answer is that they will have millions of chips within the next year or two. Thankfully, these chips are, at present, dramatically lower performing than Nvidia ones for training advanced AI models; they are also supported by a much weaker software ecosystem with many complex issues that will likely take years to sort out. This is the time that the export controls have bought for the United States to win the race to AGI and then use that victory to try and build more durable strategic advantages. At this point, all the margin for sloppy implementation of export controls or tolerance of large-scale chip smuggling has already been consumed. There is no more time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

Tackling the politics and power dynamics that have exacerbated scarcity is the only way to tackle this existential issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In over a decade working as the director of the Middle East Desalination Research Center (MEDRC), a water diplomacy organization born out of the Middle East Peace Process, I have found that the solutions to water insecurity lie not just in technology, but in politics. I must have chaired more than 50 multilateral meetings on transboundary water in which external international experts advised that new data-sharing mechanisms or pieces of technology would overcome solely political problems. Countless engineers have proposed a new nexus for approaching Gaza’s water challenges. European scientists have encouraged new kinds of groundwater modeling to conclude the final status issue of water between Israel and Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But effective policies and projects in this field are not just about dams and pipelines. They are also about culture and power. We at MEDRC have learned this lesson painfully throughout the years. Established as part of the Middle East Peace Process in 1996, MEDRC is an international organization that brings together 11 member states—including the core parties to the conflict, Israel and Palestine—as joint owners, guarantors, and co-equal partners in a broader effort defined only by a formal mandate “to assist the Middle East Peace Process.” Through its work on transboundary environmental issues like water and climate change, MEDRC provides a unique framework for negotiations, based on absolute equality between partners. But in delivering on our mandate to be a model organization for states seeking to use transboundary environmental issues in the service of a peace process, we have learned that a political economy analysis is a far more useful tool than any engineer’s diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, ignoring politics can derail otherwise-worthy water management projects. It can blind us to the downsides of projects that, though sensible from a narrow engineering standpoint, have the potential to embed dependency, neocolonialism, or unfair power relations. In conflict zones, advancing a water-for-peace agenda without a clear political framework can do tremendous harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why this new volume, edited by Natasha Hall, is such a welcome and important contribution for governments and actors managing water resources and conflicts more broadly. Although the focus is on water, the lessons here can inform mediators, government officials, and aid agencies on policy responses to wide-ranging transboundary issues, from climate change and the water-energy-food nexus to international relations and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a series of case studies from across the Middle East, the authors featured in this volume underline the importance of addressing politics in tackling water management issues. All of the chapters highlight the need for more holistic, diverse, and multidisciplinary approaches to water and environmental management. Though the focus is on the Middle East and the case studies are localized, the themes are globally relevant and the issues raised can be found across all continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are no generalities, Western bias, or orientalism here. The case studies are comprehensive, detailed, and locally informed. A refreshing heterogeneity runs through the report, recognizing and reflecting the social, cultural, and economic diversity of the Middle East today. Though most countries in the region are considered water stressed or water scarce, the political economy of water is varied even within these countries. Water systems in parts of the Gulf, for instance, with plentiful energy resources to power reverse-osmosis seawater desalination, are very different from systems in parts of the Levant that primarily rely on scarce ground and surface waters and outdated water-sharing agreements with neighbors. The case studies underline how, in such a diverse and politically complex region, the failure to fully consider power structures and dynamics can cause projects to take significantly longer to be realized, or even fail entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centrality of good public administration also cuts across all chapters. The quality of interdepartmental coordination and diplomacy can be the difference between a bureaucratic veneer and an effective developmental action. For example, the importance of interagency cooperation is key, but siloed approaches are commonplace. Water mandates in the region tend to exist across multiple governmental ministries, including those covering water, environment, energy, and agriculture. But while these departments may work on the same projects, they tend to have very little engagement together, and the frameworks for them to do so are lacking. Encouraging donor and domestic investment in good public management is among the most catalytic steps a state can take to deliver effective environmental management policies and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies below also highlight a gap between what would logically or technically work and what works on the ground. This rational-reality gap has been a key theme from MEDRC’s work. For example, external donors and partners tend to drive agendas and policies that may seem like a good idea from a Western donor’s headquarters but may not reflect the reality on the ground. Jordan’s Red Sea–Dead Sea Conveyance pipeline, analyzed in Chapter 4, is an excellent example that will be studied for decades. This high-profile and well-funded project, while providing tangible benefits, would have created politically untenable dependency between Jordan and Israel and also side-stepped Palestinians’ need for water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at a transboundary level, the report highlights the urgent need for new multilateral mechanisms to address water management and wider environmental issues. Many transboundary efforts today are constrained by narrow and dated treaties. The highly politicized nature of water in the Middle East means that cooperation is often confined to narrow bilateral agreements that limit the potential to evolve and expand cooperation in the future. Overcoming that zero-sum game may also require a more comprehensive model that incorporates issues beyond water where cooperation is needed in order to level the playing field for downstream actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, ignoring politics is political. Doing so prevents a full analysis of the root causes and effects of water insecurity and hampers change. MEDRC’s work with the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the years has shown that the water crisis in Gaza, even before the current war, was a wholly political construct that cannot be understood or addressed outside that lens. In Jordan and Israel, the Red Sea–Dead Sea Conveyance pipeline failed because it did not address the real political fears, and the realities of the cold peace, between the two countries. In the Syrian civil war, the hand of politics has often been downplayed as a cause, in favor of broader explanations like climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This edited volume makes it very clear: water and environmental policies, projects, and processes impose a broad spectrum of socioeconomic, cultural, and political impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our analyses and actions, we must appreciate and factor in this complexity in order to implement politically feasible solutions. Ignoring how the water policies of donors, mediators, and governments embed existing unequal power structures or create new ones can potentially cause harm to citizens, the environment, and international peace and security. The lessons of this volume can help us adhere to the to the first rule of peacebuilding and development: do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of water scarcity and conflict in the Middle East is an old one. Since 2500 BCE, the vast majority of documented violent incidents related to water have been in the Middle East and North Africa—442 by the count of the Pacific Institute. From ancient aqueducts to modern water systems, technology has allowed communities to develop water resources despite aridity and intervals of drought. But for all of technology’s miracles, governance and politics play a crucial role. Today, the region has access to more advanced technology for discovering and exploiting water resources than ever before. Yet communities continue to face extreme water insecurity. Violence over water is increasing, and conflict is impeding the ability to reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidly growing populations, along with failures to effectively manage water and waste, have brought many countries to a precipice. According to the Iraqi government, the average flow of the once-mighty Tigris and Euphrates Rivers has declined 70 percent over the past century. The great man-made lakes of central Iraq, al Habbaniyah and al Razzaza, have all but disappeared. The Khabur River in Syria has been reduced to a mere dribble of sewage. And the legendary Jordan River is little more than a trickle by the time it reaches its eponymous country. The water level of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan River discharges, has dropped the equivalent of a seven-story building since the year 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Satellite Images of Surface Water of Lake Habbaniyah, Iraq, August 2020 vs. August 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is just above ground. The reduction in groundwater has been at least as dramatic. As surface water declines due to man-made diversions and climate change, countries increasingly look to the water underneath them for relief. One study, prepared jointly by NASA and the University of California Irvine, showed a decrease of 144 cubic kilometers—nearly the volume of Lake Tahoe—in the volume of the region’s fresh water between 2003 and 2009 alone. It was one of the largest liquid freshwater losses on Earth during this six-year period. Most of those fresh water declines in the region have been due to groundwater reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Changes in Groundwater Storage in the Middle East and North Africa, 2002 vs. 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change and population growth threaten to exacerbate these trends. The same study showed that 20 percent of freshwater losses were due to a decrease in snowmelt and soil moisture—both of which will continue to decline with climate change. While population growth appears to be leveling off in some places, the countries most vulnerable to climate change—like Iraq and Yemen—will continue to see sky-high increases. Both populations are expected to nearly double by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States in the Middle East also struggle with cooperative and sustainable transboundary water management. Although 60 percent of surface waters are transboundary, and all countries share at least one aquifer, effective water-sharing agreements are few and far between. Rather than a driver of sustainable and equitable cooperation, water has been a source of major tension in the region. In the 1980s, Egyptian foreign minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali famously warned that the next war would be fought over the waters of the Nile. In the 1990s, peace agreements like the Oslo Accords pledged to deal with shared water resources, but many major promises were never implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major interstate wars did not come to pass, but in the following years governments became increasingly possessive of scarcer resources, with water becoming entangled in interstate hostilities and frictions. Responding to criticism regarding Turkey’s plans to build massive dams along the Euphrates, President Süleyman Demirel said in 1992 that “neither Syria or Iraq can lay claim to Turkey’s rivers any more than Ankara could claim their oil. This is a matter of sovereignty. We have a right to do anything we like. . . . They cannot say they share our water resources.” In turn, the Syrian government did not go to war over water, but for decades it did provide support and sanctuary to the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) to conduct raids on Turkey in retaliation for the dam-building undertaken as part of Ankara’s Southeastern Anatolian Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States in the Middle East also struggle with cooperative and sustainable transboundary water management. Although 60 percent of surface waters are transboundary, and all countries share at least one aquifer, effective water-sharing agreements are few and far between.9 Rather than a driver of sustainable and equitable cooperation, water has been a source of major tension in the region. In the 1980s, Egyptian foreign minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali famously warned that the next war would be fought over the waters of the Nile.10 In the 1990s, peace agreements like the Oslo Accords pledged to deal with shared water resources, but many major promises were never implemented.

Increasing water insecurity, and the reality that transboundary cooperation may not be forthcoming, has forced states to look inward at their water usage. Though most countries in the region are water insecure, water management policies have historically fostered a sense of abundance. Reversing course on decades of unsustainable water management practices has proven to be a monumental task, as those practices are intertwined with increasingly complex and dangerous political environments. For decades, governments across the region have heavily subsidized—if not freely provided—food, energy, and water in return for loyalty. In the minds of many government officials, curbing water usage by increasing costs or enforcing restrictions would be a threat to political stability. As a result, governments continued to delay the inevitable, failing to fully enact reforms and instead seeking to find new sources of water. Now, those sources, in turn, are running dry or becoming contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, two events violently shook the region: the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Arab Spring of 2011. Water reforms were put on hold for the foreseeable future. The ensuing conflicts, forced displacement, and wartime corruption continue to plague the region. Even where violent conflict has overturned established power structures in the past two decades, the historical hallmarks of governance in the region—patronage and predation—have reemerged in the wake of the Arab Spring and are now wreaking havoc on water security. In good times, governments or local authorities rely on patronage, including cheap or free basic services like water for loyalty and stability. In bad times, authorities become more predatory, as scarcity forces powerful stakeholders to restrict these widespread benefits in order to maintain their own lifestyles. As times get harder, the number of beneficiaries of patronage decreases and benefits that were previously enjoyed diminish. Water goes from being free or cheap to nonexistent or exorbitantly expensive. Authorities resort to harsher, more oppressive measures to maintain power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years of avoiding tough decisions on water usage—both at the national and transboundary levels—have now come to a head in the Middle East. Understanding how to overcome this challenge requires a more robust analysis not only of how this situation came to be, but of the stakeholders and vested interests that developed over time and the negotiations necessary to move forward. Injecting these considerations into this analysis of water reforms is not meant to further securitize the issue or encourage political instability. On the contrary, dealing with the politics of water could allow countries to prevent the full-blown crises that are occurring today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the interests of various stakeholders allows governments, civil society organizations, and aid agencies to triage politically feasible steps to water security. This requires an in-depth analysis of each country case. Though many countries have similar histories of water usage—and though the technical and economic solutions for water insecurity are fairly clear—the political, cultural, and economic landscapes of these countries are dramatically different today. Protracted and internationalized conflicts throughout the region have further complicated matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving water security is significantly more challenging in areas already affected by war, where people tend to be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For this reason, all of the case studies in this volume are conflict-affected, but the recommendations for each are starkly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries that are heavily dependent on humanitarian aid, like Yemen and Syria, are unable to address the full scope of the problem due to legal, financial, and political issues. As a result, the humanitarian community—a sector that is growing alongside the protracted crises in the region—has been forced to expand its mandate in order to provide basic services for longer periods. Emergency aid, however, cannot address the political drivers of water insecurity. As such, long-term dependence on aid can have deleterious effects on water resources. Unable to overcome transboundary issues, war economies, and power imbalances, aid agencies resort to water trucking, drilling for groundwater, and handing out solar pumps. In the meantime, wastewater or sewage is often ejected into waterways without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state actors with uncertain political futures and difficult relationships with the international community control northeastern Syria and the Yemeni highlands, the first two case studies covered in this volume. Efforts to work around these non-state armed groups to enhance water security have been inadequate. In these cases, the international community tends to wait for a peace agreement or shift in control. But it is unclear when either conflict will resolve, or if any peace agreement would improve water policies. Authors Dr. Mohammad Al-Saidi and Lyse Mauvais make recommendations for what can be done in the near term and how water could be built into longer-term negotiations for peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study of Iraq, a country that has been affected by years of war and sanctions, is a tragic example of how, in the context of an imperfect peace, money does not buy water security. Accustomed to centuries of water abundance, many Iraqi farmers continue to practice traditional flood agriculture. Water is still nearly free, but times have changed, especially in the downstream Basra governorate. As upstream communities divert water and build dams, the flow of the mighty Tigris and Euphrates decreases, leaving southern Iraq with increasingly saline soil and cracked mud flats, rather than the abundant waters of the past. Meanwhile, remnants of conflict, in the form of endemic corruption and infrastructural neglect, have severely inhibited the country’s ability to withstand both climate change and reduced river flows from upstream neighbors. The challenges of systemic change in Iraq are so daunting that fellow authors, Dr. Hassan al Janabi and Maha Yassin, argue that the Basra governorate should prioritize rehabilitating drinking water networks and accommodating newly urbanized communities to improve health outcomes and avoid increasing societal tensions. While providing recommendations for agricultural water use and transboundary negotiations, the authors note that the political obstacles are significant, but that other steps can be taken now to address immediate and long-term needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan, one of the most arid countries in the world, has a stable government but still struggles with constant external shocks to its water supplies, as refugees from neighboring countries have arrived in the hundreds of thousands for nearly a century. Unreliable transboundary neighbors have also strained Jordan’s resources and ability to manage dwindling water resources. Dr. Neda Zawahri makes the case for how the Jordanian government, in cooperation with civil society, can begin to implement reforms that have long been delayed. She also argues that given the country’s precarious position, Jordan and its benefactors need to build up the country’s own independent sources of water to make it more resilient to contentious regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renowned scholars, engineers, and aid organizations have written innumerable reports on water insecurity in the Middle East. Many of them note the environmental and human consequences of the failure to adapt to scarcity, rehashing standard technical and policy solutions to water insecurity. But projects based solely on technical solutions have either failed altogether or even worsened sustainability and equity when confronted with political realities. Other experts and government officials have lamented those political realities and delayed taking measures to chip away at the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This volume takes a different approach. The authors convincingly argue that waiting for a ripe moment to address water insecurity in the Middle East would simply allow the issue to become an existential threat—for many, it already is. Yet they do not shy away from the political challenges involved. Rather, those obstacles are woven into the potential solutions they offer. Their recommendations are not silver bullets, but they are politically feasible when pursued through the appropriate steps. Rather than circumvent conflict and power imbalances, stakeholders can take the steps recommended here to improve water security and equity. They can acknowledge those challenges and provide effective incentives to relevant parties to change behavior, linking water to other important issues such as trade and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of the incentives, limitations, and influence of political and economic stakeholders in water security—from water companies and powerful farmers to donor states and local communities—will allow governments, civil society groups, and aid agencies to craft realistic policies to address this increasingly existential challenge. The pages that follow suggest what those policies could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, poor neighborhoods in the Syrian city of Qamishli revived an old ritual commonly practiced in rural villages across northeastern Syria. They paraded “rain brides” made of scrap fabric through the streets, begging for rain to come and for a good harvest that would keep the price of bread, meat, and dairy within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The northeastern Syrian countryside usually provides 60 percent of Syria’s wheat, but from the summer of 2021 to February 2023 it remained largely lifeless, stricken by drought. In many areas there was not a single shrub or tuft of wild grass in the fields. Vast expanses of parched baal (the local term for non-irrigated agricultural land) stretched to the horizon, broken here and there only by patches of irrigated wheat, islands of life in the desert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summers of 2021 and 2022, the national wheat harvest plummeted to a quarter of the prewar average due to drought, limiting the availability of bread. Skyrocketing inflation has left meat and dairy increasingly out of reach for most families, who now rely on subsidized, state-baked bread as their lifeline. Farmers in northeastern Syria grew angry and increasingly desperate, while millions of other Syrians went hungry. As of April 2024, the World Food Programme (WFP) estimated that 12.9 million people in Syria were still food insecure, including 3.1 million who were severely food insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the countryside, many fields remained fallow as Arab and Kurdish farmers grumbled about the high cost of fertilizers, pesticides, and the fuel needed to operate the water pumps that irrigated their land. Farmers went into debt to cope with these rising costs, hoping to increase dwindling yields. To their dismay, water levels also dropped in riverbeds, dams, and irrigation wells due to the lack of rain. In some areas, the water table dropped so low that watering crops cost more than letting them die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pastoralists have been even worse off. Barley—a primarily rain-fed fodder crop—also failed in 2021 and 2022, and there was little straw left from other cereal harvests as an alternative. Market-sold barley became scarce, with prices soaring by over 40 percent in the summer of 2022. Even the wild plants that normally provide some pasture in winter withered away. Many herders were forced to sell their sheep at a discount, rather than letting them die of hunger. In northern Hasakah province, for instance, an extended family of 20 members, displaced from the Raqqa countryside in 2020, lost their entire herd of 500 sheep to hunger and disease over two years. To get by, they work in menial day jobs in nearby villages and farmed other peoples’ land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most worrisome manifestation of this crisis has been the despair of agricultural engineers, NGO staff, and local officials, who have been all equally at a loss for solutions. “If the weather becomes permanently like this, we will need to start looking for alternatives. Probably an alternative country,” sighed a senior agricultural official in the Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), the de-facto government that controls most of the country’s northeast. His half-hearted humor highlights the existential threat of water insecurity for the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma for aid workers and local officials in northeastern Syria is that there is no apolitical roadmap for achieving water security. Syria’s water crisis was and remains inextricably linked to the 13-year-long war that followed the 2011 revolution, and to geopolitical tensions with neighboring Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bid to secure access to water and electricity, Ankara has built dozens of dams along the Euphrates River and its three main tributaries that flow into Syria, limiting the flow of water downstream. To make matters worse, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and its civil branch, the AANES, are connected to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey considers a terrorist organization and national security threat. To weaken the SDF, Turkey has not only restricted access to water but also systematically targeted oil infrastructure in northeastern Syria, severely exacerbating water and soil pollution while limiting farmers’ access to fuel for irrigation. Turkish-backed opposition factions controlling other areas in northeastern Syria also regularly deprive the roughly one million residents of Hasakah, one of the region’s biggest cities, of tap water through their control of water-related infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of drought, climate change, and Turkey’s actions, the Euphrates River has dropped to historic lows since 2020, crippling the supply of irrigation water and electricity from hydroelectric dams. The river is Syria’s lifeline, historically providing 85 percent of its renewable water. But what remains of it today is so polluted by sewage and agricultural runoff that cholera, a previously eradicated waterborne disease, re-emerged in the country during the war. So far, widespread thirst and famine have been averted by aggressive use of the area’s remaining groundwater resources and by the trucking of water to the worst-hit areas—but these solutions are hardly sustainable in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the international community has lost interest in Syria’s intertwined water and humanitarian crises. In early 2024, humanitarian needs were only 37 percent funded, which led the UN World Food Programme in January 2024 to limit food assistance to cover just 5.6 million Syrians—a quarter of the prewar population covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there have been unprecedented changes since then. The Assad dynasty, which ruled Syria with an iron fist for over five decades, fell unlocking unprecedented hopes for peace and political change—but also deep anxieties about the future of the country. Future humanitarian trends are difficult to predict in this tumultuous context, but a steady stream of funding for the water sector is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northeastern Syria enjoys credible prospects of political stability and economic recovery, which could have positive effects on the rest of the country. But the future of this de-facto government, the AANES, is uncertain, seeing as Turkish-backed opposition factions hostile to the SDF control ever-greater swathes of northern Syria. Along with diminishing Western interest in the Middle East, this political instability threatens to allow the water crisis to spiral out of control—along with both Syria’s food security and regional security. The failure to manage this crisis highlights the central challenge in dealing with food and water security in Syria: how to foster water governance during a protracted conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain how northeastern Syria got to this point, this chapter begins by providing background on Syria’s water usage and policies prior to the 2011 revolution and charting how the ongoing water crisis has intersected with the current conflict. The chapter’s second section explains how the current political landscape shapes local and international responses to the water crisis. It argues that although humanitarian assistance and remittances are keeping some Syrians afloat, the lack of coordination between the AANES, donor governments, and aid organizations hinders the implementation of comprehensive solutions to the region’s multifaceted water issues. Worse, current aid interventions are contributing to unsustainable outcomes, including the depletion of Syria’s groundwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter concludes with a series of steps that those interested in the stability of Turkey, Syria, and Iraq could take to avert a major calamity—involving more political will, longer-term planning, and better coordination with local actors. As the breadbasket of the country, the future for millions of Syrians hangs precariously on the northeast’s ability to secure its water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;northeastern-syrias-complex-water-crisis&quot;&gt;Northeastern Syria’s Complex Water Crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A HISTORY OF MISMANAGEMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2020–2023 drought has tested the resilience of Syrian farmers in unprecedented ways, but their ability to cope was jeopardized from the start by a legacy of public mismanagement. Long before the 2011 revolution, Syria’s water resources were already being squandered, largely due to the Syrian government’s agricultural policies. Historically, the semi-arid ecosystems of northeastern Syria supported livelihoods centered on mobile pastoralism and rain-fed farming, not the large-scale intensive agriculture of today. This agricultural transition, which started under the French Mandate in the 1920s, sharply accelerated from the 1960s to the 1980s under the leadership of the Ba‘ath party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eyeing food sovereignty, the Syrian government supported modern agriculture on a large scale, centralized the distribution of seeds and inputs, and encouraged massive investments in infrastructure and irrigation via loans to farmers. Government subsidies allocated support to farmers based on the surface area of irrigated land they farmed, thereby encouraging them to switch from rain-fed agriculture to irrigation, even in areas with no access to surface water. As a result, the drilling of private wells grew exponentially. The initial goal of the subsidies was to enhance Syria’s food security through increased wheat production and to support the country’s cotton-based textile industry, but it perversely led farmers to abandon local drought-resistant seeds and become increasingly dependent on irrigation, a trend that has accelerated in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These policies allowed Syria to become a net exporter of wheat while simultaneously increasing the production of cash crops like tobacco and cotton. But they also made farmers reliant on modern varieties of wheat designed to thrive under irrigated conditions and with chemical inputs. As a result, irrigated agricultural surfaces expanded eightfold from 1990 to 2000, eventually reaching around 360,000 hectares in Hasakah province before the war. Agricultural irrigation is the top source of water usage in Syria today, representing around 85 percent of national consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p9Go9RP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Increase in Irrigated Land, 1961–2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to large-scale irrigation was neither profitable for the government—which heavily subsidized agriculture—nor sustainable. In the early 2000s, the springs feeding the Khabur River, a key tributary of the Euphrates, went partially dry due to overpumping in the transboundary aquifer between Syria and Turkey. Consequences were dire for Assyrian, Arab, and Kurdish farming communities in this crucial basin. Then, between 2006 and 2009, a drought hit, exposing the vulnerabilities created by the government’s water and agricultural policies. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave northeastern Syria, and most received little to no assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, conflict, droughts, and displacement have exacerbated the crisis. Groundwater wells became essential survival tools as the Khabur dried and the flow of the Euphrates decreased. Many AANES officials see the Khabur as a cautionary tale, fearing that other river basins will suffer a similar fate as groundwater pumping intensifies across the region, both for agriculture and drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE WATER CRISIS COLLIDES WITH THE CONFLICT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s water crisis captured media attention in late 2020, when low and erratic rainfall, along with higher-than-average temperatures, began to devastate agricultural production in northeastern Syria. By 2021, rainfall plummeted to 50–70 percent below Syria’s historical average. The following winter rainfall decreased to 75–92 percent below average in the northeast. This had a devastating and immediate impact on wheat production, 50 percent of which is rain-fed across Syria—a proportion that rises to 70 percent in the northeast, and up to 85 percent in Hasakah province. In 2021 and 2022, wheat yields reached historic lows of around 1 million tons—just a quarter of the prewar average. These numbers were also well below the amount of wheat—3.2 million tons—needed to feed the 15 million Syrians living in government-held areas, let alone the 2.6 million living in AANES regions and the 4.4 million in opposition-held territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the rains returned in 2023, a healthy season is likely to become the exception rather than the rule. Recent studies predict that droughts are 25 times more likely to occur in Syria today due to global temperature increases linked to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, irrigation and drinking water are under threat for other reasons. Turkey’s upstream damming has caused drastic reductions in the flow of the Euphrates River and its tributaries, which have long been a lifeline for agricultural communities in northeastern Syria. Based on transboundary water-sharing agreements, Ankara must release 500 cubic meters of water per second to Syria, yet that volume has dropped to under 200 cubic meters according to Syrian dam authorities. Although over five million people in Syria directly depend on the Euphrates for drinking water (alongside millions more in downstream Iraq), Turkey shows no sign of loosening its stranglehold on the river. Adding to these challenges, Turkish-backed factions have, over the past four years, repeatedly interrupted the operations of Alouk water station, which supplies drinking water to around a million people in Hasakah province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WATER GOVERNANCE IN NORTHEASTERN SYRIA TODAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 years of war, Syria gradually split into three main zones: Syrian government-controlled territory in the south and central areas of the country, opposition-controlled areas in the northwest, and AANES-controlled areas in the northeast. This territorial division persisted for several years until the beginning of December 2024, when a rebel offensive that initiated in the northwestern province of Idlib toppled the Syrian government over the course of a few days. Among the galaxy of opposition groups that remained active in Syria throughout the war are also several Turkish-backed opposition groups, who were contained during most of the war along the northern border with Turkey. In December 2024, these groups markedly expanded east into AANES-controlled territory, prompting new waves of displacement toward AANES-controlled northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the war, the internationally recognized government headquartered in Damascus and the main governing authority in northwestern Idlib province were subject to sanctions by the United States and its Western partners; while the AANES, which is the local partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, enjoyed steadier access to stabilization and early recovery funding. As of December 2024, the leading rebel faction now in control of Damascus remains sanctioned internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, sandwiched between Turkey and the Syrian army for around a decade, the AANES has historically been heavily dependent on the military presence of the United States to ensure its survival. It is also not an internationally recognized government, a fact that limits its capacity to engage with foreign partners. It does not have the ability to openly sell oil internationally. Most aid funding is channeled through NGOs rather than to the AANES directly. Many donors also have strict red lines that prevent their partners from transferring funds or equipment to the AANES or working face-to-face with its departments, fearing this would aggravate Ankara and constitute a violation of Damascus’s sovereignty. However, those red lines are also not entirely coherent, which has confused and frustrated NGOs, local authorities, and beneficiaries. Some donor governments, for example, ask their partners to work only with nominally independent agricultural cooperatives rather than AANES agricultural departments. Others are amenable to some degree of collaboration and capacity building with AANES, as long as material transfers are avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These policies are partially a result of ongoing uncertainty about the political future of the area. As U.S. leaders renew promises to disengage from Syria over the long term, donor governments and Turkey have no reason to invest politically in the current status quo. But as they wait to see how governance will evolve in the coming years, the situation grows more precarious. In the meantime, a constellation of stabilization and humanitarian actors, local authorities, and international donors operates in a splintered policy landscape that is not conducive to improving water security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE AANES: WALKING A TIGHTROPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main water management stakeholder in northeastern Syria before the fall of the Assad regime was the AANES: the most recent iteration of a governing coalition of Kurdish, Assyrian, and Arab parties established during the campaign to defeat the Islamic State in northeastern and eastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its non-state status, AANES agricultural institutions essentially mimic the highly centralized bureaucracies of the former Syrian regime. Agricultural and irrigation departments closely oversee the distribution of water from canals and issue yearly “agricultural plans” to farmers. These contain detailed breakdowns of wheat and other crops that each farmer is requested to plant. Based on this, agricultural departments then allocate subsidized seeds, fertilizers, and fuel to each farmer. Rationing the fuel used to operate private wells, water pumps, and tractors allows the AANES to control both agricultural production and water usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But donor governments and NGOs see this deeply ingrained centralization of agriculture as an obstacle to promoting new, more sustainable practices among farmers. The AANES wields tremendous influence over not only farmers’ habits, but also their appetite for change. “Farmers are used to this system where they receive what they need and sell what they produce [to the state],” one donor said. This hinders efforts to promote alternative crops or irrigation methods. Many farmers prefer sticking to crops that the AANES subsidizes and promotes because doing so gives them guaranteed access to cheaper inputs and a sale price set each year by the AANES. Experimenting with new crops means taking on financial risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AANES has been understandably wary of changing the model. Because farmers have been socialized to expect a high degree of support from the state (now, the AANES), their resentment is quick to grow against perceived shortcomings of political elites. “Agriculture is a losing business,” said a Kurdish investor cultivating several rain-fed and irrigated cereal fields in Hasakah. “Farmers can only benefit with state support.” Even in Kurdish areas of rural Hasakah, which suffered the most under the Assad regime, farmers occasionally express nostalgia for its agricultural institutions, which are often idealized (now that they are gone) as better at defending their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the political tightrope that the AANES walks with the local population and regional opponents, the administration is unlikely to change its agricultural policies without backing from international benefactors like the United States—backing that is more uncertain than ever before. Thus, the AANES lacks the political will to regulate farmers’ water use, even though most aid actors see this as a priority. Agricultural wells are not metered, and AANES officials do not enforce existing regulations out of fear of political pushback in rural areas. “For now, we tell farmers to use the pumps for 12 hours per day maximum, and we give them just enough subsidized fuel to do that. But we cannot enforce it. It’s only an instruction,” one official from Hasakah’s agriculture department admitted. In the fall of 2022, the AANES issued a ban on drilling new irrigation boreholes in order to protect groundwater at the height of the drought. But it could not actually enforce this rule, and wells continued to be drilled in the open. In such a weak regulatory landscape, the impact of aid is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AANES also lacks the technical capacity to repair water infrastructure and monitor water quality and quantity. Of the roughly 80 wells that are used exclusively to monitor groundwater levels and quality in AANES-controlled areas, all but six were out of order in 2023, according to Hasakah’s water department. Those six were rehabilitated only in 2022 by an international NGO planning to carry out northeastern Syria’s first hydrological baseline assessment since the early 2000s. But even this assessment may be of little immediate use to AANES staff, most of whom are not trained to use the devices and lack the transportation and fuel needed to visit the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A CHAOTIC AID POLICY LANDSCAPE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, a plethora of foreign aid actors have been paying increasing attention to early recovery and development needs by funding water-wise irrigation techniques, fodder production, seed distribution, and the solarization of wells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while beneficiaries welcome the projects, these interventions have done little to transform the systemic causes of water insecurity. “There is low awareness overall in the aid sector on what is needed to respond to this crisis,” said one official working at an organization that helps NGOs coordinate their efforts. “Many NGOs prefer to support farmers with immediate solutions rather than wait and invest in long-term solutions. And anyway, there are very few long-term options open to us due to the very nature of humanitarian funding cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NGO projects are uncoordinated because “people don’t talk to each other,” as one donor put it. “Even if there are coordination mechanisms in place, NGOs often have restrictions from their donors, and there is competition between actors in the field—so information is withheld for various reasons.” To make matters worse, there is no coordinated strategy to monitor the water used across humanitarian interventions, which means NGOs and donors are running simultaneous projects to drill or repair boreholes without a clear picture of the state of groundwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aid sector has, to its credit, tried to maintain aging and damaged infrastructure. NGOs run many projects to rehabilitate irrigation infrastructure and water canals—particularly in Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor—that were destroyed in the war against the Islamic State. Yet many of these networks are becoming less useful to farmers as the flow of water in nearby rivers decreases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some NGOs now focus on retrofitting water pump stations, adapting them to lower water levels in riverbeds. They also encourage individuals and communities to save water through modern irrigation methods, as opposed to the ancestral practice of flooding fields periodically. But while these interventions can help certain communities cope with reduced access to water, they have a limited impact. Donors recognize that Syria’s prewar irrigation networks are too large and interconnected to be rehabilitated by NGOs alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there are other overlooked dimensions of the water crisis that require longer-term interventions and coordination with the AANES. Little has been done, for example, to address rampant water pollution through improved waste management or wastewater treatment, or to build the AANES’s capacity to regulate imports of pesticides and fertilizer. Yet the pollution of surface and groundwater resources is a major threat hovering over Syria, as contaminated aquifers may become unsuitable for drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE LIMITS OF THE CURRENT RESPONSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As both climate change and Turkish politics are out of the hands of the AANES, aid actors, and the government in Damascus, their responses to the water crisis have focused on immediate solutions to increase the availability of drinking water and irrigation in the short run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this supply-driven strategy is now reaching its limits. Wells drilled haphazardly in recent years to supply communities with drinking water were often dug improperly, created too close together and with no technical oversight from local authorities. In Hasakah city, residents have even started drilling wells in their gardens and backyards to make up for municipal water shortages. “When they saw that the drought was continuing for a third year in 2023, more people started drilling,” said one cereal farmer in the countryside of Hasakah. “We’ve had several droughts in the past,” he added, “but we always managed to cope by irrigating and using extra fertilizers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet groundwater abstraction is not a magic solution to the current crisis. In many places, the intensification of well-drilling threatens groundwater resources. When boreholes are drilled too closely together, their proximity creates imbalances in water-table pressure, disrupting the distribution of water in the aquifer. In some cases, the boreholes stop producing water. This is due not to a natural drop in the water table but to interferences from nearby boreholes that prevent the water from rising up as it normally should. Haphazard well-drilling also increases the risk of groundwater pollution: every new borehole is another avenue through which aquifers can be contaminated. Practitioners and experts acknowledge that these practices must be urgently regulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite growing concerns about groundwater abstraction, the AANES has quelled farmers’ discontent by maintaining historical fuel subsidies that enable them to pump water from licensed wells. In parallel, many NGOs are now providing solar panels to assist the pumping of water from community-owned wells. These solarization projects, meant to help communities and farmers access water at a lower cost and with less pollution, raise concerns among some AANES officials that expanding access to solar energy will drive over-pumping, since subsidized fuel is currently the AANES’s only means of controlling how much water farmers can pump. Within the aid sector, many experienced local staff share these doubts. And although the private sector supplies many of these solar panels, NGOs’ solarization projects still have an impact on both water use and the long-term management of discarded panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another downside of current humanitarian projects is that they still focus primarily on farmers using irrigation—via support for seeds, farming techniques, alternative crops, fuel distributions, and irrigation—but they have little to offer livestock herders or farmers using rain-fed agriculture, who are most vulnerable to drought. “Our preferred beneficiaries are irrigated farmers, and the ones who need our interventions the most are non-irrigated ones,” a senior staff member at an NGO coordination platform summarized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many NGOs have understandable difficulties designing projects suited for rain-fed farmers. Such projects could include insurance schemes in case of harvest failures, which would ensure these farmers continue to plant rainfed crops, an essential source of animal feed. To help pastoralists, the aid sector could improve and expand distributions of veterinary medicine and feed, which often come too little, too late, according to these communities. Aid donors could also pursue longer-term projects to replant wild shrubs, restore wild rangelands—vast swathes of which are overgrazed—and rehabilitate boreholes in rangelands that once served nomadic herders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, aid actors and AANES officials are aware that many of their interventions have been inadequate at best, and unsustainable at worst. But with a lack of a longer-term vision that confronts the structural causes of the water crisis, NGOs continue to implement these small-scale projects. “We can’t work directly with local authorities, and we cannot engage with the big actors like Turkey, the AANES, and the Assad regime to effectively ensure a bigger supply of water,” a Western government donor said. “So our focus is on . . . localized interventions that don’t need coordination with the AANES.” But most stakeholders, from farmers to aid actors, know that these are temporary solutions that will be unable to prevent a full-blown crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rethinking-approaches-to-water-in-northeastern-syria&quot;&gt;Rethinking Approaches to Water in Northeastern Syria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a new strategy, Syria’s water crisis seems doomed to spiral further out of control. Even if abundant rainfall in coming years alleviates some pressure on water resources, the current situation suggests a grim future for water in Syria. The good news is that there are options to reform the current approach to the water crisis—options that would provide adequate incentives for behavioral change among actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LESSONS OF THE PAST COULD HERALD A BRIGHTER FUTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the region’s de-facto government—equipped with institutions, good agricultural extension services, and a strong interest in bolstering the region’s economic and social stability—the AANES has been the actor most likely to have an impact on water use and users. However, any governing body will have to tackle the same challenges that the AANES faced. The AANES experience provides valuable lessons. The fall of Assad and the subsequent potential to open up the country to investment create new much-needed possibilities as well. However, if aid actors continue to follow a short-term aid approach, the next crisis could quickly spiral out of control for this fragile and food-insecure country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the AANES has avoided directly regulating water use (through measures like metering systems and taxes) due to fear of popular backlash, much like other governments mentioned in this volume. But with stronger financial incentives, offered through agricultural loans and subsidies, a government could expand water-wise irrigation methods and shift away from the water-intensive monoculture that is detrimental to pastoral ecosystems and soil quality. In coordination, the international donor community could also support staff in efforts to monitor the quality and quantity of water resources, particularly groundwater. This support could be particularly targeted to heavily water-stressed areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AANES officials have shown great eagerness—to the point of desperation—for new solutions to the water crisis. Any future government is likely to do the same. Scaling up NGO interventions such as agricultural loans, which donors could partly fund, would be a welcome intervention. Donors and future investors will also need to support efforts to monitor groundwater levels and quality, as well as tackle water pollution from sources like pesticides and fertilizers, oil extraction and refining, and the unregulated dumping of solid waste. The AANES is still fighting wars on all fronts and uncertain of its political future. Its Board of Environment says these issues “are not priorities” in the current context. That is unlikely to change, as the Kurdish dominated government faces a more uncertain future than ever before. However, any government will need to stabilize the situation and ensure equity for all stakeholders in order to keep the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mix of financial and technical supports are the key entry points through which donors can influence Syrian water policies. Such assistance could start with capacity building and technical support for water and agricultural departments. These efforts could also be directed toward limiting the import and use of low-quality agricultural inputs, which have replaced the state-issued fertilizers produced in Homs before the war. “Chinese companies have flooded the market with products we don’t know, and there is no one to monitor their effects,” a cereal farmer in rural Hasakah said in 2023. Many other farmers and agricultural unions echoed these complaints. “Before, these things were provided by and certified by the state, and we didn’t have to worry about their quality.” Many farmers, agricultural union members, and AANES officials believe testing labs are needed to monitor the quality of imports now sold on the market. Such labs could allow aid actors and government officials to regulate, or at least raise awareness about, low-quality products that pose the most direct risks to health and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the fall of Assad, there is also a chance for sanctions to be lifted or lightened, encouraging much-needed investment in the sector. Even more positively, there is a greater possibility of the Syrian economy once again becoming connected. With support to rehabilitate refineries and an agreement to equitably share oil revenues, Syria’s makeshift oil drilling and refining could also be a thing of the past, allowing the ground that farmers depend on to finally be cleared of toxic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ROLE OF DONORS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western donors have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars over the years into stabilization and early recovery projects in northern and eastern Syria. In 2023, under the umbrella of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) started mobilizing $42 million to support agriculture in non-regime-controlled areas of Syria, $28 million for livelihood projects, and $50 million for governance, infrastructure, economic recovery, and civil society projects. The United States and its partners spent billions more in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Syria’s Western donors have also been losing interest in the region, making future funding uncertain and long-term programming impossible. The short span of humanitarian and stabilization funding—two years at most—drives NGOs to pursue short-term interventions based on donors’ current whims and geographic priorities, rather than thought-out strategies. While they may satisfy donors’ priorities, these projects largely fail to address the root causes of the water crisis and may even make things worse by contributing to unmonitored pumping from Syria’s depleted groundwater reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donor governments have a big role to play in redesigning current aid and stabilization programs in ways that factor in the impacts of both climate change and Turkey’s damming. Large donors could work jointly to ensure that NGOs abide by strict principles to do no harm to water supplies. This may mean investing more resources in hydrological assessments and in the rehabilitation of monitoring wells. Large donors could also push for better coordination among the stakeholders they fund, to ensure that data on all existing water resources (especially groundwater) is shared among implementing partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing no harm also means improving waste management across all aid programming. After 13 years of war, virtually no attention has been paid to the management of solid waste from camps hosting internally displaced persons (IDPs), which is dumped in open-air informal landfills that are sometimes located close to potable water wells or drain into springs and river beds. At the very least, NGOs responsible for waste management should ensure that waste is disposed of in areas far from riverbeds and important groundwater reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRIORITIZING DIPLOMACY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Turkey’s outsized role in Syria’s water woes, donor engagement on technical fixes must go hand-in-hand with attempts by Western states to engage Ankara on transboundary water sharing. Restoring—or at least increasing—some of the Euphrates’ flow is the most immediate and effective way to alleviate Syria’s water crisis and lift pressure on groundwater resources, which should remain the country’s best-guarded asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But exerting any influence over Turkey’s policy is difficult. Local NGOs have called for establishing “an impartial and independent monitoring mechanism for transboundary water resources shared by Syria, Türkiye, and Iraq to oversee the three States’ compliance with signed agreements,” supporting dialogue between the three countries. Such a mechanism is unlikely to exert any significant influence on Turkey, but its findings may at least serve as a basis for donor governments—fellow NATO members—to advocate for better water sharing with Ankara.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, donors, potential investors, and local stakeholders will not be incentivized to invest in better management of Syria’s water resources if Turkey or any other warring party continues to systemically target the country’s energy and water infrastructure. Turkey has attacked this infrastructure multiple times over the years. In January 2024, Turkish airstrikes damaged northeastern Syria’s only gas plant and key energy hub, the Suwaydiyah plant, putting nearly 100 boreholes out of service and depriving over one million residents of electricity, gas, and fuel. These strikes often target oil fields, causing direct air, soil, and water pollution. By destabilizing electricity grids, Turkish attacks also drive short-term reliance on generators; by destroying oil infrastructure, they upend efforts to regulate pollution from the oil sector. Any effort to manage pollution—while entirely necessary to protect remaining water resources—will be a drop in the ocean if such infrastructure continues to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly a decade, donors have invested heavily—in blood and treasure—to recover this territory from the Islamic State and stabilize the area. Yet these efforts will be wasted if there is no political will to address the structural causes of Syria’s water crisis, which is highly consequential not just for Syria but also for the wider region. The fall of Assad has not made the country’s water insecurity, which preceded the conflict go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture in northeastern Syria feeds millions around the country, but the area is now critically threatened by rising input costs and declining access to water. As this chapter has highlighted, failed harvests have already pushed farmers and herders to the brink, bringing cascading impacts to the food supply and prices of staple foods. To cope, many farmers rely on remittances from relatives abroad to stay afloat. Others are abandoning the land or leasing their fields to pastoralists. Those who can no longer afford to feed their herds or sow their fields have few options apart from moving to bigger cities to work as day laborers—or leaving the country, if they can. On a large scale, rural exodus and the loss of agricultural livelihoods directly impact Syria’s prospects for security. As remote rural areas empty, armed groups fill the void, offering paths out of misery for remaining local youth. This is true not just in Syria but also in neighboring Iraq. As water levels drop in the Euphrates, many of Syria’s agricultural woes are spreading to communities downstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northeastern Syria must be understood as central to the stability of Syria and Iraq. Despite its importance, Western donors have long been losing interest in the region and emphasize that they will not remain forever. This tenuousness creates a vicious cycle in which regional stakeholders are simply waiting out U.S. presence, and therefore, not investing in the future. This is a strategic mistake, especially for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Northeastern Syria is one of the few places in the Middle East where U.S. policy still has a role to play that is clearly constructive. Rather than simply treating symptoms through security assistance and limited humanitarian aid, the United States could be preventing a larger crisis by devoting more attention to northeastern Syria. At a time when Washington’s responses to crises in Yemen, Iraq, and Gaza have been ineffective and seemingly limited to precision airstrikes and regional policing, northeastern Syria is a place where the United States and its allies can provide a stabilizing influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a security perspective, the United States and its allies have little to gain by letting the region slip back into chaos. On the other hand, Western donors are almost certain to lose the hard-earned benefits of their stabilization efforts if the northeast’s agricultural production collapses due to the water crisis. Addressing issues like the flow of the Euphrates River would also have a transboundary halo effect, helping to ease tensions between Syria and Iraq that have arisen from the two countries’ water shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no miracle solution, but there are many policies that can help northeastern Syria and any future government in Damascus navigate this crisis. Donors and their partners could immediately implement some of these short-term, pragmatic interventions at marginal cost to correct the unsustainable trajectory of existing aid interventions. Such policies, as outlined above, include experimenting with ways to support rain-fed farmers and pastoralists, greater coordination among aid actors and with local authorities when planning groundwater extraction projects, and stronger commitments to do no harm by planning boreholes more wisely, investing in groundwater monitoring, and improving waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other solutions, while entirely feasible, will require a scale-up of donors’ financial and political commitments. The absolute priority is to improve waste and wastewater management, a lack of which has greatly harmed soils, surface water, and groundwater. Here, again, there is a wide spectrum of potential interventions, including the regulation of imports, usage of pesticides and fertilizers, relocation of informal landfills away from potable water aquifers and riverbeds, and multimillion-dollar projects to build engineered landfills and wastewater treatment plants. While significant, these investments could also have positive effects further downstream, in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the political side, donors should lift NGO barriers to cooperation with the AANES and any future local governing body. These barriers are primarily political but retaining such barriers for NGOs make little sense for long-term stability. For too long, NGOs have been caught in a delicate balancing act of trying to reform the agricultural sector’s water-intensive practices without working with the main actor in charge of regulating them. Thus, many opportunities to support the water sector have been squandered due to red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Western states and Arab allies need to prioritize diplomacy with Turkey and should urge it to release more water from the Euphrates River for both Iraq and Syria. This remains the most effective way to alleviate immediate pressure on Syria’s water resources. Strengthened regional diplomacy could also ensure that Turkey is not damaging a downstream ally, Iraq, through its punishment of Syria. Diplomacy would also help secure any future investments and existing food and water supplies from Turkish attacks, which threaten Syria’s environment—and thus its stability—over the long term. Now, perhaps more than at any previous time during the conflict, there is a need to finalize a peace agreement between Turkey and the leaders of the AANES and formalize the AANES’s relations with the central government. The United States will be instrumental in mitigating violence and inequity that could further hinder efforts to better manage water: this essential and increasingly scarce resource in Syria. The fall of the Assad regime provides a historic window of opportunity to improve conditions in Syria. But if it is not seized with longer-term diplomatic and financial investment, it could lead to further crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until significant steps are taken to address the water crisis, villages will continue to empty as Syria’s breadbasket turns into a hollow shell, creating a vacuum that is only likely to strengthen extremist groups’ hold in the region and lead more Syrians to leave the country. “If there was no war and no drought, this village would have a hundred young men. But only 15 are left because everyone is gone to northern Iraq, Turkey, or Europe,” said one rain-fed farmer in the countryside of Derik, near the border with Iraq. Facing the worst drought he can remember, he has gradually sent all his children away—some to bigger cities in Syria, and one to Germany. “Most families in this village have a relative in Europe. Without them, the people here wouldn’t survive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Tahrir Square in Sana’a, the capital of Yemen, was inundated with thousands of people protesting the 30-year rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The protests eventually led to a war that shook the foundations of the country and led to Saleh’s removal. Thirteen years later, Tahrir—Sana’a’s most iconic square—was inundated with water. Heavy rains and years of neglected infrastructure led to massive floods, submerging cars and homes and turning the square into a small lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not the first time. From April to August 2020, heavy rains and floods affected hundreds of thousands of families across Yemen, including in the Sana’a region. The 2020 heavy rains converged on the city from all directions, flowing over the brims of dams such as the Shahik and flooding the old city of Sana’a, a UNESCO world heritage site. Years of war and neglect rendered the city ill-prepared for the intense rains. The floods swept solid waste that had accumulated in storm drainage canals through Al Sayla, in the heart of Sana’a. The waters also entered sewage pipelines, causing them to overflow. The impact was particularly devastating due to the years of war that had forced thousands of people from around the country into Sana’a, driving the spread of unregulated construction projects and increasing waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While destructive flooding gives the impression of plentiful water, Sana’a is also, counterintuitively, severely water scarce. In fact, many of the dams around Sana’a were dry in the years before the 2020 rainstorms. During periods of heavy rainfall, there is no time for water to seep into the earth and to recharge depleted underground aquifers; instead, floodwaters run into the desert and evaporate. Floods have become a serious climate risk in Yemen: the United Nations estimates that over half a million people were severely affected by the unprecedented floods of August 2024, with many tens of thousands living without shelter in the Sana’a area during an associated cholera outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water insecurity is now shaking the foundations of Yemen and could prevent a sustainable peace. Conflict over water resources—and the conflict’s impact on water resources—would further destabilize the country and lead to outward migration. But despite the urgency of the situation, confronting water insecurity has been challenging for governing authorities and donors. In addition to the insecurity bred by the war itself, aid access constraints, vested interests, and donor regulations have hindered the ability of NGOs and UN agencies to confront the problem. Many Western and Gulf governments consider the Houthis, the armed group that took control of Sana’a during the war, a terrorist organization. And the Houthis themselves have made aid work difficult. Since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Houthis have also launched attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea in support of Palestinians during Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. This has done even more harm to the Houthis’ efforts to ingratiate themselves with the international community to support peace talks and greater investment and aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While governance is part of Sana’a’s water insecurity problem, climate change and the city’s location also make it particularly vulnerable. With or without war, water insecurity is expected to worsen. Though there is limited data available, extreme weather events in Yemen—such as storms, droughts, and flash floods—appear to be growing more severe and frequent, with devastating effects. These extreme weather events wipe out houses and farmland, upend livelihoods, displace families, and kill people. More severe storms have also destroyed deteriorating dams that Yemenis have depended on to control and exploit water. Projections suggest there will be further changes to rainfall patterns and temperatures, bringing increased drought and desertification, which are being exacerbated in turn by the overextraction of groundwater for irrigation.&lt;/p&gt;

Projections suggest there will be further changes to rainfall patterns and temperatures, bringing increased drought and desertification, which are being exacerbated in turn by the overextraction of groundwater for irrigation. Yemen’s water insecurity significantly aggravates its already tenuous situation; it is the second-most fragile out of 179 countries surveyed worldwide. These issues highlight both the challenge and the necessity of finding ways to confront Sana’a’s water insecurity even in times of war. Sana’a sits atop one of the major groundwater basins in Yemen, which spans around 3,200 square kilometers. The Sana’a region is also one of Yemen’s largest agricultural regions, representing 11–13 percent of total crop area. The basin is the source of water and agriculture for millions of Yemenis, including three million in the rapidly growing capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the basin’s historical and socioeconomic importance, and the intense environmental and anthropogenic pressures on it, donors, aid agencies, and technocrats are struggling to develop solutions to the water crisis as the war drags on. Groundwater overuse, pollution, and climate variability have overwhelmed the capacities of current governmental water institutions. Many interlocutors have said that greater assistance will be delayed until the war ends or a different government takes power in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the severe degradation of the Sana’a basin cannot wait for an imperfect peace deal. In any case, the Houthi armed group that controls Sana’a and other parts of northern Yemen may remain in power after a peace agreement, which is unlikely to address water issues. Even when peace negotiations were active in early 2023, they did not include water governance or support. And Sana’a’s future as a capital will depend on the ability to provide affordable water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a united approach, regional and international donor governments could press for vital water reforms and support water infrastructure development in Sana’a. Currently, there is no clear strategy or coordination among donors supporting Yemen. However, starting with elemental steps toward water security, donors—together with local stakeholders—could build the trust needed to set the framework for broader reforms in the future. That framework would both lead to a more sustainable peace when an agreement comes and have positive effects on health, food security, and livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explains how and why a partnership between a coalition of donors could embed water solutions within a broader strategy for economic development in the region. It highlights politically feasible reforms and solutions that could be implemented using the combined leverage of the traditional donor government community, in concert with Arab Gulf donors who seek an end to instability in Yemen. Through politically feasible projects, a strategy for future water policies and investments can emerge. In the short run, projects can build on past reforms and improve water cooperation in the Sana’a basin through capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long-term impact, the government—with the support of donors—needs to expand reforms beyond the purview of the core technical experts who are still employed within various ministries in Sana’a. By reaching out to local stakeholders and decisionmakers within the government who may lack the technical knowledge to approve projects, aid agencies, multilateral organizations, and donors could develop programs with the right mix of carrots and sticks to bring Sana’a back from the brink. Future reforms could then address agriculture, which accounts for nearly 90 percent of water usage in the country. Supporting more sustainable rural livelihoods will slow the rapid depletion of groundwater in the Sana’a basin. For this, donors can build coalitions with political and traditional elites in Yemen, as well as in water sector institutions. While these solutions are not a silver bullet, they can put sustainable water management in the Sana’a region on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter starts by providing a background on Sana’a’s water governance and insecurity before and during the war. It then assesses donors’ roles in the water sector and their current reticence to get involved, given Sana’a’s difficult governing authorities and ongoing instability. The chapter will argue, however, that starting with Sana’a’s water and sanitation sectors is important and feasible. The chapter will conclude by suggesting a series of short- and long-term steps toward greater water security through the combined leverage of regional and international donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Sana’a have long had to fight water insecurity, in part due to geography. At 2,300 meters above sea level, Sana’a abuts some of the highest mountains on the Arabian Peninsula and is surrounded by smaller ranges. Since ancient times, Yemenis have built dams to collect water for agriculture and for the protection of Sana’a, which lies in the valley of the mountains. Some of these dams date back to pre-Islamic civilizations, such as the Shahik, which sits in Jabal al Lawz at an astonishing 3,344 meters above sea level. In the decades before the war, donors—including USAID and the Arab Fund in Kuwait—supported the development of channels for draining flood water in Sana’a. They also supported the rehabilitation and construction of dams as well as improved irrigation around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s and 1990s, Yemen also expanded irrigated agriculture, which caused the country to become increasingly water scarce. Starting in the 1970s, many Yemenis from the countryside migrated to the Gulf, reducing the workforce for traditional agriculture. At the same time, the remittances sent by the Yemeni guest workers funded the modernization of agriculture, through mechanization and expanded irrigation. As traditional agricultural methods and water-saving techniques like rainwater harvesting fell out of fashion, Yemen’s lack of rivers often led irrigators to draw out groundwater. But it was soon clear that high levels of groundwater abstraction were not sustainable and that the government needed a more coherent approach to water management. This scarcity was further aggravated by the need to support a rapidly growing population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the outbreak of the most recent war in 2014, many observers saw the complete depletion of the Sana’a basin as imminent. Experts warned that the city in particular could be the world’s first modern capital to run out of water. The groundwater depletion rate is now very high in zones across Yemen; the hardest-hit area is the highlands, where scientists have recorded annual water table declines of between two and six meters per year in the Sa’dah, Rada’a, Taiz, Amram, and Sana’a basins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several water institutions were established with the help of donors and based on the concept of integrated water resources management (IWRM). IWRM regards water problems as a reflection of fragmented responsibilities and a lack of laws and strategies. The IWRM reform process led to the creation of a separate Water and Environment Ministry (MWE), a National Water Resources Authority (NWRA), a National Water Law, and an ambitious national five-year strategy (2005–2009) with a $1.5 billion investment program designed mainly to support the municipal water sector and decentralized water utilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OQlmO2O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Increase in Irrigated Land in Yemen, 1961–2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sana’a Basin Committee, established in 2003 as part of the NWRA Sana’a branch, was a particularly important partner. Supported by donors like the World Bank, the basin committee was assigned to establish a binding plan to quantify existing water resources and develop future water-regulation investments and strategies for the Sana’a basin, accomplishing this through negotiation among all water users and relevant civil society actors. But the war and successive natural disasters disrupted these reforms as well as more recent donor efforts like the World Bank’s Integrated Urban Services Emergency Project, which is aimed at restoring basic urban services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in 2015, after years of unrest, the Houthis expelled the recognized government from the capital. The Houthis themselves originate from Sa’dah, a region that had been facing severe water scarcity, which might have played a role in the militia’s expansion southwards. Today, the Houthis (an Iran-backed group, known among members as Ansar Allah) control a large proportion of the mountainous and densely populated areas in the northern and central parts of the country. These areas of control include some of Yemen’s water-stressed regions, such as Sana’a, Sa’dah, and Rada’a. Yemen’s second-largest city, Taiz, which is controlled in part by the Houthis and in part by the Internationally Recognized Government (IRG), also experiences frequent water shortages. The IRG, backed by a Saudi and Emirati-led coalition of Arab nations, also controls the southern governorates and has a presence in the governorates of al-Jawf, Hajjah, and Marib. In April 2022, a truce was announced, essentially freezing these lines of control but not opening the door to greater investment in Sana’a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Active fighting has complicated water security, but so has the Houthis’ reputation among donor governments. The United States designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist group in 2021. That designation was reversed in 2022, in part to facilitate aid and commerce to the region, but the Houthis were newly classified in 2024 as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist Group”—a different categorization with different consequences—after they began attacking shipping vessels in the Red Sea. The Trump administration re-designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist group in January 2025. Now, the prospects for imminent peace seem even less realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these developments, promising water sector reforms were cut short by the direct and indirect effects of war. Many of the water institutions (e.g., the MWE and NWRA) have existed for less than 20 years, a period largely overshadowed by war and political turmoil. The current war has interrupted institutional build-up in the Yemeni water sector, which had been improving the performance of utilities and overall water governance. Other reforms related to the creation of water laws, strategies, and new institutions had little chance of being implemented during the war. The centralized governance style of the Houthis also largely sidelined the Sana’a Basin Committee, whose model was based on collective decisionmaking. However, the committee has continued to function as a hub for knowledge and data on the water basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While dependence on agriculture—Yemen’s most water-intensive sector—has decreased due to war and water insecurity, water consumption has not. Only a third of the Yemeni population is employed in agriculture, down from over 50 percent prior to the war. In the Sana’a region, livelihoods that depend on agriculture have also decreased due to the high urbanization rate of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite decreased food production and support for livelihoods, unsustainable and water-intensive cropping patterns have increased since 2015—including the cultivation of qat, which was responsible for 25–43 percent of agricultural water abstraction in the basin in 2018, up from 15–30 percent in 2007. Qat is a plant that Yemenis regularly chew as a mild stimulant; it is water intensive mainly because it is planted and harvested year-round. As a result of these trends, agriculture’s contribution to GDP has risen once again to a third of Yemen’s current weakened economic output, up from around 10 percent in 2011, despite contributing less to livelihoods and food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such an environment, weakened water institutions have been unable to confront the overabstraction of precious groundwater. As a result, residents in most urban areas are living with extreme water scarcity. At the best of times, daily municipal water withdrawals are capped at 50 liters per capita per day, but this figure does not account for network losses of up to and over 50 percent. In 2020, those living in Sana’a city were receiving between 15–20 liters of water per day and sometimes as low as 3 liters, well below the World Health Organization’s threshold of 15 liters per day in emergency situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these factors have increased inequity in water provision, augmenting social tensions and straining livelihoods and health. Urban water and wastewater services have deteriorated markedly, increasing reliance on expensive water from private tanks, with prices up to $4 per cubic meter in Sana’a. The heavy reliance on trucked water and the degradation of sanitation services has also made outbreaks of cholera more frequent and predictable. In 2017 and 2019, respectively, Yemen accounted for 84 percent and 93 percent of all cholera cases worldwide. As humanitarian aid dwindles, especially for Sana’a, health-focused NGOs are seeing cholera cases emerging in multiple provinces. In the meantime, elites in Sana’a drill ever-deeper wells to reach depleted groundwater, while others subsist on rations and are forced to leave their farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As water disappears, the likelihood of a larger confrontation over it becomes more likely. Warring parties have already weaponized water, cutting off various segments of the population from access to it. Tribal feuds over water are reportedly increasing. Despite the urgency of water scarcity in these areas, more effective water management and reforms have been put on hold during the most recent conflict. However, the war in Yemen has now entered a stage of stagnation, with occasional bursts of violence that might recur for some time; in the meantime, and the Sana’a basin risks complete collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desperate water situation in Sana’a and the surrounding rural areas has increased political pressure on the Houthis to act. Influential tribal forces in the region are beginning to voice discontent. This opposition force, originating among tribes around Sana’a, was allied with Ali Abdullah Saleh’s government but switched to an opportunistic alliance with the Houthis after the latter killed Saleh in 2017. A part of Saleh’s political party, Al-Motamar, even decided to remain in Sana’a and work with the Houthis against the Saudi-led coalition. But now the party in Sana’a has been publicly demanding that the Houthis invest in the workforce and pay civil servants’ salaries. In September 2023, there were rare large protests against the Houthis’ undermining of the state’s institutions. In this context, capacity building and small-scale infrastructure rehabilitation projects would likely receive wide support from the Sana’a region’s powerful tribes, which the Houthis depend on for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While withdrawing from Houthi-controlled areas and focusing on IRG-controlled areas may be more politically palatable for donors, it will not be sufficient to curb instability in the country. Fixing the degradation of water infrastructure in the Sana’a region is a project that cannot wait any longer, and donors have leverage to act now through humanitarian and development aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-coalition-for-water-aid-in-yemen&quot;&gt;Building a Coalition for Water Aid in Yemen&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both regional and international stakeholders, as well as Yemen’s major donors, understand the importance of aid in stabilizing the country. Most of the oil-rich Gulf donor governments, along with European countries and the United States, seek to counteract Iran’s influence and curb emigration and the rebirth of transnational terrorist groups. As such, these donors have given generously to Yemen in the past. However, disparate aid efforts have struggled to gain the political concessions that would make the sum total of these efforts most effective. Regional and international donors could work together to provide more cost-effective assistance to the water sector in the Sana’a region in a way that could be mutually beneficial. Given the amount of support provided to Yemen over the years, the impact of more coordinated assistance would be substantial and would make future peace more possible. In the case of a rapprochement with the Houthis, regional donors might have the financial leverage to offer aid in return for better water governance in Sana’a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aid provision has been substantial. In 2022, Yemen was among the top 20 recipients of official development assistance. Alongside sizeable humanitarian aid, Gulf donors are involved in development aid to Yemen’s water sector, primarily in IRG-controlled areas. After the formation of the Presidential Leadership Council (a new IRG executive body) in 2022, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) pledged $3.6 billion, including hundreds of millions in development aid, to cities in IRG-held areas. From 2015 to 2020, the UAE provided more than $6 billion in aid to Yemen, mostly to support public services. In the water sector, the UAE is supporting the construction of a small desalination plant in Aden—Yemen’s interim capital—that will produce around 10,000 cubic meters per day; the UAE has also promised to develop a clean energy project to enhance the use of water resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Saudi Arabia and the UAE have focused on IRG-held areas, Qatar—which is officially neutral in the armed conflict—has supported humanitarian projects in contested areas such as Taiz. In 2023, Qatar also announced a $15 million donation to UNICEF to improve water and sanitation services in several cities across Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and European countries have provided a great deal of support to Yemen even prior to the current conflict. They made the overwhelming majority of pledges in the Yemen High-Level Pledging (HLP) conferences of 2022 and 2023, which brought in $1.3 and $1.2 billion, respectively. While the HLP is related to humanitarian rather than development aid, these vast sums show that donors can still mobilize funds for Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite generous past donations, recent aid cuts, particularly in northern Yemen, now threaten to further destabilize the country. In December 2023, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) announced that it would pause the distribution of food aid to needy families living under Houthi control. Though this aid was partially resumed in mid-2024, President Donald Trump’s decision to temporarily freeze foreign assistance in 2025 can reverse these gains for the most vulnerable communities. Aid, totaling approximately $0.8 billion in 2023, went to humanitarian sectors, such as emergency food assistance dispersed through the WFP. Yemen is now competing for aid with numerous other countries in crisis, which has forced Yemenis and aid agencies to do more with less support. At the same time, the Houthis’ terrorism designation and lack of international recognition has also created obstacles. In September 2024, the United Nations decided to cut back some of its activities in Yemen after the Houthis cracked down on humanitarian and developmental workers, accusing them of spying for the United States and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait could become the most significant contributors to Yemen’s future stability. These countries have the direct political motivation to stabilize their neighbor, as well as the capacity to do so. Gulf countries have become important new donors on the international scene, with improved development cooperation and infrastructure financing. Some rich Gulf countries give more official development assistance, as a percentage of their economies, than more established Western donors. They also have strong experience in delivering water infrastructure projects to other countries, as shown in billions of dollars of Saudi and Emirati investments in Egypt’s ongoing water infrastructure projects. In late 2023, Saudi Arabia also announced the establishment of the Global Water Organization, which aims to integrate with global aid efforts to address water sustainability. Saudi Arabia already allocated $6 billion to various development projects in the water and sanitation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European donors, namely the Dutch and German development agencies, also have extensive experience providing significant technical and financial assistance to the water sector in Yemen, which received the second-largest share of aid before the political turmoil of 2011. Between 2002 and 2009, water sector assistance to Yemen increased from $36 million to $52 million, with Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Japan, the UAE, and others contributing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the combined leverage and expertise of regional and international donors, it is possible to mobilize funds for water development in Yemen and lower the risk of failed projects. Regional donors can play an important role, since they are already carrying some of the financial cost of the military conflict and the ensuing humanitarian crisis. Together with traditional Western donors, they can start designing capacity-building projects and setting the stage for broader water economy reforms in the region. Today, many aid projects in Yemen are single-donor funded and lack coordination. The lack of a strategy tying these aid efforts together diminishes the potential for synergies across their activities, and thus decreases their impact. This siloed approach also makes it easier for political elites to hinder or manipulate aid to suit their needs rather than the public good. For example, the Houthis have been accused of treating aid projects as cash cows by imposing taxes and transport fees, and even selling aid or demanding compensation for granting humanitarian access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a coordinated approach around water and sanitation support for the Sana’a region, donors can implement more conditionality and design a multisector approach by focusing on capacity building and infrastructure aid in both urban and rural areas. Lately, new platforms have emerged for improving coordination among donors and for linking humanitarian and development aid. As a step in this direction, the World Bank and the European Union recently established the Yemen Partner Group to coordinate the efforts of development actors through the creation of technical teams covering water and food. However, the work of such mechanisms has not been visible yet, and more coordination with Gulf donors is necessary. This kind of cooperation can withstand political forces in Yemen to a degree that is difficult for any single government to achieve alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-sanaa&quot;&gt;Why Sana’a?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While assistance has dwindled in recent years, most of stakeholders and donor governments share an interest in a stable Yemen that is not a source of mass emigration or terrorism. Achieving that necessitates prioritizing water resources in the Sana’a basin as well as in IRG-controlled areas. Otherwise, the water crisis in northern Yemen could eventually engulf the whole country as different regions compete for access to resources. There are also numerous other reasons to prioritize water management in the Sana’a region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing capacity building and water cooperation in the Sana’a region could have positive spillover effects on stability and environmental sustainability. Sana’a’s economic significance has arguably increased along with war-driven migration to the capital city, both from the conflict-affected areas in the south and from the now-affluent tribes affiliated with the Houthis. In 2004, Sana’a’s population numbered 2 million people; by 2024, that figure had reached 3.4 million. This number may be even higher, as displaced people have continued to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sana’a is also home to a generation of water professionals, often educated abroad, who have worked for many years in Yemen’s ministries and think tanks. It is also the heart of water education institutions like Sana’a University’s Water and Environment Center (WEC). Today, such centers still offer courses on water issues, but they are not equipped to perform as national hubs for water research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital is also where most of the data and the technocrats of the former government reside. Water institutions like the Sana’a branch of NWRA and the Sana’a Water Supply and Sanitation Corporation (SWSLC)—the latter established during the reform process to decentralize and privatize the water sector—are also located in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sana’a has been the political center of Yemen for centuries, and regional powers still compete for influence over its elites and its powerful regional tribes who once formed the backbone of President Saleh’s coalition. As such, the Sana’a region needs to be included in any future peace, which will be sustainable only if water security is provided to the millions of people in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-to-start&quot;&gt;Where to Start&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Yemenis, and those with an interest in stabilizing Yemen, need to deal with the dire water and sanitation situation in the Sana’a region. However, they will also need to acknowledge the political hurdles of doing so in Houthi-controlled areas during an ongoing war. Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping vessels in 2023 and 2024 have further isolated Sana’a. The Houthis have also been notorious for putting conditions on UN humanitarian agencies and being difficult in access negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While major reforms in such an environment will be challenging, there are steps that Yemenis, the local authorities, and donors can take to begin to put the region on the right path and prevent or delay a major water crisis. In the short term, building up capacity for water research and cooperation in Sana’a is feasible, in part because of the groundwork laid by numerous donors to build water expertise in the capital. And because the area is essentially controlled by one governing actor, it may even be more feasible to implement this and other steps in the Sana’a region than in the south, for instance, where the presence of numerous warlords make governance, security, and aid access even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capacity-and-trust-building&quot;&gt;Capacity and Trust Building&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aid designed to rehabilitate technical capacities (e.g., data collection and water utility monitoring) is a good first step to revitalize the water sector. Some of the professionals who participated in past reforms have fled the capital city or emigrated, but the key water institutions of Yemen, and many associated water experts, remain in Sana’a. Donor-led projects can capitalize on the presence of these experts by enhancing cooperation between local Yemenis and international experts and education centers. These local experts could begin to collectively gather data on the Sana’a basin that could inform future water policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of projects could also support the ongoing efforts of water management institutions (e.g., NWRA) to design basin-wide plans. Donors can also support the Sana’a Water Basin Committee to study the future plan for the basin and to act as a platform for water cooperation and dialogue. The committee’s work can also create leverage for donors, environmentalists, and water sector institutions—both local water utilities and national water agencies like the NWRA and MWE—to demand better water management from decisionmakers in government. Building up alliances between sustainability-minded actors could push the water agenda forward and create support for related interventions. Through such alliances, technocrats, researchers, and trained citizen scientists could complement remote monitoring of irrigation water with fieldwork to measure groundwater levels and quality. Such data would provide water institutions and donors with a baseline to assess priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technocrats, small rural farmers, urban communities, and development organizations also share an interest in countering the powers of the large area farmers. By strengthening the ties between these stakeholders, donors would also empower the Basin Committee, the NWRA, and local councils, thus mitigating conflicts. Many of these bodies, like the local councils, have historically acted as arbitrators of water conflicts. As such, development professionals have argued that empowering environmental institutions and supporting community-level environmental projects could help to resolve conflicts in a more sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These negotiations could speak to the Houthis’ desire to appear to be an actor that can better provide security and services to the Yemeni people. The Houthis have argued that, in areas under their control, people enjoy the absence of competing militias as well as a better economic situation, as the local currency value was three to four times that of the currency in IRG areas in 2024. In Aden, which was declared a temporary capital after the Houthis took over Sana’a, residents complain about insecurity and the lack of basic services like electricity. Still, the reform of water institutions in Houthi areas has been undermined by the lack of funds, as well as by political interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with other government bodies in Houthis-controlled areas, the work of water institutions has been closely supervised by Houthi-appointed moshrefeen, or supervisors. But supporters of capacity building can engage with the Houthis, who are not indigenous to Sana’a and are not finding it easy to convince the capital’s diverse constituents of their governance capabilities. In order to maintain their reputation, local Houthi authorities have an interest, above all, in tackling water insecurity. And their ability to govern affects their broader security interests. In part to counter protests and regain their legitimacy, the Houthis have focused on external enemies: Israel and the United States. The Israeli government’s actions in Gaza since October 7 have allowed the Houthis—who were once losing popularity—to recruit new fighters in droves and distract the population from their own mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;urban-water-supply&quot;&gt;Urban Water Supply&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given recent cholera outbreaks and the abysmally low water consumption per capita in Yemen’s cities, improving the urban water supply in Sana’a should be prioritized as well. In the capital, a diverse group of private water tankers were delivering water to the majority of households even before the war—around 60 percent pre-conflict and 70 percent in 2017. But this practice is not well regulated. The World Bank has recommended improving collaboration between water institutions and private tankers to test and register water operations while gradually rehabilitating the municipal water network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local authorities, as intransigent as they have been on certain issues, have an interest in allowing for progress on water and sanitation. Since the 2022 ceasefire, the local population has been demanding improved services—especially clean water, which has become exorbitantly expensive and even dangerous, as unregulated private water tankers capture the market. More support and engagement with the SWSLC and the MWE, as well as its subordinate Environmental Protection Agency, could have immediate positive impacts on the urban water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These institutions, however, lack the technical capacity and funds to regulate the private tanker markets alone. NGOs and donors could improve the situation by matching grants for replacing old tanks, creating an association of regulated private tankers, establishing a directory of regulated providers, and providing chlorine and water quality tests. The Houthis are accused of benefiting from the dysfunctional water supply in Sana’a by profiting off of the water tanker industry. However, the suggested measures will benefit both the water tankers and the consumers by improving the quality of the private water supply. With many water tankers present, consumers have the power to choose. If tankers are registered and certified, consumers will likely choose regulated ones, thus incentivizing more tankers to cooperate with authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;agriculture&quot;&gt;Agriculture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While improving the drinking supply would be a life-saving intervention, dealing with the agricultural sector’s water consumption is vital as well. Agricultural groundwater abstraction drives the largest percentage of water use in the Sana’a region; failing to curb its excesses has and will continue to cut into drinking water for millions. Although the Sana’a region’s population is largely urban, agriculture in the area still consumed 0.8–1.0 billion cubic meters in 2018, declining from 1.2–1.5 billion in 2007. This decline was largely linked to water scarcity and agricultural abandonment. Despite this trend, the agricultural sector still accounts for almost half of water demand in the Sana’a region. Failure to effectively manage agricultural water use could also further exacerbate food insecurity and poverty in a country that has already suffered from acute hunger for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, certain crops contribute to water scarcity without improving food security. Qat, for example, is a significant drain on water supplies and does not improve Yemen’s food security. However, curbing qat production is a complex issue. Because it provides high revenues year-round, it typically wins out over alternative crops. During the conflict, warring parties have also benefitted from qat production. The Houthis and their allies have increased taxes on qat, which can be sold within the country for hard currency—something that is difficult to obtain in Houthi-controlled areas, which have become increasingly isolated from international markets during the war. However, this same interest may force the Houthis into a more sustainable and cooperative approach toward improving water efficiency on farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 UN Development Programme report posited that the overexploitation of groundwater will only stop if it is completely depleted, or if drilling deeper wells and maintaining water quality become cost-prohibitive. This may be true, but that would be disastrous for Sana’a and the rest of the region as citizens and armed actors seek out water and better pastures elsewhere. Rescuing the basin after its collapse would be nearly impossible. Local authorities, however, could slow the trend toward basin closure and help communities adapt to a future with no or little groundwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolving the groundwater issue will require local authorities, communities, and donors to deal with over-abstraction in the agricultural sector—which means dealing with powerful agricultural interests. Directly regulating overconsumption may not be feasible in today’s Yemen. Due to the socioeconomic importance of agriculture and the political difficulties of limiting related water consumption, it will be important to improve efficiency through the provision of precision irrigation systems. Conserving water is particularly important for qat farmers, whose share of agricultural water in the Sana’a region has increased during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, it may even be possible to enforce regulations and policy reforms that have been difficult to implement. In this case, the heavy-handed and centralized control of the Houthis may be an asset. The government—including the ministries and the local councils—might be more willing than Saleh’s regime to enforce water consumption limitations. Saleh doled out favors to powerful tribal elites to maintain power, and this lenient position toward tribes limited the power of water institutions to regulate the tribes’ excessive water consumption. The Houthis, by contrast, have demonstrated that they are willing to impose regulations on tribes if they see the need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to practicing more sustainable farming techniques and accepting regulations, the rural population can also be oriented toward more sustainable livelihoods over the long term. Previous donor projects have incentivized climate-resilient agriculture or alternative livelihoods in sectors such as heritage and tourism. However, donors and local authorities have never had a coordinated strategy to orient the market away from water-intensive crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional donors are also in a position to develop market-oriented approaches to water security. The Gulf can put its trade relations with Yemen—and its millions of Yemeni workers—to use. Yemen has traditionally exported coffee and fruits from the Sana’a region to neighboring countries. Gulf countries can incentivize less water-intensive agriculture through guarantees for environmentally friendly crop sales to the Gulf and certification programs that could help commercialize sustainable products like coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarian and development actors should also make their interventions more sustainable. Some reports have noted that providing solar energy for pumping groundwater has become a moral hazard by encouraging excessive use of the resource. While some aid agencies saw solar power as a lifeline for communities that could not afford diesel pumping, the subsequent depletion of groundwater has also shown why solar energy use must be closely monitored and conditioned on water conservation. Successful cases from India demonstrate that linking support for solar energy to the installation of micro-irrigation systems can address the goals of water conservation and energy access in agriculture. Agricultural extension services can also provide community trainings on the use of these efficient technologies in small-scale farming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decreasing-vulnerability-through-small-scale-projects&quot;&gt;Decreasing Vulnerability Through Small-Scale Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing methods to conserve and distribute storm or drainage water can also alleviate some of the competition over Yemen’s dwindling resources and mitigate the destructive impact of floods. For example, there are four watersheds in the Sana’a region that flow into wadis or into the capital city, causing destructive floods during heavy rains. Prior to the war, donors supported the construction of small dams for agriculture, aquifer recharge, and water flow control. Building on this work to rehabilitate the drainage canals in the Sana’a region could enhance water resources and alleviate flooding and health concerns. In particular, donors and local actors could prioritize the rehabilitation of the Al Sayla, a vital outlet in the heart of Old Sana’a, which has caused concern lately due to recurrent floods and a lack of waste collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in small dams and ponds that capture additional water flows could give communities more independence from expensive private water sources and alleviate pressures on groundwater, which accounted for 27 percent of irrigation in 2018. There are extensive water harvesting systems in the Sana’a region through open ponds, or birak, but the government has neglected them, contributing to groundwater depletion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In agricultural parts of the Sana’a region (e.g., the Bani al-Harith and Bani Hushaysh), farmers are increasingly unable to till their fields due to lack of water. Given the evidence of increasing scarcity and related conflict, local farmers and tribal actors are likely to support the rehabilitation of their traditional water harvesting systems. Many of these tribal communities around Sana’a have depended for centuries on rainwater-collection infrastructure for agriculture, non-drinking domestic purposes, and their livestock. These traditional methods fell out of favor with increased water pumping. However, during the war, rainwater harvesting was repopularized by necessity—a trend that local authorities and donors could capitalize on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Sana’a region will need larger infrastructure investments to develop new sources of water and improve the circular water economy through the reuse of municipal and agricultural wastewater. Yemen could benefit from advancements in the Arab world, either in wastewater reusage or, as in Egypt, drainage for the reuse of agricultural water. For now, such large investments seem like a distant dream—but incorporating them into larger governance and peacebuilding efforts may be necessary to save the Sana’a region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the desperate water situation and the protracted nature of the conflict, Sana’a cannot wait for the uncertain prospects of a political compromise. Instead of postponing water reforms until a peace treaty is reached, regional and international donors can begin to lay the groundwork for a lasting stability by reducing the vulnerability of the population to climate change and water supply shortages. While large-scale developmental reforms may not be feasible now, donors can invest in small-scale water infrastructure in urban and rural areas, in coordination with strengthened local and basin-wide water institutions. These incentives could ease negotiations with local decisionmakers and communities on regulations of water quality and usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a water-secure future for the Sana’a region will be a gradual endeavor that begins by forming alliances with water stakeholders, building trust among these stakeholders, and increasing the participation of state institutions. Donor cooperation also creates the leverage needed to improve water governance in Sana’a. Such efforts will, in turn, improve security in Yemen and the region. When a peace deal arrives, having tackled the water issue will make that peace more lasting and environmentally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent political turmoil has shown the importance of water issues in peace. As highlighted in 2023 and 2024, insecurity in Yemen has the potential to shift international markets and destabilize the world and neighboring states with strong trade, migration, and security linkages to Yemen. Tackling the roots of this instability necessitates tackling water insecurity in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International and Gulf donors have the financial means to alleviate water issues in Sana’a, the political and cultural center of one of the region’s most populous countries. Harmonizing Western donor strategies with those of Gulf countries can cement long-standing partnerships with the Arabian Peninsula at a time of international competition for influence over this vital region for world trade and international security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Uf6kXxG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For millennia, legendary civilizations rose through their ability to control and exploit the mighty Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The people of southern Iraq, in particular, became wedded to the water, literally floating on top of seemingly endless marshlands covering an area nearly the size of Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities not only survived but flourished in this Fertile Crescent by learning to adapt to the floods every spring. As the snow on the highlands melted and increased the flows of the Euphrates and Tigris, communities downstream made use of the water and built their lives around it. But in just a few generations, everything has changed. The threat of water scarcity has now become existential for Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many internal and external factors are contributing to the scarcity, pollution, and salinization of Iraq’s ground and surface water. The rivers on which southern Iraq depends have been diverted and heavily polluted within and outside the country. While Iraq was the first to control the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, its upstream neighbors—Turkey and Iran—have since superseded Iraq, diverting and storing the waters within their borders, reducing downstream water supply to Iraq. At the same time, Iraq—accustomed to centuries of abundance—is still using flood agriculture and failing to preserve the quality of its diminishing waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing urgency for reform, conflicts, internal and external political disputes, and corruption have strained the government’s capacity to improve water resource management as well as its ability to adapt to climate change. If oil prices drop, Iraqi government revenues—which are 90 percent dependent on oil sales—will be unable to provide basic services like water and sanitation or absorb newly unemployed farmers in the public sector. Even with high oil prices, Iraq has stagnated at 0.67 on the Human Development Index, positioning the country at 134 out of 204 ranked countries and territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a land with as much familiarity with political violence as Iraq, the potential for explosive consequences in the near-term are very real. In some parts of the country, conflicts are already manifesting, whereas in others, people are still struggling to get by. In southern Iraq, the situation is particularly acute and potentially volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all of Iraq is struggling, Basra, Iraq’s southernmost governorate, has become the poster child of Iraq’s water insecurity. The marshes and agricultural lands that once made the region famous are now desiccated. And the tensions between the haves (e.g., oil companies, urbanites) and the have-nots (e.g., smallholder farmers, marsh dwellers, and city newcomers) is growing. However, the stability of this governorate is also essential to the future of Iraq, as it is the source of over 70 percent of the country’s oil revenues and the host of Iraq’s major ports. Basra’s response to its water crisis serves as a poignant example of political action prompted by imminent threats, resulting in tangible progress. But while there have been some positive developments, the water situation is deteriorating faster than these modest improvements can keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the magnitude of the challenge, this chapter will first lay out how Iraq abruptly moved from conditions of water abundance to water scarcity, and why this history makes it particularly challenging to shift water usage behaviors and management practices. The second section will delve into the consequences of water insecurity for communities and explain some of the governance challenges behind the failure to tackle problems. The chapter will conclude with some of the government’s recent successes in Basra and what more could feasibly be done in the near term to mitigate a larger crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that, at the very least, the government can improve its municipal water supply and prepare for greater urbanization. That focus is a grim acknowledgement of the political obstacles to broader reforms in Iraq, but the chapter still highlights important and feasible steps toward safeguarding the resource most essential to life—drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-abundance-to-water-scarcity&quot;&gt;From Abundance to Water Scarcity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In just a few decades, the population of southern Iraq has gone from floating on water to eking out a living on ever-larger sections of parched earth. Water availability in Iraq dropped from nearly 5,000 cubic meters of renewable fresh water per capita in 1960 to 827 cubic meters in 2020—the definition of water scarcity. Iraq’s rapidly growing population, which is expected to nearly double by 2050, threatens to exacerbate that scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the drivers of the frequent and prolonged drought conditions in southern Iraq is climate change: scientists estimate that, because of climate change, the likelihood of drought in the Tigris-Euphrates river basin has increased from a 1-in-250-year event to a 1-in-10-year occurrence. Climate change is also expected to reduce the rivers’ flows, further affecting Basra. A 2017 climate modelling study sponsored by the UN Economic and Social Commission for West Asia (UNESCWA) determined that there is considerable uncertainty regarding future inflows to the basin due to climate change; some scientists have predicted that, by 2100, the flows of the Euphrates and Tigris will decrease by 30 and 60 percent, respectively. According to another study, just a one-degree Celsius increase would reduce water resources for nearly one-third of the irrigated land in Iraq by 2050, leading to a 17 percent drop in the demand for unskilled labor in a country already facing 16 percent unemployment. However, while climate change is a significant factor in increased temperatures and water scarcity, much of southern Iraq’s water insecurity is due to upstream water management and domestic water mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq depends on the Tigris and Euphrates, and their tributaries, for 98 percent of its water. For centuries, the flow of these rivers remained uninterrupted as they made their way to the Shatt al-Arab, passing through thousands of square kilometers of marshlands in southern Iraq that naturally filtered out toxins through reeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the second half of the twentieth century, to control the often-dangerous flows of the rivers, Iraq began artificially taming the water well ahead of its transboundary upstream neighbors. The Iraqi government constructed the Hindya Barrage in 1913 on the Euphrates, near the holy city of Karbala, and the Kut Barrage in the 1930s, on the southern reaches of the Tigris. Numerous other dams and barrages were built in the 1950s, forming artificial lakes. But these methods of control were relatively minor compared to what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Iraq have designed water management strategies to serve their individual, rather than collective, interests. Today, apart from the Greater Zab, a tributary to the Tigris River, all rivers and tributaries are dammed. Iraq struggles to fairly manage water even within its borders. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has planned for the construction of dozens of barrages and dams in northern Iraq without the consent of the central government. And with every commissioning of a new dam, dyke, or barrage, less water becomes available in southern Iraq. Still, damming and surface diversions of surface water are one some of the only ways the country has managed water. Even the 2014 Strategy for Water and Land Resources in Iraq (SWLRI), sponsored by the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR), clearly stated that Iraq did not need major dams and proposed the construction of about 20 smaller dams in the country, most of which were for water-harvesting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most egregious example of politics driving southern Iraq’s water crisis is former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein’s campaign to drain the marshes. Still, despite millions of dollars spent to rehabilitate the marshes, they are so battered that they can no longer handle the surge in southward-running waste. As rainfall becomes more erratic and populations grow in the most water-stressed region in the world, riparian countries are increasingly focused on maximizing their capacities for storing and diverting water. While some experts have given up on the marshes of southern Iraq, this unique ecosystem remains a symbol of deeper dysfunction and points to the critical need to address transboundary water sharing and internal management immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;iraqs-marshes&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Iraq’s Marshes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the 1980s and 1990s, Saddam Hussein diverted water away from the wetlands to prepare the battlefield for war with Iran and to expose rebels hiding in the marsh reeds. Ninety percent of the marshes disappeared. The United Nations called the draining of Iraq’s wetlands “one of the world’s greatest environmental disasters.” It also led to mass displacement: hundreds of thousands of people lived in the marshes prior to Hussein’s campaign, but only 20,000 to 40,000 remained by 2006. Millions more in the southern governorates were also affected in some way, since 60 percent of those governates’ market fish and more than 40 percent of these regions’ dairy products came from the marshes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A program to restore the marshes after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and overthrow of Saddam Hussein was reasonably successful until recently, when those gains were reversed by the reduction of water allocations for Iraq by neighboring riparian countries and by internal water mismanagement. However, the incredible initial comeback of the marshes just after 2003 showed that Iraq could battle catastrophic degradation if doing so was prioritized.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq’s solution to water insecurity during its centuries of water abundance—the erection of dams and dikes—is unlikely to save the country now. Dams and diversions in times of scarcity tend to increase tensions and inequity, with marginalized communities—especially small farm-holders and the marsh Arabs—suffering the most. Experts also point to the hundreds of illegal water diversions toward land owned by powerful and influential people, who use the water for fish farms or irrigation. But even when dikes are built to help farming and marsh communities, civil society questions the long-term impacts on the environment. In 2010, the MoWR agreed to erect a small earth dike across the Euphrates River near the city of Mdayna, north of Basra, to maintain a minimum water level in the river and its adjacent central marshes. While the dike was necessary to support the livelihoods of tens of thousands of farmers along the southern part of the Euphrates, including marsh-dwelling families, some activists and locals also argued that because the water quality arriving in Basra was already poor, a dike would only concentrate the river’s pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite decreasing flows of water and increasing concentrations of pollutants, Iraq continues to manage water as if its resources were infinite. Iraq doubled its irrigated land between 1990 and 2020, using the same water-intensive flood irrigation employed in ancient Sumer. While the former abundance of water diluted salts, sewage, and contaminants, decreased water levels have concentrated these pollutants, making the remaining water unusable for humans, animals, and crops. Still, there are few, if any, wastewater plants that treat sewage even to a secondary level (i.e., doing more than simply filtering solid matter). Now, as surface fresh water becomes increasingly scarce, communities and farmers farther from the main rivers and tributaries are increasingly relying on groundwater and expensive water trucking. In parts of Najaf, the water table has dropped between 12 and 15 meters in a single season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical water abundance is now part of the challenge. The Iraqi government will have to push a society accustomed to plentiful water and flood agriculture for thousands of years to become one that overcomes water scarcity, especially in hard-hit southern Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-consequences-of-the-water-crisis-in-southern-iraq&quot;&gt;The Consequences of the Water Crisis in Southern Iraq&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water crisis has devastated communities in southern Iraq. Many farming families have gone from temporarily adapting to dry years by farming less land and killing off their livestock to permanently moving away, breaking apart social networks that have already endured decades of socio-economic traumas ranging from near-constant war to government collapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Basra Environmental Directorate reported that water degradation in the governorate cost Iraq $400 million in lost animals, palm trees, and crops in 2018 alone. The diminishing water levels in the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, as well as seawater intrusion from the south toward al-Qurna in northern Basra, have dramatically increased soil salinity. In 2022, the United Nations reported that this resulted in the destruction of more than 60,000 acres of agricultural land and the loss of 30,000 trees. The head of the Agricultural Engineers Syndicate reported in 2018 that salinity and water scarcity had eliminated 87 percent of Basra governorate’s 20,000 square kilometers (7,700 sq. miles) of arable land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences have been particularly acute for Iraq’s marshes. According to the MoWR’s Center for Restoration of the Iraqi Marshes and Wetlands, nearly 70 percent of the marshlands’ water has dried up, making the salinization even worse. In Al Chibayish marsh in northwest Basra, for example, salinity levels ranged between 2,300 to 3,000 ppm in July 2021; by July 2023, the salinity doubled, surpassing 6,000 ppm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water scarcity, salinity, and pollution have significantly decreased local fish and buffalo numbers. Tens of thousands of fish in southern Iraq are killed during the summer months as water fails to reach the south or becomes too saline for the fish to survive. Buffalo farmers are increasingly finding their herds stuck in the mud of dissipating streams and sickening from lack of fresh water. Some estimate that Iraq has lost 80 percent of its original buffalo population. Inhabitants of the Hawizeh marsh in southeast Iraq have struggled to secure even basic water supplies for domestic use. While there are numerous reasons for the decrease in water levels, including a major Iran-built dam on the Al Karkheh River in 2009, frustrated residents have threatened to march on nearby oil companies to shut down their operations and demand that government take action to curb the companies’ water usage, which involved pumping up to three barrels of water into the ground for every barrel of oil produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not, however, these communities are unable to confront powerful economic and political players. Most people cope in any way they can. To sustain their crops and livestock, some have resorted to purchasing expensive water from tanker trucks. Many families have been forced to sell off surviving livestock, losing a lifetime of assets in the process. More and more families who depend on fishing and animal husbandry have either moved to the north, toward Baghdad (on the Tigris) or Najaf (on the Euphrates); some have gone farther south to Basra, with the hope that conditions will be more conducive to their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between January 2016 and October 2022, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), water insecurity and environmental degradation displaced more than 55,000 people in central and southern Iraq. This figure represents approximately 15 percent of the previous population of these areas. Notably, the governorates of Thi-Qar, Missan, and Qadissiya, which host large farming communities, witnessed the highest displacement rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a proper governmental response to the crisis has led to increased displacement and conflict over water, resources, and services. As men, and then entire households, move to urban centers for better labor opportunities, they face another set of challenges. The lack of planning and assistance for both host communities and the displaced has exacerbated instability. Farmers, accustomed to rural life, find themselves living in smaller, crowded spaces, socially marginalized, and facing discrimination in housing and education. In lieu of adequate housing for these newcomers, informal neighborhoods have rapidly expanded. The government typically underserves these communities, and many urbanites regard them as hubs for criminality. Even environmental activists from Basra and Amara have attributed the escalating drug trade in border regions to drought and a lack of job opportunities for displaced families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq has been unable to accommodate its growing urban population. In 2011, housing shortages affected less than 10 percent of Iraqis. By 2024, the housing shortage was estimated to be in excess of 3 million units—a number thought to affect a quarter of the Iraqi population. To address the housing and services shortages, the current Iraqi government has been keen to allow private contractors to invest in the construction of residential complexes. However, the unprecedented support for these efforts—in the form of cheap land acquisitions and lavish loans to certain investors and developers—has been marred by corruption, making most new housing unaffordable for the average family. For example, well-connected individuals can take property deeds to banks and deposit them as security for loans totaling three to five times the property’s value, and then use the cash for new acquisitions. In November 2022, the current government’s Council of Ministers approved decision No. 320, which allowed for development of buildings on agricultural land. However, this changing of land-use patterns comes at the cost of fertile areas and further disturbs the country’s fragile food market. These actions are unlikely to close the gaps in housing supply and basic services and may even cause further environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social and political tensions over water scarcity have now reached a dangerous pitch in Iraq, which is still fragile from decades of war and entrenched mistrust, both between internal communities and with neighboring countries. Increased tensions have occasionally led to conflict, particularly among tribes in Maysan and north Basra. In 2017, tribes in the southern governorate of Al-Muthanna threatened war with others in Diwaniya governorate who had exceeded their fair share of water; in 2021, one official in Dhi Qar warned that local authorities feared tribal conflict could break out at any time. Rather than levelling the playing field, however, this competition often comes at the expense of impoverished farmers who have lost their access to water—and their farms and livelihoods along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central government, municipal governments, and communities also trade accusations of who is responsible for water scarcity. Rice farmers in the central governorates of Najaf and Diwaniyah, for example, accuse the central authorities of diverting their water to sustain the southern marshes, while marsh inhabitants accuse rice growers in these middle Euphrates governorates of consuming large quantities of water, preventing the rivers from flowing into the marshes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water scarcity has also led to tensions between rural communities and between farmers and oil companies, which need water for non-drinking purposes. Tribal leaders and influential locals frequently dig trenches or establish illegal wells to tap into shared resources when water levels get low. Local government officials are often powerless to stop them but also fear the outbreak of larger conflict as powerful individuals secure their own water at others’ expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Iraqi government does not reform water management to respond to scarcity while oil prices are high, the country may be heading for collapse, with underdevelopment and rising societal violence between armed tribesmen and militias in the years ahead. However, the governance challenges are very real. Understanding governance obstacles may allow Iraq to triage feasible and high-impact policies to address this critical moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Iraqi government does not reform water management to respond to scarcity while oil prices are high, the country may be heading for collapse, with underdevelopment and rising societal violence between armed tribesmen and militias in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-challenges-contributing-to-water-insecurity&quot;&gt;Governance Challenges Contributing to Water Insecurity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraqi politics and governance, especially in the past three decades, have become the biggest impediments to water security. Even transboundary issues can, in part, be tied to Iraq’s governance challenges. While Iraq was embroiled in conflict or suffering under economic sanctions, the surrounding riparian countries strengthened their control over shared rivers and tributaries. During these years, a struggling Iraqi government had more immediate priorities than securing fair and binding international agreements with Turkey and Iran. A fragile and fractured Iraq also could not prioritize long-term water and sanitation needs or improve water management practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main impediment to prioritizing water is simple. Water is cheap, if not free, across Iraq, even though water and sanitation infrastructure is expensive and requires constant maintenance. As such, the management of water and sanitation tends to fall low on the government’s priority list. Wastewater treatment is a particularly egregious example of this political problem. Such treatment is socially and economically beneficial, protecting people’s health and the environment they depend on, but presents no immediate benefit for politicians seeking flashy, popularity-boosting projects that will get them reelected. As such, Iraq spends less than it should on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). WASH spending ranged from 0.47 percent of the government’s total operational expenditures in 2018 to just 0.72 percent of total expenditures in 2021. The government would need to spend approximately 4 percent of its usual expenditure to achieve universal access to safely managed WASH services by 2030. Taking population growth into consideration, the financing gap between available resources for public WASH services and the resources needed to achieve universal access to such facilities will more than double between 2022 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the low levels of spending on basic services, there have been significant delays in allocating the minimal resources available. Iraqi politicians have regularly delayed the implementation of reforms and infrastructure investments in order to safeguard their political gains and interests. Tensions between the central government, the KRG, and other local authorities, in addition to disagreements between political factions, have significantly delayed budget provisions for water services. In 2021, due to political skirmishes, the national budget was not approved. In 2023, the budget was not approved until June because of a disagreement over the sale and distribution of oil and gas revenues. This delay resulted in many projects not coming to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to broader government dysfunction, Iraq’s water sector is fragmented. It encompasses many stakeholders, including the MoWR; the Ministry of Construction, Municipalities and Public Works; the Baghdad Mayoralty; the Ministry of Agriculture; the KRG; and local authorities at the governorate levels. The functions of all these entities overlap and often work at cross-purposes, making it difficult for southern governorates, or any one entity, to take control of and responsibility for a project from planning to operation. This leads to significant delays and lack of accountability. For example, when contaminated drinking water sent 118,000 people to hospitals in Basra in 2018, the Water Directorate and local politicians tried to shift the blame to the MoWR, which is responsible for water supply but not for the maintenance of the distribution system, which was the source of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tensions also rise when the governorates’ Water Directorates demand more water allocation than the MoWR is able to give, or when local authorities demand more autonomy over infrastructure projects. The disconnect between the needs of the governorates and the central administration’s authority to dole out funds is partially a remnant of the post-conflict reconstruction that followed the U.S. government overthrow of the Ba’athist government. After the 2003 U.S. invasion and occupation, the Iraqi government was decentralized under the tutelage of the United States. The de-Ba’athification process created a vacuum when Ba’athist bureaucrats and technocrats were essentially thrown out of government. A country that used to be centrally controlled was suddenly transformed into a decentralized apparatus, leaving sizable gray areas between the entrenched central authority and the burgeoning, capacity-deficient local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donors and the government have since tried to reform the bureaucracy and bridge local and central actors in various ways. In the water sector, this effort has centered on the creation of a National Water Council (NWC). The NWC was supposed to be responsible for devising and leading strategic water reforms, implementing climate change adaptation measures, financing major desalination projects, and introducing water-saving technologies. In 2005, the final proposal for the NWC’s mandate was presented to the Iraqi government for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the proposed NWC remains shelved for various reasons, including politicians’ watering down of the initial concept in subsequent negotiations. Rather than creating water management plans for the country, supervising the implementation of those plans, and allocating funds for strategic projects to ensure water sustainability, politicians attempted to turn the NWC into yet another bureaucratic body. As a result, the NWC would have implemented narrow projects instead of taking on a more holistic and influential role in determining the direction of the development of Iraq’s water resources, improving overall water management sustainability, and helping the country adapt to climate change. There were also no guarantees that the new NWC would be able to hire qualified, competent, and independent technocrats and experts, since politicians proposed filling its ranks with high-level government employees at the deputy minister and general director levels—excluding, or at least narrowing, the chances for independent experts to come in from outside the prevailing bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these challenges, instead of focusing on strategic and long-term solutions to water and sanitation, the country has found itself dealing with water issues in an ad hoc fashion, sometimes too late. The drinking water sector in southern Iraq is a casualty of this crisis-management approach. Despite acknowledgment of the need for desalination plants to supply Basra after the destruction of the city and the Shatt Al-Arab during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, the Iraqi government did not diversify water sources. Basra’s drinking water still comes from two sources: the Shatt Al-Arab and the Sweet Water Canal (SWC), known locally as Bad’a Canal. The SWC is a 238-km-long open canal built in 1997 to convey fresh water from the Al-Gharaf River, north of the city of Nasiriyah, to the north of Basra. However, the government estimated that the SWC would only be serviceable for five years, during which time the administration was supposed to build major desalination plants. But the SWC, despite its fragility, is still in operation nearly three decades later. In the last few years, the MoWR has pushed to replace the open canal with expensive ductile pipes. The government spent millions of dollars to purchase the pipes, but the project has been delayed and the National Commission of Integrity has raised suspicions of corruption. A number of public servants within MoWR are currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iraqi government is beginning to understand and grapple with these issues as a threat to its hold on political power. Prime Minister Sudani ran on a platform in 2022 of delivering better services and fostering collaboration with local governments. The administration in Basra, for example, has succeeded in scaling up project implementation after feeling public pressure to provide better water and sanitation services after the city’s 2018 water contamination crisis. Politicians have begun to realize that improving water security is in their interests if they wish to survive. As such, there has been growing momentum for long-delayed projects, but much more needs to be done to systemically manage the vested interests that continue to plague Iraq’s water governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-bright-future-for-basra&quot;&gt;A Bright Future for Basra&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the situation in Iraq seems dire, the country has a major advantage compared to many others in the region that suffer from even more pronounced scarcity. Iraq has plentiful oil revenues to deal with the challenge. If it spends those revenues in the service of preserving fresh water, protecting its environment, introducing technologies to develop nonconventional water resources, and shifting the economy away from water-intensive sectors, Basra could survive growing scarcity and eventually prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financially and geographically, the city is the best-suited governorate to handle the challenges of providing water and sanitation services. It produces over 70 percent of Iraq’s oil and has six commercial ports and two land border crossings. In theory, Basra has ample extra-budgetary financial allocation from so-called “petrodollar” provisions designed to compensate the oil-producing governorate. Petrodollar funds and regional development allocations for Basra amounted to nearly $1.3 billion in 2023. This puts Basra in a better position to demand more budget allocations for infrastructure development. Politicians know that a stable, oil-rich Basra serves their political interests. And a stable Basra is one in which its most urgent problem, water, is addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basra can do little about the broader government paralysis or the water-intensive agricultural sector, which would take massive funding and political courage to change. Without broader investment, agriculture—particularly on the banks of Shatt Al-Arab—will remain unprofitable due to soil salinization. As a downstream province, there is also little that Basra can do to stop upstream communities from diverting and polluting the waters. Since the central government must negotiate transboundary issues, local authorities focus on improving the quality of the only waters that they have access to: the Shatt Al-Arab and the area’s groundwater, both of which are saline and heavily polluted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the country will need to drive a shift away from water-intensive agricultural practices and, in some places, away from traditional agriculture altogether. But in the meantime, ensuring clean water for all citizens, as well as adequate housing and jobs for those displaced by the water crisis, will be paramount. It may also be the most politically feasible path to walk today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MUNICIPAL WATER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water supply management is one of the few areas where the local government in Basra has had some recent wins. Recognizing that a stable Basra—the principal source of Iraq’s oil—is essential, Prime Minister Sudani’s government transferred the responsibility for implementing a major water initiative, the Great Basra Water Project, from the Ministry of Housing, Construction, Municipalities and Public Works to the local government of Basra. The Great Basra Water Project, funded by a $3 billion Japanese loan and launched in 2014, is aimed at supplying clean water for domestic use in Basra. While the project previously faced challenges such as delays in releasing funds, tribal conflicts, and political interference, it is now functioning at almost full capacity, supplying purified and desalinated water to northern and central Basra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plant with a capacity to desalinate 72,000 m³ (about 19 million gallons) of water per day from Shatt al Arab for the Abu Al Khaseeb district has now been operational since February 2022, and a desalination project for groundwater is under construction in Um Qasar, with a 1,000 m³/h capacity. Other proposed plans include the transference of water 80 km from Qurna District to the Shatt Al Arab and rehabilitating pipelines. These projects will decrease water losses from older pipelines that were fragile, outdated, and easily broken, all contributing factors to health issues and water wastage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, after years of delays, the central government has also handed over responsibility to the Basra authority for the construction of one of the largest seawater desalination plants in the world. A plant producing one mcm of water per day will be constructed at Fao, south of Basra. If implemented successfully, it will be the largest reverse osmosis (RO) purified water desalination plant in the world. There is finally progress on the project now, after years of delays due to corruption-related scandals. The Basra governorate awarded the multi-billion-dollar megaproject to a joint-venture of PowerChina, a Chinese company, and al-Ridha, a local company in 2024. The project is not cost-effective, since water will have to be pumped a long way to reach urban residents further north, but it is still welcome for many residents and politicians who have been waiting years for a boost to Iraq’s drinking water supply. In the future, since the central and local governments lack capacity to run large desalination and wastewater treatment plants, new potential projects should seek reputable contractors to construct plants based on a build-operate-transfer model to avoid potential financial and technical deficiencies and to train the next generation on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While desalination projects alone cannot tackle all drivers of water insecurity, Basra authorities believe the only way they can address the crisis is by improving the quality of what they receive from the northern provinces and increasing supply through desalination. However, it will be equally important to convey potable water from treatment plants to distant city neighborhoods through a network of well-designed and -implemented transmission pipes. Therefore, investing in renovating both transmission pipelines and the overall distribution network will be essential to providing potable water from the yet-to-be-constructed desalination plants or from the existing conventional water treatment plants in the city. This may also reduce tensions between communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the government invests in a split system, where potable desalinated water is delivered via a new but smaller distribution network that functions parallel to the existing one, clean tap water could be provided to every kitchen and linked to a meter that would charge households accordingly. This could overcome three major obstacles to providing affordable and safe drinking water: vested interests, inefficient transmission networks, and cost. Currently, private water companies selling RO purified water have established a monopoly over this essential good and are charging exorbitant prices as a result. For example, some households in Basra pay between $60 and $148 a month on drinking and cooking water. In a country where the average monthly take-home pay is just $549, the cost is crippling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the government is now spending large sums to produce desalinated water, it still cannot guarantee the safe and efficient delivery of this resource because of outdated or damaged transmission and distribution networks. With this split system, prices would be far lower than bottled water yet would still encourage water-saving behavior through a metered system. The government could also encourage RO businesses to invest in the plan, co-opting those that may sabotage it. Most importantly, this strategy enables politicians to provide safe and cost-effective water services more efficiently, scoring them political points on a heated issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AGRICULTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been little progress made on a holistic plan to reform the agricultural sector in Iraq. Since around 75 percent of Iraq’s water is used in agriculture, this stagnation significantly impedes efforts to improve water security. The agricultural sector also has the potential to spark conflict between local authorities and the central government, as well as between communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constitutionally, the provision of water for agricultural purposes remains within the purview of the MoWR and the central government of Iraq. Local authorities in Basra, therefore, argue that they do not have the capacity or mandate to tackle the issue. Officials from the Directorate of Agriculture in Basra and the governorate’s parliamentary representatives complain that the Ministry of Agriculture does not provide sufficient financial backing for the provision of modern irrigation systems or equipment to Basra farmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Basra government has also largely neglected the agricultural sector. The administration turns a blind eye to the illicit sale of agricultural land—such as in areas like Abu Al Khaseeb—which is then repurposed for housing or commercial ventures. This lack of oversight is partly due to the government’s emphasis on economic growth and job creation for youth, who typically do not see agricultural work as appealing. It is possible that the government also does not regard farmers as crucial to the city’s stability. After all, it was urban residents who led the 2018 protests related to water contamination and the subsequent hospitalization of tens of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet both the national government and Basra have made modest efforts to assist farmers. The MoWR allocated $300 million for the construction of the 128-km-long Basra Irrigation Canal, completed in 2017, to carry higher-quality water from the northern part of the Shatt Al-Arab to the south, aiming to irrigate about 100,000 dunums (around 39 square miles) on both sides of the river. The Basra government also established the Department of Plant Tissue Culture to spearhead the in-vitro propagation of date palms and other plant species capable of withstanding drought, heat, and salinization. While the department has successfully developed certain vegetables (e.g., tomatoes) as well as tree species (e.g., bananas), its outreach and impact have been underwhelming. According to a senior engineer at the department, a limited budget has constrained the department’s capacity and resources to expand production, market its products, and support farmers throughout the governorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater budget allocations from the central government could rehabilitate existing distribution networks, transmission pipes, and drainage infrastructure, as well as shift farmers to less water-intensive crops and irrigation methods. However, reforming the agricultural sector will take more than one-off infrastructure projects. Saving agriculture in Basra for small- and medium-sized farms is a monumental task that would require a systemic shift in crop selection, irrigation methods, and trade. These changes would require more fundamental changes to Iraq’s economy. The government would need to subsidize the planting of less water-intensive crops, protect drought-resistant crops with import tariffs, and encourage the import of water-intensive products. This could improve the situation for farmers more generally. Many of the goods produced in Iraq are already uncompetitive with regional imports due to high production costs, severe power shortages, and an open border through which uncontrolled and untaxed imports are regularly dumped on the country. Regulating trade could partially protect Iraqi markets and promote the import of virtual water (i.e., the amount of water used to produce goods and services throughout their value chain). But better-regulated trade in an age of endemic corruption will be challenging in the near term, as will efforts to systemically change agricultural practices that have existed in Iraq for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the local government will need to create social safety nets and support a larger ecosystem of job growth and urban development. Basra needs to explore tangible solutions for assisting farmers who have been forced to abandon agriculture and animal husbandry either temporarily or permanently. This could involve initiatives such as vocational training programs, increases in job compensation, and effective emergency interventions to sustain drought-stricken communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accommodate urbanization, the central and local governments should accelerate the development of urban areas to ensure that newcomers receive decent low-income housing and services, rather than criminalizing those forced to move to cities. The government will also need to protect remaining fertile areas and encourage the development of low-income housing in cities, rather than selling arable land to developers for considerable profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a number of housing compounds cater to low- and medium-income households, these mainly host government employees whose regular salaries allow them to afford monthly mortgage payments. For others, acquiring a government home loan is fraught. Bank transactions are still paper-based, which makes the sector convoluted for most Iraqis and susceptible to corruption. Iraq’s land and property registration processes are also paper-based, and data is not shared between government agencies. This dysfunctional system creates advantages for savvy businesspeople but does not serve ordinary Iraqis. Internet banking would increase transparency, alleviate the burden on understaffed banks, and open home ownership to more Iraqis. These latter two points could incentivize private developers to build low-income housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To alleviate the stress on water supplies and rural communities in drought years, local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the MoWR have compensated farmers to reduce the agricultural areas they cultivated. These initiatives have provided some relief to communities and may help to curb displacement and potential instability. However, land-use regulations and compensation typically do not apply to all farmers, especially smallholders. More powerful landowners tend to circumvent restrictions, diminishing the positive impact of austerity measures. Still, providing more of a social safety net, accompanied by longer-term assistance—through either alternative housing and jobs or the provision of drought-resistant seeds and irrigation systems—could ease the pain of scarce years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSBOUNDARY NEGOTIATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While transboundary relations are outside the purview of the southern governorates, improving water-sharing remains the most impactful way to improve water quality and quantity in Basra. To address external factors contributing to the water crisis, Iraq can leverage trade and other shared interests with Iran and Turkey to advocate for greater regional environmental cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central government could leverage trade and security agreements to turn transboundary negotiations from a zero-sum game to one in which Iraq, as a downstream country, is on more equal footing. The value of exports from Turkey to Iraq in 2022 was $13.8 billion, and in 2023, Iraq was Turkey’s third-largest trading partner. The recent Development Road Project, one of the 26 memorandums of understanding signed during Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s visit to Iraq in 2024, is another opportunity to expand negotiations over shared interests, including water resources. The project aims to establish a trade route connecting Basra to Turkey and eventually to Europe. Exploring how water could be incorporated into such agreements could further enhance economic cooperation, in addition to enhancing peace and stability. Turkey has also conducted military operations on Iraqi soil, targeting the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara considers to be a terrorist group. As much as possible, such cooperation or acquiescence by Iraq should be tied to greater water cooperation. This security relationship, as well as direct official Iraqi government requests, have already encouraged Ankara to release more water to Iraq during scarce years—but these are typically ad hoc arrangements. Agreements on transboundary water need to be adaptable medium- and long-term arrangements for equitable and reasonable water sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent wins with Iran on transboundary waters have also been tied to non-water-related issues. Water quality deterioration in the Shatt Al-Arab have largely been a result of Iran diverting the waters of the Karun and Karkheh rivers from Iraq, causing a sharp increase in water salinity due to sea water flowing into the Shatt al-Arab. In the summer of 2023, Iran released the Karun River to boost its alliance with Baghdad’s new regime, the Coordination Framework government, which was battling popular anger in Basra resulting from, among other issues, the deterioration of the Shatt Al-Arab. Typically, however, Iran refuses to communicate with Iraq over water issues. Connecting water to Iraq’s stability and to bilateral trade may convince Iran to be more consistently cooperative—but that seems unlikely, given Tehran’s extensive economic, military, and political influence over Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obligations under various other international conventions could also serve as a basis for negotiated arrangements on shared waters. In 2023, Iraq became the first Arab country to sign the 1992 UN Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (known as the UN Water Convention), highlighting its increased interest in water insecurity. While upstream countries are not party to the convention, they are parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The states that are members of these conventions take on certain obligations that, if implemented in Iraq, would benefit the country. Annual international conferences of parties could also provide platforms for promoting Iraqi positions and securing international diplomatic and technical support from Iraq’s upstream neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoWR holds key responsibilities in maintaining Iraq’s fair water shares with upstream neighbors and within the country itself. Better internal coordination between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the MoWR could also enhance Iraq’s negotiating position in international conferences and boost water security as a national priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the downstream part of a downstream country, southern Iraq is a manifestation of catastrophic change. Water scarcity and environmental degradation are already leading to increased violence and tension both within farming communities and between newly displaced families and urban populations. Taking steps to tackle this overwhelming problem is a must, but the reasons for Basra’s water insecurity are complex and intertwined with both Iraq’s ancient and recent history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over millennia, the people of southern Iraq adapted to water abundance. More than just surviving, communities prospered by learning to work around the floods every spring. The environmental benefits of these waters, particularly in the marshlands, made the region habitable. The waters moderated extreme summer heat, preserved the biodiversity that communities depended on, and provided livelihoods, food, and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, that former abundance has become a curse. Generations of floods entrenched social, cultural, and economic behaviors in Iraq that are difficult to shake in this era of scarcity, and in the shadow of near-constant war and sanctions. Renewed urgency has led to greater advocacy on the international stage and the completion of some long-delayed infrastructure projects. But to avoid further instability, Iraq—a country that has suffered from years of violence and sanctions—will need to finally prioritize water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regionally, the government will need to strengthen its economic and diplomatic position to better negotiate for transboundary waters. However, Iraq must also prepare for such diplomacy to not bear fruit. Political promises and water-sharing agreements among riparian countries have been falling apart. Turkey now regularly slashes its allocations of the Euphrates River to Syria—per a 1987 agreement—by half, and this affects Iraq further downstream. In a warming world, states’ water-sharing parsimony is likely to worsen. Moreover, there is little a city like Basra can do about transboundary partners or even other upstream users within the country, as the primary responsibility for negotiating water shares with other governorates and transboundary countries lies with the MoWR and the central government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A systemic shift in Iraq’s domestic water management is a must. The Ministry of Agriculture can promote modern irrigation technologies, regulate water-intensive crop cultivation, and introduce alternative crops for local consumption or export. These steps will gradually contribute to sustainable water management and agricultural practices in Iraq. Water management reforms could also improve Iraq’s negotiating posture with transboundary neighbors and with international donors and lenders. However, shifting agriculture away from water-intensive crops and irrigation methods will require the central government’s commitment to reorient the economy and tackle powerful vested interests and corruption. Without the ability to truly enforce regulations on water use, crops, and trade, the Iraqi government will struggle to see immediate benefits from such reforms. Worse, inconsistently enforcing these regulations could lead to increased societal tensions. In the near term, Iraq will need to find a path for reform that allows the government to circumvent or co-opt vested interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving municipal waters and services is a good place to start. With water issues in southern Iraq reaching crisis levels in recent years, politicians have an interest in investing in water security for their political survival. It is vitally important for the government to provide basic services, such as water and electricity, at affordable prices. It is a major task, but one that is politically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Basra illustrates how instability and threats to political power—in the form of water protests in 2018—can compel both central and local governments to address water issues. Investing in renewed distribution systems, as well as water and wastewater treatment plants, will mitigate future health crises. By developing a new drinking water transmission system, the government will also be able to provide affordable potable water to its citizens while collecting revenue. Handing over project implementation to local authorities, with significant monitoring by loan providers, could also hasten more responsible project implementation. Constituents will be able to see the immediate benefits, making such reforms beneficial for politicians focused on their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future may look different than the past, but it will be more sustainable for Iraqis, as it will curb instability and violence. Addressing the water crisis will also help the government rebuild trust with communities that have already endured too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-political-economy-of-water-insecurity-in-jordan&quot;&gt;The Political Economy of Water Insecurity in Jordan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;neda-zawahri&quot;&gt;Neda Zawahri&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TJIhFLW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan is in an unenviable position when it comes to water. It is a naturally arid country, downstream from unreliable transboundary neighbors. On top of these natural and geographic obstacles, it has struggled to tackle water management within its borders because of a number of regional and domestic political challenges. Despite the obstacles, Jordan will need to overcome its water insecurity to remain a viable state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s water scarcity has threatened the state’s security for decades. Due in part to a growing population and an increase in irrigated agriculture between 1950 and 1990, the government has been operating on a significant domestic water deficit since the 1990s. Current domestic water demand is 1.1 billion m3 per year, whereas the country’s available renewable water resources are just 977 mcm per year. Climate change, natural population growth, influxes of refugees, and the mismanagement of existing water resources threaten to exacerbate the water crisis. For now, Jordan covers the deficit of 151 mcm per year by buying additional water from Israel, mining near-depleted aquifers, and rationing water, but all of these strategies are precarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan overextracts from and, effectively, mines 10 of its 12 groundwater aquifers, by double the safe yields of some. This has contributed to a deterioration in water quality and increased salination. The Azraq and Amman-Zarqa aquifers, for example, are declining by one meter per year because of overextraction, which has increased the water’s salinity and nitrate concentration, making it unusable and even toxic in some areas. Parts of northern Jordan now receive piped household water just once a month, while the residents in the capital receive water once a week. This strategy for surviving water deficits is unsustainable and unreliable for meeting its present and future needs. Jordan’s ability to buy water from Israel has also been put under significant political strain in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing the population with access to safe and sufficient water will be integral to Jordan’s political stability and social and economic development, but the country faces numerous political, economic, and demographic challenges to achieving water security. The often-competing interests of domestic and international stakeholders, the political unreliability of multilateral water projects, and Jordan’s vulnerability to upstream consumption of transboundary rivers have all compromised the country’s efforts to secure a sustainable supply of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To confront this challenge, the Jordanian government needs to prioritize water security domestically. The country must reduce internal water demand and augment its internal water supplies to make itself more resilient to climate change and geopolitical shocks. Its allies—the United States, Germany, and France, who invest heavily in Jordan’s stability and viability as a state—should also support such a path to achieving water security within its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate this argument, this chapter will first provide background on Jordan’s natural limitations and the regional challenges it faces in securing water. It will lay out how and why Jordan’s persistent efforts toward transboundary cooperation have often fallen short, leaving it less resilient and in a constant state of crisis management. The chapter will then assess Jordan’s domestic water management challenges, analyzing the diverging interests of government institutions, local stakeholders, and the international donors upon whom Jordan heavily depends. It will then analyze why decades of prioritizing stability over sustainability have delayed necessary domestic reforms and brought the nation to multiple points of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the chapter suggests how the Jordanian government could follow through with long-delayed reforms with a more transparent process that provides ample carrots before sticks. And finally, while Jordan should continue to pursue multilateral efforts that can augment its water supply and build regional peace, the challenges of these efforts indicate that doing so within the country’s own boundaries may be the key to increasing its resilience to seemingly inevitable regional shocks. In building internal water resiliency, Jordan would be following the path of other regional states like Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-inhospitable-nature-and-neighborhood&quot;&gt;Background: Inhospitable Nature and Neighborhood&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By some measures, Jordan is the second-most water-scarce country in the world. Over 80 percent of its land is an arid desert—badia in Arabic—receiving less than 200 mm of rainfall per year. In 2021, it had about 61 m3 of renewable water available per capita per year, well below the 500 m3 per capita per year threshold marking absolute water scarcity for countries. Due to climate change, the Jordanian Ministry of Water and Irrigation, along with independent studies, anticipate that the country’s available freshwater will decline 15 percent further by 2040 and 50 percent further by century’s end, causing knock-on effects for food security and the economy. According to the World Bank, the reduction of water supply and climate change’s impacts on agriculture will cause a 6.8 percent decline in Jordan’s GDP by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional politics also affect Jordan’s water security in numerous ways. While Jordan is not itself embroiled in conflict, it has hosted multiple waves of refugees from conflict-affected neighboring countries. In addition to Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced from their homes in what is today Israel and the West Bank in 1948 and 1967, Jordan has absorbed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Syrian refugees in the past two decades. In fact, 13 percent of Jordan’s population are now Syrian refugees, and more than half of all Jordanians claim Palestinian descent. The influx of refugees has placed even more pressure on the country’s limited water supplies and its wastewater treatment facilities. Syrian refugees in northern Jordan, for example, have increased the region’s water demand by 40 percent. These influxes highlight the importance of Jordan’s ability to develop a reliable water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shocking as these population surges have been to Jordan’s water budget, perhaps few other issues affect the country’s water security like its transboundary relations with Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. Jordan is a downstream riparian country that sits along the transboundary Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers and the Disi aquifer, which together provide 25 percent of the country’s domestic water supply. However, this supply has become unreliable because of increased upstream consumption and regional tensions. Even when Jordan has negotiated bilateral treaties governing these transboundary water supplies, its military weakness relative to neighboring riparian countries and the general instability within the region have made it difficult to secure a fair share in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s northern neighbor presents an example of this challenge. The influx of a million Syrian refugees since 2011 has been one factor challenging Jordan’s water security, but even prior to the fall of Syria’s Assad regime in December 2024, Jordan has long struggled to obtain an adequate share of the Yarmouk River, which flows from Syria. Between 1953 and 2001, Syria and Jordan signed multiple bilateral agreements to share the Yarmouk and allow Jordan to construct the Wahda, or “Unity,” Dam. However, contrary to the spirit of its name, the transboundary relations between the Assad family and the Hashemite rulers of Jordan surrounding the dam were disappointing. With each consecutive treaty, the dam’s size has decreased, and Syria has secured its right to fill more of its own upstream dams prior to allowing the Wahda to fill. Due to this upstream consumption, the Wahda has never reached its full capacity of 110 mcm since it became operational in 2006. In 2013, as Syria’s stability was breaking down, the dam’s water reached 68 mcm for the first time. In 2018, the dam reached its highest capacity, at 88 mcm; but in 2022, as Assad’s regime increased its authority over the country, the water fell to just 28 mcm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the fall of the Assad regime, Israel invaded southwestern Syria and took control of both the Yarmouk River and the Wahda dam within Syrian territory. The lack of political stability in Syria and Israeli control of this water supply could affect Jordan’s water security. While the Wahda dam only provides around 10 percent of the country’s water needs in good years, these events point to the precariousness of Jordan’s transboundary situation. It is also a significant water and fishing source for southern Syria. At the time of writing, it is unclear what Israel’s long-term strategy is in terms of controlling this hydro-strategic territory and what impact this could have downstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, the fall of Assad is an opportunity for Jordan to amend its transboundary water-sharing agreement with its northern neighbor. The outdated agreement, which lacks details and effective enforcement mechanisms, is in dire need of an update. Given the new Syrian transitional government’s overt desire to have good relations with its neighbors, Jordan could take the opportunity to improve the distribution of basic services across boundaries—including water and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the southeast, relations are slightly more equitable with Jordan’s neighbor, Saudi Arabia, but still precarious. The Disi aquifer, which contains non-renewable, 30,000-year-old fossil water, traverses Jordan’s southeastern border. Since the 1980s, Saudi Arabia has extracted an unknown quantity of this groundwater to support agriculture. In Jordan, about 80 mcm per year is used for farming in the region around the Disi and for municipal water supply to nearby cities like Aqaba. But in 2013, desperate to provide water to its major cities in the northwest, where 94 percent of its population is concentrated, Jordan began transporting 100 mcm per year of Disi water 325 km north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Jordan and Saudi Arabia signed a treaty to govern their shared aquifer, agreeing to use the water in a protected area of the aquifer only for domestic uses. But the lack of quantitative allocation between the two states may lead to unsustainable depletion of the aquifer, complicating the treaty’s attempt at transparent cooperation and coordination. Many in Jordan, seeing the green farms over the border, believe that Saudi Arabia is still using the aquifer for agriculture. Remote-sensing analysis estimates that Saudi Arabia extracts 984 mcm per year from the aquifer in the city of Tabuk, near the border with Jordan, resulting in a precipitous decline of the water table within both states. Even in a best-case scenario, analysts estimate that the aquifer will be exhausted in 50 to 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if transboundary agreements could not be trickier, Jordan’s relations with its western neighbor, Israel, have become increasingly contentious. With more than half of Jordanians having ancestry from Palestine and much of the population sympathetic to the Palestinian plight, the Jordanian government has had to tread carefully in negotiations with Israel. To ease these tensions, the United States has expended enormous economic and political capital to promote cooperative transboundary water management of the Jordan River since the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not until 1994 that Israel and Jordan signed an official peace treaty, normalizing relations and laying out guidelines for water cooperation. Annex II of the treaty allocates shares of the Yarmouk River’s water and commits to the construction of joint water projects between the states. However, aspects of the treaty disadvantaged Jordan or were never carried out, and so Jordan was expected to gain much more water than it actually has. For example, according to the treaty, the signatory states share the Yarmouk River with Israel, which diverts a fixed allocation of the waters from the river before it reaches Jordan. Using a fixed allocation effectively secured a predictable water supply for Israel but left Jordan’s share vulnerable to droughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To secure some of Jordan’s share of water from the lower Jordan River, the treaty called for the construction of storage facilities to capture flood waters. But after years of negotiations, the storage facilities to capture 20 mcm of flood water were never constructed. As a result, Jordan effectively lost its share of the lower Jordan River. Israel diverts 97 percent of the upper Jordan River through its 1964 National Water Carrier, after which the river connects to the Yarmouk to form the lower Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treaty also called for the construction of a desalination plant. But due to ambiguities in the agreement over the source of water to be desalinated and the source of funding for the project, the desalination plant—meant to give Jordan 50 mcm per year of water—was never constructed, which resulted in Jordan losing 25 mcm per year of high-quality water. Instead, Israel committed to allocate 25 mcm per year to Jordan from Lake Tiberias, where the water quality is much worse. The combination of ambiguities brought about by a rushed treaty and the failure to implement treaty provisions has meant that Jordanian negotiators and the Jordanian public believe they have received far less than promised. This perception has only deepened as Jordan’s water deficit has increased due to population growth and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help meet it domestic deficits, Jordan periodically purchases additional water from Israel outside of the parameters of the 1994 peace treaty. But Jordan’s ability to purchase water from Israel has increasingly become hostage to bilateral relations between the states. Relations deteriorated so significantly in 2021—a time when Jordan was particularly water-stressed—that U.S. president Joe Biden had to intervene to persuade Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to sell 3 mcm to Jordan. When Naftali Bennett became Israel’s prime minister in the summer of 2021, he approved the sale of 50 mcm of water, but this agreement expired in May 2024, once again putting Jordan’s water in jeopardy. Media reports indicated that Israel would withhold the water until Jordan restrained its criticism of the war in Gaza and allowed for the exchange of ambassadors. However, in April, after Jordan assisted in shooting down Iranian drones headed to Israel, Netanyahu agreed to a six-month extension of the 50 mcm sale of water as a reward for Jordan’s assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strained bilateral relations have periodically challenged Jordan’s ability not only to purchase additional water from Israel but also to build multilateral projects, such as the Red Sea–Dead Sea Conveyance (RSDSC) system and the energy-for-water exchange known as Project Prosperity, both of which could augment domestic water supplies for Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Jordan and Israel approached the World Bank for help with constructing the RSDSC. The project was to provide Jordan and southern Israel with desalinated water, save the declining Dead Sea by discharging brine via a desalination plant in Aqaba, and encourage peace between the signatory states. A 2013 agreement stipulated that 200 mcm per year would be extracted from the Red Sea, for the production of 80–100 mcm per year of potable water. But in 2021, Jordan nixed the highly touted joint venture due to Israel’s decreased interest in the project, pressures from environmentalists, and increasing bilateral tensions between Prime Minister Netanyahu and King Abdullah of Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of fruitless negotiations over the RSDSC, that agreement was not the last proposition for transboundary water projects. In 2022, Israel, Jordan, and the UAE signed a memorandum of understanding to undertake an energy-for-water exchange whereby Jordan would build a solar power facility and sell 600 megawatts (MW) of its generated electricity to Israel. In return, Israel would build a desalination plant to sell 200 mcm per year of water to Jordan. The UAE committed to providing funding and technology for the solar power plant through its government-owned company, Masdar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project was widely unpopular with the Jordanian public because it left out Palestinians and made Jordan’s water security even more dependent on Israel. While the deal would cover 20 percent of Jordan’s water budget, it would cover only 2 percent of electricity consumption for Israel, a country already rich in natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project seemed set to move ahead. But in November 2023, Jordan refused to proceed with it due to deteriorating bilateral relations over what Jordan’s leadership and population felt was a disproportionate Israeli military offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what will happen to the deal in the long run. But what has become evident is that these transboundary projects, whether with Israel or Syria, are highly vulnerable to regional and bilateral politics, climate change, and the upstream consumption of water. While Jordan expected to gain a total of 310 mcm per year from the aforementioned transboundary water agreements, the country ended up receiving only 120 mcm per year, including Jordan’s purchase of 50 mcm per year of water from Israel. As such, the Jordanian government has doubled down on investing in a National Conveyance project, which involves the construction of a solar-operated desalination plant to generate 300 mcm per year of water from the Red Sea port of Aqaba, then transport the water via an energy-intensive 450 km pipeline to population centers located at higher elevations in the north. The project would help Jordan meet its water needs and minimize the impact of regional tensions on its plans for water security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policymakers and peacemakers should remain hopeful for better days in the future, these examples demonstrate that water cooperation can fall prey to bilateral relations and regional politics. For a country as water-insecure as Jordan, entrenching such vulnerability could push the situation over the edge during another crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;jordans-domestic-challenges&quot;&gt;Jordan’s Domestic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the effects of these exogenous forces are numerous domestic challenges to improving water management. The diverging interests of government institutions, local stakeholders, and international donors have often slowed, weakened, or halted necessary reforms and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A WEAK WATER SECTOR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While governance of water is highly centralized in Jordan, many of the institutions responsible for improving water security are not empowered to affect change. Jordan’s hiring practices also tend not to incentivize high performance or innovation among public sector workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to absorb new entrants to the workforce, the government often doles out public sector jobs, especially to those with influential tribal family connections. This makes it difficult to hire competent staff with relevant skills or to lay off unproductive civil servants. Moreover, due to meager pay in the public sector, government institutions—including the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI)—tend to lose those with technical skills to the very donors and private sector actors that they work with. While the MWI has a corps of competent engineers, decisionmaking and innovation is not common beyond this cohort of engineers. Rather, the ministry is bloated and overstaffed with unqualified and unmotivated employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this broader issue with the public sector, there are institutional challenges unique to the water sector. Jordan has many different institutions responsible for various aspects of water use, each with separate goals and mandates. As a result, as with the Ministry of Water Resources in Iraq, the MWI lacks the authority to systemically tackle water insecurity. For example, only the Jordanian cabinet can change the price of municipal or agricultural water, not the MWI. Consequently, the minister in charge of MWI depends on a group of political elites who have little interest in changing the status quo, even to make decisions that directly affect the country’s financial capacity and economic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment, and the MWI, domestic water resources are also governed by two autonomous bodies, the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) and the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA). The JVA is responsible for water management in the agriculturally important Jordan Valley, while WAJ is responsible for municipal and industrial water supply and wastewater treatment. The MWI develops the national water strategy, but it depends on all the aforementioned institutions for implementation. The MWI itself does not have the power or resources to implement its own strategy. When competing interests from agencies such as the Ministries of Agriculture and Interior—which are not incentivized to curb overpumping of water—fail to implement parts of the strategy, there is little the MWI can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the MWI is in a difficult position, the reality is that in all of these institutions, bureaucrats are more focused on political stability than on efficiency, economic recovery, or conservation. This mindset affects their ability to rein in elite farmers’ unsustainable water consumption in the water-poor highlands, the Jordan Valley, and in the southern desert. Raising the price of irrigation water would upset the monarchy’s powerful tribal base. Regulating water consumption has proven equally difficult. In the words of one water expert in 2023, “People would go crazy if you cut off their water here. You can’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balancing the interests of different institutions and constituencies makes it difficult for local authorities to curb not only overconsumption driven by ongoing water subsidies but also leakage and outright theft. Jordan loses 50 percent of its produced water—so-called non-revenue water—due to leaks, thefts, and inaccurate metering. Experts estimate that this could amount to 100–150 mcm per year. USAID estimates that the Jordanian government loses $500 million annually from non-revenue water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the institutions governing the country’s water supply lack the political power to enforce sensitive policies, curbing water theft has become especially challenging. Individuals seeking to resell stolen water face fines of 5,000 Jordanian dinars and jail terms of up to three years. But prosecution typically does not extend to those with powerful connections. Even when punishment is enforced, it does not appear to deter repeat offenders, as reselling stolen water to the municipal and agricultural sectors is very lucrative. In this environment, water thieves have become organized mafias. They attack the pipelines and disrupt a neighborhood’s water supply. After stealing the water, they resell it to the neighborhood at inflated prices via water tankers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, despite several government campaigns to snuff out water theft, it is still ubiquitous. In 2022, Jordanian government officials identified 10,000 cases of water theft across the country and hundreds of illegal wells. That year, they estimated that about 10 mcm of water was lost to theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has had more success curbing water consumption indirectly. For example, in comparison with the rest of the region, Jordan is doing fairly well in wastewater treatment and reuse. Much of this success is due to the expansion of Jordan’s largest wastewater treatment plant, completed in 2015. The As-Samra wastewater treatment plant handles 65 percent of Jordan’s urban wastewater and runs almost entirely on hydropower and biogas. Getting farmers to agree to use treated wastewater was initially challenging. However, when the government simply began channeling the treated effluent from As-Samra to the King Abdullah Canal, upon which lower Jordan Valley cultivators depend, the farmers were effectively made to use the treated wastewater—mixed with surface and rainwater—to irrigate their crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there is room for improvement. The government incurs high energy costs to pump wastewater to As-Samra, and a significant share of the country’s wastewater remains untreated. To address these issues, experts note that the government needs to expand and decentralize wastewater treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most rural areas continue to lack access to wastewater treatment facilities, contributing to the deteriorating quality of Jordan’s already-scarce fresh water. In a country as water-stressed as Jordan, resolving these issues would not just be a boon to water quality but a necessity in confronting an even drier future. However, for many Jordanians, having a wastewater treatment facility near one’s home or land is still shunned. Farmers using treated wastewater, and those living near such facilities, fear that their crops or land will be devalued. To move forward, Jordan will need to educate these communities on the benefits of wastewater treatment and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-donors-a-mismatch-between-hopes-and-realities&quot;&gt;The Role of Donors: A Mismatch Between Hopes and Realities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the oil-rich Gulf States and Israel, which can use their financial resources to construct desalination and wastewater treatment plants to significantly augment domestic water supply, Jordan’s limited financial capacity makes it heavily reliant on the international donor community. It depends on external funding for the construction, operation, and maintenance of its hydrological infrastructure, as well as to cover the large budget deficits of its water institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International financial aid, consisting of both grants and loans to the water and agricultural sectors, represents a significant portion of Jordan’s already generous package of loans and assistance. In 2022, Jordan received $4.4 billion in aid, of which 14.4 percent went to the water and sanitation sector and 13.2 percent went to food security and agriculture. As such, Jordan must balance the interests of donors and its population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank, USAID, and others have all pressured Jordan to raise its water tariffs, cut subsidies, trim bloated bureaucracies, and cut non-revenue water. At times, donors have advised Jordan to undertake all these policy modifications simultaneously. However, when the Jordanian government hesitates or when protests are predicted, donors tend to pull back, leaving nothing resolved. In some cases, projects to bridge the gaps between donor and local stakeholder interests mean that projects become unsustainable or are never completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many examples of this clash between Jordan’s political realities and donors’ plans. One example is the effort of the German aid agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to fund the creation of water user associations (WUAs) in 2001. The goal was to improve the efficiency of farmers’ water use in the Jordan Valley, manage operational and maintenance problems in the delivery of water, improve cost recovery of irrigation water for the Jordan Valley Authority, and develop a system of participatory management for irrigation water. The WUAs led to some positive outcomes. It allowed farmers to monitor water thefts and manipulation of water meters, as well as to carry out minor maintenance. But in the end, the WUAs simply became extensions of a powerful tribal network that used the associations to resist the enforcement of water conservation policies—including those to reduce theft and use treated wastewater in the northern Jordan Valley. The presidents of the WUAs—typically tribal leaders— often hired workers with connections, rather than technical skills, to monitor pipes and open taps. The WUAs also allowed smaller farmers to resist government policies as they rode on the coattails of powerful farmers’ lobbying through the associations. While that solidarity decreased theft between farmers, it may have enabled more theft from the Jordanian state’s water resources, like the King Abdullah Canal. The positive impact on Jordan’s water deficit and water management have remained minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies of WUAs reveal that their effectiveness depends on understanding the socioeconomic, political, and cultural context in which they operate. In this case, donors failed to account for the divergent interests of stakeholders, which limited the WUAs’ effectiveness. Farmers saw membership in a WUA as a means of securing water and a path to patronage, while employees at the Jordan Valley Authority sought to protect their institutional power and feared the devolution of authority to a WUA. Had donors understood the sociopolitical context in the basin, then efforts by powerful tribes to capture resources could have been managed more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highland Water Forum (HWF) provides another example of donors attempting to implement participatory water management without fully appreciating the sociopolitical context. The MWI, the French government, and GIZ established the forum in 2010 to enhance the efficiency of irrigation water use, reduce groundwater abstraction of the overexploited Azraq aquifer and wetland, and improve the participatory decision-making process. The project brought together 60 stakeholders—including farmers, government institutions, research centers, and NGOs—to develop ideas to protect the aquifer’s dwindling water. In 2013, an action plan was presented to the MWI’s minister, with policy recommendations that included revising bylaws and well regulations, establishing a rainwater harvesting program, and improving the collection and dissemination of data on irrigation water-use efficiency. But once GIZ funding ended, more financial support did not materialize. When the project ended with little follow-through on the recommendations, farmers who took part in the process, expecting financial gains and greater access to water, were dissatisfied. Without the sustained support to provide these benefits, MWI had no way of using the forum as a way of mediating its reforms—its priority with the project. And while donor governments saw the forum as a way of enforcing the 2002 groundwater abstraction law, they failed to support the elements of the program that may have won farmers’ support—or at least their acquiescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like so many initiatives, without sustainable financial support and with frequent changes in both the leadership of the MWI and the representatives of Jordan’s donors, the Highland Water Forum fizzled out. The next MWI strategic plan did not even mention it. In this case, even when there was good faith from farmers to participate in a process like the forum, there was no follow-up or understanding of incentives. This breaks trust on all sides: farmers become less inclined to participate in the next process, while donors and the MWI trust the farmers less. No one’s motivations were adequately responded to, and incentives were not built into the process to accompany requisite sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with slight modifications and longer-term support, many projects could be more successful. For example, the agricultural component of one such project to connect private sector suppliers of water-conserving technologies to farms proved to be enormously cost-effective. The Water Innovations Technologies (WIT) project, active from 2017 to 2022, was successful for a time at improving water savings at relatively low cost. But without price mechanisms or crop selection policies to discourage excess water usage, farmers simply stopped using these technologies when they fell into disrepair. Rather than abandoning projects like this, donors and the government should lean into the lessons learned and continue to support the maintenance of the projects while gradually increasing prices, incentivizing less water-intensive crops, and regulating water usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-more-resilient-path-forward&quot;&gt;A More Resilient Path Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMUNICATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance water security, the monarchy itself needs to take on a more proactive role in negotiating with powerful stakeholders to limit their water usage, minimize pollution of existing supplies, and increase water efficiency across the agricultural and municipal sectors. For many within Jordanian society and politics, the king has the final word. That means that he must empower civil servants to carry out policies and serve as a mediator when there is discontent. When powerful constituents protest, the king needs to support civil servants with their efforts to rein in overconsumption. To assuage discontent among powerful stakeholders, the king and high-ranking government officials can explain the threat of water insecurity to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time-tested tradition during moments of protest and popular discontent has been for the king himself to visit powerful stakeholders, such as tribal leaders, and listen to their grievances. Direct meetings and negotiations between high-level government officials and various stakeholders, such as farmers and political elites, can help minimize these actors’ resistance to large structural changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donors and the government could also distribute free water conservation equipment along with the promise to provide maintenance—in return for being able to enforce water and crop regulations. Paired with a major public relations and education campaign about the need to conserve water and the benefits of the technology provided, this could simultaneously shift public attitudes and provide the needed sticks and incentives to water users. An educational campaign on planting vegetable and fruit varieties that are less water intensive and more drought resistant, followed by the provision of free seeds to farmers, could increase the probability of compliance. Farmers also need financial and educational support to see them through the transition. Farmers stealing water or continuing to grow water-intensive crops should be subject to significant punishment to effectively change behavior. Some may say this is expensive, but many water experts have stated it would likely cost less than the numerous failed projects already undertaken. It is also increasingly existential for Jordan to prioritize such spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gradual approach would include a prolonged national education and public relations campaign equating water security with national security and socio-economic justice. Greater transparency and information-sharing will be key, but given the deep mistrust of the government by the public, those water governing institutions cannot do it alone. They will need to enlist civil society, religious institutions, private sector actors, and trusted community members to lead the way. What they have going for them is that every Jordanian knows the country is water scarce. But providing specific information on how individuals can improve water security is essential—as is ensuring that everyone is held to the same standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dissemination of information to the public through various means (e.g., TV, radio, social media, religious institutions, and schools) could lay the groundwork for the harder policies ahead, such as increases in water tariffs and decreases in import tariffs on water-intensive goods. In 2023, Jordan used this strategy to spread awareness about upcoming municipal water subsidy cuts for all households consuming above a fixed quantity. After a prolonged information campaign and transparent public discussions on the price increases, the government implemented a policy in January 2024 to gradually increase water prices and to shift from quarterly to monthly payments to minimize the impact on water bills. To increase transparency and prepare society for new water utility bills, the government even released a water bill calculator on their website to allow people to anticipate their bills. There was still some domestic discontent with the new policy, but the gradual and transparent approach proved effective at minimizing the mass protests that typically accompany many of Jordan’s domestic policy changes. As such, policymakers should think about applying a similar strategy to the agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With backing from the king, government representatives can carry out a public campaign to educate society about the nation’s water crisis and the need to conserve water for current and future generations. Such a campaign would influence the population to make native plants and water conservation more of a priority. This approach could gradually reduce pressure on the government—an actor often seen as merely taking away benefits—and recast it as a leader in the fight to secure the nation for future generations. Such public campaigns would then make it easier to regulate the water consumption of wealthier segments of Jordan’s population, who are often less efficient. For all of these reforms, a gradual approach with continuous follow-through to fine-tune existing projects would allow the government and donors to chip away at Jordan’s water woes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPANDING WATER TREATMENT AND REUSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan will also need to expand its reuse of treated graywater and wastewater. Currently, farmers can switch to a mixture of graywater (water used in household cleaning, baths, and washing machines), treated wastewater, and surface water from the King Abdullah Dam and Zarqa River for many crops. Households have the option to use graywater in their gardens. The government, in turn, can be more transparent about the quality of water in the reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also remains plenty of room for improvement in expanding wastewater treatment facilities in rural areas. In 2023, the country had 33 wastewater treatment plants that produced 186 mcm per year of treated effluent. About 90 percent of treated wastewater is reused in either the agricultural or industrial sectors, which represents a huge improvement. But some 30 percent of the urban population and 80 percent of the rural population are still unconnected to the wastewater network. Expanding access in these remaining areas could be a major boost for the conservation and preservation of domestic fresh water supplies. Promoting the reuse of graywater would also have significant benefits. In rural areas that lack wastewater treatment plants, the government encourages households to voluntarily recycle graywater for irrigation and toilet flushing purposes. As a result, it is estimated that 54 mcm per year of graywater is reused in Jordan. Such programs can be expanded to the rest of the country with little political blowback, if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsidizing high-quality water conservation technologies—like drip irrigation—and less water-intensive crops in the near term will vastly improve water savings. It may also minimize political consequences for governmental crackdowns on excessive usage or theft. Convincing the remaining elite farmers who grow water-intensive citrus, or other crops for regional markets, to partially use treated wastewater will also be important. Currently, these farmers fear that treated wastewater will harm their fruit trees and curb their export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on improving the quality of treated wastewater, testing the water as it travels through various points, and sharing test results with farmers, the government can help to overcome some of these perceptions. Even test crops could be used to show the benefits of using certain kinds of treated water or water-conserving equipment, such as drip irrigation and weather- and soil-monitoring systems. The co-founder of iPlant, a Jordan-based startup in the field of agricultural technology, has even said that treated graywater is more beneficial to plants grown in vertical farms than tap water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government and donors should also support studies assessing whether treated wastewater or graywater can stabilize aquifers. Underground aquifers are naturally resistant to increased evaporation as the climate changes, but if they collapse, that naturally sustainable water storage mechanism disappears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPANDING RELIABLE WATER SUPPLIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while it is important for Jordan to improve its domestic management of water, doing so will still be insufficient to meet the country’s domestic water needs. Closing the gap on all non-revenue water (estimated at around 100 mcm per year) would still leave a deficit of over 50 mcm per year today. This deficit is only going to increase due to factors like climate change, population growth, increased upstream consumption of shared water resources, and overextraction of aquifer water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s domestic water demand is expected to rise from 1,128 mcm per year in 2022 to 2,000 mcm per year in 2040. If Jordan is able to curb both water theft and overconsumption, the country can save an estimated 100–150 mcm per year, which is still not enough to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, something must also be done to increase supply for the future. Given the vulnerability of multilateral efforts to regional and domestic politics, the construction of joint infrastructure or the purchasing of additional water from Israel may not help Jordan secure a reliable source of water in the current political environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, Jordan should follow the experience of Israel and the Persian Gulf states by building its own desalination capacity within its territory. To secure a sustainable supply of water, Jordan is proceeding with the National Water Conveyance. Even with the operation of the National Water Conveyance and other new multilateral projects, Jordan is unlikely to meet even its domestic water needs in the near term. In fact, with the operation of these new projects, Jordan is expected to face a 15 mcm per year deficit in its water needs by 2035. In light of growing frustration within Jordan toward Israel and the challenges of negotiating a multilateral project, international donors should support the NWC. After securing the desalination plant and improving its domestic water management, Jordan could then opt to join multilateral projects as a means for promoting peace in the turbulent region and helping to build the country’s resilience to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the NWC, Jordan must secure a financially acceptable deal. At the time of writing, the bid for the NWC was more than 50 percent over initial cost estimates and interest rates on the project were oppressively high. Financial acuity will be needed to ensure that the project does not bankrupt the country, causing a financial crisis even before the country reaches a water crisis. In addition to the high cost estimates, the deal requires more synergy with the National Electric Power Company. Electricity for the project would come to over 12 percent of Jordan’s total electricity use and increase the water sector’s electricity usage by 150 percent. Failing to better integrate the electricity and water sectors for this project could threaten the reliability of the grid. These issues are manageable but may require a reconsideration of the logistics of the project to ensure that Jordan does not dig itself out of water insecurity, only to be hit with other crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neoliberal economic theory advises the use of pricing mechanisms to encourage a resource’s efficient and sustainable use. However, cheap water is intimately connected to the political bargain that the Jordanian monarchy made with its citizens during the state-building process. In return for citizens’ loyalty, the government keeps resources like water cheap and public sector jobs available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic reforms that would improve the water deficit are, therefore, potentially threatening to Jordan’s stability. Jordan’s international benefactors, such as the United States and major European donor governments, know this well. So, while donors encourage the government to reduce water waste, they also have tended to prioritize political stability over environmental and financial sustainability, fearing the social and political impact of price increases or water shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, to avoid upsetting this delicate balance, international donors have worked with Jordan to increase its water supply. While Jordan’s government pushed to construct hydrological infrastructure—either multilateral, bilateral, or domestic—to augment supplies, it delayed domestic reforms. These delays entrenched the sociopolitical obstacles to water security through improved efficiency. The disappointing results of multilateral and transboundary water efforts have further pushed Jordan toward a precipice. But there are steps that can be taken that will begin to chip away at the challenge and put the country on more resilient ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan cannot alter its natural aridity and downstream location. Increasing its dependence on its riparian neighbors for additional water leaves it highly vulnerable. To address its existential water crisis, Jordan should focus on solutions within its control: reducing domestic demand for water and augmenting domestic supplies. The king and donor governments have the most power to shift Jordan’s grim trend toward deepening water insecurity; they can achieve this by following policies that offer a staggered series of carrots and sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ccess to basic public goods, such as electricity and clean water, is an integral part of state stability and regime legitimacy. The combination of climate change, refugee influxes, and mismanagement is threatening Jordan’s ability to provide its population with a basic essential resource that is not only integral to regime stability but also to human security. By 2100, if Jordan does not undertake critical measures, over 90 percent of its low-income population will experience critical water insecurity. The poor in Jordan already struggle for clean water. Any further decrease in water availability and quality can raise the potential for instability in a relatively stable country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thousands of Jordanians protesting for days straight in 2024, calling on the government to cancel its agreements with Israel, and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria highlight the vulnerability inherent to dependence on Jordan’s unstable neighborhood for something as essential as water. To avert a crisis, Jordanians, their government, and their government’s allies must cooperate to expand supply and reduce demand for water within the borders of the country. And, as the region stabilizes, work on multilateral efforts to augment water supplies and build regional peace can resume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is no stranger to water scarcity and violence. For centuries, conflict has exacerbated water insecurity and vice versa. But the region is now at a tipping point. Groundwater aquifers are running dry or becoming contaminated, populations are exploding, and borders are more hardened than ever, making resettlement—a time-tested survival strategy—impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere are these issues more evident than in the Palestinian territories. In initial plans for this volume, these areas were meant to be among the case studies. But the events of 2023 and 2024 swept away any notion that CSIS could conduct a timely, forward-looking study of what was possible there. Even before the most recent conflict, conditions in the West Bank and Gaza exemplified the danger of applying an apolitical lens to a political problem. As is the case across much of the region, water security fell prey to the lack of political progress on resolving underlying conflicts. Without that political progress, donor governments and aid agencies have resorted to applying technical fixes to political problems. But in the Palestinian territories, as in much of the world, water insecurity has been a sign of deeper dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Israel has restricted West Bank Palestinians’ freedom to cultivate land, rehabilitate infrastructure, or build wells and desalination plants, while simultaneously being very permissive of Israeli Jewish citizens—including settlers’—requests to do the same. As a result, around 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas of the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In Gaza, even before the current hostilities, it was difficult for Palestinians and donors to build adequate desalination facilities to treat enough contaminated and brackish groundwater to rescue the endangered Coastal Aquifer, upon which the 2.3 million people living in Gaza depend for water. For political and security reasons, Israel has also wanted to develop Palestinians’ reliance on Israeli supplies of water and energy, which the Israeli government has sometimes interrupted. The recent conflict has laid bare this asymmetry. At the start of the conflict, the Israeli government immediately cut almost all of Gaza’s access to water, energy, and food. As the conflict in Gaza has raged for months, clean water has become scarce, and polio has reemerged after 25 years, when untreated sewage flowed into the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ciarán Ó Cuinn noted in the foreword to this volume, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a particularly egregious example of what happens when donors, mediators, and communities are unable to resolve political challenges to water security. Political issues constrain both sustainability and equity in all case studies evaluated in this volume, as well as all over the world. Governments decide how and where to spend money, and vested interests (e.g., polluting industries, warlords, and farmers) can play an outsized role as well. Even in the United States, local tax revenues—and the associated political and financial power—often dictate where infrastructure will be rehabilitated or built. Flint, Michigan, is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flint, a predominantly Black and poor community, will forever be synonymous in the United States with its water crisis. Local authorities dismissed concerns of high lead levels in the water in order to cut costs. But much like the Middle East, water insecurity was present both before and after Flint’s lead-laden water became headline news. Flint’s woes stemmed from historic marginalization, not local authorities’ inability to provide safe water for residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these difficulties in the world’s richest and most powerful democracy, it may seem quixotic to prioritize water security within the existing disorder of the Middle East. But despite the challenges, these case studies show that water can no longer be put on hold. Countries have been living beyond their means to avoid war and instability. But equating the absence of a direct water war with cooperation or peace has been dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local conflicts and human insecurity have increased, even as countries have not gone to war over water. For weaker parties, war has not been an option. Rather than immediately resort to violence, those most affected by water insecurity—the poor, the marginalized, and weaker states—have simply tried to cope. They have used less water as governments have begun withholding or rationing water for certain communities. As water and sanitation services have deteriorated, people have resorted to buying expensive bottled water and relying on water trucking if they can afford to. Those who cannot afford bottled water have gotten sick. Farmers lucky enough to be able to drill deeper for water have done so. Those that cannot have moved, when possible. They have sold their possessions, married off their daughters earlier than planned, and sent their sons and husbands to work in cities, where they have often been seen by urban populations as an added burden on already limited services. Weaker downstream riparians have tried to cope rather than fight, but regional tensions and violence have increased as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these coping mechanisms are reaching a breaking point throughout the Middle East, with some communities forced to accept emergency rations of water and falling victim to previously eradicated waterborne diseases like cholera and polio. A third of the countries in the Middle East are embroiled in active conflicts, and many others are hosting refugees or are affected in some way by neighboring conflicts. Not only is there no end in sight to these crises, but they seem to be getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unemployment rates remain high; water is running out; the energy transition is coming, as are other great powers and regional powers, who will have their own agendas. In Jordan, youth unemployment reached as high as 50 percent in 2020. More and more Jordanians are finding illegal pathways out of the country. At the same time, every country in the Middle East and North Africa will experience extreme water stress by 2050, meaning that all will be using at least 80 percent of their available water supplies. If oil prices fall, producers like Iraq will be far less able to absorb the unemployed into the public sector or provide basic services. At the same time, global competition will allow countries to play great powers off one another, lessening the pressure from any one donor government to reform governance. Dealing with the seismic social and economic shifts of the next decade will require thoughtful planning, but the region is currently mired in crisis management, with international interest diminishing and aid budgets plummeting. And even with generous aid, problems like conflict, financial troubles, and water insecurity persist. Across the region—especially in Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, and Palestine—the United States and other international donors have spent tens of billions of dollars on water security. It is time to reconsider how these funds are spent, not cut them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve better outcomes, the politics that have brought the region to this inflection point cannot be ignored. For decades, Western governments, as donors and political stakeholders in the Middle East, have prioritized short-term stability over long-term sustainability and human security. Across the region, governments have feared systemic reforms would tip a delicate political balance out of their favor. Western governments have shared their concern. As a result, many reforms and regulations have either never been implemented or were weakened. Due to the political challenges of reform, governments and donors have focused on building dams, exploiting groundwater, and building desalination plants. Few of the countries covered in this volume have adequately pursued wastewater treatment and reuse, targeted water theft and leakage, enforced more moderate water usage, or negotiated fair and sustainable water-sharing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors in this volume do not shy away from the political challenges to water security. Rather, they acknowledge the many hurdles and the motivations of various stakeholders, thereby outlining feasible steps toward more sustainable and equitable water management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria and Yemen are perhaps the most challenging cases. Embroiled in conflict for years, both societies struggle to invest in long-term solutions to their increasingly existential water insecurities. Donor governments and private investors are reluctant to support possible solutions, and sometimes are even legally constrained from doing so. Nonetheless, authors Mauvais and Al-Saidi both argue that there are small steps that the international community can and must take to set both areas on a more sustainable path. Building local capacity and monitoring capabilities would allow communities to measure the extent of their water problems and advocate for solutions with authorities and donors. Connecting local experts and civil society to the wider world could also make local authorities and vested interests more accountable and build awareness of concrete solutions. In the cases of Sana’a and northeastern Syria, these solutions include diversifying and incentivizing drought-resistant crops and ensuring that water is part of peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, international actors can also play a diplomatic role. In northeastern Syria, they can encourage Turkey to release more water and cease the destruction of vital infrastructure. In Yemen, they can encourage warring parties and diplomats to incorporate water management into negotiations, including incentives for rehabilitating and building water-related infrastructure and concessions on access, human rights, and security. Both authors argue that such steps will be vital for national and global security as these areas grow unable to absorb the unemployed or provide food and water for their people. Destabilizing internal and outward migration will be inevitable without these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Basra, the obstacles to reforming the agricultural sector are so wide-ranging that the authors have focused on one aspect of water insecurity that is reasonably surmountable: the provision of safe drinking water and preparation for further urbanization. Those steps will not solve all of Basra’s problems, but they are necessary and feasible in the current environment. However, the authors also outline reasonable steps that may encourage greater cooperation in agricultural and transboundary management—the greatest potential sources of water security in the country. Recommendations include linking water to other areas of concern for transboundary neighbors, like trade and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Jordan, author Zawahri argues that the government should work with civil society and local leaders to frame stewardship of water resources as a patriotic and social justice issue. Part of this effort will be enacting reforms in a transparent and universally accountable way, while providing ample investments and sufficient time to ease the transition. At the regional level, Zawahri acknowledges the need for water-stressed Jordan to develop its own water resources to overcome the long-standing political challenges to transboundary, multilateral water deals. Indeed, the data shows that Jordan will need to pursue multilateral efforts, domestic desalination capacity, and greater domestic water-use efficiency just to meet the needs of its growing population by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these more limited politically feasible steps to achieving water security, conflict, broadly defined, may be necessary. Contestation—defined as the divergence of goals, objectives, expectations, methods, and behavior—does not have to amount to violence or coercive cooperation. It is the way such conflicts are approached that will define the future of water security in the region and the potential for violence. Avoiding the political realities of extreme water insecurity is leading to more crises, which could cause further instability in the future. Eminent scientists and academics briefing the UN General Assembly have already noted that disputes over shared water resources will rise due to changes brought on by climate change and growing human demands for water. In all of these areas, employment in security services or armed groups is fast becoming one of the most important and last remaining livelihoods opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the bleak predictions, this volume contends that while disagreements are inherent to the quest for equitable and sustainable water management, violence is not inevitable—provided stakeholders, including regional governments, non-state governing actors, and donor governments, take decisive action. In some cases, that action will require more financial investment. More often than not, however, it will require different strategies. The current investments of time and resources should be shifted toward endeavors in which donors, governments, and lenders consider stakeholders’ incentives and follow the projects through, ensuring that some stakeholders do not become spoilers. For example, donors and governments should work toward building civic consensus around the need for wastewater treatment plants, emphasizing the upsides and debunking negative assumptions. Governments should not simply cut farmers off from using water or cultivating all of their land; they should assist farmers in transitioning to less water-intensive crops and farming methods. At the transboundary level, more diplomatic investment is needed to open paths for solutions that are not politically feasible today. In other words, donor governments with influence over upstream countries should encourage them to prioritize equitable water sharing. Downstream countries should manage domestic water sources more carefully, but they should also strengthen their diplomatic, economic, and security cooperation with neighbors to ensure that they are diversifying their leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice is stark. Either change course or face far greater challenges in the future. The Arab Spring and the subsequent conflicts have shown that the status quo is untenable. Those movements shook the region. As the aftershocks have continued, mistrust has increased between communities and countries, all while investment interest has decreased—yet both trust and investment will be crucial to achieving water security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, time is of the essence. Rather than sidestepping the political challenges, this volume has aimed to provide concrete steps to incentivize change among actors currently benefiting from an unsustainable status quo. To do so, countries must enlist reform-minded government officials, donors and international stakeholders, warring parties, civil society, farmers, and aid agencies. Each player must play a part in leveling the field. If they do not, inequity will widen, a growing swath of territory will become unlivable, and conflict—violent conflict—will break out and spill across borders. By implementing the solutions outlined here, countries can avert a looming crisis and pave the way for a more stable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With near-peer threats and stiff economic challenges, 2025’s Strategic Defence Review has hard balance to find if it is going to provide a credible Land force, but such a balance has been struck before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army needs depth to be sustainable in war: both a second echelon to follow close behind the first, and structures to generate a third and subsequent ones. The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and the Treasury, despite the recent increased announcement in spending, are unlikely to both fund more regular troops for a second echelon and maintain the equipment programme and extra munitions required for modernisation. Army Reserve units and formations can provide the cost-effective additional mass to expand the army in war and deliver that second echelon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Reserve can provide individual reinforcements but cannot grow the army with additional units. The current Future Soldier warfighting structure inhibits the ability of the Army Reserve to expand the British Army in war. This commentary looks to the last time a Defence Review had to balance “NATO First” with modernising the army in fiscally challenging times, set against a peer-level threat in Europe. It illustrates how the British Army embraced their reserve forces to reorganise and modernise into an army that was sustainable, affordable and played a key role in successfully delivering deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-demand-for-mass&quot;&gt;The Current Demand for “Mass”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been much mention of “mass” and the British Army, aligned to the SDR’s considerations. To be credible for high intensity warfighting experience from Ukraine suggests that the British Army will require access to more mass. Mass in these reports usually implies access to more numbers of people, more equipment and more munitions. However, the continuing financial pressures on UK Defence will likely prevent any significant increase to the numerical mass of full-time forces if it is to also provide the better firepower, enablement, readiness and resilience required. As a result, there has been more of an emphasis on the current force structure’s ability to successfully mass the effect of combat power through enhanced lethality delivered by modernisation, improved command and control, robotics and faster exploitation of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These enhancements are indeed important to win the first battle, especially for the UK’s medium sized army, but wars are rarely won by the first battle and peer-level opponents will return for a second round. It is important for an Army to retain enough people, equipment and munitions to deal with a wartime level of attrition and to continue to provide the range of capabilities to ensure it can at least take part in the second battle, and beyond. The Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Tony Radakin is correct that war in Europe is a remote chance but NATO’s land force sustainability is also important for keeping the odds low through deterrence. What balance of investments will deliver the optimum and sustainable British Army for its near-term readiness for warfighting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simple force development terms sustainable depth is attained through the provision of additional capability, such as follow-on echelons. The structural basis of capability in the British Army, as in most other armies, is the unit and the formation. Most nations cannot afford to have standing armies made up of the required number of trained and equipped units ready to fight large wars. Peacetime armies are limited in size by national budgets and as Andrew Sharpe points out must be ready to expand rapidly to cope with the heavier demands of war. Threats and tasks increase greatly in war, formations suffer attrition, units need to be replaced, areas of operation grow larger. The medium-sized British Army must be ready at the outset to have a structure, a second echelon, which can generate more formations and more units for war, or it risks becoming very small, very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army has traditionally relied on part-time Army Reserve units, who train collectively in peacetime, to generate the second echelon additional units for the expansion of the British Army in war. As has been pointed out many times before this remains the most cost effective and most successful way to expand the British Army for war. Additional units cannot simply be conjured up at the start of a war from pools of individual reinforcements, let alone untrained wartime volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessity for a funded, equipped and trained Army Reserve in peacetime has been a key lesson from Ukraine and from our own history. The peacetime formed reserve units of the Ukrainian Army were vastly more effective than those units pulled together from scratch with little cohesion and very poor combat effectiveness. While Army Reserve units are not equivalent in capability to Regular units, history, and our allies performance, show they can provide a “good enough” contingent capability within a few weeks from mobilisation, for the focussed wartime missions they should be allocated. This provides mass and sustainability, to allow time for subsequent echelons to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peacetime armies also need many individual reinforcements on wartime mobilisation. They are needed to fill inevitable peacetime gaps in both regular and reserve units and to bring all units up to a wartime strength, not needed in peace, to ensure units can cope with the rigours of war. Individual reinforcements are also needed to provide formations with a battle casualty replacement pool. The British Army has traditionally called back ex-Regulars (the Regular Reserve and those with liability for recall, now termed the Strategic Reserve) to provide most of these individual reinforcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual reinforcements by themselves do not expand the Army, since they do not provide additional units, but are vital for making units and formations more resilient. Under current legislation you cannot “grow” the Strategic Reserve. They are fixed by virtue of being ex-regular so as a regular force shrinks so will the Strategic Reserve since their numbers are determined by regular leavers. Historically the Army have also developed plans to scour their peacetime-only structures to deliver more regulars in war for the deployable forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple-to-understand system, where the Army Reserve expanded the British Army in war with additional units on mobilisation and where the Regular Reserves were called back to provide resilience through individual gap filling, lasted for over 100 years. It was far from perfect, had its bumps, but was reasonably affordable in times of financial difficulty and was relatively successful when it came to fighting actual large-scale war and deterring a cold one. Unfortunately, this system has been slowly abandoned by the British Army over the last 30 years and the British Army will struggle to expand and deliver the mass it seems to have on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-un-expandable-future-soldier-british-army&quot;&gt;The Un-Expandable “Future Soldier” British Army&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been acknowledged that some part of the “Future Soldier” programme have not been ideal for the British Army. This is especially true for the Army Reserve. The Chief of Staff of Field Army wrote in 2023 that “Without the Army Reserve, any notion of maintaining the Army’s combat endurance beyond the first ‘thunderclap’ is fanciful”. Yet, the bulk of the fighting power of the Army Reserve is structurally tied up with that first “thunderclap”. Under Future Soldier, on mobilisation for war, the majority of Army Reserve units will provide up to 70% of the Army Reserve unit workforce to backfill the gaps in Regular Army units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Future Soldier backfill demand on the Army Reserve effectively removes the capacity of the British Army to rapidly expand on mobilisation and fundamentally undercuts the role of the Army Reserve to provide additional units for wartime. It also risks undermining the first echelon readiness, as Army Reserve personnel are at lower levels of readiness, and many could not deploy immediately with their combat formations without some additional training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional second echelon of the British Army, with up to 70 Army Reserve units on paper, is currently planned to be spent against the first echelon. The British Army has no depth. Meanwhile, the pool of individual Regular Reservists that traditionally provided a backfill function have been allowed to assume they will never be needed and despite repeated attempts, going back decades now, they have not yet been brought out of abeyance. I have previously written on why this has been culturally difficult for the British Army to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future Soldier, building on the slow withering of Army Reserve unit training since the end of the Cold War, has created a British Army for war that is primarily based on its full-time Regular Army structure in peace. The privileging of the units of the first echelon to the detriment of second echelon Army Reserve unit capability is explainable given financial pressures, is culturally understandable, has been influenced by political aversion to honest discussions about the Army, and has happened before. It makes the British Army in war a potentially “first battle” winning organisation, if the logistic problems of deploying can be overcome, but at the risk of being small and fragile for actual war winning. It has stripped out the capacity of the army to expand rapidly and to be more sustainable in war. Future Soldier has created the best possible single echelon force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any first rate second echelon will be a very long time arriving under Future Soldier. Yet the British Army has enough Army Reserve units now to create a second echelon; it has chosen to disinvest in their collective capability. The current Future Soldier structure also makes the British Army relatively more expensive for the units and resultant capability it can deliver in war in comparison to our NATO allies armies. Our NATO allies, including those who are also expeditionary, such as the Americans, still rely on cost effective expansion from reserve units and those like the French are investing heavily in building more reserve units. The fundamental withering of British Army Reserve capability has happened at a period when UK Defence is under pressure to deliver more wartime Land Forces for NATO and now also for UK Home Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there is now growing recognition that in order to sustain itself in a large-scale war the British Army’s “Reserve force will form our second echelon.” To do this it will need to use units from the Army Reserve and call upon individual reinforcements from its Regular Reserves. The SDR call for evidence indicated that Reserve capability is going to be an important factor in their thinking. They appear to have a desire to make more of the Army Reserve and the Regular Reserves. Without additional money this will involve tough choices and indications are that the Treasury will be hard pressed to provide much more for defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Army, various Defence Reviews have been in this space before – with regard to the poor and misunderstood state of reserves – and perhaps lessons can be drawn. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and resultant Future Reserves 2020 programme show parallels, but were focused on developing operational reserve forces for lower intensity warfare. The review with some striking similarity to today’s British Army is perhaps the radical 1981 UK Defence Review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-1981-defence-review---nato-first-high-threat-but-little-extra-money&quot;&gt;The 1981 Defence Review - NATO First, High Threat but Little Extra Money&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early 1980’s saw a heightened peer-level threat from Eastern Europe leading to demands to improve the UK Land contribution to NATO. There was also an increased threat to the UK Homeland. This was set against severe financial constraints on growing UK Defence spending, but with Conservative party election pledges to increase the offer to Defence and make up for a decade of retrenchment and shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On attaining power in 1979, a generous pay offer from the new government had been given to Defence to try to improve retention in 1980 while still having to deal with severe in-year pressures to reduce costs and cancel expenditure from an over extended budget. A Defence review was called for to match ambition to the resources available. The review was to be focussed on a “NATO First” strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like today, the British Army was not in the best state. Some claimed the Army had the most outdated equipment in NATO. The Army had begun a process of modernisation of its key equipment, but with poor morale personnel recruitment was poor and outflow high. A previous review saw the warfighting corps adopt a structure that was not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army also needed to become more sustainable for a more flexible NATO warfighting response. This would require increased stocks and increased mass. The British Army of 1981 did not have enough units on mobilisation to cover the requirements of a deployed and sustainable Corps for war in Europe. As the CGS of the time later remarked “There was not too bad a front line, but there was literally nothing to sustain it.” The Army needed more units in war, but an expansion of the regular forces was unlikely given the costs involved and that any extra funds would be needed for modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 Defence Review team made it clear they wished to prioritise commitments to Trident, NATO Land Forces and Home Defence. While there was actually an overall increase in the defence budget, the proportion for each of the services changed, reflecting a deliberate focus on the NATO alliance for UK security and the resulting political imperative to reinforce SACEUR’s needs. The Royal Navy aspect of the review has been covered in much detail over the years and the measures in light of the 1982 Falkland’s conflict, were effectively shelved a year later. The RAF budget was increased with their politically aligned focus on improving the Air Defence of the UK. The Army did uncharacteristically well and saw their overall budget estimates grow with some increased investment to continue to modernise the Army’s equipment and improve levels of stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deliver a more sustainable Army it had accepted the more radical change in the 1981 Defence Review that is often overlooked. The review was “determined to make more use of reserve forces” as an affordable way of delivering more capability for its NATO First policy. Improvements to Reserve Forces had been identified by the review team from early in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet NATO demands for more sustainable forces and in order to preserve funds for their modernisation programme the Army invested in its reserve forces. The Territorial Army in 1980 (the TA, whose name changed to the Army Reserve in 2014) was suffering somewhat from a recruitment and retention crisis and the Regular Reserve was known to be needed but somewhat languishing. They would need some investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in additional reserve capacitywas controversial at the time in some quarters but it was seen to offer the best route to the political imperative of NATO First and delivering affordable sustainability. The 1981 Defence Review therefore saw a planned increase in the TA of 25% over ten years. This would grow it in personnel numbers from 45% of the size of the Regular Army to nearly 60% and so bring it more in line with NATO allies. Additional investment was also confirmed for the Regular Reserves with the introduction of the 1981 Individual Reinforcement Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To balance the books the Army reduced its full-time operating costs. It did this primarily through re-organisation and reducing associated personnel costs. The army had, as now, the largest proportion of its budget allocated to personnel costs across the single services, primarily to its full-time personnel and families. The Army cut its high-level administrative HQ in British Army of the Rhine by 20% and removed one of the four divisional HQs in the 1st British Corps assigned to NATO. They absorbed the workforce from the disbanded division, and this allowed for three fully resourced and more powerful divisions of three brigades rather than the four, weak and under-staffed, divisions. This improved the readiness of first echelon by removing the immediate need for reserve reinforcements to backfill across the four divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ta-second-echelon--sustainable-mass-for-expansion&quot;&gt;The TA Second Echelon – Sustainable Mass for Expansion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a very clear doctrine for the use of the TA in war that helped to achieve its growth over the decade. The TA would provide the additional reinforcement of units and formations needed to expand the Army in war. The TA provided the bulk of a complete second echelon Division for rear area security and mobility plus additional Corps Troops and Lines of Communication support. TA units would be given enough equipment to allow unit training with an increase in training days to 44 to ensure they could train to a reasonable level of collective capability and there were plans in place to receive an additional wartime increment of equipment on mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TA expansion was greatly helped by the Army accepting most of the 1979 Shapland Report recommendations to improve TA recruitment and retention by assigning specific wartime missions, better training, more modern equipment and some improved benefits. Between 1980 and 1990 the trained strength of the TA increased by 15% and since UK Reserve Forces recruitment is based on local patches there were funded improvements to existing TA accommodation. The modest investment transformed the TA over the decade. The system was certainly far from perfect, as some have argued, and the short timelines to reinforce Germany were extremely optimistic, but the strategic depth potential, at least, from the Army’s Reserves did contribute to deterrence and pacified NATO demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-regular-reserves--affordable-reinforcement&quot;&gt;The Regular Reserves – Affordable Reinforcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 Defence Review endorsed the Army’s Individual Reinforcement Plan to deliver more assured Regular Reserves. Their primary role was to provide individual reinforcements in wartime as Regular and TA units were rarely at 100% of their peacetime liability and each unit also had to receive a top up to their Warfighting Establishment. The Regular Reserves also provided the Battle Casualty Replacement (BCR) pools for the Army in this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They retained a basic uniform scaling with their mobilisation instructions for reporting in war and were required to attend an annual briefing at a local TA Centre. With a bonus payment for attendance, 92% attended annual briefings by 1983. There was an optional one-week training refresher for those who left regular service three years previously and many could volunteer to join major exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delivering-deterrence-by-planning-for-mobilisation&quot;&gt;Delivering Deterrence by Planning for Mobilisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 improvements to the army’s reserves also succeeded because the British Army was oriented to planning for NATO warfighting. Transition to war would potentially impose so many concurrent demands on the army that an ad hoc approach to force generation would impose delay and risk. This would subvert the future sustainment of any deployed forces, especially mobilisation of the second echelon TA. This risk was well recognised in the Cold War and there was a deliberate force-generation plan pre-written, and exercised, to mobilise the entirety of the TA and Regular Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this plan foresaw a short war it did include detail on how the UK could put in place structures to regenerate and reconstitute for a longer attritional conflict. To be clear, this was not a plan for how to fight a war but how to deliver an army ready and expanded for war. The 1981 Defence Review recognised the importance of having such a plan for deterrence – crucially this included exercising the mobilisation of the Reserve components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the demise of the Cold War the British Army has had little need for a plan to expand and fight against a peer-level adversary. The army has been able to respond to recent operational demands with a bespoke force-generation process often drawing together varied units and personnel from across the army and mobilising small groups or individual personnel from among the reservists. There was no requirement to mobilise and expand the army with additional units. Challenging this “just in time” Lego bricks model that has lasted for over 30 years across expeditionary armies like the British Army and developing a plan for mobilisation that naturally includes reserves will be difficult for the army. Our allies have been quicker to realise this necessity but the 1980’s demonstrates we have done this before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1981 Defence Review is chiefly remembered for the negative impact on the Royal Navy, but it was also radical for the focus on improving reserve forces for NATO warfighting. The Army made a rare comparative success of the review by embracing and investing in the reserve forces to deliver affordable sustainability for the mass required, while preserving vital funds for modernisation. Then, as now, it was not affordable to expand the number of Regular units to meet the NATO First demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment in training and equipping TA units and formations provided a “good enough” second wartime echelon for NATO. Regular Reservist reinforcements were made an offer to attend refresher training and allocated war roles. This effort was underpinned by thorough mobilisation planning and steady funding. It worked. The TA grew in numbers and capability with its expanded role through the decade helping to deliver a NATO Corps that was more capable than before 1980.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Army Reserve could be used to deliver unit capability to the army’s second echelon but to do so they will need to embed the new stable funding model and be trained, and equipped. A consequence of the 1981 decision to use the TA to provide the second echelon to the NATO Corps was the creation of a Long-Term Costing equipment and training programme to support it. To be effective, the Army’s need to modernise training has to include Army Reserve units for large-scale exercises and prioritised use of simulation. The Ukraine war has shown that affordable, older equipment is better than no equipment at all for Reserve Forces. The recent MOD response to changing its policy on disposals for this purpose is hardly encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Labour has outlined a similar NATO First focus to 1981. The Cold War of the 1980’s has long gone but parallels regarding military workforce balance and affordability remain today in an era of increased threat and fiscal difficulty. The increased funds for Defence today are welcome but will be limited. For the Army it is difficult to see how increasing lethality through modernisation while concurrently improving sustainability for warfighting will be achievable with the limited additional funding available. The Army Reserve can deliver the affordable sustainability needed for today’s NATO First focus and provide that vital peacetime trained-and-equipped second echelon mass available for war – but investment will be required. Tough choices indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上確認訊息紀錄等-黎結束52日作供&quot;&gt;庭上確認訊息紀錄等 黎結束52日作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英第52日作供。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行周一（3日）結束24天盤問。辯方代表大律師關文渭進入覆問第2天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3YvSd4A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 辯方代表大律師 關文渭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前供稱，每星期輪流與其中一個部門舉行「飯盒會」，由於一共有8個部門，因此每個部門相隔兩個月才有一次「飯盒會」。惟控方指從通訊軟件 Slack 紀錄中，各部門並非相隔兩個月便有一次「飯盒會」紀錄，部份更相隔數個月才有相關紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今向黎出示他與前秘書 Julie 的 WhatsApp 紀錄，顯示 Julie 通知黎「飯盒會」的日期和出席者，包括「飲食男女編輯部」和「美蘋」。黎確認相關紀錄，並稱這些這些部門與《蘋果》無關，而且與編輯部功能無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後表示，除非法官還有其他問題想問黎，否則「這就是黎先生漫長的證供（epic evidence）」。三名法官沒有其他問題，法官杜麗冰遂吩咐黎可以返回被告欄就坐。黎從證人台站起來，分別向律師席和法官席說：「謝謝」，之後帶同耳機和水杯，在懲教人員看管下返回被告欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師黃雅斌接著在庭上讀出由專家證人 Alan Jeffries 撰寫、有關 WhatsApp 轉發功能的專家報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭其後呈上另一份專家報告，有關如何從網上下載黎於2020年7月6日出席劉細良對談節目的影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方欲呈專家報告-包含明報報導等-冀證黎說法有基礎-官拒呈堂&quot;&gt;辯方欲呈專家報告 包含《明報》報導等 冀證黎說法有基礎 官拒呈堂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前控方證據提到，黎在2020年4月26日的專欄文章〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉中稱：「中共出擊撕掉《基本法》，摧殘香港一國兩制特別行政區地位。沒有釋法權利的港澳辦和中聯辦高調曲線釋法，稱兩辦並非《基本法》22條所指的一般意義上的『中央人民政府所屬各部門』，公然向港府奪權。」控方質疑黎的說法沒有事實基礎。此外，黎分別在專欄文章和網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，指稱《國安法》凌駕（supersedes）了《基本法》，使香港沒有自由和法治。控方在盤問時質疑說法不實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭打算呈上由專家證人 Alan Jeffries 撰寫的報告，有關如何下載《明報》新聞、中聯辦及港澳辦聲明，以及律政司司長對《基本法》作出詮釋的簡報文件。不過法官李運騰質疑，辯方不能以這份專家報告，來填補黎證供的空白之處（fill in the gap）。關否認目的是填補空白，強調只是從另一個角度去印證黎的說法。惟法官杜麗冰反駁指關的做法是「走後門（from the back door）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關解釋指，港澳辦和中聯辦曾發表聲明稱它們不屬於《基本法》第22條所稱一般意義上的「中央人民政府所屬各部門」。而黎供稱他閱讀過一些東西，但記不起，因此辯方希望呈遞當時的《明報》報導，並強調：「我不是在嘗試填補空白。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問關，是否想說黎的說法並非客觀上錯誤？關確認，重申：「我不是在嘗試填補黎先生記憶的空白。」惟李官指出，即使辯方呈交證據證明有人說過相關言論，也不代表那人的言論是正確。杜官又指，若果辯方在覆問階段中，黎曾說閱讀過相關新聞，便有理由呈交該則新聞；可是黎只說過閱讀過《蘋果》報導而非《明報》，質疑辯方嘗試填補空白，想證明黎閱讀過相關新聞。關則強調，其用意並非如此，因相關新聞報導在當時社會裡公開流傳，辯方亦不需要證明黎閱讀過相關報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，就算黎的確有留意到《明報》的報導，那對黎的案情有什麼幫助？杜官則表示，看不到辯方呈交《明報》報導與本案有何關聯性。法官李素蘭則表示，不認為報導可以呈堂。關文渭回應，黎撰寫了一篇文章，被指沒有事實基礎，但辯方呈上報導是為了證明黎有基礎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官最後表示，不認為相關證據有關聯性，因此不批准辯方呈堂。李素蘭並提醒辯方不要在結案陳詞中就相關證據作陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;案件押後至明日-待修改控辯雙方承認事實&quot;&gt;案件押後至明日 待修改控辯雙方承認事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一名辯方大律師李峯琦其後讀出報告內容，有關2019年的公眾集會和遊行資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻指，黎的案情即將完成，但控辯雙方承認事實仍有部份需要作出修改。接著便會是三間《蘋果》相關公司的案情，大律師黃國豪表示打算呈交一些文件作為證物，需時五分鐘。杜官遂將案件押後至明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

The use of artillery in Ukraine has echoes of the past, with revolutions in application following every Russian war of the 20th century.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time of Suvorov, artillery was one of the most esteemed and prestigious branches of the Russian military – a view that was largely forgotten by the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the Second World War, artillery was extensively employed to dismantle enemy defences and, in many cases, to obliterate entire cities. This preference for artillery warfare persisted after the Second World War, as evidenced in the Russian Invasion of Afghanistan and various post-Soviet conflicts including the fighting in Ukraine following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Despite this enduring characteristic, the importance of artillery in Russian military doctrine has often been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may not inspire awe in the same manner as bombing from the air, Russia’s extensive use of artillery has proven effective and remains difficult to counter. The significance of artillery in Russian warfare extends beyond its battlefield effectiveness. Through history and to the present moment, its deployment has carried direct political meaning, serving as a visible demonstration of Russia’s determination to achieve its objectives, regardless of the level of destruction or civilian casualties involved. The psychological impact of Russian artillery is not an unintended consequence but a deliberate feature of its warfighting strategy. This story starts in the less remembered eastern front of the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-world-war-i--the-baptism-of-artillery-firepower-in-1916&quot;&gt;Russian World War I – The Baptism of Artillery Firepower in 1916&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian use of artillery on a tactical and operational basis in the First World War mirrors the current evolution of artillery strategy in Ukraine: the emergent use of new reconnaissance technology, and artillery as a psychological weapon and obstacle-clearing tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brusilov Offensive (1916) was one of very few resounding Russian victories during the First World War, wherein, as historians often agree, the victory was achieved in part by spotter aircraft increasing the accuracy of artillery barrages on strategic objectives. The Tsarist Russian Empire was not an artillery powerhouse compared to other European powers such as France or Germany, primarily due to their lack of larger calibre artillery. However, the availability and efficacy of anti-aircraft artillery was limited, allowing spotter aircrafts to patrol the skies above enemy territory with comparative impunity. This has stark parallels with the modern-day usage of drones to improve the accuracy and targeting of artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the increased rate of communication, the impact of aerial reconnaissance does not reside solely at a strategic level, – concerning artillery’s capacity to have significant effect over a wide area – but at a squad level as well. The efficiency of targeting reached through aerial surveillance was part of the First World War revolution in military affairs allowing reliable and accurate delivery of indirect munitions from small unit-based mortars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;General Aleksei Brusilov created warning fatigue in the enemy by ordering barrages meaning enemy infantry forces were not able to anticipate Brusilov’s movement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of the Brusilov Offensive that proved effective for the Russian forces, and carries on to the modern day, was the use of artillery barrages days or weeks in advance of an offensive to create warning fatigue in the enemy. This hampered the capacity to attack only after a significant concentration of force. Longer artillery barrages across a frontline were a common indicator of an incoming attack by Russian forces General Aleksei Brusilov created warning fatigue in the enemy by ordering barrages meaning enemy infantry forces were not able to anticipate Brusilov’s movement due to the prolonged massive artillery attack that preceded. This allowed Russian forces to creep closer than anticipated to Austrian defensive positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson is apparent in the current use of artillery warfare with Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Considering the psychological impact of large-scale artillery barrages for soldiers in the trenches, the fact that Russia now owns a commanding lead in artillery shell production and manufacture of related parts is increasingly worrying for Ukrainian defences. A surplus of ammunition and available artillery pieces can allow modern-day Russia to feign offensives to draw a larger number of Ukrainian defenders to sectors that Russia does not plan to pursue offensively, thereby denying the usage of those troops in areas in which the numerically inferior Ukrainians need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia still exploits the artillery’s ability to clear traps and other obstacles to deny the enemy pre-planned kill-zones, as proved in the Brusilov Offensive. Barbed wire, mines, and other fortifications are often used by defending forces to control the avenues an attacking force can utilize for an operation, thereby allowing a defending force to establish kill-zones for the enemy. Kill-zones here are defined as the central piece of an ambush site with the following characteristics: convenient and likely to be traversable by the enemy; contains obstacles to slow advances; and has a large enough area that defenders can easily view the approaching enemy and benefit from an advantage in timing. As shown through the beginning stages of the Brusilov Offensive, artillery was used to destroy barbed wire and other such defences to allow the Russian forces to have a greater number of approach avenues.Grau and Bartle highlight the calculable reasoning achievable when opposed by artillery, as artillery barrages have known ranges, timing, areas of effect, and success probabilities given a certain level of fire exposure. This takes into consideration counterbattery fire, although in the modern era this proves less robust with loitering munition counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military experience in artillery warfare in the First World War laid the foundation for the use of artillery by Russian forces: the notable reliance on aerial reconnaissance for accurate indirect artillery barrages; effective use of artillery in psychological operations; and the utilization of artillery as an obstacle-clearing tool to allow for rapid offensive manoeuvres. The lessons of the First World War still apply to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;world-war-ii-1941-1945--red-army-way-to-artillery-or-god-of-war&quot;&gt;World War II-1941-1945 – Red Army Way to Artillery or “God of War”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia adjusted its artillery doctrine with the introduction of earlymulti-launch rocket systems (MLRS), and relied on direct fire of 76.2-millimeter batteries to provide accurate fire on enemy armoured vehicles and fortified positions. The new approach greatly increased the number of available artillery resources per kilometre of a frontline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the onset of Operation Barbarossa in 1941, the Soviets had successfully developed one of the world’s first MLRS systems, the BM-13, which provided a greater rate of fire and manoeuvrability than traditional towed artillery systems. A full salvo of rockets could be fired in 7-10 seconds and each salvo had up to 48 rockets, with the only downside being the lower sustained fire rate due to a slower reloading process. Hence, Soviet forces were able to deploy devastating levels of destruction upon an enemy in a short time and avoided counterbattery fire through the increased maneuverability of a truck-mounted launch system. BM-13 platforms were deployed in the battle of Stalingrad (1942). After the Second World War, the BM-13 was improved upon, eventually resulting in the BM-21, a highly configurable MLRS that is fielded by multiple nations across the world, including Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the rapid evolution of tanks in the inter-war period, Soviet doctrine adjusted to deploy large numbers of 76.2-millimeter guns and 57-millimeter anti-tank guns to support defending or advancing infantry. Unlike the regimental 122-millimeter howitzers, both variants would be placed in a direct-fire capacity where the crew operating each weapon would not need to rely on a forward observer to engage targets accurately. Laddering techniques, i.e., two guns alternating responsibility for firing on a target and advancing, would be used to ensure consistent fire upon enemy positions, thereby denying the enemy time to effectively engage advancing infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of laddering fire is fundamental to understanding the movement of Russian artillery during offensive operations. A potential cause of this shift away from direct-fire artillery implements is likely a result of the means of communication used by artillery spotters: from wired communication lines to radio-based. This development allowed for better coordination of fire between different units with a greater dispersion of information, and as more units were be able to receive communication from spotters it lowered the risk to valuable field guns by placing them out of view of the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final notable development of Soviet artillery doctrine in the Second World War was the disparity in guns and mortars per kilometre of frontline compared to pre-war estimates. Multiple Russian experts before the onset of the Second World War recommended between 75 and 100 guns per kilometre of front to break through a positional defence; however, in the later years of the Second World War, Soviet density of firepower on breakthrough fronts was between 150 and 200 guns per kilometre. The disparity between the expected and observed ratios shows the reliance of the Red Army on its industrial capability to overwhelm its enemies with devastating barrages of artillery fire. As Stalin is thought to have stated of the Red Army, “quantity has a quality all its own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Though the Red Army proved to be far more advanced and sophisticated in both quantity and quality than its direct predecessor, its achievements were based on a direct evolution, more than a revolution, in technology and doctrinal development&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Red Army’s Second World War experience in artillery warfare showed the spectrum of improvement expected from a more industrialized economy with a greater productive capacity and outcome – including sophisticated Soviet-designed weapon systems. However, as is clear from the Tsarist Imperial Russian armed forces, this does not necessarily follow from progress toward modern firepower and force concentration. Though the Red Army proved to be far more advanced and sophisticated in both quantity and quality than its direct predecessor, its achievements were based on a direct evolution, more than a revolution, in technology and doctrinal development. As a result of this consistent evolution, the effectiveness and broad use of artillery assumed a political importance, testified to by Stalin who is thought to have labelled artillery the “God of War”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;soviet-afghan-war-1979-1989--red-armys-artillery-warfare-in-a-limited-war&quot;&gt;Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) – Red Army’s Artillery Warfare in a “Limited” War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet evolution of artillery doctrine throughout the Soviet-Afghan war (1979-1989) consisted of a conjunction of overwhelming air and ground-based barrages. This was supported by an emphasis on smaller specially trained units to follow up a successful barrage. Underlying this was a tactic of resource denial on an unprecedented scale. The Soviet forces had to contend with a competent and well-supported insurgency in a non-conventional war, that erased the concept of a defined frontline and other concepts central to a typical nation-state conflict. It came to resemble later hybrid wars fought by post-Soviet Russia and Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Afghan warlords commonly concentrated most of their forces in positions observable from aerial reconnaissance the initial stages of the war proved successful for the existing Russian artillery doctrine. Afghan forces were left decimated by artillery and attacks from the air. However, the Afghan forces quickly adapted to rely on tactics that spread out their resources in underground structures resistant to aerial or artillery campaigns, whereby they could launch successful hit-and-run attacks on Soviet troops and armoured columns, proving costly for the Soviet Army and invalidating its air and artillery superiority. Afghan forces ambushed the enemy at ranges where Soviet artillery could not be utilized, and putting Soviet troops in danger of friendly fire during attacks that were over so quickly that air support could not respond in time. The Soviets responded by employing engineer battalions to level farmlands and other natural obstacles within 300 meters of roadways to ensure ground troops could spot and engage Afghan forces at a distance that would allow for the use of artillery and air power. While it is unlikely that efforts to level 300 meters to the left and right of every roadway were successful, the fact that it was attempted in the first place emphasizes the Soviet reliance on artillery and established road networks for strategic victory. To this day, close-range ambush tactics have proven effective against Russian forces, as shown in the ongoing Kursk offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet artillery and air dominance were invalidated by Afghan tactics, and the Soviets struggled to adapt to the battlefield. One notable exception to this trend was that of the first and second battles of Zhawar (September 1985 - April 1986), in which Soviet artillery, along with a complete encirclement of the underground position held by the mujahideen, was able to break the will of the Afghan defenders after the deployment of special forces into tunnels. This victory by the Soviets illustrates one of the only ways artillery can be used successfully to secure an underground fortified position. Tactics like these only succeed when the subterranean fortifications are surrounded, and all escape avenues are either destroyed or properly guarded, thereby cutting defenders off from resupply and reinforcements, as was recently seen in the Israeli intervention in Gaza against Hamas. However, underground defence networks can slow an advancing army to a halt until a given position is thoroughly cleared, a lesson that Ukraine learned in the final days of the battle for Mariupol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Artillery is seen as an intermediate weapon between the strategic weapons (such as nuclear missiles) and purely conventional armaments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet experience in a limited conflict shows how a reduced use of artillery can be both effective and strategically constrained, contrasting with the First and Second World Wars, where artillery was the “crown jewel” of a sophisticated land force centred on concentration of firepower. This said, Afghanistan is a rural country where cities or demographic density will not allow for major concentration of forces, the natural target for artillery. When the appropriate situation was realized on the ground, artillery was able to prove its worth once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-soviet-russias-1st-and-2nd-chechen-wars--a-never-ending-quest-for-neighbor-control&quot;&gt;Post-Soviet Russia’s 1st and 2nd Chechen Wars – A Never-Ending Quest for Neighbor Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian political need to secure the Chechen capital of Grozny in 1995 was defined by the indiscriminate levelling of infrastructure by artillery and unconventional adaptations in operating procedures that included hit-and-run tactics in an urban combat scenario. In the initial stages of the First Chechen War (December 11, 1994 to August 31, 1996), long Russian armoured columns were used en masse in an attempt to overwhelm defending Chechens in their capital city. Chechen hunter-killer rocket propelled grenade teams made short work of these armoured columns, as the main cannons of the Russian vehicles lacked the degrees of elevation to eliminate hunter-killer teams raised positions. To remedy the situation, artillery strikes were called in to level the buildings where hunter-killer teams were thought to be hiding, and armoured columns began to include ZSU anti-aircraft vehicles as they could successfully engage enemies regardless of their elevation in relation to the armoured column. These changes in approach show a key characteristic of Russian operations in urban combat: their desire to take the city or town by any means necessary. However, it must be noted that the negative effect artillery has on communications in an urban environment is a key weakness of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;importance-of-artillery-warfare-in-the-russian-way-of-war&quot;&gt;Importance of Artillery Warfare in the Russian Way of War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s armed forces still heavily rely on artillery as one of the main tools to exert power appropriately (as in the case of the First and Second World Wars) and inappropriately (as in the case of the Soviet-Afghan War and the First and Second Chechen Wars). Artillery is seen as an intermediate weapon between the strategic weapons (such as nuclear missiles) and purely conventional armaments. There is no reason to believe that in future wars Russia will not use artillery as a means to exert political and psychological pressure, and express determination, both internally and externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberspace has become a pivotal domain for geopolitical competition and statecraft, where vulnerabilities are systematically exploited and weaponised to advance state power. While certain sub-threshold activities, such as espionage, are tacitly regarded as “acceptable”, other behaviours remain ambiguously defined along the spectrum of responsible and irresponsible state conduct. This lack of clarity has significant implications for the present and future of the stability and security of the global digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, states have engaged in extensive multilateral discussions to delineate the “rules of the road” for cyberspace. These efforts, primarily undertaken within UN forums on international peace and security, have culminated in the development of a framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Anchored in four pillars – international law, norms, cyber capacity-building, and confidence-building measures – this framework represents a consensus-based approach to reducing ambiguity. However, its negotiation reflects a narrow focus, constrained by geopolitical tensions and divergent state priorities. The resulting diplomatic deadlocks and ongoing cyber confrontations between key actors – the US, China, Russia and others – highlight the challenges of operationalising the framework in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compendium seeks to expand the discourse on responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) by examining perspectives that have been under-represented in global debates. Moving beyond the confines of the UN framework and the perspectives of a select group of “capable” countries, this publication draws on region-specific case studies from North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East and Africa. These studies offer a critical lens on how states interpret and enact RCB, with approaches often shaped by unique regional dynamics such as developmental priorities, geopolitical pressures and climate concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By exploring these diverse approaches, the compendium not only enriches understanding of RCB but also underscores the importance of contextualising global norms within local and regional realities. The compendium is the outcome of 11 workshops, as well as interviews and literature reviews conducted by the authors, undertaken under the aegis of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour, a RUSI-led initiative with over 80 researchers dedicated to advancing regional research on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies illuminate how responsibility is articulated and operationalised through institutional development, legal and regulatory frameworks, cooperative agreements, and responses to major cyber incidents. Collectively, they contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between global principles and localised practices, offering an essential foundation for advancing both scholarly enquiry and policy formulation on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;louise-marie-hurel&quot;&gt;Louise Marie Hurel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the past two decades, most of the discussions concerning state responsibility in cyberspace have revolved around two specific processes in the UN: the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on the Security of and in the Use of Information and Communications Technologies. Taken together, these two processes have resulted in a series of UN resolutions that have sought to determine the “rules of the road” for state conduct in cyberspace. This aggregate set of resolutions has also been referred to as the “framework of responsible state behaviour” in cyberspace, which is made up of four key areas (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fzEU0ZE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Four Key Areas of RCB&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the importance of the “framework” in setting an international benchmark for how states are expected to conduct themselves in cyberspace, defining “responsible” and “irresponsible” behaviour remains a highly subjective endeavour, for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notions of responsibility are deeply engrained in institutional, political, economic and/or legal cultures at the domestic level, which provide international discussions with a broadly interpretable language.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The nature of cyberspace makes it particularly challenging to attribute malicious activities as well as to determine intent, and thus it is difficult to establish the actor (state or non-state) behind a cyber incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The sub-threshold nature of most cyber operations and malicious activities allows state-affiliated or state-sponsored groups to make use of ambiguity and obfuscation to conduct activities that are disruptive, but not entirely unacceptable or unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only 32 states to date have published their views on how international law applies to cyberspace, which means that there is still limited understanding of how key concepts such as sovereignty, non-intervention and due diligence are interpreted by states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defining responsible state behaviour in cyberspace is a political act and, as such, there are incentives and disincentives. In being clearer about certain types of conducts, a state is also “drawing a line” as to what it should and should not do, which is not always politically or strategically desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As cyberspace involves the activities of many stakeholders beyond states, the diverse interests and perspectives of non-state actors have a significant role in shaping collective expectations on behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors shows that despite there being a basis for the understanding of responsible state behaviour, there are still ongoing challenges in taking the debate beyond general agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, and to respond to the challenge of recognising discussions beyond the UN framework, as well as the interdependence of states with other stakeholders in enhancing cybersecurity, this compendium uses the term “responsible cyber behaviour” (RCB), rather than “responsible state behaviour”. This is not to negate the state as a key actor, nor the UN framework; rather, it is to recognise that such a concept might provide a useful analytical tool for exploring responsibility in cyberspace. In this regard, “responsible” refers to the responsibility of a range of actors within the global cyber-security governance regimes, while “cyber” indicates the realm of that responsibility – that is, in or through cyberspace. “Behaviour” purposely focuses on practices and conducts that are seen as responsible or irresponsible, acceptable or unacceptable, lawful or unlawful, in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when assessing state responsibility, this compendium still places it under the broader conceptual umbrella of RCB, as there are many other stakeholders that interact with, support and/or hold significant prominence in global cybersecurity politics (for example, large technology companies providing critical software and cybersecurity services). Moreover, and as this compendium argues, even though responsibility in cyberspace has been perceived as being directly linked to the “framework”, it is not solely defined by it. As the compendium shows, there are other factors at the regional and domestic levels that need to be considered, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The association between responsibility and content control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How specific understandings of responsibility are encoded through laws, strategies and institutional settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How regional threat landscapes impact how some states perceive what is appropriate and necessary, both in demonstrating responsibility and in defining irresponsible cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;towards-a-more-culturally-sensitive-view-of-responsible-behaviour-in-cyberspace&quot;&gt;Towards a More Culturally Sensitive View of Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notions of responsibility in cyberspace are negotiated via a series of concurrent (and at times, competing) forums – these can be multilateral, regional, theme-specific or multistakeholder. These forums may not use exactly the same term, but they nevertheless play a role in shaping auxiliary and synonymous references to responsible behaviour in cyberspace. A multisited view of RCB shows how norms and expectations of responsibility in cyberspace can and have been shaped beyond the UN and via other forums, as well as triggered by institutional developments and, in some cases, by cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that these discussions happen in siloes and are disconnected from or not well accounted for in current policy and scholarly literature. This is why this compendium seeks to provide an integrated view of RCB across the international, domestic and operational spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critical to understand that the UN framework is a product of the time and place in which it has been negotiated. As consensus arrangements negotiated within UN structures, the UN frameworks often conceal responsible state behaviour beyond “agreement” and like-mindedness. It can be argued that there are other components, such as national legislation (for example, cybercrime laws that define unlawful behaviour) and industry standards that equally shape RCB. The UN will likely continue to be the place for these discussions for the foreseeable future. However, because of the specific nature of where the discussions take place, there has often been a narrow view of where one should look to understand emerging state practice and collective views on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, equating RCB solely with the UN framework can lead to some analytical shortcomings in at least the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The multilateral nature of the debate:&lt;/strong&gt; The fact that these key discussions take place in a multilateral space means that the agreement and decision-making power over such processes ultimately sits in the hands of UN member states. This also means that non-state actors have a limited role to play in discussions about RCB – including the private sector, which owns most of the software development and infrastructure used to support governments; and civil society and academia, which are not only users of the technologies but also targets or receivers of the disproportionate effects of cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The structure and politics of multilateral debates:&lt;/strong&gt; While the previous point has been consistently recognised by both governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in the context of the OEWG, much less has been said about how the specific processes at the UN and the ways they operate also condition how these discussions take place. There are specific mandates for different “committees” within the UN. The state behaviour dialogues happen in the First Committee on Disarmament and International Security. This committee ultimately deals with the highest level of security concerns. The “framework” of voluntary commitments is crystallised through a years-long series of consensus-driven resolutions – but these still do not represent a legally binding commitment to those norms of expected behaviour. Such structures, processes and mandates have direct implications for what is considered to be within and outside the scope of the UN framework; for example, questions concerning the relationship between sustainable development and cybersecurity might not apply to the OEWG. Arguably, more development-leaning agendas would be considered if – and only if – they were framed as capacity-building concerns that are directly linked to the application of specific parts of the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited data and access:&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of data, public information is restricted to transcripts, video recordings, resolutions and expert discussions with diplomats and legal experts who have, over the years, taken a seat at the table in these UN meetings. This poses practical and analytical challenges for the study of how norms and other parts of the framework have come to be accepted and mainstreamed via UN resolutions. Even though the framework builds on non-cyber references that already provide a foundation for many of the notions of responsibility socialised among member states in the context of the GGE and OEWG – such as international humanitarian law, the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, and the UN Charter – how international law applies to cyberspace, and how other dimensions of the framework reflect specific notions of responsibility, need to be further investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A diplomatic sphere:&lt;/strong&gt; The UN-centrality of the debate on state responsibility in cyberspace means that the debates take place in a space that is often dominated by diplomats, rather than between those who possess the relevant expertise in cybersecurity. It is not often that domestic legislation or national cybersecurity strategies refer back to the “framework” – which is most familiar to diplomats and ministries of foreign affairs, and perhaps to other individual experts who have supported UN delegations from their respective capitals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compendium invites readers to reflect on how other examples, expressions and interpretations of responsibility are found beyond the international UN framework. It does so in at least three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going beyond norms implementation:&lt;/strong&gt; The UN framework (and the 11 norms therein) is taken as a point of departure, but not as the entire framing or understanding of RCB. So, rather than concentrating on how these norms have been implemented – as other researchers already have – the following chapters consider how other processes can also help illustrate how notions of RCB are deeply engrained, both socially and institutionally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognising that “responsibility” can look quite different from what has been agreed at the international level:&lt;/strong&gt; Economic, social, regional, geopolitical and even environmental dynamics influence both directly and indirectly the priorities of national governments, including their views on RCB. As each chapter shows, while there can be some consistency in terms of the commitment to the UN norms and framework, there are quite a few other state views that might extend the scope delineated internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring case studies with the aim of providing a practice-based view of how states perceive responsible or irresponsible behaviour:&lt;/strong&gt; Norms are what states have agreed to “say” that is acceptable or expected in terms of state behaviour, but when faced with a large-scale incident, further insights on what constitutes RCB emerge. This is illustrated in the chapters on Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-the-compendium&quot;&gt;About the Compendium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the challenges outlined above, the compendium offers a cross-regional set of views on the narratives underpinning notions of “responsibility” advocated at the national level. The compendium is the outcome of a year-long set of workshops undertaken within the context of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB), a RUSI-led initiative founded in 2023, involving more than 70 scholars from different regions, with the purpose of creating a platform for researchers to engage in regionally based and sensitive discussions of what RCB means from their cultural, social and economic perspectives. These discussions have informed the questions, cases and reflections explored in each of the chapters of this compendium. Chapters cover the following regions: Europe, the Indo-Pacific, LAC, the Middle East and Africa, and North America. The compendium reflects a regional breakdown in accordance with the five regions of the GP-RCB. Because of this, the regions covered are far from being exhaustive or indicative of a detailed regional breakdown. Recognising the limitations that this might present for subregional analyses, the compendium nonetheless provides a unique contribution of cross-regional case studies on RCB, with the aim of encouraging more research on regional and contextual interpretations of responsibility in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Regional”, for the purposes of this project, does not refer to or presume regional cohesiveness, or refer to a “regional” position on RCB per se: rather, it should be seen as an aggregate set of national views (and cases) within a particular geographic region – even though there are case studies covering regional mechanisms in the Indo-Pacific chapter and the Middle East and Africa chapter. As noted by previous researchers, regions are, in and of themselves, highly contested units of analysis, some drawn by linguistic identity and history, others by political agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In aiming to understand debates and factors that might have otherwise been overlooked in international discussions, the compendium makes three important contributions to advancing the study of RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It offers a space for reflection about the cultural drivers and gaps in the interpretation of “responsibility” in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It offers an analysis of specific cases that provide a practice-driven discussion of behaviours that are perceived as responsible or irresponsible, acceptable or unacceptable, by different governments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It lays out reflections for future research and policy agendas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research design for the compendium balances inductive and deductive approaches to the study of RCB. In practice, this means that rather than predefining RCB as a concept, researchers spoke to regional experts, organised workshops and reviewed existing literature to identify under-represented cases and perspectives on RCB in the current policy and academic literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapters address the following guiding questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contextual analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the key elements shaping RCB discourse and practice (for example, values, institutional frameworks, legislative developments, operational considerations)?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case studies:&lt;/strong&gt; What are some examples of how the country or region in question has grappled with defining RCB? The cases outlined in this compendium include analyses of institutional arrangements, incidents and national cyber crisis responses, which illustrate different interpretations of what responsibility means in practice (for example, means to respond, capacity to recover and institutional accountability).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaps and learnings:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the gaps in the discussion that have emerged from research into this topic that merit further investigation?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the authors vary in the ways that they seek to analyse each of these elements, they all draw on two or three data-gathering methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature review:&lt;/strong&gt; All chapters draw from official documents, legislation, policies, speeches, and academic and policy papers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshops:&lt;/strong&gt; All chapters are the outcome of 11 workshops (two to three per region) conducted between December 2023 and May 2024. The first regional workshop gathered GP-RCB researchers with the purpose ofscoping the key elements associated with RCB for a particular region, and identifying potential case studies. For the second regional workshop, authors invited practitioners to join GP-RCB members in exploring the case studies identified in the first workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unstructured/semi-structured interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Some authors used interviews to collect additional views from experts and policymakers from the region who may not have been able to attend the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chapters-overview&quot;&gt;Chapters Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter I, Patryk Pawlak focuses on the different pillars that support the views of European countries on RCB – as well as blockers and barriers. The chapter argues that, notwithstanding the diversity of countries in the region, if there is to be a “European approach to RCB”, this must revolve around strengthening the responsibility of different stakeholders within the cyber community, on the one hand, and strengthening the responsibility of external actors in relation to irresponsible behaviour, on the other. Most importantly, the chapter draws on the international relations literature on Responsibility to Protect to propose a typology for Europe’s “common but distributed responsibility”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter II, Gatra Priyandita reflects on how countries in the Indo-Pacific view RCB. There are common perspectives in the ways in which Indo-Pacific states perceive “responsible” state behaviour in cyberspace, chief among which are the importance of sovereignty and non-interference. Yet states differ on how these principles apply, with most choosing to adopt a policy of ambiguity and/or silence. The chapter focuses on ASEAN and Pacific Island countries as two key case studies on the differing views and approaches in the region, the former having concentrated on the development of cyber confidence-building measures and the latter on an approach to RCB that is influenced by the region’s specific climate security threats and how these relate to critical infrastructure protection and resilience concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chapter III, Mariana Salazar Albornoz analyses the LAC region. The chapter looks at the views of LAC states on RCB through a combination of contextual, legal and case-based analysis. The first part of the chapter focuses on the disparate levels of development and capacities in these states, while the second part reflects on their still-evolving positions on how international law applies to cyberspace. The third part reflects on the lessons learned from large-scale incidents in Costa Rica and Colombia, and how these inform RCB in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter IV looks at cases in the Middle East and Africa. Noran Fouad argues that, despite regional differences, RCB here is driven by several institutions, policies and intra-regional, rather than cross-regional, agreements that focus more on cyber governance than on “norms” per se. The chapter reflects on the AU’s push towards a common position on international law, among other efforts, as an indicator of commitment to RCB. It goes on to analyse an often under-explored case in the Middle East: the Gulf Cooperation Council and its institutional efforts to promote cyber dialogues among members in a region that is fraught with armed conflict and highly skilled cyberthreat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being the “smallest” region, North America encompasses two prominent “cyber powers”: the US and Canada. In Chapter V, Gavin Wilde examines how Canada and the US conceive their own responsible behaviour in cyberspace, rather than how they define it for others (for example, through attribution, sanctions and other “sticks” used to deter malicious cyber activity). The chapter reviews key legislation and institutional developments that have been signalled by both the US and Canada as key competencies for them to be able to “act responsibly”. Given the disproportionate presence of large cybersecurity and big-tech companies in the US, the chapter also gives some consideration to how state responsibility is interdependent with private responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this compendium highlights the diversity of approaches, views and experiences of countries regarding what constitutes RCB, it does not seek to be either exhaustive or comparative. Each chapter offers reflections on whether countries in the region have engaged with the concept of RCB and, if not, how they have sought to define it, and provides case studies that can shine a light on often-underexplored countries, sub-regional groupings and incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through investigation of different European methods to forging cyber responsibility – regulation, standardisation, deterrence and assistance – this chapter advances the notion that European countries practise a common but distributed responsibility that assigns specific roles within the cyber ecosystem while clearly recognising the importance of all stakeholders. It extends responsibility from states to other actors, making them explicitly part of the solution. Rather than looking at legal interpretations of responsible cyber behaviour (RCB), this contribution investigates various cyber-driven discourses and practices of different stakeholder groups. It identifies five key pillars of RCB, seeing it in terms of a responsibility to shield, refrain, constrain, assist and uphold. In that sense, this chapter also contributes to the existing scholarship on responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-decoding-cyber-responsibility&quot;&gt;Introduction: Decoding Cyber Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European approach to RCB is characterised by a strong focus on the role played by various stakeholder groups – government agencies, the private sector and industry operators – in shaping the overall cyber resilience of a state, society or community. This is usually referred to as a “whole-of-society” and “whole-of-government” approach in developing cyber policies and strategies. Although crucial for effective and inclusive cyber policymaking, such diffused responsibility – in the absence of clearly defined duties and accountability mechanisms among different stakeholders – may lead to a lack of clarity over who is ultimately responsible for successes and failures. The specific rights and obligations of individual stakeholders are often, but not always, clearly defined in laws and regulations. This lack of clarity contributes to accountability gaps that need to be addressed at various levels beyond the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of diverse European responses to cyber incidents confirmed that cyber responsibility is a multidimensional concept that relies on direct and indirect causal links between an actor’s actions and the effects of those actions to better capture the complexities of causality-driven approaches to responsibility. “Material responsibility” explains responsibility by examining the direct causal link between actions and effects. For example, several European governments have assigned responsibility for malicious cyber operations against their critical national infrastructure (CNI) or democratic processes to Russia or China. Another approach is “political responsibility”, whereby actors may be responsible for specific outcomes by belonging to specific cultural or political communities in which they shape the worldview of what is and is not permissible. National public attribution of cyber operations that violate the UN framework of responsible state behaviour and national positions on the application of international law are examples of states signalling what is and is not acceptable in cyberspace. Their decisions to publicly call out behaviour that violates agreed norms – even without pointing a finger at the perpetrator – establish the parameters for what RCB means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter defines the Europe region rather broadly, including member states of the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, and the countries in the Western Balkans, as well as Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. It does not focus on any specific case study but rather offers signposts for navigating commonalities and differences in European approaches to RCB. Nonetheless, as this chapter demonstrates, much reflection in Europe is shaped by the approaches developed in the EU, through which a web of collaborative frameworks shapes the regulatory and institutional landscape beyond its member states. Given clear differences over what RCB means and the antagonistic relations between Russia and other European countries, this chapter does not reflect the Russian perspective on cyber responsibility. The analysis presented in this chapter builds on the conclusions of two workshops organised as part of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour – one with researchers and another with policymakers – and policy documents, regulations and statements issued by national governments and EU institutions. The chapter begins by presenting the context that shapes European approaches to RCB. It then discusses different practices of RCB in Europe, and finally, building on this analysis, the chapter concludes with a presentation of pillars of common but distributed responsibility in the European context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contextualising-european-perspectives&quot;&gt;Contextualising European Perspectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion about RCB in Europe is shaped by several factors that impact the narratives and policies on what it means to “behave responsibly” or “be responsible” in cyberspace. Five elements are particularly relevant in shaping the European context: high levels of connectivity, strong regulatory culture, a significant cyberspace governance footprint, a high level of regional integration, and pressures on the overall security architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Levels of Connectivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries in Europe are among the best connected in the world. While this makes their digital economies more competitive in global markets, it also creates vulnerabilities and demands for addressing digital risks. Europe’s dependence on internet connectivity and much higher levels of cybersecurity vulnerability compared with countries in Africa or Asia create specific obligations and duties on different categories of stakeholders. Governments are expected to protect their citizens and businesses, and industry is responsible for ensuring the uninterrupted and safe operation of digital services and CNI. Although similar expectations may also apply in other parts of the world, the high level of dependence on connectivity and associated vulnerabilities in Europe have significantly influenced European perspectives on RCB and have fed into regulatory and institutional frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strong Regulatory Culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the commitments and obligations of different stakeholder groups are enshrined in specific regulatory acts and legislation adopted and implemented in the region. The region is characterised by a strong regulatory presence in cyberspace, primarily due to measures adopted by the EU and spread across the region through the EEA and the accession negotiations, as well as through the Council of Europe’s treaty-making activities. Two additional aspects are particularly important in this respect. First, laws and regulations adopted in the EU provide for robust accountability and enforcement mechanisms through the Court of Justice of the EU, the European Commission and the Council of Europe’s European Court of Human Rights. Second, obligations and duties created by EU legislation often apply to foreign entities operating in EU markets, creating an additional layer of responsibility (for example, the Cyber Resilience Act and the Network Information Security (NIS2) Directive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significant Cyberspace Governance Footprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of the European approaches to RCB is that these countries were at the core of the decisions that resulted in the emergence of a complex governance system whereby cyber-related issues are discussed concurrently across different international organisations and institutions. This has occurred primarily through international and regional organisations such as the OECD, the Council of Europe and the EU. This means that European countries were involved in setting the parameters for the current understanding of what constitutes RCB. Consequently, any attempts to revisit the existing legal and policy frameworks are considered as challenging the status quo. In terms of institutions, regional organisations such as the EU, the Council of Europe, the OSCE and – to some extent – NATO are considered cornerstones of regional cooperation. Proposals for new institutions or attempts to concentrate decision-making on cyberspace in other organisations within the UN system can also be interpreted as attempts to shift power structures within the international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Level of Regional Integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European region is also one of the most integrated regions of the world, with numerous regional organisations and platforms playing important roles in setting the rules for cyberspace governance. The EU is at the core of this institutional ecosystem. It drives legal and institutional processes among the 27 member states, as well as in other countries through a network of digital and cyber partnerships, such as the EEA, and through the accession process for the countries of the Western Balkans and Eastern Europe. In that sense, the process of European integration has served as a harmonising force. In addition, the Council of Europe, with the European Court of Human Rights, has served as the cornerstone for strengthening the rule of law and protection of human rights online, with several critical judgments setting the standard for the legal framework applicable in cyberspace. The OSCE has set the framework for international security cooperation, particularly by strengthening conflict-prevention mechanisms such as confidence-building measures in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pressures on Security Architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, the European debate about responsibility has been influenced by the Russian war against Ukraine, which has tested not only the capabilities of European states to defend themselves in the cyber domain but also what they consider to be critical capabilities for strengthening resilience and defence. It has influenced their understanding of the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and how they should cooperate at the regional and international levels to deter malicious attacks and strengthen the accountability of perpetrators. At the same time, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its behaviour in cyberspace have significantly reshaped the existing institutional cooperation structures in Europe. While NATO has accelerated cooperation on cyber defence issues by adopting new doctrines and approaches, cooperation within the OSCE that focused primarily on confidence-building measures and strengthening member states’ capabilities in this respect has suffered a significant blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, decades of cooperation among European countries translate into a relatively high level of trust and a strong culture of collaboration, which, despite national differences, often leads to the emergence of common approaches to defining RCB. At the same time, any legal, institutional or political challenges to this common understanding of RCB and the existing institutional and legal order (for example, the proposal for a new UN cybercrime convention) are interpreted by European governments and analysts as contestation that undermines the rules-based international order in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;practising-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Practising Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European experience allows us to distinguish at least four major dimensions through which RCB is defined and promoted: regulation, standards, deterrence and assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not coherently approached across Europe, regulation has become one of the key mechanisms for defining and promoting norms, rules and principles of RCB. Through legislative processes, treaty-making, self-regulation or voluntary norm-making processes, states create concrete duties or incentives for different categories of actors to behave responsibly in cyberspace. This is particularly important in countering arguments about cyberspace as a “wild west” without clearly prescribed rules. Even in the absence of a universal cyber treaty to govern state use of information and communications technologies and the discussions about the application of the existing international law to cyberspace, it can be argued that cyber behaviour is regulated through consumer laws, data protection laws and penal codes. Understanding the impact of regulation is critical. Legally defined responsibilities create specific duties and obligations that impact power relations between actors within the cyber ecosystem: governments over private companies and private companies over their users, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s role in this respect has been critical, given the size of its market and the fact that many countries in the Eastern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans are connected to the EU through various institutional mechanisms, with EU membership negotiations the most obvious example. Such regulation often carries extraterritorial implications and therefore reaches beyond the EU’s jurisdiction (for example, the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR), significantly reducing the risk of regulatory evasion and making the content of the regulation even more significant from an international perspective. Regulation has also become a key instrument for managing the behaviour of multinational corporations and tech companies. The EU has adopted several pieces of legislation addressing different dimensions of behaviour in cyberspace, including the fight against disinformation (Digital Services Act), market concentration and competition (Digital Markets Act), and specific obligations for digital operators of financial services (Digital Operational Resilience Act, DORA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standardisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach adopted across Europe to ensure that actors behave responsibly in cyberspace is through setting standards, which provide the baseline for products and services in cyberspace. Standards offer a benchmark for governments regarding the minimum requirements needed for cyber resilience, ensure that the private sector provides adequate quality products and services, and offer guidance to industry operators in performing their tasks when delivering critical services. European lawmakers, regulators and standardisation bodies such as CEN-CENELEC and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute play a central role in this respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous legislative acts adopted by the EU set clear standards for RCB by harmonising different approaches in the 27 member states and candidate countries. The NIS2 Directive sets out common standards for cybersecurity risk-management measures and reporting obligations, adoption of national cybersecurity frameworks, and establishment of competent authorities and single points of contact, among others. The Cyber Resilience Act aims to address the low level of cybersecurity of digital products and services and the insufficient understanding and information for users about the cybersecurity properties of products and services. Guidance on specific topics, such as the cybersecurity of 5G, complements the existing work undertaken by standards bodies, notably within the Service and System Aspects 3 workgroup of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project. Standards of behaviour in cyberspace are also set through regulation and self-regulatory frameworks concerning content moderation by online platforms. Further, the research community has played an important role in providing guidance on implementing the framework of responsible state behaviour, particularly by promoting the development of a common terminology and monitoring of cyber incidents, clarifying principles for implementing the framework of responsible state behaviour, and promoting results-based approaches to cyber capacity-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deterrence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States practice RCB by strengthening their deterrence postures, both in terms of “deterrence by denial” (in other words, strengthening their own cyber resilience) and “deterrence by punishment” (in other words, imposing consequences on states engaging in malicious cyber operations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of deterrence by denial, being responsible in cyberspace implies putting in place high levels of cybersecurity. Overall, European countries have invested significant resources into strengthening their capabilities to increase the cost (in other words, make it more resource-intensive and expensive) for attackers. This has been achieved through enhancing institutional and human capacities as well as the enabling environment. For instance, legislative acts such as the EU’s Cyber Solidarity Act aim to improve preparedness and response to cybersecurity incidents by testing entities in crucial sectors such as finance, energy and healthcare for potential weaknesses, creating an EU Cybersecurity Reserve consisting of incident response services from private service providers (“trusted providers”), and ensuring mutual assistance during a cybersecurity incident. Despite differences in cybersecurity maturity levels, European countries generally score highly across various cybersecurity indeces and have relatively advanced cybercrime legislation, primarily due to the implementation of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, to which most European countries are signatories. Advanced cooperation among law enforcement agencies, including through Europol, has also contributed to strengthening deterrence by denial, with several high-profile arrests, botnet takedowns and destruction of dark web markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by punishment is geared primarily towards influencing the calculus of perpetrators of malicious cyber activities by clearly defining potential consequences. The growing intensity and complexity of malicious cyber activities have strengthened international cooperation in this domain. EU countries have adopted a joint framework for diplomatic response known as the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox (CDT). The most significant aspect of the CDT’s implementation was the introduction of the horizontal cyber sanctions regime, with targeted sanctions (travel bans and asset freezes) against individuals and entities linked to specific malicious cyber activities. The CDT does not define what constitutes RCB but clearly links potential responses to violations of the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. Statements are also used to signal how states see their own responsibility. In the statement issued following the attacks on Albania, the EU stressed its determination to prevent cyber attacks through enhanced resilience and its commitment to assisting in building up cybersecurity resilience in candidate and other countries, using all available EU tools (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Pall Mall Process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In addition to regulation, states have engaged in norms development processes. One example is the Pall Mall Process launched by the UK and France to set the guiding principles and highlight policy options for states, industry and civil society in relation to the development, facilitation, purchase and use of commercially available cyber-intrusion capabilities. Although the signatories recognise that states may have interests in legitimate and responsible development and use of such capabilities, the Pall Mall Process aims to address the challenge of access to commercially available cyber-intrusion capabilities that increases the opportunity for their malicious and irresponsible use.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 2022 UK National Cyber Strategy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK’s 2022 National Cyber Strategy explicitly refers to “responsible cyber power” and clearly prescribes the elements of RCB. The vision expressed in the strategy commits the UK to being “a leading, responsible and democratic cyber power, able to protect and promote its interests in and through cyberspace in support of national goals”. These goals are to:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Protect military deployments overseas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Disrupt terrorist groups.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Counter sophisticated, stealthy and continuous cyberthreats.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Counter state disinformation campaigns.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reduce the threat of external interference in democratic elections.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Remove child sexual abuse material from public spaces online.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As a responsible democratic cyber power, the UK is expected to operate in a legal, ethical and responsible way. With that in mind, the National Cyber Force designs its operations in accordance with three core principles: accountability, precision and calibration. Key factors that ensure RCB operations include strict adherence to legal and ethical frameworks, robust oversight and accountability, thorough and established processes for governing operations (including authorisations), and cyber capabilities that can be controlled effectively and that are predictable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Charter of Trust&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Launched by Siemens, the Charter of Trust is a set of 10 principles signed by private sector actors to promote cybersecurity as a critical factor to the success of the digital economy. The Charter includes specific references to responsibility across different stakeholder groups; these include anchoring the responsibility for cybersecurity at the highest governmental and business levels by designating specific ministries and chief information security officers, as well as promoting responsibility throughout the digital supply chain.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an element of “responsibilising” other states, European governments now issue statements on selected cyber activities – a practice that has gained importance in recent years (see Table 1). These statements are particularly useful for understanding the parameters of RCB. Even when they do not attribute an attack to a specific actor, they usually indicate what the authors consider to be responsible or irresponsible behaviour. The language of these statements has evolved significantly, from vaguer terms in the early days to more specific language in recent years. Their scope has also varied, ranging from calling out attacks aimed at degrading CNI, influencing democratic processes or undermining integrity, security and economic competitiveness, to increasing acts of cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important and under-analysed aspect is the dilemma that governments face when applying the UN framework of responsible state behaviour not in peacetime but in conflict. The EU did not reference the UN framework in its January 2022 statement on cyber attacks against Ukraine, but, as highlighted in Table 1, it has done so with regard to various peacetime cyber incidents. This suggests that governments struggle to apply the commitments in the UN framework to instances of interstate conflict. States in the region have also become more direct in attributing specific attacks. In a recent case, the UK, supported by allies, identified China and Chinese state-affiliated organisations and individuals as responsible for two malicious cyber campaigns targeting democratic institutions and parliamentarians. Such attributions are an important element in strengthening accountability in cyberspace in peacetime. More importantly, these statements and attributions often demarcate how states collectively signal and refer to “irresponsible behaviour” and “destabilising behaviour” and how they seek to reaffirm their importance of the commitments to the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assistance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European states also understand their responsibility as providing assistance to strengthen cyber resilience, combat cybercrime and enhance cyber-defence capabilities. Over the years, the EU, the UK, Norway and Switzerland have invested significant resources in cyber capacity-building. These efforts express a collective responsibility for strengthening the overall cyber ecosystem. EU states have led some of the most successful global projects (for example, the Global Action on Cybercrime Extended programme and its later iterations) and launched major initiatives such as the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is reflected in statements issued by the EU. In the case of Albania, the EU committed to “assisting in building up cybersecurity resilience in candidate and other countries, using all available EU tools”. In Ukraine, the EU committed to providing technical assistance to further build Ukraine’s resilience against cyberthreats and hybrid threats. In addition, there has been significant effort to strengthen operational support to partner countries. The EU, for example, has completed two Cyber Rapid Response Teams missions to support Moldova during the country’s presidential election and referendum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for assistance highlights the different roles and responsibilities of the multistakeholder community, particularly the tech companies, industry operators, technical community and civil society.54 Each has different missions and duties, which they pursue with available tools and resources. For example, companies providing services to governments – such as Microsoft’s support to Albania – have a particular responsibility to ensure that their support empowers and enhances the capacities of their clients in the long term, rather than creating dependencies that might become too costly. They also have the obligation to ensure that the products and services they provide are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pillars-of-the-common-but-distributed-responsibility-in-europe&quot;&gt;Pillars of the Common but Distributed Responsibility in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RCB can be approached as either a past-oriented concept (mostly in the context of legal responsibility and interpretations of state practice) or a future-oriented concept (when certain expectations of behaviour emerge from agreed norms and laws). The latter has been described by some as a new responsibility-based instrument that serves to govern transnational relationships. This understanding of responsibility is suitable in the context of cyber behaviour, where decisions about the content of global obligations, their allocations and potential sanctions are based on constant dialogue and their articulation with multiple stakeholders, especially the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic nature of RCB also implies varied understandings of main concepts such as rights-holders (individuals and social groups with particular entitlements) and duty-bearers (state or non-state actors obligated to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the human rights of rights-holders). This dynamism results in multilayered responsibility whereby state and non-state actors bear responsibility for specific aspects of cyber behaviour. The analysis of existing practices and approaches described earlier allows for the differentiation five key pillars of RCB in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Shield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmental and non-governmental actors within the cyber ecosystem are responsible for providing adequate levels of cybersecurity protection for their citizens, clients, end users and key stakeholders. These responsibilities are inscribed in laws, regulations, contracts and normative frameworks such as those mentioned earlier (for example DSA/DMA, NIS2, GDPR, DORA and the Cyber Resilience Act). They are responsible for the cybersecurity of those who have entrusted them with specific tasks. Therefore, all duty-bearers must take steps and measures that actively protect rights-holders from any adverse effects of cybersecurity incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Refrain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governmental and non-governmental actors have a responsibility not to undertake any malicious or illegal activity that may cause damage and harm to another country and its citizens. This responsibility is clearly spelled out in the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. Similarly, the private sector has a responsibility to refrain from releasing products and services to the market that have not been adequately tested. Numerous statements issued by the EU and individual states, as well as the self-regulatory approaches by the private sector mentioned earlier, illustrate this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Constrain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When governments decide to use cyber operations against other actors (state or non-state), they have a responsibility to conduct such activities within the limits of existing domestic and international law, as well as norms of responsible state behaviour. Their actions should be guided by principles of proportionality and necessity. This means that states should abstain from cyber activities whose outcomes they cannot anticipate, or which might have a disproportionate impact on their targets. The UK’s definition of responsible cyber power and what it means in practice illustrates this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1xGI0vK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Responsible Cyber Behaviour – Material Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Assist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European governments have emphasised the importance of technical assistance and cyber capacity-building as a means to support partner countries in strengthening their cyber resilience, fighting cybercrime and developing competence in cyber diplomacy. This commitment is not only expressed through declaration and policy documents such as the ones mentioned earlier but also translates into significant funding for cyber capacity-building initiatives from the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, France and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Uphold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments also define their responsibility as upholding the rules-based order in cyberspace, particularly the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. This aspect of political responsibility stems from their membership in international organisations and their contribution to shaping the existing international order. European states have confirmed this principle through numerous declarations, such as those mentioned in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tFgPs6w.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Responsible Cyber Behaviour – Political Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusions-and-outlook&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Outlook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of different European policy approaches and practices on RCB leads to several additional observations that will impact the future of these debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is a strong focus in Europe on political responsibility, with strong support for the UN framework of responsible state behaviour. Although there is overall agreement on the goals of the framework and a strong sense of responsibility to uphold it, decisions on implementation and choice of instruments are left to each state. This also explains the substantial focus on implementing the framework as part of the responsibility to assist identified by European governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the attribution of responsibility remains one of the major issues in the practice of responsibility. Legal attribution is critical in assigning responsibility to states in line with existing international law and state practice. Actions by non-state actors may also be legally attributed to a state if the latter acknowledges and adopts the conduct as its own. However, political responsibility (and political attribution) does not necessarily require direct causation of harms, and decisions about attribution are usually taken based on nationally defined procedures. In the future, it will be important to further clarify and align such criteria at the international level. The multifaceted nature of attribution also raises questions about corresponding types of responsibility; for example, while legal attribution may trigger responsibility rooted in international law, technical attribution prescribes technical responsibility for providing infrastructure to enable malicious actors to conduct cyber operations. Similarly, a state from whose territory attacks originate does not necessarily carry technical or legal responsibility but has political responsibility to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, while European governments have attached significant attention to the question of attribution, there has been limited discussion about the question of “knowing”, which is central to several norms of responsible state behaviour. This gap needs to be addressed through further research and policy discussions. For example, the norms talk about states not “knowingly” allowing attacks to originate from their territories, but the parameters of “knowing” remain largely undefined. This opens the discussion about the responsibility of individual states to put in place institutions, tools and processes that increase overall situational awareness and contribute to improving the knowledge of states about what happens in their respective networks. This carries concrete implications for other adjacent debates, especially on cyber capacity-building needs and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the research and policy community needs to address the challenges of diffused responsibility. While it is true that effective cyber policies require cooperation and involvement of different stakeholder groups (“cyber is a team sport”), additional work is needed to better understand how specific responsibilities are delineated and understood within the multistakeholder community. The lack of clarity on this issue makes drawing the borders of responsibility difficult and ultimately undermines efforts to strengthen accountability in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gatra-priyandita&quot;&gt;Gatra Priyandita&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explains the similarities and differences between how Indo-Pacific states perceive the concept of “responsible cyber behaviour” (RCB). While RCB is not featured within the cybersecurity lexicon of the Indo-Pacific, regional governments, civil society and industry have articulated their expectations of what it means to be a “responsible” actor. Indo-Pacific states’ cybersecurity strategies and national position papers within the UN and regional architectural processes maintain their commitment to the global framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Their approach recognises the applicability of customary international law in cyberspace and voluntary commitment to the UN’s 11 norms of responsible state behaviour. But despite common views on the importance of sovereignty as a basis of international relations in cyberspace, Indo-Pacific states have different perceptions of what RCB looks like, including different attitudes on how to respond to irresponsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unsurprising that Indo-Pacific governments and societies have different ideas of what constitutes RCB. The region comprises over 40 states, including major markets such as India and China, as well as smaller Pacific Island states. The region accounts for nearly half the world’s population and drives about $50 trillion in economic activity. It is also a key arena for US–China strategic competition, with both powers pursuing sometimes-competing goals in multiple domains, including cyber. But the region is also home to regional powers – such as Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan and South Korea – that are actively attempting to assert their own visions for the international order. Meanwhile, state-sponsored cyber actors, such as those in China and North Korea, engage in espionage, intellectual property theft, infrastructure disruption and financial crime. These activities often mirror geopolitical rivalries, as in the India–Pakistan cyber conflict, where Pakistani-based threat actor APT36 targets Indian entities and India’s Patchwork APT conducts espionage in Pakistan. Geopolitical tensions shape cybersecurity dynamics, impacting how states perceive threats and choose to cooperate. For instance, cybersecurity has emerged as an area of cooperation in some minilateral groupings, such as the Quad (Australia, India, Japan and the US) and AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the US), where states move to share information and intelligence regarding state-sponsored cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines the diverse perspectives from across the Indo-Pacific region on what it means for states to demonstrate RCB. The analysis attempts to capture perspectives from four subregions: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania. Given the wide range of states involved, some will inevitably receive more attention than others. Furthermore, there is the additional risk that more “cyber mature” states (for example, Australia, China and Japan) will receive far more attention, given just how developed and well-articulated their positions on responsibility in cyberspace may be. To mitigate this risk, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) organised virtual discussions with experts from across the Indo-Pacific to test regional perspectives on RCB as part of the Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB) regional workstream – also ensuring the participation of experts from a wide range of states. The research for this chapter also specifically engaged with researchers from several jurisdictions – often less represented in discussions on RCB – in order to do an additional deep dive into how their countries of study perceive RCB. Insights from these virtual discussions and additional analyses further inform this chapter, allowing the articulation of perspectives from a wider range of states, rather than those that have been more vocal on these topics, such as Australia, China and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter argues that a state’s expectations of “responsibility” in cyberspace are shaped by international experiences and the unique national characteristics of individual states, the latter of which are affected by historical experiences, political systems and sources of insecurity. Variation in national experiences shape how states develop approaches to international security in cyberspace, including over questions concerning attribution, countermeasures and the use of multilateral and minilateral platforms. States also have different experiences in how these rules are enforced domestically; imposing stricter guidelines on the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) internally may be complicated by inter-service rivalries, poor civilian control over the security and defence apparatus, and/or weak oversight mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, many states are particularly cautious about the principles of sovereignty and non-interference, shaped by recent experiences in nation- and state-building, especially in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Island states. These experiences have created an environment where governments prioritise preventing the misuse of cyberspace by criminals, insurgents and terrorist organisations. In international affairs, these shared experiences have reinforced the importance of multilateralism for addressing issues of peace, security, capacity-building and information sharing. States in these regions are generally more cautious about developing (or even declaring) offensive cyber capabilities (including for countermeasures) – which can be seen as a violation of sovereignty – and publicly or politically attributing cyber attacks to state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand – cyber-mature states with clearly defined state-based threats to their cyberspace – have articulated national positions which suggest that they are willing to be more assertive in cyberspace, including by publicly attributing attacks. While Japan and South Korea have traditionally been cautious about attributing cyber attacks, particularly due to diplomatic sensitivities, recent shifts indicate a growing recognition of the need for stronger attribution measures, especially in the face of increased threats from state actors such as North Korea and China. Both states are exploring more proactive measures in deterrence and response, demonstrating a different approach from their counterparts in the broader Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis presented in this chapter is informed by content analysis of primary documents (such as cybersecurity strategies and national positions in the UN), as well as virtual discussions and interviews with government officials and the expert community. The chapter has two main sections. The first examines areas of convergence and divergence in national attitudes to the different features that make up how states perceive the international and internal dimensions of responsibility in cyberspace. The second examines two case studies – ASEAN’s adoption of the 11 UN norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace, and cyber capacity-building in Pacific Island states – to highlight how unique international and domestic considerations inform national attitudes to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interpreting-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Interpreting Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpacking the International Dimensions of RCB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines how Indo-Pacific states converge and diverge when interpreting the international dimensions of RCB. This interpretation can be uncovered by examining how states have expressed their preferences and concerns on how states interact with one another in cyberspace. In looking into these debates, this section examines how attitudes towards international law and norms compare between Indo-Pacific states, including the rule of law, multilateralism, sovereignty and cyber capacity-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Law and Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As members of the UN General Assembly, all Indo-Pacific states have agreed to the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Such frameworks themselves rely on the UN Charter and the associated rules of customary international law, both of which apply to activities in cyberspace. Indo-Pacific states also agree on the application of the 11 UN norms of responsible state behaviour, which guide what states principally can and cannot do in cyberspace. In agreeing to this collective framework, Indo-Pacific states commit to broad sets of actions that constitute state responsibility in cyberspace, including to not use ICTs for malign purposes (such as attacking critical national infrastructure CNI, during peacetime) and to commit to ensuring secure cyberspace by responding to the misuse of cyberspace domestically by criminals. In 2018, ASEAN became the first (and, thus far, only) regional organisation in the world to formally adopt the 11 UN norms, an initiative that will be further explored in one of this chapter’s case studies. ASEAN also works with regional partners to identify how these norms can be operationalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the global consensus on the collective framework in principle, states have different understandings of how international law applies to cyberspace. Among states in the region, only a few – most notably Australia, China, Japan and Singapore – have managed to articulate how it applies in cyberspace. Those that have articulated national positions have done so as a means of either defining the debate or encouraging transparency. For example, Australia has explicitly stated that it has published its views in order to “deepen understandings and set clear expectations”, given that “activities conducted in cyberspace raise new challenges for the application of international law”. Through this effort, states that have articulated their interpretations have gone beyond recommitting to the UN framework by, among other actions, providing technical definitions of key terms (for example, “coercion”, “sovereignty” and “cyber operations”) and/or further articulating positions and/or policies on elements of how international law can be applied to cyberspace, including subjects such as countermeasures, attribution and international humanitarian law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, most Indo-Pacific states have not been explicit in articulating how international law should apply. This includes larger states, such as India, Indonesia, South Korea and Vietnam. While reasons for not producing national positions vary, some states may lack the technical capacity (and/or a sense of urgency) to establish positions, an exercise that requires high expertise in the intersections of digital affairs and international law. Ambiguity on national positions can also be strategic, as it allows states to flexibly navigate an international legal environment that is increasingly becoming polarised by strategic competition. In particular, this allows non-aligned states to avoid the impression of leaning too closely towards one state. For example, some states may seek to exploit this ambiguity to prevent spillover into other issues, which may have an impact on their economic and technological relationships with other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing diplomatic issue is the question of whether a distinct international treaty on international security in cyberspace is necessary. While the UN General Assembly has accepted that the existing body of international law can be sufficiently applied to cyberspace in principle, some states have questioned its value in practice and have instead advocated for new rules. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization – whose member states are predominantly Indo-Pacific states – first proposed the creation of an International Code of Conduct for Information Security in 2011 (with a revised draft in 2015). More recently, many Indo-Pacific states supported the creation of an international cybercrime treaty that would consider content-related crimes, including disinformation and copyright infringement (issues that the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime does not specifically cover), and offer more precision in concepts surrounding ICT. Initial discussions that led to the Convention Against Cybercrime received support from many Indo-Pacific states, including China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam, none of which have acceded to the Budapest Convention. Reasons for extending this support likely vary, but some states did so to ensure that the international treaty would be inclusive of the varied perspectives on what constitutes cybercrime and how international cooperation should function. Others saw a distinct international cybercrime treaty as useful to help to harmonise technical definitions and cooperation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another ongoing diplomatic issue is content security. Internal security concerns shape national approaches to cybersecurity and help to explain why many Indo-Pacific states prefer a cybersecurity policy – or a system of international law – that covers content-related crimes, such as disinformation and online hate. In this chapter’s examination of India, Indonesia and Pakistan, it was found that attitudes towards content security are in part driven by concerns about terrorism. In key policy documents, each of these states has expressed a desire to see strengthened law enforcement and government cooperation to prevent the misuse of cyberspace by terrorist groups. For example, India’s contribution to the 2022 Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) annual progress report explicitly called for “strengthen[ed] law enforcement cooperation to prevent the use of cyberspace for terrorist purposes”. In other states, such as Cambodia and China, the preference for addressing content-related crimes may also be attributed to regime security. Internal security concerns prompted a preference in several states to see an international cybercrime treaty that covers content-related crimes. However, such attitudes run counter to the preferences of liberal democracies, such as Australia and New Zealand, which fear that the criminalisation of such activities might have a negative effect on the freedom of expression online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responding to Cyber-Enabled Threats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indo-Pacific states adopt varied approaches in reinforcing the principles of international law and the 11 UN norms. Most states opt to use multilateral and bilateral mechanisms to reiterate key principles. This includes incorporating principled commitments (such as those concerning the application of the UN Charter and commitment to providing cyber capacity-building) in cyber agreements. For example, ASEAN member states have responded to cyber-enabled threats by working to operationalise the norms of RCB, including through the publication of a checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many states also respond to cyber-enabled threats by focusing inward and dedicating resources to building internal resilience against cyber attacks. This means building the capacity to respond to cyber incidents, establishing baseline cybersecurity standards for key entities, and establishing the legal, institutional and regulatory framework for cyber governance. For example, recognising that the country is vulnerable to being exploited by domestic and foreign hackers, the Indonesian government has worked with experts, industry and other stakeholders to improve its capacity to map out the cyberthreat landscape, improve incident response, and introduce needed legislation to protect critical information infrastructure and improve incident reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomacy is also used to fulfil domestic resilience-building needs through advocating for international support and assistance for cyber capacity-building and/or using multilateral, bilateral or minilateral mechanisms for information and intelligence sharing. Cyber capacity-building has emerged as a key priority in diplomatic agendas across the region. For example, the Pacific Island states’ cyber engagement with Australia, New Zealand and European states involves support for capacity-building in operational, legal and policy matters. Australia also supports Pacific Island states by deploying cybersecurity experts to the region to support incident response and cyber resilience-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some states, however, cyber resilience-building is seen as not enough. Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore have explicitly confirmed the applicability of the law of countermeasures to cyber operations to protect CNI. They agree that states may take proportionate action to retaliate against a malign cyber actor, should it induce the actor to comply. Several states have adopted measures such as active cyber defence and/or have adopted offensive cyber capabilities to respond to potential cyberthreats. For example, Australia has adopted a policy of retaliating against malign cyber forces by disrupting and degrading their computer systems. However, some other states, such as Indonesia and Pakistan, have cautioned against countermeasures due to the fear that such efforts might trigger a cyber arms race and risk the further militarisation of cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another means of responding to cyber attacks is through attribution, where states “name and shame” actors (particularly states) that behave irresponsibly in cyberspace. In the Indo-Pacific, several states – including Australia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and China – have either technically or politically attributed cyber operations to a state. The majority of Indo-Pacific states have not made any public attributions against states (and even fewer have committed to policies on cyber attribution). There may be several reasons for this. First, cyber attribution requires certain technical capabilities – ranging from digital forensics to language skills – that may not necessarily be available to most states. Second, many states choose not to attribute cyber attacks in order to prevent direct confrontation with other states, especially if they lack the capacity to conduct the necessary forensics to formally attribute. Third, cyber attribution may compel states to respond either with reciprocal cyber measures or through alternative non-cyber actions – steps that some states might be reluctant or unwilling to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multilateralism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, states agree on the importance of international cooperation to ensure peace, security and stability. Multilateralism stands as the preferred form of cyber diplomacy for many Indo-Pacific states. Through these channels, states aim to develop common understandings on issues such as cybercrime, data privacy, cybersecurity and the use of cyber capabilities in conflicts. Regional discussions on cyber, such as those that centre on ASEAN, facilitate exchanges of best practices, promote transparency and build trust, thereby ideally contributing to a more stable and secure cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a shift in turning to other kinds of mechanisms beyond multilateral forums to affirm the global framework on RCB. Increasingly, states are acting in coordination with other states to respond to malicious state cyber attacks, invoking international law. Through the Five Eyes intelligence arrangement, Australia and New Zealand have attributed cyber attacks with the US, the UK and Canada. Japan and South Korea have also issued several joint cyber attributions with other states. In a recent development, some states have jointly presented public statements warning of certain malign state actors in cyberspace; for example, the intelligence chiefs of Australia and New Zealand – again, through the Five Eyes network – have made public statements warning of China’s use of cyber capabilities to irresponsibly secure economic goals. The emergence of smaller groupings as a platform for voicing concerns about issues in cyberspace may stem from growing disillusionment in some states over the limitations of multilateral mechanisms in terms of asserting international law and norms. This has prompted like-minded states to band together over shared security concerns. For example, the Quad arrangement’s growing focus on cybersecurity is, in part, driven by shared concerns about Chinese cyber operations and a desire to strengthen ICT and technological supply chain security. The Five Eyes intelligence network’s decision to call out China’s irresponsible use of cyber capabilities is also an example of more transparent collaboration in response to a shared security concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sovereignty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political character of the Indo-Pacific region stands as uniquely “Westphalian”, given recent experiences of colonisation and nation- and state-building. Insecurity about internal security challenges has led to a situation whereby governments tend to be more concerned about misuses of cyberspace by criminals, insurgents, terrorist organisations and even opposition groups. As a result, there are strong domestic sensitivities about foreign interference, including in the cyber domain, especially if foreign states are suspected of sponsoring or supporting certain domestic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, the principle of sovereignty plays a crucial role in shaping attitudes in cyberspace, including how states articulate national positions on what constitutes “responsible” cyber behaviour. For example, Indonesia’s concerns about the global proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities are partly driven by the potential use of these tools for espionage, which can undermine a country’s sovereignty. There is a principled belief across the region that states shall not use cyber tools to violate another country’s sovereignty by intervening in their domestic affairs or using force to undermine physical infrastructure. However, this belief is often not clarified clearly in national policy documents; most often, it is only communicated and understood during private correspondence with officials. As such, how exactly the principle of sovereignty applies to cyberspace remains a matter of debate, as few states have clearly articulated their views on what it means not to “violate” another country’s sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Indo-Pacific, the debate over sovereignty in cyberspace is most prominently shaped by discussions on “data sovereignty”. For many states in the region, data sovereignty is increasingly intertwined with broader national interests, given the central role of cyberspace in national security, economic stability and societal wellbeing. As a result, Indo-Pacific states tend to adopt a cautious and protective approach towards cyberspace, treating it as an extension of their sovereign territory that requires robust safeguards against external threats. This protective stance manifests in policies designed to assert greater control over digital infrastructure, data flows and digital governance. For example, India, Indonesia and Thailand have pursued data localisation laws and stringent cybersecurity regulations aimed at preventing foreign access to critical data and digital assets. These measures reflect broader concerns about cyber espionage and foreign interference, reinforcing the perception that cyberspace must be governed as a critical domain of state sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capacity-Building&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, states agree that cyber capacity-building – both receiving and giving support – is a fundamental component of international cooperation in cyberspace. Among more cyber-mature states, such as Japan and Australia, there is a proactive effort to provide support to less cyber-mature states, including by helping local incident response units and collaborating on developing the capabilities of security operations centres. Meanwhile, less cyber-mature states have openly demonstrated the desire to receive cyber capacity-building support as a means of overcoming challenges in cyber governance, incident response and technical understanding. Some states also actively use regional organisations for this purpose: for example, ASEAN member states have underlined the importance of international cooperation and capacity-building to support the implementation of the 11 norms of RCB in the use of ICTs. ASEAN member states can also receive support for cyber capacity-building from one another or from donor states. Such support can be obtained through ASEAN’s immediate dialogue partners and/or by using its extensive network of cyber capacity-building programmes and initiatives, such as the ASEAN Cyber Capacity Program, ADMM (ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting) Cybersecurity and Information Centre of Excellence, and ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Capacity-building Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some states have called for states to provide cyber capacity-building without political conditions. For example, the research for this chapter revealed that the Cambodian government is against the provision of support for cyber capacity-building that is conditional on changes to the domestic political systems of states. This perspective is based on concerns that Cambodia has been sidelined from receiving certain support due to its authoritarian political system. Meanwhile, Pacific Island states have advocated for more sustainable forms of cyber capacity-building, as such efforts would not only have a positive effect in building local capacity to respond to cyber challenges but would also be potentially more climate-friendly, given that less air travel is needed by experts from donor states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpacking the Internal Dimensions of RCB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond looking into the international dimensions of RCB, this chapter provides a snapshot of how states try to demonstrate responsibility domestically. This exercise involves looking into the kinds of regulations, standards and oversight mechanisms available to states to ensure that they do not irresponsibly use ICTs. Across the Indo-Pacific, many governments have the capability to conduct domestic surveillance. However, in a highly diverse region with a complex make-up of democratic and authoritarian political systems, how states try to demonstrate responsibility is not always clear or straightforward. For example, national intelligence agencies do not always make guidelines on the use of ICTs for domestic or international surveillance publicly available. Moreover, given the expertise required to oversee the use of ICTs by governments, not all parliaments are well equipped to hold the national security apparatus to account on its use of these technologies. In the states examined for this compendium, the laws and specific guidelines governing the state use of ICTs for national security reasons remain under-developed or under-explored. For example, neither Pakistan nor Cambodia maintains specific controls or transparency requirements for purchasing and selling cyber-enabled technologies. While Indonesia has legal and regulatory requirements for procuring surveillance technologies, their enforcement remains unclear. Even Japan, as a cyber-mature country, does not publicly detail how its authorities are restricted in using cyber tools. As a means of committing to certain international commitments, some states abide by clearer sets of guidelines for the sale and use of cyber tools. For example, the Wassenaar Arrangement for conventional weapons commits some Indo-Pacific states – including Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand – to limiting the export of technologies that can be used for cyber-enabled attacks. For Japan specifically, it also maintains a general principle on the export of weapons and military technology, which limits it to friendly states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, governments across the Indo-Pacific have attempted to demonstrate RCB by establishing the necessary cybersecurity standards domestically to ensure compliance from various organisations – from industry and universities to government entities. Pacific Island states have looked to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as offering the gold standard for cybercrime law. Other states may be inspired by the Convention but have not opted to directly adopt these standards; rather, they have chosen to design domestic cybersecurity standards with local considerations in mind. In some states, such as Japan and Taiwan, industries that produce more technologically advanced products and items of higher intellectual property value are subjected to more stringent cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 1: ASEAN Norms and Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2018, ASEAN leaders met in Singapore and released the ASEAN Leaders’ Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation. In essence, the statement saw the adoption of the 11 UN norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, as it “recognised” the need for all member states to adopt a “set of common, voluntary and non-binding norms” in order “to enhance trust and confidence in the use of cyberspace”. The Leaders’ Statement also called for further identification of a concrete list of voluntary, practical norms of state behaviour in cyberspace that ASEAN can work towards adopting, taking reference from the 11 UN norms. This agreement further attempts to provide the initial normative foundations for regional cooperation in cyberspace. The decision to adopt the norms undoubtedly reflects the deep economic interests in the value of cyberspace and the security-related concerns held by the mostly emerging cyber powers about the misuse of ICTs by state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Leaders’ Statement reflects the economic lens through which ASEAN member states perceive cyberspace. Despite serious concerns about the threats online, member states recognise the transformative powers of digital technology as a means of bolstering economic growth, addressing economic and social ills, and facilitating speedier public services. Yet, to safeguard peaceful coexistence in cyberspace, officials agreed (at least in principle) that there has to be coordination to share best practices and information on cybersecurity policy, coordinate on incident response, and work to build capacity in less cyber-mature states. On this basis, and with strong advocacy from Singapore, member states agreed that an international normative framework was necessary for guiding state conduct in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the adoption of these norms may also be credited to ASEAN’s desire to play a meaningful role in international discussions on cyber norms. Given that ASEAN provides a major platform for international engagement on security issues and confidence-building measures through both the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit, adopting these norms is meant to be a way to offer ASEAN member states the collective opportunity to highlight how the norms can be operationalised and understood widely, as well as perhaps exported to other parts of the Indo-Pacific region, particularly great powers such as China. The opportunity to articulate what the norms mean operationally would (ideally) allow ASEAN to play a more proactive role in shaping international attitudes in cyberspace. As such, the adoption of these norms is part of ASEAN’s long-standing pursuit of “socialising” major powers in the Indo-Pacific region – this time, by attempting to localise an internationally agreed set of norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that non-interference is a nearly sacrosanct principle in ASEAN, it is also fundamental to highlight that the voluntary nature of these norms allows member states to commit with some flexibility. It allows states, at the very least, to first rhetorically commit to the norms and eventually work towards internal operationalisation. The principle of non-interference will, nonetheless, be a further hurdle in enforcing ASEAN’s capacity to both internationally socialise other states and domestically enforce the norms as structural impediments, including a lack of common legal understanding and an absence of enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Study 2: Pacific Island States and “Climate-Friendly” Cyber Capacity-Building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this chapter, the Pacific Island states refer to the 12 independent smaller island states that are wholly located in Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia. This subregion – which has an overall population of roughly 12 million – shares common perspectives on how states should behave in cyberspace. Among others, states abide by the application of international law and norms in cyberspace, meet basic cybersecurity standards as outlined by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and accept that cyber capacity-building support is necessary to build cyber resilience. There are also distinct threats to the subregion’s cyber ecosystem, in the form of natural disaster-related challenges and the social problems emanating from cyber-enabled crimes. While the latter is not unique to the Pacific, it is a primary source of cyber-enabled threat. Pacific Island governments are increasingly concerned about the social and economic effects of malign cyber activities on their citizens. In this respect, the 2018 Boe Declaration has placed cybersecurity resilience as a priority. In responding to cyber-enabled challenges amid problems with under-resourcing, many Pacific Island states require financial and technical assistance from donor states in combating threats in cyberspace. Because of the existential threat of climate change, Pacific Island states have uniquely stood out in advocating to ensure that all forms of cyber support pay attention to the effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific Island states see an abundance of cyber capacity-building support from donor states (particularly Australia and New Zealand) and through formal multilateral groupings, such as Partners in the Blue Pacific. Despite the abundance of support, concerns over the effects of climate change are influencing attitudes towards cyber policy in several ways. First, they have led to an increasing call for cyber capacity-building support to be sustainable, not only to allow local Pacific Islanders to domestically build cyber capacity but also to ensure that any form of support does not have a further effect on increasing carbon emissions (such as through flights or uses of energy-inefficient technologies). Second, there has also been a call for states to be inclusive when delivering technological or cyber capacity-building support. This particular preference is rooted in growing concerns over the implications of strategic competition in the ICT space, as well as the continuing need to invest in (or receive) ICT infrastructure that is not only inexpensive but also climate-resilient and energy-efficient. Existential concerns over the effects of climate change and the need to meet development goals mean that Pacific Island states perceive RCB in other states to lie in the provision of support that is highly empathetic of their development and security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no Indo-Pacific state has employed the term “responsible cyber behaviour” as a distinct concept within its diplomatic lexicon, these states do maintain interpretations of what it means for states to be responsible actors in cyberspace. States have committed to the global framework for RCB as a means of demonstrating that they are themselves responsible actors. These international commitments inform Indo-Pacific states of how they expect other states to behave. But underpinning national interpretations of RCB are the unique historical, security and economic contexts of individual states. Attitudes toward sovereignty, multilateralism and capacity-building converge and diverge because of these national differences. How states demonstrate their own “responsibility” domestically also demonstrates these national differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the Indo-Pacific, national attitudes towards cyberspace are strongly influenced by principles of sovereignty and non-interference, reflecting historical experiences in nation- and state-building, particularly in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Island states. These states prioritise protecting their cyberspace from misuse by criminals, insurgents and terrorists, leading to a cautious approach that includes a reluctance to develop or declare offensive cyber capabilities or attribute cyber attacks to state actors. Multilateralism is seen as essential for advancing peace, security, capacity-building and information sharing. In contrast, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, driven by clearly identified state-based threats, have adopted more assertive cyber policies. These states are increasingly open to attributing cyber attacks and exploring proactive deterrence measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a seeming trend in which more cyber-mature states (such as Australia, China, Japan and Singapore) tend to have more articulated interpretations of RCB. While it is possible to assume that states would articulate their positions more clearly as time goes by, it is also possible that strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific encourages more states to adopt a policy of ambiguity and silence on cyber diplomacy. With the UN OEWG process becoming increasingly polarised into identifiable camps between different forms of “like-minded” states, a community of states seeking to avoid entanglement may choose to continue to avoid articulating clear positions. While this may seem unavoidable, it is possible to focus international cooperation and capacity-building on improving national capabilities to instead defend against cyberthreats. Encouraging states to behave responsibly internally is fundamental to ensuring that they genuinely behave responsibly internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States from the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region have actively participated in debates in the UN and other forums on responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) since these debates began more than two decades ago. Nevertheless, the LAC region still lags behind others on developing a common understanding of what constitutes RCB. There are two reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is an enormous disparity among LAC states regarding cyber capabilities, readiness and response, a disparity that is inextricably linked to unequal levels of development. The International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index 2024, which compares the legal, technical, organisational, capacity-development and cooperation measures in relation to cybersecurity of 194 states across five tiers, includes only one LAC state (Brazil) in the highest tier (“Role-modelling”) and three LAC states (Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay) in the second-highest (“Advancing”), while the rest are widely distributed among the third (“Establishing”) and fourth (“Evolving”) tiers, and one (Antigua and Barbuda) is in the fifth and last tier (“Building”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, amid the particular challenges faced by the region, cybersecurity – understood in its broad sense to include cybersecurity, cyber defence and cybercrime, all three of which require state involvement, albeit at different levels – does not yet seem to be among the priorities of many LAC states. The LAC region represents approximately 8% of the world’s population and 7.3% of global gross domestic product, yet figures from 2023 show 27.3% of LAC’s population (172 million people) living in poverty. Added to these inequalities, LAC “is the most violent region of the world, and violence keeps rising”, with “the number of homicides per person … five times higher than North America, and 10 times [higher] than in Asia”, accounting for “one-third of the world’s total deaths by homicide”. Besides social, domestic and political violence, organised crime has been the primary source of violence in LAC since the early 2000s. High levels of inflation, human rights abuses, political instability, insecurity, corruption and ineffective judicial systems are widespread, with many LAC states ranking among the lowest in the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index. At the interstate regional level, while LAC does not face the same kinds of geopolitical battles and armed conflicts as other regions of the world, political and diplomatic tensions and ruptures among LAC states have increased significantly in the past few years. Considering these challenges, while LAC countries cite a “thirst for development and sustainability … they are often slow to understand the importance of cybersecurity as a pillar for achieving the sustainable and resilient kind of development they seek amid more pressing agendas”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context has meant that many LAC states have not adopted a proactive or preventive approach to cybersecurity. Rather, as signalled by Belisario Contreras, the “key trend” in LAC has been “a reactive approach, where countries strengthen their defences after experiencing attacks”. According to Louise Marie Hurel and Joe Devanny, “it is neither new nor rare for Latin America’s governmental and other sectors to be targeted in cyberspace”, and in fact, “the region faces many of the same cyberthreats as others, ranging from apparently global hackers-for-hire to groups more ostensibly aligned to the interests of specific states with strategic interests in the region”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, highly disruptive cyber incidents have significantly affected government information and interests in the LAC region. For example, in 2021 the Guacamaya hacker group extracted 6 TB of confidential military information from the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense, the largest attack of its kind in Mexico’s history, which had the potential to “cause a collapse of institutions”. In 2022, the Conti group carried out a ransomware campaign against several Costa Rican government entities, stealing and leaking over 600 GB of data, leading Costa Rica to declare a state of emergency. Also in 2022, the BlackCat group carried out a ransomware attack against the Colombian government-owned Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM), one of the largest public energy, water and gas providers in the country, paralysing its operations and online services. These recent incidents have led some LAC states to significantly strengthen their cybersecurity institutions, policies, legislation and technical capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this chapter is to identify, from emerging LAC states’ narratives and practical experience in recent years, a clearer and more concrete understanding of what constitutes RCB for LAC states. More than interpretations, the chapter seeks to provide tangible examples from which to draw lessons for the understanding of RCB. The analysis presented in this chapter is the result of academic research and two workshops held in early 2024 with the participation of leading academics and practitioners from the LAC region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter begins with a focus on the participation in and narrative of LAC states in multilateral forums regarding RCB, particularly in the realms of international law and norms. It then focuses on the recent cyber incident response practice of LAC states, with a particular emphasis on the case study countries of Costa Rica and Colombia. The chapter concludes by identifying, from the emerging narrative and practice, 10 lessons learned that form part of the understanding of RCB in LAC. These cover: confidence-building; institutional and legal frameworks; inter-agency collaboration; collaboration with the private sector; international cooperation; communications strategies; the alignment between states’ national measures and positions in multilateral forums; training and capacity-building for government officials; preventive security measures; and digital literacy and human capital development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;discussions-on-international-law-and-norms-in-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Discussions on International Law and Norms in Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the addition of information security to the agenda in 1998 UN multilateral discussions on RCB have been carried out through the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six Groups of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which convened between 2004 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which convened from 2019 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One OEWG on the security and use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) created for the period 2021 to 2025, the deliberations of which are currently ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, various LAC states have participated actively in these discussions. The 2009–10 GGE’s 15 members included a government expert from Brazil, the 2012–13 GGE’s 15 members included one from Argentina, the 2014–15 GGE’s 20 members were chaired by the Brazilian expert and included experts from Colombia and Mexico, and the 2019–21 GGE, composed of 25 members, was chaired by the Brazilian expert and included two additional experts from Uruguay and Mexico. Various LAC states were also active participants in the discussions of the 2019–21 OEWG and continue to be so in the ongoing discussions of the 2021–25 OEWG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC states have joined the consensus reports recognising that international law is applicable and essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment. This was recognised in the 2013, 2015 and 2021 UN GGE reports and in the 2021 OEWG report, and was reaffirmed by the UN General Assembly. These reports called on states to refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law. They also concluded that further common understandings needed to be developed on how international law applies to state use of ICTs, which remains the subject of ongoing debates in the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further elicit discussion on the issue of the extent to which international law is applicable in cyberspace, besides its report, the 2019–21 GGE produced an official compendium of voluntary national contributions from state experts participating in the GGE, focused specifically on the question of how international law applies to the use of ICTs. Despite the fact that experts from three LAC states participated in that GGE, only Brazil submitted its national contribution to the compendium in 2021, becoming the first LAC state to publish its views on the applicability of international law in cyberspace. This submission was coherent with Brazil’s role as chair of the GGE and was included among a wider set of measures adopted by Brazil to consolidate its cyber diplomacy and strengthen its internal cybersecurity governance structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion continues in the ongoing 2021–25 OEWG, which has called on states to publish official, comprehensive national positions presenting their interpretation as to how, or the extent to which, international law applies in cyberspace, and two regional organisations, the EU (composed of 27 states) and the AU (composed of 55 states), have done so. Among the 193 UN member states, the number is advancing slowly but steadily, yet many states have still to publish their positions. The number of published comprehensive national positions currently includes only three from the LAC region – Brazil, with the above-mentioned submission of 2021; Costa Rica, which published its national position in 2023, likely as part of the measures adopted to strengthen its cyber capabilities and to enter into international cooperation agreements following the Conti attacks; and Cuba, whose comprehensive national position, published in 2024, was built on frequent verbal statements over the years in the OEWG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general terms, and notwithstanding a few differences on specific issues, the positions of Costa Rica and Brazil follow broadly similar lines in their interpretation of the extent to which international law applies in cyberspace. The same may be said for the verbal statements issued by most of the other LAC states, except for Cuba, which seems to stand well apart from the rest of the region on this matter. Table 1 provides a general thematic comparison of the issues contained in the comprehensive national positions published by Brazil, Costa Rica and Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Kpa5s6S.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: General Thematic Comparison of the National Comprehensive Positions on International Law in Cyberspace of Brazil, Costa Rica and Cuba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the reasons for the caution of LAC states about issuing comprehensive national positions have likely been the disparities in cyber capabilities and legal understandings of the topic in the region, added to the low priority given to proactive adoption of cybersecurity frameworks, among other challenges. It may also be the case that this conservative approach represents a strategic political decision by those LAC states to wait and analyse the positions taken by other states, and thus to avoid taking sides unnecessarily in the geopolitical cyber battles of other states in which they are not involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participation of LAC states that have not yet published comprehensive national positions has remained limited to sporadic verbal statements on specific issues in segmented discussions of the OEWG. The frequency of such statements has increased during the past five years. Nonetheless, Maria Pilar Llorens argues that these states face difficulties in adopting a narrative of their own. While, on the one hand, LAC states have called for the development of a distinctly Latin American perspective on the international governance and legal framework of cyberspace, which takes into account, for example, the impact of the cyber capabilities development gap, at the same time, most of their statements rely on narratives and resources produced by states from the Global North and have not brought new, regionally adapted elements to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the discussions on international law, UN processes have also led, over the decades, to the adoption of 11 voluntary norms for RCB, within the realm of the 2013, 2015 and 2021 GGE reports, with guidance on the interpretation and implementation of the agreed norms. These voluntary, non-binding norms contain general recommendations to states on confidence-building measures, capacity-building and cooperation, with the purpose of reducing risks to international peace and security and contributing to conflict prevention through cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the regional level, efforts within the Organization of American States (OAS) have been undertaken to complement (not duplicate) the UN processes. In 2020, the OAS General Assembly adopted a resolution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;reaffirming the applicability of international law to cyberspace and the importance of implementing voluntary, non-binding norms for responsible State behaviour in cyberspace as set forth in the consensus reports of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OAS has also contributed to promoting further cybersecurity understanding, transparency and capacity-building in the Americas. The OAS’s Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (Comité Interamericana contra el Terrorismo, or CICTE) has been carrying out its cybersecurity programme for more than 15 years, through which it assists OAS members in the development of cybersecurity capabilities at the technical and public policy levels. Among other endeavours, it assists in the development of national cybersecurity strategies, prepares regional reports and publications, and provides training to public and private officials, as well as students, on cybersecurity and cyber operations. Under this programme, the Network of Government Cyber Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) of the OAS members, known as the CSIRTAmericas Network, promotes the exchange of information on cybersecurity threats, provides technical assistance to strengthen CSIRT services, and offers training to cybersecurity specialists in the CSIRTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, since 2017, OAS member states have agreed, within CICTE’s Working Group on Cooperation and Confidence-Building Measures in Cyberspace, on 11 confidence-building measures to promote increased cooperation, transparency, predictability and stability among states of the Americas in the use of cyberspace. These include providing information on national cybersecurity policies, identifying a national point of contact at the political level to discuss the implications of hemispheric cyberthreats, strengthening capacity-building and training, exchanging best practices, and fostering multistakeholder dialogue and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, the OAS’s Inter-American Juridical Committee (IAJC) started working on international law and cyberspace in 2018, with a view to contributing to further transparency on how American states understand the application of international law to cyberspace. The results of a questionnaire distributed to OAS members were published in an IAJC report in 2020. Among its conclusions, the report reaffirmed the wide disparities among regional states in terms of technical capabilities and legal expertise on the subject, as well as internal institutional challenges, such as a lack of clarity in the assignment of responsibility for cyber issues among the authorities within each state, and a lack of inter-institutional dialogue between internal authorities that could directly or indirectly involve cyber issues. The IAJC organised a training session for OAS member states in 2022 and published another report in that year on the main processes, resources and legal issues involved when discussing the applicability of international law to cyberspace, to serve as a guide to support LAC states in preparing their comprehensive national positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These international and regional multilateral discussions on international law and norms are all applicable to cyberspace and are particularly relevant in view of the fact that to date, there is no specific international or regional binding treaty applicable to LAC states that is exclusively dedicated to RCB. Unlike other regions, LAC states are not part of a regional military alliance governed by common, binding norms to respond collectively to cyberthreats. There are only a few specific chapters or clauses on, or related to, cybersecurity in other more general treaties and instruments to which some LAC states are party, such as the examples illustrated Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EBn1KRG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Selected Instruments Applicable to LAC States with Sections on Cybersecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these examples, a comprehensive normative perspective of what constitutes RCB for LAC must take into account both the dedicated multilateral discussions that are evolving in the UN and the OAS, and the specific provisions on cybersecurity contained in treaties on other issues, such as trade or data protection. As evidenced above, these specific provisions to date focus mainly on strengthening the capabilities of CSIRTs and the international cooperation among them, as well as on adopting security safeguards for data protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-cyber-incident-responses-by-lac-states&quot;&gt;Recent Cyber Incident Responses by LAC States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the evolving nature of the normative discussions on RCB in the multilateral arena, a correct understanding of what constitutes RCB needs to consider lessons learned from existing state practice. As indicated in previous sections, the LAC region has faced serious challenges in the past few years in relation to cyber incidents. As Hurel notes, “the year 2022 was in many ways a wake-up call for countries in the region and a reminder of both old and emerging threats”. According to Cecilia Tornaghi, the digital transformation in the region following the Covid-19 pandemic, involving considerable innovation in areas such as fintech and e-commerce, “has not been matched by efforts and investments to keep digital systems safe”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines two serious cyber incidents that affected Costa Rica and Colombia in 2022 and analyses the state responses, as presented by state experts during the workshops held in preparation for this chapter. By incorporating lessons learned from state practice into a normative approach, this section seeks to offer a fuller understanding of what RCB means in practice for the LAC region, as well as how incident responders perceive RCB in moments of large-scale cyber crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, Costa Rica suffered a severe ransomware attack by the Conti and Hive groups, both reportedly based in the Russian Federation. The attack started on 11 April, when the groups gained access to the Ministry of Finance. This soon allowed them to access other government agencies, including the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications and the National Meteorological Institution. In total, the attack affected 33 institutions in the country. The Conti group demanded $10 million from the Costa Rican government in exchange for not releasing any of the stolen information on the dark web. The government refused to pay, labelling the hackers “terrorist groups”, as a result of which Conti uploaded approximately 672 GB of data from various government agencies to its leak site. The effects of the attack continued for several months until the end of June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack occurred three weeks before the new president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves, took office. As described in the workshops, this was an institutional challenge in itself for the Costa Rican government, because, as it was the end of an administration, there was no budget left to respond to the attack. On 8 May, the first day of his presidency, Chaves officially declared a state of emergency in Costa Rica, indicating that the attack was unprecedented in the country, had crippled the government’s ability to operate and had affected the national economy, because it disrupted tax collection and exposed citizens’ personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysing the government’s response strategy to the attack, as described during the second workshop, the following successes can be identified:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inter-agency cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Incumbent president Carlos Alvarado established a working group in April with the participation of the relevant government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multistakeholder participation:&lt;/strong&gt; Contacts were made with the private sector to evaluate, from a multisector perspective, how best to detect and contain the incident. The government received technical assistance from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; A communications strategy was adopted: on the first day, political and technical groups were created, and a press release was published; over the next two days, press conferences by ministers were held; on the third day, a message from new Costa Rican president Rodrigo Chaves was issued. From the fourth day, a daily press conference was established, accompanied by a press release and a video from which the media could extract the key messages. A protocol for communications was adopted in order to avoid disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Formal and informal international cooperation with states and computer emergency response teams (CERTs) in other countries was sought. Formal cooperation agreements were signed by Costa Rica with Spain, Estonia and Israel, which proved to be very useful. Israel and Spain, together with the US, helped Costa Rica to restore its services. The country also received donations of money and incident response teams from various countries that were deployed to Costa Rica, in addition to the collaboration of intelligence services (including the FBI and Israeli intelligence). The US has since “announced plans to provide $25 million in assistance to establish a cybersecurity operations centre by 2026”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing best practices:&lt;/strong&gt; Costa Rica has now shared its best practices with other states to promote the adoption of preventive measures in preparation for a cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these actions, by the second week of the attacks, the detection and containment measures had started to work, and by the third week they were complete. The US State Department offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the identification of persons in a leadership position within Conti. As indicated in the Cyberlaw Toolkit, Hive was eventually shut down in January 2023 following a coordinated effort by Europol and the German, Dutch and US authorities. Multisector communication and cooperation, both among national agencies and internationally, emerge from this case as essential components that shape RCB at the domestic level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colombia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Colombia in December 2022, EPM, one of the largest public energy, water and gas providers in the country, owned by the district of Medellín and providing services to 123 municipalities, suffered a severe BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware attack. The attack also affected AMBITCO, a financial company, and the Universidad Piloto de Colombia, a private university. The attack affected the delivery of water and energy services and electronic payments, and created a loss of confidence in digital environments. For two weeks, these services were totally inoperative, and it took approximately 30 days to recover them. In response to the incident, the Colombian government received assistance from the Spanish multinational private company Indra; however, as stated by a government official during the workshops, help did not arrive until 36 hours after the incident began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not the first serious cyber attack against a state institution in Colombia in 2022. In February, the servers of the Colombian National Food and Drug Surveillance Institute was subject to a cyber attack from BlackByte. The impact of this attack included the blocking of movement of food, medicine and raw materials; logistics cost overruns of 35% to 40%; an increase in food prices; and, as noted by government officials during the workshops, a loss of public confidence in the authorities responsible for vigilance and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the seriousness of these cyber incidents, Colombia’s capacity to respond does not seem to have significantly strengthened in their aftermath. A year later, in September 2023, the Ransomhouse hacker group launched a cyber attack against IFX Networks, a cloud service provider, which affected at least 50 Colombian state entities, including the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and the Superior Council of the Judiciary, as well as private entities and the supply chains of technological service providers. The attack also affected authorities in Chile and Panama. In fact, Ransomhouse itself informed Chile’s CSIRT, which in turn informed the relevant Colombian authorities. A total of 300 machines were rendered unusable in the Colombian Ministry of Health, obstructing the provision of critical health services. The attack also affected agricultural services and, as stated by government officials in the workshops, again provoked a loss of confidence in digital environments. The affected systems were completely down for about two weeks, and took around 30 days to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike those of Costa Rica, Colombia’s responses seem to have lacked fluency in terms of inter-agency and international communication and cooperation, and it appears that the country also lacked a wider network of multistakeholder partners to assist the state in ensuring a swifter and more effective response to the incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparison between the cyber incidents in Costa Rica and Colombia shows the difference that a strengthened and coordinated national response can make in terms of prevention. From the analysis of both cases by the LAC experts who participated in the workshops, the following lessons are drawn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence-building:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber incidents erode society’s trust in institutions. It is essential to continuously implement confidence-building measures in order to counter this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional and legal frameworks:&lt;/strong&gt; Institutional and legal frameworks for responding to cyber incidents should cover not only public safety threats but also national security threats in the cyber realm, to ensure adequate response against cyber incidents affecting states’ infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inter-agency collaboration mechanisms:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber incident responses in the LAC region have evidenced a problem of disarticulation among the various government agencies involved in dealing with cyberthreats within each state, and a lack of formal mechanisms for dialogue and coordination. LAC states should establish long-term inter-agency cooperation and coordination mechanisms for cyber incident response. Participants should include both public safety and national security institutions, as well as national and foreign policy institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation with the private sector:&lt;/strong&gt; The private sector is willing and able to help governments in incident response. Collaboration from the tech industry has proven to be key, particularly in view of LAC states’ limited resources. Governments should build and maintain communications channels with the private sector. In turn, companies should ensure that their assistance is provided swiftly and without undue delay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; International cooperation with states and CSIRTs of other countries, particularly from the LAC region, has proven to be highly useful when responding to cyber incidents. As identified by Contreras, a “significant trend is the strength of international collaboration, with Latin American nations actively engaging in global dialogues and partnerships to strengthen cybersecurity measures”. Formal cooperation agreements should be adopted by states to provide a solid framework for the assistance. In addition, informal cooperation channels and personal contacts among cyber authorities and experts of different states are of great help when faced with a cyber incident, and should be encouraged and nurtured through networking meetings, forums and associations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber incidents in the region have evidenced that LAC states’ laws and policies lack uniformity on what information must be shared, and with which actors, when responding to a cyber incident. LAC states should put in place strong communications strategies specifically designed to deal with cyber incidents. These strategies should include defining the teams and authorities involved in the response, key messages, an institutional protocol for communications, the ways in which interactions will be carried out with the media, and the spokespersons and measures needed to prevent disinformation. In addition, the strategy should manage public information and statistics, be transparent, and define and show “quick wins” when these are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment between states’ national measures and positions in multilateral forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Many LAC states face a dissociation between their discourse at the international level and their incident response at the domestic level. LAC states’ strategies for strengthening their cyber capabilities and frameworks at the domestic level should include positioning their views coherently within UN forums.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training and capacity-building for government officials:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a “revolving door” phenomenon whereby the rotation of certain public officers as a result of changes in government administrations results in a loss of knowledge and a lack of continuity of cybersecurity policies. To avoid this, states must ensure continuous training and capacity-building efforts in relation to new teams in charge of cybersecurity policy and cyber incident response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive security measures:&lt;/strong&gt; States must always put in place and periodically update security measures in their technological infrastructure in order to control vulnerabilities. Moreover, they should encourage continued investment in cybersecurity infrastructure and technologies, including cloud solutions and security software, to defend against emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital literacy, human capital development and education:&lt;/strong&gt; States should continually encourage digital literacy and carry out efforts to bridge the digital divide in their societies. Research shows that “investing in talent and culture around cybersecurity is a foundational step that can drive maturity, resilience and risk reduction over time, benefiting organizations and citizens alike”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The understanding of what constitutes RCB in the LAC region is complex and evolving. From the normative side, apart from some specific provisions on CSIRT capabilities and international cooperation, and on data protection contained in some trade and data protection treaties to which LAC states are party, there is no international or regional binding treaty specifically devoted to RCB applicable to LAC states. Most LAC states accept the applicability of the voluntary, non-binding norms and measures adopted in multilateral forums for RCB, as well as the applicability of international law in cyberspace. However, only three out of the 33 LAC states have, to date, published national positions on the extent to which international law applies in cyberspace. This low number reflects the wide disparity in technical capabilities and legal preparedness among LAC states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this situation is starting to change. Faced with significant cyber attacks in recent years, LAC states have been forced to shift from a relatively dormant state in terms of cyber incident and response, to an active, hands-on approach in response to specific cyber incidents that have affected them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The understanding of RCB in LAC is now shaped by important lessons learned. Confidence-building, strong institutional and legal frameworks, effective inter-agency and international collaboration, strong cooperation with the private sector, an effective communications strategy, alignment in national and foreign policy, capacity-building, preventive security measures and digital literacy have emerged as essential components of RCB in the LAC region. While the normative approach advances slowly in the region, the practical approach to RCB seems to be advancing at a much quicker pace. Seen together, both approaches help inform the nascent regional understanding of RCB in the LAC region as a tool for further strengthening cyber capabilities there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitalisation processes have been vastly accelerated in various countries across the Middle East and Africa in recent years. This can be seen in the growing investment in digital infrastructure by governments, telecommunication companies, tech start-ups and world tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and Apple. In several countries in the Middle East, huge investments are being directed to the building of smart cities, growing the digital health market and supporting an expanding e-commerce market that is projected to be worth more than $3.45 billion by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, studies show that information and communication technology (ICT) projects in Africa increased from 93 projects worth $3.7 billion in 2003–05 to 464 projects worth $23.5 billion in 2018–20. These developments have largely been accompanied by widening disparities within and across countries, adding a digital layer to socioeconomic inequalities. For instance, most of the growth in mobile internet adoption in the Middle East is in high-income countries (such as, the UAE, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia), whereas in lower-income countries, particularly those affected by conflicts (such as Libya, Yemen and Syria), users face low-speed internet and loss of connectivity for long periods. Data also shows that 61% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa live within range of broadband but do not use it, and that Africa as a whole has one of the widest digital gender gaps in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These digitalisation processes have also resulted in a remarkably challenging cyberthreat landscape. For example, according to an IBM report conducted on companies in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, their cost of data breach was the second-highest in the world in 2023, after the US, with an average cost of $8.07 million. African countries are experiencing an alarming increase in the number of cyber incidents, particularly those targeting businesses. For instance, Kenya, one of the leading countries in Africa in terms of access to digital infrastructure, experienced 860 million cyber incidents in 2022 alone, increasing from 7.7 million in 2017. It is thus no surprise that more attention is now being directed towards cyber governance and the need for cooperation to develop regulations, strategies and specialised institutions to address cybersecurity needs in the Middle East and Africa. These efforts have been well documented and analysed by literature and reports in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one important aspect of cyber governance remains largely under-explored in policy and academic circles: the conceptualisation of, practices relating to, and discussions on “responsibility” in cyberspace in the Middle East and Africa. In most cybersecurity literature, the issue of responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) is discussed in the context of the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security. These are platforms in which many countries in the Middle East and Africa are not necessarily active, and they remain primarily dominated by the superpowers. This is not to suggest that there is an absence of discussions on responsibility in these regions; rather, it indicates different prioritisation and conceptualisation of what RCB should entail or address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas responsibility in Western discourse is more focused on state-launched or state-backed cyber attacks targeting other states, the focus in many countries in the Middle East and Africa is on combating cybercrime by non-state actors as a key challenge facing the digital economy – as shown in this chapter. “State responsibility” may refer to building capacities to detect and mitigate cybercrimes, due diligence or raising awareness. Importantly, in these two regions, many discussions that are relevant to the concept and practice of RCB do not happen on conventional diplomatic platforms, but rather are driven by several institutions, policies and intra-regional (rather than cross-regional) agreements that focus more on cyber governance than on “norms” per se. Further, scrutiny of state behaviour in cyberspace is often pushed forward by civil society organisations, aimed at holding governments accountable as part of a larger framework of respecting human rights and individual freedoms. All such developments take place in challenging geopolitical contexts that may slow progress on reaching agreements on a specific meaning of “responsibility”. The fact that, at the time of writing, more than 45 armed conflicts are taking place in the Middle East and North Africa, while Africa has the second-highest number of armed conflicts of any region in the world, challenges prospects for increasing cooperation within and among countries to develop unified “national” or “regional” perspectives on cybersecurity issues more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, this chapter seeks to address the aforementioned gap in research and analysis by developing regionally grounded understandings of RCB in practice. This is achieved in two ways: through desk-based research on regional dynamics and countries’ perspectives and responses to evolving cybersecurity challenges, and through targeted workshops with local and international cybersecurity experts focusing on countries in the Middle East and Africa. The chapter reflects and builds on the viewpoints of academics and practitioners in the Middle East and Africa, which were collated in three online workshops run in December 2023 and January 2024 by RUSI’s Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB). The key question on which the discussions in these workshops were based was: what does RCB mean to this region from a practical perspective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a regional composition that reflects the GP-RCB’s regional structure, the chapter aims to outline key themes, research areas and questions that will inform future research on countries in the Middle East and Arica. The chapter acknowledges the complex and extensive political and socioeconomic differences between countries in these regions, and highlights the need for separate analysis in future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the chapter aims to introduce perspectives that go beyond the obvious “big players” in the Middle East and Africa, be they Israel or Iran, Kenya or Nigeria. Although it acknowledges the prominent roles these countries play in digital spaces and their influence on regional cybersecurity discussions, the chapter addresses gaps in the literature and develops the research on RCB by shifting the analysis beyond the major powers. The aim is to create more space for other significant actors who may be under-represented in research and analysis on RCB. Accordingly, in workshop discussions, two important case studies appeared as relevant starting points for analysis: the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the AU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of these two case studies was made inductively following the first workshop, in which both organisations were highlighted as significant players in current cybersecurity governance efforts in their respective regions. There are many big players in the Middle East, making it difficult to offer a comprehensive understanding of the entire region, given scope, research design and space limitations. Added to this is the problematic – and inherently contested – concept of the “Middle East” as a “region” as such, which masks differences among countries. The GCC was chosen as a case study due to the status that its countries enjoy in technology leadership, both in the Middle East and around the world. As James Shires argues, “the Middle East” has a different connotation in the world of cybersecurity from that which it has in general international relations literature, with most of the Middle East events and conferences that tackle cybersecurity centred on the GCC countries. The AU, meanwhile, has been playing a major role in cybersecurity governance and digital policy in Africa since the adoption of the AU Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection in 2014. Despite the various persistent challenges to developing a “common” position on, or approach to, responsibility in Africa, as discussed later in the chapter, the AU has managed to institutionalise many of its initiatives, which warrants further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this chapter, therefore, is to identify areas where understandings of responsibility or (un)acceptable state behaviour have been prominent in existing cyber governance initiatives or state cyber practices; areas where the development of such understandings at the national, bilateral or regional levels is impeded or challenged; and areas where opportunities for advancing responsibility in governing cybersecurity can be realised. The chapter is divided into three sections. The first analyses the peculiarities of RCB in the Middle East and Africa as a dimension of the efforts to govern cybersecurity and cyberspace within complex political and geopolitical contexts. The second and third sections consider the specificities of the two case studies, the GCC and the AU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-behaviour-through-a-regional-lens&quot;&gt;Responsible Cyber Behaviour Through a Regional Lens&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main conclusions emerging from workshop discussions was that international debates on RCB mostly assume that the key threats to address are those engendered by states or by the most sophisticated cyber actors targeting other countries – a view that does not necessarily reflect perceptions in the Global South. As noted by participants, in many countries in the Middle East and Africa, the question of RCB is primarily triggered by domestic politics – for example, states’ use of cyber tools against citizens, or the abuse of certain technologies. In such cases, it is mostly civil society organisations that trigger conversations on holding states accountable for any abuse of their cyber power. The cyberthreat landscape is slightly different too, with cybercrimes such as business email compromise, ransomware and phishing being seen as the most important in cybersecurity discussions in these regions. As many studies show, unlike advanced economies, emerging economies must develop novel policies and institutions to address cyberthreats, particularly those targeting the financial sector. This poses various policy challenges, given the limited cyber capacities, human capital and financial resources of many such countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking specifically at Middle East states’ perspectives, RCB appears to be primarily approached in terms of building state capabilities to detect and mitigate cyberthreats. Many countries have been persistently building their cyber capabilities, passing laws aimed at securing internet communications (for example, around 13 Arab countries have enacted some form of cybercrime or computer crime law), and establishing national cyber incident response protocols. The idea of using such capabilities “responsibly” has been largely tied to protecting national security interests. For example, the UAE was one of the first countries in the region to cooperate with allies, including the US and the UK, in order to establish its National Electronic Security Authority and to develop a national cyber strategy. Such efforts specifically linked building the state’s cyber capabilities and intelligence-gathering with defence against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of responsibility from states’ perspective, as discussed in the Middle East workshop, can be seen in external engagement with partners on cyber governance initiatives. Although the participation of Middle Eastern countries in UN forums such as the GGE has generally been sporadic, and only four countries from the region are signatories to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey), there have been other notable efforts to solidify external engagement and combat cybercrime. In 2010, for instance, the Arab League issued the Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences, with the aim of strengthening cooperation between states to defend against cybercrimes. Egypt has been particularly active in internet governance initiatives and in the World Summit for Information Society (WSIS). Following resolutions issued at the WSIS, the Arab Internet Governance Forum (Arab IGF) was established in 2012 to monitor developments relating to internet governance in the region; it has since hosted various meetings, including in Kuwait in 2012, Algeria in 2013, Beirut in 2014 and 2015, and Cairo in 2020. Similarly, through negotiations with Oman, Saudi Arabia gave funding to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to establish the Arab Region Cybersecurity Centre in 2013 in order to enhance regional cooperation. Most recently, the Arab League announced the formation of the Council of Arab Ministers of Cybersecurity, proposed by Saudi Arabia, with Riyadh approved as the headquarters. The Council will have the mission of developing strategies and initiatives to enhance Arab collective efforts on cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, information operations have been integral to cybersecurity approaches in the Middle East region. Several information campaigns to influence public opinion or push forward certain narratives have been repeatedly launched by governments, including in Iran, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Further, cybersecurity infrastructure that enables mass surveillance and solidifies government control over information has been widely adopted as part of states’ responsibility to combat “terrorism” and protect national security. This was particularly heightened during the Arab uprising in 2011, when many governments increased their control over cyberspace and broadened their use of digital surveillance tools. Such policies are widely adopted, particularly for monitoring social media. For example, in 2019, the Turkish government accused voices on social media critical of its military operation in Syria of “terrorism” and subjected them to detention, criminal investigations and travel bans. This approach is reflected in cybercrime laws in the region, as many include provisions that limit free speech online. In 2023, for example, Jordan adopted a new – heavily criticised – cybercrime law that increases government control over online content and criminalises posts that promote “immorality”, demonstrate “contempt for religion” or undermine “national unity”. Such practices create an environment of mistrust in government initiatives and impede prospects for stakeholder engagement in developing a coherent national, bilateral or regional approach to RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prospects for cooperation on cyber governance are further challenged by the complexities of the geopolitical context. The Middle East has been riddled with various geopolitical conflicts and rifts that are persistently reflected in cyberspace. This is particularly true in the case of Iran and its long-standing rivalry with Israel and many Arab countries. Several attacks have been widely attributed to the Iranian government since the targeting of the Saudi company Aramco in 2012. For example, in 2020, Iran was accused of launching a cyber attack on water utility networks in Israel and the UAE, leading to what the media labelled a retaliatory measure from Israel, which allegedly hacked into the Iranian port of Shahid Rajaee, one of the country’s most important logistics hubs, disrupting its operations. Several other carefully calibrated attacks have been launched against Iran, including those by Predatory Sparrow, a hacking group believed to be linked to Israel. The threat that Iran poses to many countries in the region has historically played a major role in Arab–Israeli rapprochement and was one of the driving forces behind the 2020 Abraham Accords, the bilateral agreements on Arab–Israeli normalisation signed by Israel and several countries in the region, including Bahrain, the UAE, Morocco and Sudan. Intra-state conflicts have similarly been spilling into the cyber world, through non-state groups or militias that repeatedly target governments, including Cyber Hezbollah, the Syrian Electronic Army and the Yemen Cyber Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is slightly different in Africa, as it is widely believed that many African countries lack the technical capacity to develop sophisticated tools for offensive cyber operations. This comes with a few exceptions, however, including reports about the Moroccan government hacking the phones of Algerian politicians using Pegasus spyware in 2021. What has been extensively reported is states’ use of cyber espionage to target political dissidents, either abroad, such as in operations conducted by the government of Ethiopia, or domestically, as in the case of Uganda. Matters are complicated by the presence of multiple intra-state armed conflicts in the region, including those in Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia and Mali. Many countries have pushed for responsibility in relation to preventing advanced economies from using offensive cyber tools to target other states. Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt are among those that have voiced concerns about many countries’ growing militarisation of ICTs and stockpiling of vulnerabilities (keeping software and hardware vulnerabilities that are unknown to vendors for future use), and have demanded more transparency in reporting such vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many disparities in technical capacities, political structures and legislative frameworks in African countries that cast a shadow over their ability to coordinate RCB standards. Some, such as Mauritius and Tanzania, stand out as leaders in cybersecurity, through their engagement in cross-border collaborations, investments in ICT infrastructure and active computer emergency response teams. Other countries, however, either do not have sufficient economic or technical capacities to prioritise cybersecurity, or are crippled by political instability and armed conflicts that hinder cybersecurity initiatives. Such disparities make harmonisation of standards and practices of cyber governance a challenge. Added to this are disparities in approaches to external partners, with some countries aligning with Russia and China, and others leaning towards partners in the West. This warrants further research to see how the positions of Middle Eastern and African countries might differ from other countries playing the same manoeuvring strategy between superpowers, for example India and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenging nature of developing a harmonised regional approach to cyber governance, subregions and subregional organisations have been making progress in coordinating their efforts. These include the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the East African Community (EAC), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). The role played by these communities helps in developing frameworks and directives that address the question of responsibility. One notable example was the ruling by the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice that Togo’s decision to shut down the internet amid protests against the government in 2017 was illegal and a breach of citizens’ freedom of expression. The court also ruled that Nigeria’s seven-month Twitter ban in 2021 was illegal and that the government must amend a controversial section in its cybercrime law that is widely believed to harm freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, some states have been implementing unilateral or bilateral initiatives on cybersecurity cooperation. One example of this is the collaboration between Togo and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) to host the first African heads of state Cybersecurity Summit in 2022, which culminated in the Lomé Declaration on cybersecurity. This declaration signified a commitment from more than 27 countries in the region to foster cybersecurity initiatives. Kenya has also been playing a leading role in East Africa to promote and advance cyber governance. Added to this are other non-state and multistakeholder platforms that have been pushing for responsibility issues, including the Africa Internet Governance Forum (AfIGF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous capacity-building projects directed towards Africa that experts believe should be geared towards ensuring implementation, accountability and responsibility, rather than the current focus on training alone. The Council of Europe, for example, on the basis of mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs), is committed to capacity-building in Nigeria and is working with the Ministry of Justice to revise the cybercrime legal framework that has been questioned by the ECOWAS court. This is a subtle approach to demanding accountability where capacity-building is strategically directed at enhancing RCB rather than at trainings alone, which do not contextualise cyber capacity-building to local needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, several constraints were outlined in the Africa workshop discussions that limit progress on issues of responsibility in various ways. First, these constraints impede the development of rules, legislation and institutions to address the question of RCB, domestically and regionally. Second, they challenge the formation of coherent, regional cybersecurity positions that would counter the dominant, often Western-centric narratives on cyber norms and RCB. Third, even within each region, it is often difficult to translate regional, multilateral initiatives into national implementation and priorities. These constraints, as well as potential cooperation enablers, are discussed further in the next two sections, with the GCC and the AU as case studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-gulf-cooperation-council&quot;&gt;The Gulf Cooperation Council&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions on and interest in cyber governance have been growing rapidly in the GCC in recent years. Even during a temporary paralysis of cooperation due to a rift between the UAE and Qatar as part of what is often called the “diplomatic crisis” of 2017–21 – initiated mostly after reports indicated that the UAE government had allegedly hacked into the Qatari state news agency – discussions at technical levels continued. Hence, after a long period of inactivity in UN processes and ad hoc committees, most GCC countries are now developing strong national coherence, statements and positions to articulate their cybersecurity approaches. For example, the national cybersecurity authorities in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have international diplomacy departments that have been vocal on cybersecurity issues. Both institutions have also recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance joint cooperation. This was followed by Qatar announcing the launch of its National Cybersecurity Strategy 2024–2030. Further, there is a growing projection of national cybersecurity capability on the global stage through multiple platforms, including the Global Cybersecurity Forum held in Riyadh and the GISEC Global Conference held in Dubai, in which various global partners participate to share knowledge and know-how on cybersecurity-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an organisational level, there have been multiple efforts to institutionalise cybersecurity initiatives and foster cooperation among countries in the region. This can be seen in the establishment of the Permanent Committee and Ministerial Committee for Cybersecurity in the GCC, aimed at enhancing cooperation and developing joint policies and procedures to address cyberthreats. There are also growing efforts at collaboration with other external allies, including the US, the UK and the EU. This can be seen, for example, in the convening of the GCC–US working group specialising in cybersecurity, whose establishment was endorsed in a security-related ministerial workgroup with both sides. The same goes for negotiations between the GCC and the UK on a free-trade agreement, which would have significant implications for fostering security cooperation between the two parties – especially on cybersecurity, a key area in negotiations thus far. Moreover, a recent high-level forum between the GCC and the EU on regional security and cooperation included cybersecurity as one of five key areas of proposed cooperation. This is part of bigger security cooperation initiatives such as the establishment of the Gulf Academy for Strategic and Security Studies as an affiliate of the GCC, based in the UAE, with the goal of providing cybersecurity training to GCC leaders and developing shared understanding on security issues in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key issues have been receiving the most attention from GCC countries. The first is the protection of critical national infrastructure (CNI), a response to multiple cyber attacks that targeted CNI sectors in the region, particularly the oil and gas industries. The second is information sharing on social media and the extent to which it challenges state sovereignty. Since 2011, there have been an increasing number of arbitrary arrests and travel bans imposed on critics and activists in the Gulf region, and a growing crackdown on online expression. Governments’ punitive actions in relation to what they label “fake news” as part of their cybercrime laws are likely to remain a divisive issue. This is further complicated by GCC governments’ increasing engagement with problematic private actors, which diminishes the prospect of civil society involvement in defining government responsibility. For example, numerous reports have been published about the use by the governments of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Oman of Pegasus spyware, developed by Israeli company NSO Group, to target activists. Another prominent case is that of the UAE company, Dark Matter, which recruited former intelligence operatives from the US and Israel to launch espionage operations targeting other governments and human rights activists. As a response, discussions in both the Middle East and Africa workshops emphasised the importance of civil society initiatives, which have been increasingly active in creating fact-checking pages to target misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms, advocating for women’s rights, campaigning to boycott certain private sector companies, and making a general push for legislation in support of human rights and freedom of speech in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in discussions with experts in the GCC workshop, many GCC governments regulate technology markets and invest heavily in technology companies and incubators. Governments are already pushing entrepreneurs to invest some of those funds in securing their software and hardware products. Therefore, the question of responsibility for governments’ direct investment choices is important to explore, given their powerful role. This could be a potential area of collaboration, particularly when such investments are directed towards or received from foreign companies, whether American, Russian, Chinese or from other countries. Such collaboration must, however, take into consideration the substantial differences among GCC countries in terms of cyber capabilities, readiness, diplomatic efforts and general awareness of cybersecurity issues, which result in continuous competition. As outlined at the Middle East workshop discussions, such disparities can be seen, for instance, in the relationship between the GCC countries and global technology companies. Major cloud and social media companies see the region as a very attractive market, but their offerings in terms of infrastructure and R&amp;amp;D vary across countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note too that the prospect of economic cooperation as a driver for more collaborative cybersecurity governance, whether among GCC countries or between the AU and other countries in the Middle East, is complicated by the geopolitical situation. In June 2023, the UAE’s cybersecurity chief said at the Cyber Week Conference in Tel Aviv, “Thank God for the Abraham Accords”. This signified the willingness of the UAE to maximise its cooperation with Israel on cybersecurity matters, predominantly in combating threats from Iran as a common “enemy”. However, the Abraham Accords have since been challenged by the war in Gaza. For example, Saudi Arabia has declared that it will not establish ties with Israel before the latter ends its war in Gaza, nor before an independent Palestinian state is established – how this would affect the state of cybersecurity in the region is a question that remains. The use of high-tech and automated weapons in Gaza, either for targeting or surveillance, will likely have regional and global implications for the conversation on RCB more generally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-african-union&quot;&gt;The African Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, various AU initiatives have demonstrated the significance of cybersecurity in the region’s policy agenda to foster the digital economy and improve internet access and availability. The Digital Transformation Strategy 2020–2030 is a case in point, in which the AU Commission identified cybersecurity, privacy and personal data protection as some of the cross-cutting themes for digital transformation to achieve prosperity and inclusivity. In addition, cyber governance has been approached as fundamental to economic growth and the eradication of poverty, as part of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement. The Policy and Regulation Initiative for Digital Africa, a joint initiative among the AU, the EU and the ITU, is another important initiative that solidifies cooperation and conversations with international partners on RCB. Most recently, the AU’s Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection, also known as the Malabo Convention, entered into force in July 2023, signed by only 16 countries, nine years after it was adopted. Although it remains unratified by most AU countries, the Malabo Convention offers a basis for instigating a discussion on RCB, through its reaffirmation of a commitment to international human rights conventions – fundamental in the UN context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of state responsibility, the AU has taken a primarily informal and indirect approach, framed around the application of the international law on cyberspace. For instance, in November 2022, the AU’s Peace and Security Council (PSC) acknowledged for the first time the applicability of international law to cyberspace, noting that “the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law are also applicable to cyberspace”. Most recently, in January 2024, the PSC adopted the Common African Position on the Application of International Law to the Use of ICTs in Cyberspace, which stresses respect for the territorial sovereignty of states, the prohibition of the use of force or intervention in states’ affairs, and the obligation to combat malicious conduct in cyberspace by non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing the digital economy, and particularly fintech, is one of the key areas where common understanding has been developed. For example, 44 countries signed up to the African Continental Free Trade Area in 2018 with the purpose of facilitating digital trade in Africa – including cybersecurity and online safety. Another promising initiative in this regard is the Smart Africa alliance, which includes 39 countries and is aimed at accelerating sustainable development in Africa through the use of ICTs. As noted by participants in the Africa workshop, the alliance has been promoting important projects, including the bulk purchase of wholesale submarine and satellite internet bandwidth, along with several other joint investments. Such initiatives do not reflect a “traditional” UN interpretation of RCB seen through an international peace and security lens, but they are likely to push all governments to engage in reaching a common or shared understanding of how responsibility – when seen through the lens of development in a digital economy that includes security (of data and systems) – can also refer to the responsibility to invest collectively in efforts to secure cross-border connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of global cooperation, multiple initiatives hold promise, including cooperation with law enforcement agencies in countries of the Global North by sharing information. Initiatives between Interpol and Afripol (the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation), which have launched an operation to combat cybercrime in 25 African countries, are an important example. It is important to note here, however, and as highlighted by expert conversations in the workshops, that any cooperation for information sharing with governments in the West should be done within MLATs to make sure that the obligation to share information goes both ways and does not only benefit one side. Such treaties could themselves be used to share best practices among participating states and to foster conversations on RCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts pointed out a general disconnect between researchers and policymakers in many countries in Africa. This problem is twofold. On one side, there is not enough research-enabling data, particularly regarding government practices, or clear communication of government priorities. On the other, there are not enough calls from governments for researchers to be involved in agenda-setting on cybersecurity issues, due either to a lack of infrastructure or platforms that would help translate research into policymaking processes, or to a lack of desire on the part of governments to listen to researchers on this matter. The participation of civil society in such conversations is also impeded by various issues, including a lack of technical knowledge and funding, and some governments’ perception that any external funding to such organisations could present a national security risk. Many civil society organisations view governments’ reluctance to share information as a form of opposition to stakeholder engagement, which complicates engagement even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, many government practices have set “negative norms” that stifle stakeholder engagement, especially internet shutdowns. Data shows that in 2022 alone, seven African governments shut down their internet nine times, four of which were during political protests. There has also been some targeting of particular social media platforms; this includes Uganda blocking Facebook in advance of a contentious general election, and Nigeria’s ban on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important challenge to developing shared understanding on RCB is that of the deep disparities among AU countries, whether historical, political or cultural. This is one reason why workshop participants partially believed that it is difficult for the AU to argue that it is speaking on behalf of the entire region or to assume there is a common “African” position on cybersecurity matters. Expert discussions revealed, however, that over the years, some technical and operational teams – for example, CERTs – have managed to foster cooperation through informal information-sharing channels, building elements of trust among themselves even when governments have not been responsive to such efforts. Workshop participants noted that the subregion of Central Africa has an advantage in this regard, as its regulations for digital financial systems, for example, are set by a central regulator. This means that no country can choose not to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing general conclusions across two markedly different “regions” is undoubtedly challenging, particularly when attempting to analyse them within a single study. The purpose of this chapter has been to identify key themes and questions for further research that can deepen understanding of how RCB manifests uniquely across regions and countries, rather than to present a definitive overview of RCB in the Middle East and Africa. The approach shifts the focus from “cyber norms”, which are primarily studied within Western-centric frameworks, to looking closely at examples from the Global South, where diverse practices, policies and institutions have been established to enhance cyber governance. Examining such practices provides important insights into how different actors may view (un)acceptable state behaviour in cyberspace, even if the concept of “responsibility” as such is not used. As highlighted in the chapter, regional (and subregional) bodies have an important role to play as enablers for the discussion on RCB – a discussion that they thereby hold on their own terms, focusing on topics such as development, combating cybercrime and protecting CNI, while also addressing important elements of UN commitments, such as international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as was emphasised in workshop discussions, one reason why many countries in Africa and the Middle East have been reluctant to participate in international norm processes is the institutional perception that the discussion on cyber issues has matured to a degree that any participation in agenda-setting would be considered a late arrival. It is becoming increasingly difficult for many governments to grapple with the speed of innovations and developments in technology, and discussions on responsibility may not, therefore, be seen as a priority. Currently, the political will for cooperation remains primarily focused on issues of peace and stability, rather than on RCB. Although it may seem that lack of resources is a key impediment to achieving progress on cyber governance in relation to responsibility, in many instances, countries have in fact been active on particular platforms on particular issues when such active engagement has been sought, in order to have a bigger impact. This means that at the heart of the problem could be dual issues of political will and of the structure of the incentives to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter has shown that, for many countries in the Middle East, RCB has been approached in terms of building the state’s cyber capabilities to protect national security, combat cybercrime and control the circulation of information online. Prospects for cooperation on cyber governance in the region are challenged by geopolitical rifts and intra-state conflicts. Looking at the GCC as a case study, the protection of CNI and information operations have been of particular importance to states’ cyber governance initiatives. Although the rivalry with Iran was once seen as a potential catalyst for rapprochement between GCC countries and Israel, the ongoing wars in the region complicate this endeavour and raise questions about the legitimacy of using automated weapons for targeting and surveillance as part of military operations – questions that have wider implications for global discussions on cybersecurity and the use of technology in warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa has witnessed a particularly active role played by subregional groups, such as ECOWAS, the EAC, the SADC and the ECCAS, in cybercrime legislation and instigating discussions on cyber responsibility. This has been especially focused on fostering the application of international law to cyberspace. Such subregional, rather than continental, forums for cooperation have overcome the challenges of harmonising policies among African countries with deeply rooted disparities, though those disparities have nevertheless impeded the AU’s ability to develop an “African” position on cyber matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future research and analysis should focus on the multiple areas where the roots of cooperation on responsibility in the AU and the GCC can be further developed, bearing in mind the importance of there being sufficient incentives for governments to cooperate. In addition to combating cybercrime and securing the digital economy, workshop discussions concluded that the responsibility of non-state actors is an issue where common understanding among governments could be improved. Several cyber attacks in the Middle East and Africa have been launched by non-state actors. In view of the political and security situation in the two regions, including the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and military coups against the democratic takeover of governments in Africa, regulating the work of non-state actors and debating their responsibility in cyberspace is a topic that governments are, most likely, open to engaging with. As such, this is an important area for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation is another area that many governments in the two regions see as a priority in the field of technology governance. There is, therefore, an opportunity to use this topic to engage in multistakeholder conversations on localised approaches to content moderation, for example, that would also get social media companies on board. However, any such discussions should occur through an inclusive policy framework that includes civil society organisations in all state-led cyber governance initiatives, including through regular multistakeholder consultations. This also requires governments to refrain from punishing non-compliance with state-imposed frameworks and conceptualisations of security and privacy, and there must be more inclusion of individual rights in data protection and cybersecurity legislation and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On cyber-related issues, Canada and the US are bound together by a broad range of institutions, values and common practices. Both states are founding members of NATO and part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship with the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Forged in the wake of two world wars, these long-standing bonds both underpin and engender overlap in the North American approach to responsible cyber behaviour (RCB). This chapter was written before the start of the second Trump administration and thus does not reflect on policy shifts after December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the two allies diverge somewhat in how they realise RCB, as a production of either moderation or boldness. Fundamentally, Canada perceives responsibility as an extension of self-restraint; the US, by contrast, perceives it as a byproduct of its own positive actions and those of like-minded partners and allies. Bridging this divide and situating these approaches within a broader rubric of UN-agreed principles of RCB will likely require more explicit clarity from North American capitals. Meanwhile, major technology multinationals based in Canada and the US can act both independently of, and in concert with, their home countries, lending them structural and market influence over how “responsibility” is defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatically, the US and Canada have advanced common cause on these issues internationally. Both have had delegations active in past sessions of the UN Group of Government Experts and Open-Ended Working Groups, and have worked in concert within the Organization of American States, the OSCE, the G7, ASEAN and others to implement the 11 voluntary, non-binding UN norms agreed by consensus in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even among otherwise adversarial states, in times of heightened geopolitical tension, the ability of Canada and the US to make progress towards the establishment of international cyber norms is noteworthy. However, such consensus-based, aspirational documents by design obscure the cultural values, operational considerations and institutional imperatives that tend to prevail at the national level – which sometimes override the aspirational policies and strategies concerning responsibility. In other words, particularly in the ephemeral domain of cyberspace, the so-called “say–do” gap can be wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gap also stems from the tendency to focus on detailing and curbing the objectionable behaviour of other states in cyberspace, while maintaining latitude and ambiguity in one’s own. The US and Canada have historically been vocal when it comes to calling out what they see as “unacceptable behaviour”, although the latter relatively less emphatically, through advisories, public attributions, sanctions, indictments and other punitive measures. However, this chapter examines how Canada and the US conceive of responsible behaviour beyond an external view of responsibility – that is, the responsibility of “other” states – and reflects on their own part. The disparities between domestic organisational instincts and diplomatic aims abroad are neither new nor exclusive to Canada and the US, but it is through exploring these dynamics that more understanding and progress might be achieved on developing, establishing and implementing RCB norms – both bilaterally and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on expert roundtable workshop discussions on both countries held in early 2024, this chapter begins by briefly discussing the evolution of these countries’ strategic cultures on cyber issues, including the pivotal historical inflection points that shaped them. Using journalistic, academic and civil society insights and analyses of these inflection points and major trends in the evolution of North American thinking on cyber writ large, the chapter then characterises the dominant philosophies and entities that manifest each country’s views of RCB. It then briefly touches on the unique and substantial role that the private sector plays in North American concepts of responsibility, and concludes with expert views on how to both clarify and harmonise these concepts with those agreed to under UN auspices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;canada&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada broadly conceives of RCB as a byproduct of diplomatic coalition-building and consensus, explicitly grounded in international law and philosophically rooted in states’ restraint. Relative to the US, Canadian officials have only recently adopted a more assertive stance on cyber issues, stemming in part from increasing cyber attacks, as well as from a desire to become more independently capable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until well into the previous decade, Canada’s cyber policy focus was primarily defensive – dedicated to protecting government systems from cyber espionage and helping its citizens to avoid becoming victims of cybercrime. From the early to mid-2010s, several events augured a more assertive Canadian stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013, for example, officials concluded that Canada was perhaps too heavily dependent on the US for digital intelligence and should become more independently capable of collecting its own. The following year, for the first time, Canada attributed a major cyber intrusion against its National Research Council to Chinese state-backed actors, elevating the threat of industrial cyber espionage in public discourse. Russian state-linked hack-and-leak operations against the US elections in 2016 and France in 2017 also galvanised policy attention in Canada, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government later signalled its intent to “assume a more assertive posture in the cyber domain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, the most substantial national security reforms in a generation were working their way through the legislative process. Among the most sweeping changes envisioned were major investments in cybersecurity, and formally empowering the country’s signals intelligence agency, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), to conduct offensive cyber operations, including “active defence” measures designed “to influence, interfere, degrade or disrupt the capabilities, intentions or activities of an adversary”. The legislation, Bill C-59, also enhanced the CSE’s ability to provide technical support to military and law enforcement agencies. A public-facing arm of the CSE, the Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity, was established to facilitate dialogue and exchange on these issues with businesses and the public. Canadian scholars subsequently explored the implications of this new assertive mandate in an attempt to square it with international law, the correct civil–military balance, and the necessary oversight. Military theorists, meanwhile, worked to develop capabilities and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2019, Canada created the Rapid Response Mechanism with other G7 countries to exchange insights and threat intelligence in response to cyber attacks. Despite a persistent focus on such multilateral efforts, “Canada appears to have had more success in bilateral and ad hoc initiatives or through working with its traditional security partners” on cyber issues, according to Carleton University professor Stephanie Carvin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even where Canada’s “active” cyber operations have been publicly avowed – such as those targeting unspecified foreign extremist or cyber-criminal groups – these more assertive measures are still couched largely in defensive terms. According to a Department of Defence spokesperson, “being assertive doesn’t just mean going on the offensive, but ensuring our networks, systems and applications are well protected. This is where our focus primarily lies”. This has not spared military and national security leaders from periodic criticism, however, to the effect that Canada’s cyber strategy remains “ad hoc”, lagging behind NATO allies, and too reliant on international norm-building to protect Canadian citizens and interests from persistent and growing cyberthreats. As some expert roundtable members and partners also noted, Canada’s strategic culture can be “aggression-averse”, and might reasonably be critiqued as “reactive” to national security threats in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, legislation makes it clear that cyber operations against foreign targets are to be an option of last resort, employed only when alternative tools are insufficient or untimely. In contrast to legislative oversight in the US, such operations fall squarely under the remit of the Cabinet as an executive function. Scholars note that insufficient oversight here may risk violating Canadians’ privacy rights. If conducted by the Canadian Armed Forces, offensive cyber operations are subject to the same strictures as any other use of force, requiring a Cabinet-level decision. Meanwhile, the minister of foreign affairs must accede to foreign cyber operations conducted by the CSE under its recently updated mandate. In strict keeping with international law, these operations cannot cause physical harm or impede traditional government functions such as law enforcement or democratic exercise. However, as Canadian analyst Alex Rudolph writes, “the risk in giving CSE the full capability set and mandate to conduct similar operations, even when tasked by the government, is that much of this will occur with minimal oversight or disclosure to the public”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative to the US, Canada has been more austere in issuing formal attributions for cyber intrusions and attacks, preferring to separate actors from behaviours, in the hope of depoliticising “responsibility”. As some workshop contributors noted, traditional notions of rules and responsibilities (often touted by the US as part of an international order it seeks to lead) are often perceived by smaller, less capable states as jingoistic, absent more content and context. Judging from publicly available insights, Canada’s gradually more assertive posture in cyberspace in recent years has been both austere and cautious, with deference to international law and multilateral progress on building norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us&quot;&gt;The US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driven by both its dominant position as a cyber power and a defence and security culture that prioritises dominance, the US views “responsibility” as a byproduct of state-driven action, rather than of restraint. As it has historically done in other securitised domains, the US considers a preponderance of power to be linked with a duty to define – and enforce – the rules in otherwise ungoverned spaces. In practice, this has largely relegated RCB to diplomatic and theoretical discussions, while a strategy of “persistent engagement” in cyberspace prevails operationally. While concertedly engaged in and supportive of UN and other international frameworks, the US leaves sufficient rhetorical ambiguity in its approach to cyber norms to enable flexibility and assertiveness in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the birthplace of the internet and arguably the world’s first and foremost “cyber power”, the US has a long track record of theorising about state behaviour in cyberspace, and discussing it in multilateral forums. From the late 1980s through to the late 2000s, the US gradually adopted the view of cyberspace as a domain of competition and conflict, and cybersecurity as a core national security function. The discovery in 2010 of the Stuxnet worm – which the US and Israel had reportedly deployed to disrupt Iran’s nuclear programme – marked an inflection point in how states perceive conflict in cyberspace. It was the first major demonstration that destructive physical effects – rivalling those achievable with kinetic weapons, but with far more deniability – could be delivered digitally in pursuit of geopolitical objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in other areas of foreign and security policy, the US’s preponderance of technological, economic and military might informed Washington’s approach to governing an ungoverned space. President Barack Obama’s administration issued the country’s first International Strategy for Cyberspace in 2011, considered “the first government document worldwide to focus entirely on the international aspects of cyber issues”. Since then, the US has both engaged and expanded its cyber diplomacy at the UN and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the National Security Agency’s (NSA) already formidable intelligence-gathering capabilities in cyberspace, the world’s first cyber military combatant command, US Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), was established in 2010. Its preliminary mission was to defend US military networks; beyond that, the command would “respond to cyber attacks under … military authority and would operate under standard rules of engagement. If the command need[ed] to work in a foreign country … it would need the authority of the U.S. combatant commander for that region with approval by the president”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ensuing decade proved consequential for how this approach would evolve. Most notably, unauthorised disclosures by Edward Snowden in 2013 sparked global scrutiny of US cyber-enabled espionage. North Korean hackers breached Sony Pictures Studios in California in 2014, prompting a national conversation about the extent to which the American private sector should depend on the US government for protection in cyberspace. In 2015, the White House secured Beijing’s (ultimately brief) restraint from conducting industrial espionage against American companies – including in cyberspace. Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election gave propaganda and information warfare parity with technical intrusions in terms of cyberthreat perceptions. By that time, Washington had become convinced that a purely defence posture of primarily military-related networks would be insufficient. By November 2016, USCYBERCOM had conducted its “most complex offensive cyber operation … to date”, against the Islamic State. As commercial entities and critical infrastructure operators suffered increasingly costly and disruptive cyber attacks in the years that followed, political pressures would grow to increase and enhance these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift in philosophy – and thus a more expansive, assertive posture in cyber operations – would be codified in US strategy documents as “persistent engagement” and “defend forward” (PE/DF). These terms encapsulate the notion that the US would aim to neutralise cyberthreats at their source, prior to their manifestation in sensitive networks (publicly or privately operated). Cyber operations would be routinely conducted proactively, in grey, contested or adversary online spaces, “just as the US Navy keeps the peace by sailing the seas, or the US Air Force secures airspace by patrolling the skies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, operations are not confined to military circles. In recent years, US law enforcement agencies have more aggressively pursued offensive cyber operations – with potential global reach – with an eye to pre-emptively disrupting threats. A range of mature US military, intelligence and criminal investigative authorities are now invoked to conduct offensive cyber operations. However, the mechanisms for deconflicting, formalising and clarifying the exercise of these authorities remain opaque, if not classified. The publicly acknowledged contours of National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 and the Vulnerabilities Equities Process – which broadly outline the inter-agency processes for coordinating military offensive cyber operations and handling the discovery of major software vulnerabilities, respectively – offer some insights. Still, a robust understanding of how officials delineate the limits of US RCB remains elusive. Moreover, some legal scholars have noted that non-military agencies, such as the FBI, have become more assertive in cyberspace – again with potentially global reach – but lack a clear legislative mandate and guidelines for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurt Sanger, former Deputy General Counsel of USCYBERCOM, has been reported as saying that the utility of such capabilities “lies in enabling strategic effect without entitling the adversary to use force in self-defence, coupled with a unique ability to modulate the level of impact in a way that is not possible with kinetic operations”. The operational complexity required to strike this balance is matched by the complexity of doing so while adhering to international law and norms – the principles which the US acknowledges should prevail in cyberspace. Some cyber scholars and military theorists argue that this domain differs from “conventional environments, which poses a challenge to the relevance of these rules”. Indeed, while there is consensus that the law of armed conflict applies in cyberspace in times of war, a patchwork of treaties, case law and customary law leaves room for digital espionage and subversion – some of which, as in the case of elections, states consider escalatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is this uncertainty – and the lack of conceptual clarity around whether cyber operations are an extension of warfare, intelligence or some other mode of statecraft – that raises questions about the degree to which PE/DF theory aligns, in practice, with RCB. However much coherence the concept might lend to Washington’s internal deliberations, it remains hotly debated among cyber conflict scholars whether the approach will actually constrain global competition in cyberspace, rather than intensify it. States may perceive (correctly or not) US PE/DF activities “not as a reasonable response to their own norm-busting behaviour, but as an escalation”, notes cyber scholar Jason Healey. The fact that the pre-eminent US military and intelligence-gathering organisations operating in cyberspace – USCYBERCOM and the NSA – fall under the same “dual-hatted” leadership might also complicate reliable signalling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the foundation of those rules to which the US has agreed internationally – from the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime in 2001 to the framework of UN-developed cyber norms in 2015 and 2021 – a range of “interpretive questions” likely enable US officials to flexibly pursue PE/DF in a manner they deem responsible. For instance, the US has refrained from concrete stances or definitions on issues such as state sovereignty, countermeasures and non-intervention. The US has (sometimes grudgingly) become more publicly transparent about the policy processes guiding its offensive cyber operations. It is also willing to publicly define adversary behaviours as “irresponsible”. However, this have not translated into a more explicit delineation of what specific types of cyber activity constitute “responsible state behaviour”, and which do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert contributors at the workshops ultimately assessed that the US has come to both implicitly and explicitly adopt the view that its own responsibility in cyberspace is defined more by commission than by restraint. In other words – with due deference to international law and guided by relevant norms – for those with the capability to act in service of a more secure cyberspace, their foremost responsibility is to do so. As a 2019 joint statement with like-minded states reads, “we will work together on a voluntary basis to hold states accountable when they act contrary to [the UN framework], including by taking measures that are transparent and consistent with international law. There must be consequences for bad behaviour in cyberspace”. In Washington’s view, responsible states must not only refrain from such behaviours, but also work together to punish them. In this regard, US diplomatic signalling on cyber issues has often functioned more as post hoc reprisal than as preventive remedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s diplomatic focus has, however, grown and progressed rapidly in recent years. In 2022, the US State Department established a standing bureau dedicated to cyberspace and digital policy more broadly – including a Senate-confirmed envoy to lead it, former US Marine Corps officer and technology executive Nathaniel Fick. The bureau’s remit is expansive, from bolstering technological expertise in the ranks to developing and implementing the US’s first International Cyberspace and Digital Policy Strategy. The latter, released in early 2024, sets out an ambitious and expansive agenda to make the digital ecosystem – including the hardware, software and physical infrastructure underpinning it – more secure, trusted and resilient. The strategy explicitly notes that success will be the product of “solidarity” among partnerships and coalitions sharing similar values – an evolution beyond the more “utopian” vision of a singular global internet of previous eras, implicitly acknowledging a more fractured global arena with competing models for development and security. Under this rubric, the Department of State aims to “organize and execute sustained diplomatic pressure campaigns to raise international and public awareness of significant cyberthreats and to increase the costs and risks to malicious cyber actors”, in conjunction with the operational efforts of inter-agency partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as cyberspace remains ill-defined and ungoverned, the US seeks to define by doing, and to govern by superiority. Possessing both significant cyber capabilities and a host of digital dependencies – and with several revisionist adversaries to contend with – the US perceives itself as the pre-eminent cyber power. On the global stage, it considers its role both determinative and indispensable, as much by duty as by licence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;The Role of the Private Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both Canada and the US, there is growing appreciation for the way in which commercial actors are able to shape cyberspace – for good or ill – at a speed, scope and scale that governments acting alone simply cannot match. Since many of the biggest multinational tech companies are based in North America, they enjoy some degree of autonomy in how they perceive and pursue RCB – often as consequentially as states themselves. With the US and Canadian governments and militaries depending on these same companies to develop and maintain technological solutions, both capitals and corporate boardrooms navigate a blurred line between regulatory and voluntary measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly since the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 by North Korean state actors, American and Canadian cyber strategists have pondered the degree to which commercial entities should depend on or expect protection from the state in cyberspace. In the interim, new legislative and regulatory initiatives in both countries have been aimed at shifting the onus of security from end users and consumers to developers and suppliers, and to operators of critical national infrastructure (CNI). Where prevention and deterrence have previously been the dominant themes of national strategy documents, these have come instead to emphasise resilience and security, both in supply chains and in the initial design of hardware and software programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly in the US – which is among the largest customers for technological goods and services in the world – officials have come to see governmental “purchasing power” as a way to incentivise more robust security in these offerings. As of 2023, both American and Canadian market regulators have cast corporate cybersecurity practices as being somewhat akin to the fiduciary obligations of publicly traded companies toward their shareholders. These steps have come on the heels of a number of recent intrusions into sensitive governmental and corporate systems by Russian and Chinese cyber actors in particular – including some which could be blamed as much on faulty or lax design choices and security protocols as on the sophistication of state-backed hackers. Even so, many commercial stakeholders are quick to point out that increasing concerns about liability and proprietary information can have a chilling effect on proactive tipping and information exchange with government cyber officials (Canada’s C-26 legislation attempts to assuage such confidentiality concerns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, both North American countries view domestic and international standards-setting organisations as key to enhancing cybersecurity more broadly, and to ensuring open, interoperable internet protocols. These include the US Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as voluntary multilateral entities such as the International Organization for Standardization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the International Telecommunication Union and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North America-based tech sector, in partnership with civil society, has similarly arrayed itself to lead against irresponsible behaviours in cyberspace. This positions these non-governmental, commercial actors to play a substantial role in defining “responsibility” on the international stage, whether through the very initial design of their widely used products, through advocacy and awareness campaigns, or through alignment with the national security interests of their predominantly Western, liberal democratic host states and user bases. For instance, initiatives such as the Charter of Trust, the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and the Global Cyber Alliance aim to forge consensus and galvanise private sector action against cyberthreats – in addition to and beyond that which governments can achieve alone. Many of these same commercial entities have also joined government-led initiatives such as the international Counter Ransomware Initiative of President Joe Biden’s administration, and have joined the US and Canada as signatories to the UK-led Pall Mall Declaration against the proliferation of commercial spyware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, workshop participants noted that the “private sector” is not a monolith – hence a recognition of the need not just for symbolic declarations about making cyberspace safe for everyone, but also for institutionalising the rubric that “those with the most capability must shoulder the most responsibility”, particularly when it involves CNI and key resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patchwork of voluntary, collaborative and enforced cybersecurity measures is aimed at pushing the boundaries of private and commercial capacity to withstand illicit state activity. Even so, North American leaders have retained a clear monopoly on certain kinds of operations. For instance, commentators and officials have periodically proposed – while legislators have ultimately resisted – calls to relax restrictions on otherwise illegal vigilantism by private citizens or commercial actors. Canada and the US appear to have concluded that such “hack-back” or “deputisation” proposals ultimately entail more escalatory and normative risks than they do benefits to global cybersecurity. Meanwhile, the more recent proliferation of so-called “hacktivists” amid Russia’s war in Ukraine – as well as the influx of Western commercial support to Kyiv – has reinvigorated debates about states’ responsibility for hackers operating in their territory, as well as about what behaviours might qualify an individual citizen or corporation as a “combatant” in cyberspace during wartime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;clarifying-responsibility&quot;&gt;Clarifying “Responsibility”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expert roundtable participants broadly agreed that North American leaders are likely to maintain some ambiguity in their definition of “responsibility” in cyberspace. This lack of clarity will limit the efficacy of international norms. In the US in particular, more explicit clarity about how the PE/DF strategy is intended to align with the principles of RCB may be necessary. As operations conducted under this rubric are often cast as norm-building exercises, more can be done to clearly distinguish them from the types of irresponsible – as opposed to merely objectionable – cyber activities of adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, with the barriers to entry lower than ever for non-state and commercial actors to engage in cyber operations, the margins for third-party contractors and commercial proxies will only widen. Hence more explicit delineation may be needed, as North America is a leading target of state-backed cyber operations. Expert roundtable participants Richard Harknett and John Bruce (American and Canadian scholars, respectively) thus propose that North American leaders draw on a schema of “awful, (un)lawful, and (ir)responsible” when assessing or addressing state behaviours in cyberspace – including their own. These criteria could encompass a broader range of activities conducted using ICTs, including information operations on social media, non-state hacktivism and illicit surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are areas where additional research and policy recommendations will be necessary to guide state activities, set public expectations and signal to allies, partners and adversaries, particularly as cloud-based exploitation and pre-positioning – which have gained salience as US officials have addressed the presence of Russian spies moving laterally within cloud services, and the problem of Chinese malware in US critical infrastructure – fit within this rubric. Such specificity will help to solidify international norms, harmonise threat perceptions and justify response measures, even as the threat environment evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the approaches to RCB of the US and Canada are consequential in their own right – the former as the putatively dominant cyber power, the latter as a close ally, and as both part of major transatlantic institutions such as NATO and the Five Eyes. To bridge gaps within and beyond the North American region, workshop participants therefore recommended a more harmonised approach to digital privacy, a focus on anti-trust measures to yield more cybersecurity from market competition, and increased “safe harbour” measures to elicit good-faith efforts from private industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-1&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this compendium has demonstrated, there is a diversity of approaches, views and experiences that reflect how different states see responsible cyber behaviour (RCB). The compendium does not seek to be exhaustive; rather, it offers region-based reflections on how states have engaged with RCB as a concept. Case studies in this publication offer concrete examples of how incidents, institutions and policies can help us investigate RCB beyond the UN framework. The case studies identify unique characteristics defining RCB contextually, in terms of development, climate, content control, business development and offensive cyber capabilities, among others. Altogether, the compendium provides a complex yet enriching future agenda for research on RCB at the intersection between the international, domestic and operational notions of responsibility. The compendium makes at least two important contributions to the advancement of the study of responsibility in cyberspace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It explores perspectives that have been overlooked in international discussions, by reflecting on the cultural drivers and gaps in the interpretation of “responsibility” in cyberspace. For example, the Indo-Pacific region emphasises sustainable and inclusive capacity-building, and how cyber capacity-building (CCB) should consider the context of climate change. In the Middle East and Africa, on the other hand, it seems that responsibility is much more closely tied to combating cybercrime by non-state actors, the role of civil society in holding governments accountable, and concerns with development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compendium offers a practice-driven discussion of behaviours perceived as responsible or irresponsible, acceptable or unacceptable, by different governments. For example, European states emphasise political responsibility and public attributions to strengthen accountability, while North American countries, particularly the US, adopt a strategy of “persistent engagement” and “defend forward” to neutralise cyberthreats at their source, in addition to public or joint attributions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enacting-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Enacting Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this compendium shows, RCB can be demonstrated in different ways. Despite regional differences, the compendium highlights some key methods through which states have sought to enact, showcase or indicate what RCB is, domestically and regionally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutions:&lt;/strong&gt; It is clear from the case studies that institutional development can be seen as a country’s attempt to confer certain roles and responsibilities regarding cyber security onto a specific body (new or existing). This does not presumptively mean that a state is considered a responsible actor merely by the fact that it has, for example, cyber security authorities or bodies in charge of conducting defensive or offensive cyber operations. Rather, it illustrates that, for some regions, the move to include cyber security as part of a specific institutional design might signal states’ collective commitment to addressing RCB as part of their agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laws and regulations:&lt;/strong&gt; As a key instrument of statecraft, laws and regulations are the bedrock of RCB enactment. They determine the roles and responsibilities for governmental and non-governmental entities working on cyber issues, and they set standards and requirements for baseline cyber security domestically, among other things. For example, the AU’s Malabo Convention serves as a basis for instigating discussions on RCB, reaffirming commitments to international human rights conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speeches and official statements:&lt;/strong&gt; States frequently issue statements to signal what they perceive as acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. As the Europe chapter shows most thoroughly (but is also observable in other chapters), public attribution and joint statements are some of the activities that states undertake to call out malicious cyber activity originating from or associated with another state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation agreements:&lt;/strong&gt; RCB is also enacted through bilateral and cross-regional agreements and cooperation on CCB. ASEAN’s adoption of the UN norms to enhance trust and confidence in cyberspace, and the AU’s common position on the applicability of international law in cyberspace, exemplify regional cooperation in establishing common standards and perceptions for RCB, as well as joint commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Drivers of Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other factors that might drive a state to use these tools to consolidate and/or project RCB. The compendium touches on the following drivers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; The Indo-Pacific region’s emphasis on sustainable capacity-building reflects the intersection of cyber security with environmental and climate security priorities. Because of their immediate exposure to climate change, Pacific Island countries have advocated for more sustainable cyber capacity-building efforts, pushing donors to be more empathetic about their development and security needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing geopolitical tensions:&lt;/strong&gt; Geopolitical rivalries across most of the regions surveyed have been a key driver of the creation of like-minded or minilateral environments for RCB discussions. In the cases of India and Pakistan, cyberspace targeting follows offline tensions – as with many other countries. European countries, the US, Canada and other “allies” have seen joint attributions as a main way of framing who the key threat actors are, and to which countries or regions they are linked. For others, mere proximity to major cyber powers – as in the cases of Indo-Pacific countries in relation to China – can have the opposite effect, with geopolitical tensions making countries more cautious and reluctant to attribute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The capacity to name and shame:&lt;/strong&gt; European states’ practice of public attributions serves as a mechanism for indicating what states view as irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour, and for shaming malicious cyber actors. It remains an open question whether malicious cyber activity can be deterred through public attributions, but the practice is effective in cases where states are seeking to highlight a lack of accountability from other states. While this compendium features mostly public attributions, the capacity to conduct technical non-public attribution is another key aspect of a state’s domestic responsibility to know about and act on information regarding malicious cyber activity originating in its territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure to respond to large-scale incidents:&lt;/strong&gt; Driven by the need to address significant cyberthreats, Latin American and Caribbean states have shifted from a largely reactive to a proactive response to cyber incidents. Cyber incidents in Costa Rica and Colombia have shown how large-scale incidents, especially ransomware, have propelled states in the region to strengthen their posture in relation to domestic and operational responsibility, through passing legislation, developing proposals for national cyber-security agencies, and CCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing and maturing a national position on RCB:&lt;/strong&gt; The case studies in this compendium show a range of ways in which states have matured their views on RCB. Canada’s evolution from a defensive to a more assertive cyber policy highlights the importance of developing a clear national stance on cyber issues domestically. More traditionally, one of the key ways of signalling RCB is through the publication of national positions or statements on the applicability of international law in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business and sustainable development continuity:&lt;/strong&gt; Securing the digital economy, particularly in Africa, underscores the role of cyber security in supporting economic stability and growth. This is a much under-represented dimension of RCB, yet a cross-cutting one in relation to countries in regions including the Asia-Pacific, LAC and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling the information space:&lt;/strong&gt; The intersections between RCB and information flows are clear from a variety of state behaviours. These range from Middle Eastern states’ use of cyber-intrusive tools to Indo-Pacific states’ support of content-related crimes such as disinformation and online hate, to European countries seeking to develop standards of behaviour in cyberspace through regulatory approaches to online platforms’ content moderation. On the one hand sits the need to control information, while on the other is, the need to ensure that online platforms are more accountable and transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-reflections-and-the-future-agenda-for-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;Key Reflections and the Future Agenda for Responsible Cyber Behaviour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While all UN member states have agreed to the RCB framework, connecting it to the domestic level remains a challenge. This is particularly the case with the development of national positions on how international law applies to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rather than seeking one definition, the research and debate about RCB can be richly investigated through a more culturally sensitive understanding of the drivers and means through which states seek to consolidate and project notions of responsibility. In some ways, this compendium shows that despite international commitments (and questions concerning their adequate observance), “responsibility” is what states make of it domestically and how they negotiate it, relationally and interdependently, with other states – that is, at the UN or through joint statements (for example, on international law or joint attributions).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The compendium underscores the importance of understanding regional perspectives and practices in shaping global norms and expectations. By recognising the unique contexts and priorities of different regions – as well as not taking regions as coherent, cohesive or monolithic units of analysis – it contributes to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of RCB on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of silence or non-public statements remains under-studied. Publishing statements can be framed as an accountability and transparency measure for states. However, there are multiple reasons why states decide not to be more public about their views on RCB. These can be linked to a lack of capacity (human or economic) to produce documents such as national cyber-security strategies, a lack of political prioritisation and funding, a less public approach to cyber attribution and deterrence (for example, rapprochement), or a broader political strategy of not publicly disclosing thresholds for certain types of cyber operations or activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, while RCB is a term that encompasses responsibility beyond governments, the compendium reflects a cross-regional structure and thus a still somewhat state-centric view of responsibility. Future research on RCB should also consider what the term means for private companies working in cyber security, reflecting on how existing international commitments from these companies concerning corporate social responsibility practices and/ or joint statements (from business associations) and initiatives (for example, Tech Accord) illustrate how companies – and non-state actors more broadly – have sought to signal and engage in RCB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the battlefield I did not see a single Ukrainian soldier. Only drones. I saw them [Ukrainian soldiers] only when I surrendered. Only drones, and there are lots and lots of them. Guys, don’t come. It’s a drone war. — &lt;strong&gt;Surrendered Russian soldier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines how Ukraine is advancing AI-driven unmanned systems to reduce direct warfighter involvement while enhancing combat effectiveness. Although fully autonomous warfare remains an aspiration, significant progress has already been made in partial autonomy—particularly for aerial systems—while human oversight remains critical in engagement decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian military’s objective is to remove warfighters from direct combat and replace them with autonomous unmanned systems.&lt;/strong&gt; This goal reflects the need to conserve a limited human force and overcome vulnerabilities such as fatigue, stress, and the limited capacity to process and fuse large amounts of data from various sources and sensors. Although not yet formalized into a written strategy, this vision unifies Ukraine’s military and defense industry around the adoption, acquisition, and rapid deployment of advanced technologies—including AI-enabled capabilities—and the expansion of unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy—defined by the U.S. military as a system’s ability to accomplish goals independently or with minimal supervision in complex and unpredictable environments—is not yet present on the battlefield in the war in Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; The primary reason for this is that the necessary technology—AI in particular—has not reached the required level of development. Additionally, Ukraine has no formal legislative or policy definition for “autonomy” or “autonomous weapons systems.” As a result, the Ukrainian military uses the term “autonomous systems” interchangeably with “unmanned systems,” or platforms equipped with basic autonomous functions such as navigation or targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current deployment of AI is partial in scope, enhancing certain functions and addressing some operational challenges rather than enabling full system autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt; AI is a foundational technology for transitioning from automated to autonomous systems, or systems that can decide how to achieve a goal rather than merely execute human-programmed algorithms. AI significantly enhances specific functions, such as drone footage analysis and target recognition, target tracking, and autonomous navigation, including last-mile navigation and sound and text analysis for intelligence extraction, where AI replaces 99 percent of human labor. While such systems may operate without direct human control, they typically do not perform the entire process of finding, selecting, and engaging targets independently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian forces have widely adopted small and medium first-person-view (FPV) drones as platforms that may be quickly adapted for diverse missions through modular design and interchangeable equipment.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike the United States, Ukraine categorizes drones based on structural configuration, payload capacity, and propeller diameter. Initially, 7 inch FPV drones were common due to their ease of assembly, but growing operational demands have shifted preferences toward 9–10 inch quadcopters capable of carrying heavier payloads and achieving longer ranges. Adding an improvised explosive device (IED), an IED release mechanism, various sensors, or signal relaying equipment to the same FPV platform can transform it into a kamikaze drone; a bomber; an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system; or a relay node. This modular approach, which allows for quick adaptation to diverse missions by swapping components, makes FPV drones a flexible and scalable asset on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine’s defense industry is developing standalone AI-driven software that can be integrated across various platforms to expand battlefield autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt; This software enables key autonomous functions such as environmental perception, target recognition, and navigation, including last-mile approach to the target. It comes in standalone modules, consisting of compact chips with embedded software and sometimes cameras. These modules can be integrated into a range of platforms, from small FPV drones and long-range-strike drones to turrets mounted on unmanned ground vehicles. As a result, companies are focusing on developing separate autonomous functions while ensuring their compatibility across multiple platforms and unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian defense industry is pursuing an approach of training small AI models on small datasets rather than developing large, all-encompassing models.&lt;/strong&gt; This approach enables fast and efficient onboard processing on the limited computing power of small and inexpensive chips, which can be quickly updated, retrained, and upgraded to adapt to changing battlefield conditions. These datasets can be collected through a company’s battlefield operations or open-source data from social media. Military authorities can filter out highly relevant datasets from the Ministry of Defence’s broader military dataset and allow companies to train their models in a protected military environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegating target recognition to AI-enabled automatic target recognition (ATR) systems onboard unmanned platforms reduces human limitations and allows locking on to targets up to 2 km away.&lt;/strong&gt; By automating equipment identification and object detection, drones ease the burden on frontline personnel affected by fatigue, stress, or skill variability. Advancements have extended target recognition ranges from 300 meters to an average of 1 km in combat and to up to 2 km in optimal conditions. AI-powered software also counters decoys and camouflage, which can deceive the human eye. As adversaries refine their evasion tactics, AI-enabled ATR models require continuous, real-world data updates to maintain accuracy and adapt to evolving battlefield conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous navigation makes drones strikes three to four times more likely to succeed.&lt;/strong&gt; By removing the need for constant manual control and stable communications—both of which are vulnerable to electronic warfare and lack of operator skills—drones enabled with autonomous navigation raise the target engagement success rate from around 10 to 20 percent to around 70 to 80 percent. Although the striking precision is not very high, when Ukrainian forces expect it to be in “reasonable radius” rather than a specific point on a target, autonomous navigation reduces demand on the skill level of the operator and makes weapons systems with AI-enabled navigation accessible to a larger number of warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The adoption of drones equipped with AI-enabled autonomous navigation capabilities is driving a marked decrease in overall strike costs by minimizing both drone losses and repeated mission attempts.&lt;/strong&gt; As a result of more efficient mission execution, these systems can often achieve objectives using just one or two drones per target rather than eight or nine. Furthermore, the integration of fully autonomous flight—from takeoff through mission execution to landing—makes systems reusable and reduces the need for frequent equipment replenishment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian engineers are increasingly leveraging open-source technologies and existing computer vision models to accelerate research and development while keeping costs low.&lt;/strong&gt; By integrating readily available software solutions—including open-source computer vision frameworks—developers can rapidly create and deploy autonomous functions. This approach is particularly advantageous for “attritable,” or expendable, platforms, where the benefits of minimizing both per-unit and development costs often outweigh those of highly customized solutions. Additionally, open-source components facilitate faster prototyping, ongoing updates, and a collaborative development environment that draws on global research—all of which help maintain an agile edge in modern conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypting onboard AI software enables Ukraine to preserve its technological edge by making autonomous systems difficult to reverse engineer.&lt;/strong&gt; Although adversaries can replicate hardware designs in a matter of weeks, sophisticated encryption in AI-enabled software significantly slows down their efforts to develop equivalent systems. This secure software advantage allows Ukrainian forces to maintain a lead in drone autonomy. By investing in robust encryption protocols, Ukraine not only shields its critical algorithms and data but also establishes a strategic deterrent against immediate duplication, reinforcing the enduring value of high-tech innovation in modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training to operate unmanned systems equipped with autonomous features can now be completed in as little as 30 minutes to one day, substantially broadening access to these weapons systems.&lt;/strong&gt; What once required extensive flight hours now requires only a few hours, enabling a wider pool of soldiers to develop the necessary skills with minimal specialized expertise. As self-guided systems become more prevalent, drone training programs increasingly integrate autonomous targeting and navigation into their curricula. Recognizing this shift, institutions that educate drone operators equip learners to handle both manual and AI-assisted functionalities, often mastering autonomous modes in under a day. This accelerated learning curve expands the pool of qualified operators and bolsters overall operational readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian authorities are expediting the formal adoption and procurement of software and modules equipped with autonomous capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Key initiatives include codifying these autonomous modules in alignment with NATO standards and integrating them into official military service, which helps to scale acquisition. By classifying these modules as distinct components and establishing clear guidelines for their integration and use, the Ukrainian military is speeding up procurement and deployment timelines. In 2024, Ukrainian forces began purchasing 10,000 AI-enhanced drones—a preliminary yet significant step toward broader adoption of advanced autonomous systems. Although this figure represents only a fraction of the nearly 2 million drones built by Ukraine in 2024, it shows Ukraine’s growing commitment to increasingly autonomous and capable platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian military authorities increasingly require all unmanned and reconnaissance systems to integrate with situational awareness and fire-correction platforms, aiming to establish a common operating picture in real time.&lt;/strong&gt; To meet this demand, manufacturers must ensure their systems can feed data seamlessly into shared situational awareness and command and control environments. Even foreign suppliers recognize this imperative. For instance, Skydio’s drones are linked with the Ministry of Defence’s Delta system. The same may be said of the Ukrainian acoustic reconnaissance system Zvook and the text analysis tool Griselda, which provides intelligence from group chats and intercepted Russian communications. By unifying these capabilities, Ukrainian forces create a comprehensive, real-time operational picture that spans domestic and international technology providers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two major challenges lie ahead for AI-enabled autonomy: extending these capabilities to ground, sea, and undersea platforms and enabling swarming for aerial systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Although aerial drones have led the way in autonomous operations, adapting similar functionalities for multidomain use requires overcoming more complex technical and environmental hurdles. While the potential for integrating autonomous navigation into ground systems is significant, practical implementation remains largely unexplored by Ukrainian defense companies. In the aerial domain, swarming is currently in a stage of small-scale experiments; however, fully realized swarms—where drones communicate, make decisions, and adapt in concert—have yet to be developed. Achieving such sophisticated coordination will demand substantial advancements in AI algorithms, communication protocols, and real-time decisionmaking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human oversight remains pivotal—particularly for engagement decisions—reflecting a human-in-the-loop approach that could shift toward higher-level supervision in the future while still maintaining human control of the system.&lt;/strong&gt; Although Ukrainian forces aim to expand autonomy wherever it can enhance operational effectiveness, engagement decisions remain squarely in the human domain. Current human-in-the-loop practices allow operators to override autonomous functions, ensuring critical ethical and strategic judgments remain under human control. This approach lays a foundation for broader autonomy in the future—but with sustained human involvement at pivotal junctures where the stakes are highest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent are modern unmanned systems truly autonomous, and how significantly does AI enhance their autonomy in the war in Ukraine? What are the paths for transforming military unmanned systems from ambitious theoretical concepts into practical, AI-enabled battlefield tools? What technological, operational, and strategic barriers still prevent the realization of fully autonomous warfare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper explores these questions by analyzing Ukraine’s innovative deployment of unmanned systems and assessing the role of AI in enhancing their effectiveness in contested environments. Drawing on dozens of interviews with Ukrainian military officials and Ukrainian and U.S. defense technology manufacturers, this analysis begins by reviewing the Ukrainian military’s broader vision of military strategy and technology development. It clarifies the main definitions related to autonomy and autonomous weapons systems (AWSs) and then outlines the Ukrainian military’s long- and short-term perspectives on the future battlefield, though these views have not yet been formalized into an official strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on insights from these interviews and acknowledging that current technology cannot yet support fully autonomous missions, this paper describes advancements in three essential functions—intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); automatic target recognition (ATR); and autonomous navigation—showing how these developments steer the battlefield toward greater AI-enabled autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each section identifies the main challenges AI aims to address, explains AI’s role in overcoming these challenges, and provides case studies that illustrate AI’s practical application in context. Additionally, the paper provides an overview of key lessons learned and emerging trends within each function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ukrainian-militarys-strategic-vision-and-technological-road-map&quot;&gt;The Ukrainian Military’s Strategic Vision and Technological Road Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-framework-for-understanding-autonomy-and-the-scope-of-this-paper&quot;&gt;A Framework for Understanding Autonomy and the Scope of This Paper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to begin by clarifying how digitization, autonomy, and AWSs are defined, particularly given that different actors—including the Ukrainian and U.S. militaries—do not always use the same words to mean the same thing. Figure 1 illustrates how these definitions intersect and relate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bXogZ4a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Relationship Between Digitization, Autonomy, and AWSs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitization, as used here, denotes strategic adoption of advanced IT solutions, secure networks, and user‑friendly interfaces across the whole military ecosystem. This foundational infrastructure enables streamlined operations, improved decisionmaking, and a distinct strategic advantage on the modern battlefield. Although digitization is a foundation for all further technical advancements within the military sector, the focus of this paper is more narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on digitization, autonomy in military contexts refers to the ability of a system to accomplish objectives independently or with minimal oversight in complex and unpredictable environments. AWSs represent a more specialized subset of autonomy. As defined by U.S. Department of Defense Directive 3000.09, an AWS is a system that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further human intervention. Thus, while digitization underpins the broader development of autonomy, autonomy ultimately paves the way for advanced applications such as AWSs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, however, no formal legislative or policy definition of either “autonomy” or “autonomous weapons system” currently exists. Often, Ukrainian sources use these terms interchangeably with unmanned platforms or platforms equipped with basic autonomous functions (e.g., navigation or targeting). While such systems may operate without direct human control, they frequently do not perform the entire process of finding, selecting, and engaging targets independently. Given this discrepancy, this study employs a broad concept of autonomy to examine AI applications rather than focusing exclusively on AWSs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ukrainian-militarys-central-goal-replace-humans-on-the-battlefield-with-autonomous-systems&quot;&gt;The Ukrainian Military’s Central Goal: Replace Humans on the Battlefield with Autonomous Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to technology, the Ukrainian military identifies removing warfighters from direct combat as its central objective in shaping the future battlefield. This goal is not simply an ambition; instead, it is an existential necessity for the Ukrainian armed forces. Given the substantial numerical superiority of Russian forces, Ukraine faces significant constraints on human capital, training resources, and time spent preparing warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, human personnel face inherent vulnerabilities, including fatigue, susceptibility to adverse weather conditions, and psychological stress. These human factors substantially impact operational sustainability and combat effectiveness, thereby reinforcing the tactical and strategic imperative for increased battlefield autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conversations with CSIS, a diverse group of Ukrainian military and industrial officials repeatedly shared this common vision, even though it has not yet been formalized with a written strategy. Instead, a broad consensus on this vision among commanders already guides the acquisition priorities, deployment of software (e.g., comprehensive situational awareness and fire correction), and integration of unmanned systems into forces and current operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;road-map-to-battlefield-transformation-ukraines-progressive-approach-to-ai-enabled-autonomy&quot;&gt;Road Map to Battlefield Transformation: Ukraine’s Progressive Approach to AI-Enabled Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Component&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military’s long-term strategy integrates AI‑enabled autonomous systems with real-time situational awareness as a pivotal step toward achieving its main objective. This approach aims to unify data from multiple sources, analyze it quickly with the help of AI, and maintain a real-time operating picture that every autonomous system can access, thereby sharing friendly and adversarial movements instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ukrainian forces currently envision a human-in-the-loop role, allowing operators to override AWSs when necessary, their long-term objective is to maximize autonomy across the battlefield whenever and wherever it supports improved operational effectiveness. This vision encompasses all functions, from intelligence gathering to progressing through the target life cycle, with human input limited to engagement decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, there is a significant gap between aspiration and reality in technology development. AI, in particular, has many issues that have slowed broader deployment. Ongoing technological limitations—from simple sensor malfunctions under harsh weather conditions to difficulties tracking fast-moving or camouflaged targets—force the Ukrainian defense industry and military to apply a gradual approach and take smaller steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step, the Ukrainian military focuses on adapting its command and control and integrating unmanned systems with conventional weapons systems into a single kill chain—for example, artillery. Kateryna Mykhalko, the director of Tech Force in UA, a Ukrainian defense manufacturers association, shared with CSIS that the envisioned single kill chain merges reconnaissance and strike unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with artillery in a unified command system. Rather than replace conventional artillery outright, Ukrainian forces employ smaller strike UAVs to execute precise attacks against smaller targets, which reconnaissance drones identify and track. These small attacks exhaust the defenses of bigger and more important targets, leaving them unprotected for a further, decisive artillery blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step in the transition to fully autonomous military systems involves conducting and testing operations executed exclusively by unmanned platforms. The Ukrainian military has already begun operationally experimenting with this approach. In December 2024, Ukrainian forces took this step by carrying out the first fully unmanned operation near Lyptsi, a village north of Kharkiv. The attack involved dozens of uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) and first-person-view (FPV) drones, with no infantry participation. UGVs equipped with machine guns and munitions performed tasks such as mine clearance and direct fire. FPV drones supported the operation from the air, creating a coordinated multidomain assault. Following the attack, surviving robotic unmanned systems returned behind Ukrainian positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tactical air-land operation successfully destroyed Russian positions and showcased Ukraine’s innovative approach to offset manpower limitations by leveraging attritable technologies. Although described as a “seminal moment” in conflict evolution, the robotic systems were still manually (though remotely) operated. Nevertheless, the operation brings Ukraine one step closer to implementing its vision of the future battlefield, which will increasingly utilize AI-enabled autonomous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technological Component&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS conversations with Ukrainian warfighters and defense manufacturers reveal the organic approach that Ukraine and its domestic industry are taking toward achieving autonomy on the battlefield. Rather than follow a formal strategy, this process has evolved in response to several influences, including competitive pressures from the adversary, market dynamics, geopolitical considerations, and foreign export controls, especially China’s ban on the sale of key drone and microelectronic components to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technological evolution driving this transition may be divided into three key trends progressing in parallel. These trends result in systems that are not only flexible, cost-effective, and highly efficient but also adaptable to diverse mission requirements and equipped with AI-powered software that enables autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trend 1: Ukrainian forces have widely adopted small FPV drones as a platform that can be quickly adapted for diverse missions through modular design.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small and medium Ukrainian-built FPV drones are the most commonly used platforms on the Ukrainian battlefield, aside from consumer off-the-shelf models like the Chinese-made DJI Mavic. While Ukrainian forces use these commercial drones, they cannot directly influence Mavic’s technology development. In contrast, local innovators produce and refine many FPV drones, making them the focus of this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military classifies drones, including FPV drones, differently than the U.S. military. Instead of using categories like size, weight, or flight altitude, Ukraine groups drones by structural configuration (for example, quadcopter or fixed-wing), payload capacity, and, most importantly, propeller diameter. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022, FPV drones with a 7 inch propeller diameter were most common due to their ease of assembly, smaller batteries, and greater availability. Over time, though, increased demand for heavier payloads and longer flight range has led to a shift toward larger 9–10 inch quadcopters, which now dominate Ukrainian operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FPV drones have not only grown larger but also have become more versatile. As shown in Figure 2, a basic quadcopter platform may be adapted for different missions by adding or changing specific components. This modular approach allows the same platform to carry various payloads and fulfill different roles, making FPV drones a flexible solution across many types of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MjVfJMD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Types of FPV Drones Used for Various Missions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trend 2: Ukraine’s defense industry is developing standalone software that can be integrated across a variety of platforms to incrementally expand battlefield autonomy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the shift toward more advanced drone hardware, Ukraine’s defense industry is putting much effort into software engineering. This approach centers on creating modules—electronic and software components developed independently of any specific hardware platform. As shown in Figure 3, these modules often comprise a chip with embedded software (and sometimes a camera) and are usually smaller than a bar of soap. They enable critical autonomous functions, such as perceiving the environment, target recognition, and the capacity to engage targets without direct human flight control (so-called last-mile navigation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on one specialized function at a time and then offering that function as a standalone product, Ukrainian defense firms and startups can tailor their modules to operate across a broad range of systems. These include FPV drones of various sizes, ground vehicles, and even turret-mounted weapons. In doing so, they pave the way for broader autonomy, as each module contributes a distinct capability that can be integrated into larger multifunctional platforms. Examples of such modules and companies are provided in the case studies in the following sections of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8JiueSV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Examples of Modules Enabling Autonomous Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trend 3: Ukraine has prioritized scaling and localizing domestic drone production and increasing self-sufficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a statement by Ukraine Minister of Defence Rustem Umerov, domestic drone production significantly expanded in 2024, reflecting Ukraine’s growing focus on scaling and localizing production capacity. In 2024, Ukrainian defense companies manufactured and assembled more than 1.5 million FPV drones. They also produced other advanced platforms, including strike quadcopter bombers, kamikaze drones, winged reconnaissance drones, and long-range deep-strike drones. Overall, Ukraine produced approximately 2 million drones in 2024. Notably, 96.2 percent of all UAVs that the Ukrainian armed forces used in 2024 were produced domestically, demonstrating the country’s increasing reliance on homegrown technology and localization of production components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has also introduced into its arsenal more than 200 domestically developed unmanned aerial systems and more than 40 ground robotic platforms since February 2022. Most of these new systems entered service in 2024, showing that local manufacturing is adapting to war conditions and establishing reliable supply chains. Specifically, 140 UAV complexes (designs and unique configurations) and 33 ground robotic systems were approved for operation in the first nine months of 2024 alone. Together, these developments indicate a strategic move to increase self-sufficiency, reduce supply chain risks, and ensure that the Ukrainian military can rapidly adapt to the evolving demands of modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Ukraine’s strategic emphasis on autonomy reflects its transformative vision for the future battlefield, where advanced AI-enabled unmanned systems will replace humans in direct combat to address manpower limitations and operational vulnerabilities. By integrating modular software development and scaling domestic production, Ukraine is not only adapting to the immediate challenges of war but also laying the groundwork for a future autonomous battlefield environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-in-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance&quot;&gt;AI in Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to CSIS discussions with the Ukrainian military, the battlefield in the war in Ukraine critically differs from prior full-scale conflicts. Key factors of this distinction include the unprecedented proliferation of sensors on the front line, the extensive deployment of unmanned systems, and the exponential increase in data sources and volumes. Combined with advanced technological capabilities for data processing and analysis, these elements form part of the autonomous operational paradigm. In this paradigm, real-time situational awareness will provide machines with the contextual understanding required to act effectively within the operational environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Delta system, as outlined in an earlier paper in this series, is a good example of how the Ukrainian military’s intelligence sources provide video, photo, acoustic, and text data streams in tens of terabytes daily. After being processed, the data go back to the front line, but this time in the form of detailed information on enemy locations, equipment, movements, and activities placed on a digital map and presented in a single operational picture on the phone or tablet of almost every unit commander and even warfighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-challenges-in-isr&quot;&gt;Current Challenges in ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously outlined, the envisioned future battlefield differs greatly from practical realities. In ISR, three primary factors hinder the realization of the Ukrainian military’s desired future autonomous operational paradigm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations in Human Processing Capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Modern reconnaissance systems, particularly drones, generate large volumes of data at speeds that exceed human processing capabilities. Certain tasks—such as detecting small objects in high-altitude drone footage or interpreting faint acoustic signals—pose significant challenges to human analysts. Fatigue, decreased concentration, and slower work increase the risk of overlooking important information contained in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delays in Data Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Manual data processing is inherently time-consuming, creating significant lags in intelligence dissemination and operational decisions. Achieving real-time responsiveness becomes nearly impossible under these circumstances, preventing the fast execution of missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity of Synthesizing Multisource Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining and integrating insights from diverse sources, including imagery, signals, and other types of intelligence, presents an intricate puzzle for military analysts. Successful integration demands the alignment of various data streams into coherent predictions and actionable recommendations. This task is challenging in real war conditions, given that multiple teams or even different external companies are working to analyze incoming data streams.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ai-can-address-the-challenges&quot;&gt;How AI Can Address the Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that these limitations may be overcome and data can be quickly processed into high-quality intelligence information. AI allows for handling massive amounts of multisource data in near-real time. Within a broad portfolio of AI-enabled capabilities, there are methods and systems that can help tackle each challenge, from detecting enemy equipment in drone footage to interpreting diverse formats of unstructured textual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 provides a summary of the main data types, the tasks involved in processing them, and the AI-enabled techniques used for these purposes. A more detailed explanation of these techniques is provided in subsequent sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TOiqEm9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: ISR Sources and the Role of AI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagery and Video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imagery and video data the Ukrainian military receives comprises a variety of pictures, video, and objects and comes in different formats and quality. Traditional overhead intelligence primarily relies on satellite imagery and has significantly advanced due to the proliferation of commercial sector technologies and services. These include open-source platforms such as Google Earth and low Earth orbit satellites offering high-resolution imagery from companies like Maxar Technologies, Planet Labs, and Capella Space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this traditional satellite imagery, Ukraine has recently gained access to two novel layers of overhead intelligence. Both layers are obtained through drones conducting ISR missions. The first layer is collected by high-altitude reconnaissance UAVs, which private Ukrainian companies started to produce after the 2014 Russian invasion of Donbas. They made high-altitude reconnaissance available to Ukrainian forces quite widely and quickly after the full-scale invasion of 2022. The second layer of imagery comes from short ISR missions conducted at low altitudes by commercial drones such as the DJI Mavic and by Ukrainian domestic ISR drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All satellite and drone footage needs processing, analysis, and labeling. Computer vision using machine learning lies at the core of many AI-driven video and photo analysis systems. It effectively addresses the challenge of detecting and classifying objects in visual data using deep learning algorithms. By identifying objects such as military equipment or weapons, these algorithms are the basis for additional tasks like object tracking and image captioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle the spatial and temporal nature of videos, two main types of neural networks are commonly employed: 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). CNNs work by analyzing patterns across space and time, capturing how an object or action evolves from one video frame to the next, whereas RNNs track and interpret sequential data, making them effective for tasks like recognizing specific movements or repetitive activities. These methods train machines to detect objects regardless of changing poses or angles, mirroring how humans recognize items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-time processing complicates the task of object recognition, as it requires analyzing 30 or more frames per second. With each frame containing millions of pixels, the task becomes computationally very demanding, resulting in high costs for such video processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 1: AI-Assisted Drone Footage Analysis Conducted by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first case study presents an example of how the Ukrainian military is using AI-enabled systems to extract as much useful information as possible with the limited resources available. A team of volunteers, which later evolved into the Avengers team within the Ministry of Defence’s Delta system project, began developing a video and imagery analysis platform at the outset of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. At that time, Russian military equipment was moving extensively across Ukrainian territory, creating an urgent need for the Ukrainian armed forces to track enemy movements and identify the types and locations of Russian equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this need, the Avengers team initially collected and annotated footage from stationary cameras along major roads and highways. Then they used the data to train AI models capable of recognizing various objects, determining geographic locations through metadata, and providing critical insights into Russian troop movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when Russian forces retreated from northern Ukraine, combat shifted to a more conventional battlefield. The free movement of Russian equipment ceased in most areas, rendering the stationary camera footage (and the models trained on it) less useful. The team began receiving and analyzing drone footage, which presented new challenges, such as varying perspectives, resolutions, and object sizes. Moreover, the amount of footage to be analyzed drastically increased. The Avengers team had to respond by changing its approach to focus on creating infrastructure for AI training, such as employing structured and labeled datasets, developing a secure testing environment for external AI-enabled tools development, and integrating with other products within the Delta ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a foundation for AI integration into the process of drone footage analysis, the Avengers team took the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing Labeling Practices:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2022, no enterprise solution was capable of analyzing drone footage and classifying Russian equipment. This required the team to develop AI models to assist analysts with annotations. However, these models had to be trained on large, relevant datasets. Therefore, creating AI training datasets became the first step in preparing for the transition to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dataset labeling is a labor-intensive task that requires significant human effort. Because the Ministry of Defence lacked sufficient internal resources, diverse groups, including volunteers and private sector teams, supported its efforts in labeling data. To ensure consistency, the Avengers team introduced formalized labeling standards and protocols. These guidelines outlined parameters to consider during dataset labeling, such as resolution, seasonal variations, metadata, and other relevant factors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As a result, the Avengers team created a “universal military data set,” which adhered to these formalized labeling guidelines, making the dataset consistent and standardized. This dataset is large enough to enable high accuracy in AI model performance and may be filtered to produce smaller, more specific datasets for various use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a Validation Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; To benchmark AI model performance, the team created a separate validation dataset containing content that does not overlap with the universal military dataset. For instance, if a model is trained to detect a specific Russian tank, the validation dataset includes color variations and images of the tank camouflaged, hidden in the bush, or with an antidrone net. This approach allows the model to provide accurate assessments of false positives and improves the model’s overall reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing Small, Specialized AI Models:&lt;/strong&gt; Operational experience has demonstrated that smaller, specialized models can achieve much greater accuracy in analyzing drone footage than a single comprehensive AI model. Therefore, Avengers and external teams started to produce multiple smaller models, each tailored to specific data types (e.g., footage from particular drones and satellite imagery). This approach enhances accuracy and relevance for distinct operational scenarios, focusing primarily on the hardest cases for the human eye and human attention: small objects in low resolution and poor-quality footage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating External AI Model Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Avengers allow vetted developers to train their models securely, using selected portions of the universal dataset without exposing sensitive data. For instance, a drone manufacturer can request footage from drones that match characteristics of its product, such as a particular flight altitude, camera type, or resolution requirement, and train its algorithm within the platform’s protected environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Toward Autonomous Analysis of Real-Time Footage:&lt;/strong&gt; The platform integrates with a live-streaming system called VEZHA, which is part of the Delta ecosystem and is designed to analyze real-time drone footage. Although human operators still carry out most of the analytical tasks such as classifying and logging events, improvements in AI model performance and integration with the streaming service have led to a growing role for AI-assisted analysis. This analysis may be divided into two primary use cases:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; In this scenario, AI algorithms help prioritize videos based on the number and intensity of observable events, such as active combat or significant troop and equipment movement. Drone feeds from reconnaissance missions over relatively empty fields are deprioritized. VEZHA also enables multiple operators to watch the same stream simultaneously and jointly log detected events (e.g., tank positions, destroyed vehicles, and artillery strikes). These events are then connected to a digital map (e.g., via the Delta monitor) and supplemented with screenshots and details for broader situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postanalysis:&lt;/strong&gt; The VEZHA team only applies postanalysis to the most challenging cases, such as low-resolution or high-altitude footage. Because AI-assisted analysis consumes considerable computational resources, the system prioritizes difficult footage over videos that are inherently clearer, such as those captured by low-flying Mavic drones, in which objects are more easily visible to humans. As a result, automated detection resources are conserved for situations where they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 2: Vector, an ISR Drone System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum Systems, a drone technology firm based in Germany, the United States, and Australia—with a newly established facility in Kyiv—has been testing and supplying its systems to Ukraine since March 2022. What began as a small donation of a few Vector drone systems and a focus on training Ukrainian forces has rapidly evolved into a large-scale partnership, with more than 500 systems now deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum Systems’ Vector drones serve ISR functions in Ukrainian strike missions. Acting as agile spotters, they locate targets and transmit precise data to heavier strike drones such as the Ukrainian-made Nemesis. This synergy ensures efficient fire support and artillery corrections. Quantum Systems has tackled widespread Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming by employing optical navigation and advanced data links provided by Silvus interference avoidance software. The system enables autonomous scanning and switching to alternative frequencies when one is jammed, maintaining mission-critical communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of the Vector drone design is its modular architecture. Swappable nose cones and imaging systems allow customization depending on mission needs. Equipped with day-and-night Boson cameras and powered by onboard Nvidia Jetson Orin AI computers, these drones collect high-resolution imagery and process it in real time, even under GPS‑denied conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum Systems is deploying Receptor AI, an advanced software package that enables drones to autonomously perform target recognition. While still under development, these algorithms will be trained to recognize targets based on Ukrainian datasets, ensuring better adaptability to real-world combat settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite investing heavily in AI to enhance autonomy, Quantum Systems emphasizes keeping human operators in the loop. This human oversight, company representatives told CSIS, should ensure that ethical considerations, strategic objectives, and final decisionmaking remain under direct human control, even as the technology progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acoustic Reconnaissance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acoustic reconnaissance is the practice of using sound to gather intelligence and monitor environments. It is not a new concept. It has been employed in various forms for decades, from submarine sonar systems during World War II to early warning systems detecting aircraft or artillery fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the integration of AI has revolutionized this field by automating the classification and recognition of sounds with precision and speed. AI technology enables systems to process audio data in real time, making it possible to detect and differentiate sound patterns that are challenging to identify with human hearing alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-driven acoustic reconnaissance relies on a set of techniques nearly identical to those used for video footage analysis. It uses advanced machine learning techniques and neural networks, such as CNNs and RNNs, to analyze audio signals. These neural networks are trained to extract features from sound waves and classify them accordingly. Tools like spectrogram analysis, enhanced by deep learning, allow systems to visualize and interpret acoustic signals, distinguishing between the sounds of drones, vehicles, footsteps, and even specific environmental noises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 3: Zvook, an Acoustic Reconnaissance System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following case study of the acoustic reconnaissance system Zvook illustrates how such technologies are implemented in practice in Ukraine. Ukraine’s use of acoustic detection systems has significantly advanced not only ISR but also air defense capabilities. Zvook uses sound analysis to detect and identify aerial threats at lower altitudes, where radar is less effective. It employs high-quality microphones and curved acoustic mirrors to concentrate sound waves, and it uses a computer the size of a shoebox placed behind the dish to process the captured sounds. Currently, Zvook covers approximately 20,000 square km of Ukraine with its grid-like placement of acoustic sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to radar, these systems are cheaper, with each station costing around $500. They are also passive (i.e., they do not emit detectable signals) and are particularly effective against low-flying drones, with detection ranges of up to 4.8 km for drones and 6.9 km for cruise missiles. Zvook processes data quickly, with detections typically appearing in the Delta situational awareness system within 12 seconds. The rate of false positives is just 1.6 percent. The information shared inlcudes the type of target and its sound, location, and direction of movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI capabilities for Zvook’s acoustic analysis were introduced through collaboration with the Ukrainian tech startup Respeecher, which before the war was working on AI-generated voices for collaborations with Hollywood. Reespeecher’s AI algorithms, particularly those based on machine learning, analyze acoustic signals captured by sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, AI-powered analysis filters potential aerial threats from all other sounds, such as cars, birds, and people. Second, the AI system is trained to classify different types of aerial threats based on their unique sound signatures. For instance, it can distinguish between helicopters, cruise missiles, drones with gasoline engines, and turboprop aircraft using sound alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest generation of these acoustic sensors and AI models brings an innovative feature: the ability to detect the direction of the sound source, including the azimuth and elevation angle. This means that multiple sensors can now work in tandem, using the intersecting azimuth information from different locations to precisely determine the coordinates, course, and speed of the target. Essentially, this transforms the system into a passive acoustic radar, providing a new layer of detection that complements existing radar systems. The Zvook system’s effectiveness has led to the use of radar primarily in response to acoustic alerts. Many radar installations are by default turned off to avoid emissions, which might invite Russian attacks. Zvook allows Ukrainian radars to be turned on only in priority situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a new type of drone or other weapons system appears, the team needs about a week to collect a big enough dataset for AI model training to recognize its sound. After that, the software of acoustic stations is upgraded remotely so that all sensors can recognize the new type of threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Text Information Analysis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian military receives text data in large volumes, primarily from three categories of sources: (1) intercepted communications of Russian forces converted to text, (2) chat messages used within the Ukrainian military for information exchange, and (3) reports submitted by civilians through chatbot applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handling text-based intelligence is another core area where AI excels. Natural language processing (NLP) and related machine learning approaches can sift through vast collections of messages, chats, and intercepted communications, extracting important insights. Techniques such as named entity recognition and topic modeling identify significant information—like names, locations, or critical events—and highlight patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. By rapidly cross-referencing multiple sources, these AI-driven systems bring geolocated information on a map, indicating the positions and movements of enemy equipment or forces. Consequently, these text-based sources of information serve as an additional layer of data that is equally valuable for enhancing real-time situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 4: ePPO, an Air Defense System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ePPO is a mobile application that uses AI to collect and analyze reports from civilians about air threats, such as missiles and drones. To use the ePPO application, users must first verify their identity through the government’s Diia app. Once verified, they can report observed aerial threats by selecting the type of object—drone, missile, aircraft, or helicopter—and pressing a large red button to send the alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI processes the data to estimate the most likely trajectory of the threats, predicting their direction and speed. According to Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defence Kateryna Chernohorenko, the process ensures that within two to seven seconds the data is transmitted to a digital map, which is accessible to all air defense officers. In a social media post, the deputy minister highlighted that the system significantly enhances Ukrainian efforts to repel drone and missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique feature of the app called “It’s coming your way” is a personalized warning to users if a threat is likely to impact their location. The warning is issued based on the AI-enabled data fusion and projection of flight trajectories. Within about 10 minutes of data collection, the AI delivers approximate coordinates of the threat’s movement to users, allowing them to take timely precautions. With more than 600,000 downloads and 200,000 active users contributing to this collective radar system, the ePPO app represents a significant advancement in leveraging crowdsourced data and AI to enhance air defense and protect civilians during the ongoing conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 5: Griselda, a Data Analysis Platform&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Griselda is an AI-driven system for processing unstructured data that may be customized for a wide range of uses. Griselda is sometimes described as Ukraine’s Palantir. In an interview with CSIS, the company’s founder, Oleksiy Teplukhin, shared two notable applications of this technology that use largely the same underlying methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first use case is analyzing group chats to derive actionable intelligence. At the beginning of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, warfighters predominantly shared intelligence information through group chats or messenger platforms such as Signal. Although more advanced communication systems (e.g., Delta) and specialized military channels exist, basic platforms remain widely used even today. Certain channels receive thousands of messages daily, often containing unstructured and unstandardized battlefield reports—such as sightings of Russian equipment. But this high volume of fragmented data can overwhelm frontline warfighters, making it almost impossible to extract essential insights in time without a technical solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example addresses the management of Russian intercepted audio communications from multiple sources. Traditionally, processing such extensive audio datasets requires considerable human resources, including large-scale call centers staffed by numerous analysts responsible for transcription, comprehension, and extraction of relevant details. This approach is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors, limiting its efficiency and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, Griselda, which partners with the Ukrainian military on both cases, automates processes with the help of AI. The system replaces human operators in critical functions such as transcription, semantic analysis, and identification of entities and key data points within the intercepted conversations. Moreover, the AI constructs ontological graphs, enabling pattern recognition and semantic connections across vast datasets. These graphs allow analysts to uncover insights and relationships that would be impossible for humans to discern manually. By automating these workflows, AI reduces the need for human labor by an estimated 99 percent, according to Teplukhin. Operationally, this breakthrough translates into markedly enhanced speed, accuracy, and effectiveness in processing intelligence information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Griselda is integrated with Delta, which ensures that all intelligence insights are instantaneously disseminated throughout the chain of command. These insights are then visualized on a map, enabling seamless distribution to relevant personnel, including drone operators stationed in areas where suspicious activities have been detected. By directing their drones to the designated locations, these operators can validate the intelligence and gather additional details as necessary, thereby enhancing situational awareness and operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employing AI for preliminary data filtering and prioritization optimizes resources for real-time intelligence processing.&lt;/strong&gt; By automatically screening large volumes of incoming information—such as multiple video streams from reconnaissance drones—AI systems can highlight critical content that demands immediate attention. This approach helps analyst teams direct their limited bandwidth and processing power toward the most pertinent data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardizing the curation and labeling of military datasets enhances efficiency and flexibility in AI model development.&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting consistent protocols for tagging and organizing incoming data—from drone feeds to satellite imagery—makes it easier to separate relevant parameters for different AI applications and filter out smaller datasets. Both military and private sector teams can collaborate in this effort, ensuring that well-structured datasets are readily available for specialized training and more accurate model deployment. Of note, most of this standardization occurs organically instead of, for example, being driven by some standardization committee or organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building specialized smaller-scale AI models addresses specific operational challenges more effectively.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of relying on a single, all-encompassing model, smaller specialized AI models can be trained on targeted subsets of larger datasets for focused tasks. This approach not only enables more precise problem solving but also streamlines the model-training process, making solutions more adaptable to changing mission requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trends&quot;&gt;Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian military authorities are increasingly demanding the integration of all unmanned reconnaissance systems into situational awareness and fire-correction platforms.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian military expects manufacturers of unmanned ISR systems of any size and domain, whether designed for tactical or strategic operations, to feed relevant data into shared intelligence systems (e.g., Delta). This demand helps ensure all reconnaissance activities collectively contribute to a comprehensive real-time operational picture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ukrainian military is shifting toward AI-enabled real-time multisensor fusion to enhance situational awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; By integrating data from drone imagery, satellite photos, acoustic signals, and textual information, Ukrainian forces create a continuously updated operational picture. This shift increases the need for advanced data-fusion technologies, ensuring that AI tools rapidly extract insights from every source and merge them into a unified common operating picture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI systems are evolving beyond basic data analytics to provide commanders with actionable insights and strategic recommendations throughout the target engagement cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; Building on real-time intelligence assessments, these tools soon will not only highlight potential threats but also propose prioritized targets, identify gaps in available resources, and determine which assets are best suited to neutralize a given threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military agencies are easing access to vetted datasets for external developers, providing an opportunity to keep their AI models accurate and relevant.&lt;/strong&gt; By allowing approved private companies and researchers to securely train or test AI models on government-provided data within secure environments, this approach significantly lowers the burden of data collection for companies. These efforts seek to develop a pool of advanced AI models better tailored to rapidly evolving operational needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-enabled real-time situational awareness provides the foundation for joint all-domain operations.&lt;/strong&gt; AI-enabled data fusion, integrating intelligence from land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace into one cohesive view, provides a foundation for synchronized actions across domains. It is also a basis for collaboration with allied partners in executing combined operations, allowing decisionmakers to quickly align resources, identify threats, and exploit tactical opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-in-automatic-target-recognition&quot;&gt;AI in Automatic Target Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatic target recognition (ATR) is a suite of technologies that automate the detection, classification, and tracking of objects or individuals. At its core, ATR relies on pattern recognition algorithms that match incoming sensor data against a set of known templates or behavioral models, flagging unusual features as potential targets. It is not a new concept to the military, but AI changes the way ATR works and the way ATR systems are developed, enabling enhanced performance and reducing costs that previously put such applications out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, ATR follows a three‑step process. First, an AI-enabled ATR system detects targets by scanning a designated area for any signs of interest, drawing on both visual and nonvisual sensor data. Once a target is detected, the system classifies it by identifying what it most likely represents—for example, a vehicle, a person, or a structure. Finally, the system tracks each identified target, continuously updating position information and projecting possible movements or changes in status. This continuous monitoring is particularly valuable in fast‑evolving tactical scenarios, as it gives warfighters on the ground up‑to‑the‑second insight into potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on the role of ATR as a built-in feature of unmanned systems, demonstrating how onboard AI applications help bring these platforms closer to fully autonomous operations. In particular, target recognition plays a pivotal role in enabling future AWSs to independently select targets, though ATR is often incorporated into systems that do not meet the definition of an AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By automating target identification, ATR technology bolsters real-time decisionmaking—whether a human operator or the system itself executes those decisions. Its foundation in AI-based algorithms and sensor fusion also makes it highly adaptable to ever-shifting battlefield conditions and marks a significant leap in harnessing AI’s ability to process complex data efficiently, accurately, and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-challenges-in-atr&quot;&gt;Current Challenges in ATR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although ATR technology has become essential on the modern battlefield, it still faces significant limitations. While it performs well in controlled environments, its adaptability and precision diminish under the complex and dynamic conditions of a real war. The following are some key obstacles facing human‑operated drones equipped with ATR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of Decoys and Camouflage:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most pressing challenges for ATR lies in distinguishing between genuine threats and elaborate deceptions. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces frequently deploy decoys, such as inflatable tanks or false artillery installations, and advanced camouflage techniques, confounding target recognition algorithms and human operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Warfare (EW) Interference:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to physical countermeasures, both sides employ robust EW systems designed to disrupt drone communications, sensor data feeds, and the broader chain of command. EW interference impairs real‑time data transfer, making it far more difficult for drones or their operators to reliably identify and confirm targets. As a result, ATR must operate in environments with degraded or intermittent communication links, handling target recognition and tracking tasks with onboard processing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dealing with low visibility and dense urban environments.&lt;/strong&gt; Natural and man-made factors—such as fog, rain, snow, and nighttime operations—can significantly reduce the effectiveness of standard optical and infrared sensors. In such scenarios, ATR may rely on alternative methods like radar or acoustic detection, which come with their own performance limitations. Urban settings in eastern Ukraine add another layer of complexity given the dense infrastructure. Highly sophisticated sensors and algorithms and well‑trained operators often get confused, but Ukrainian developers strive to maintain accurate targeting while minimizing collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ai-can-address-the-challenges-1&quot;&gt;How AI Can Address the Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI offers significant advantages in the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of identifying and tracking targets in complex operational environments. The good news is that AI-enabled ATR software may be integrated directly onboard an unmanned system. By processing data within a localized, self-contained network, AI algorithms can fuse multiple sensor inputs to give warfighters an understanding of their surroundings and the target, even without live communication with base situational awareness systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of AI-enabled ATR is the ability to detect and classify targets more rapidly and accurately than human operators. Advanced machine learning algorithms, trained on datasets that include real-world combat scenarios, can distinguish among vehicles, human figures, and structures in various terrain and weather conditions. Operating continuously without fatigue, these systems pick up subtle distinctions that human observers might miss, enabling identification of decoys and camouflaged targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond mere detection, AI excels at rapidly prioritizing multiple targets based on real-time variables such as threat level, proximity to friendly forces, and mission objectives. Some Ukrainian AI-enabled ATR systems use the same techniques as described in the ISR section (convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) as well as other techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, in this case, the AI models are integrated into the unmanned system’s onboard software. With such capabilities, a drone can process massive amounts of sensor data and apply predictive models in real time during the mission. AI systems can determine and advise operators regarding which threats require immediate engagement. As a result, AI reduces the cognitive load on human operators while ensuring that vital decisions—such as which target to engage first—are made more rapidly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-driven autonomy also increases resilience against enemy countermeasures, particularly those aimed at disrupting communication links and navigation systems. By shifting from human control to human oversight, AI-enabled platforms can maintain their targeting focus even if the operator’s signal is jammed or lost. Moreover, technologies like pixel lock can support high-precision tracking, allowing drones to maintain a lock on targets despite interruptions in operator communication—a critical benefit in environments subject to heavy EW interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models fuel this resilience, allowing the system to learn from each operation and refine its responses over time. Through reinforcement learning and other adaptive techniques, AI can identify emerging adversary tactics and continuously improve a platform’s targeting accuracy. This iterative learning cycle helps drones stay effective in fast-changing combat conditions, ultimately minimizing operational downtime and preserving critical military assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these AI-based technologies are still in their early stages of deployment on Ukrainian battlefields—limited, for now, to basic object recognition and tracking rather than advanced predictive models or onboard recommendation systems—their use by Ukrainian warfighters continues to grow in both scale and sophistication. In parallel, military authorities are actively developing regulatory frameworks and operational procedures to facilitate and standardize (especially for procurement) the adoption of these emerging systems, thereby laying the groundwork for more sophisticated AI capabilities in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 6: ZIR, an Autonomy Kit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company ZIR Systemspecializes in developing software that can complement almost any type of strike drone. The key feature of the software and the reason it is called ZIR (which means “eyesight” in Ukrainian) is its ability to automatically detect targets. The system includes a hardware component—a compact module with a computer and a digital camera—and a software component, which in this case involves a pretrained AI model capable of identifying targets. This software also adds some autonomous navigation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hardware module, approximately the size of a bar of soap, is designed for seamless integration across a variety of platforms, from quadcopters to aircraft. Presets exist for 7–10 inch standard quadcopter models. For fixed-wing drones, the company provides only essential wiring and components, leaving manufacturers to address weight balancing, camera placement, and other aspects of their product design. Although the hardware integration process may appear straightforward, each new drone still requires manual adjustments. Therefore, the overall process of integrating the ZIR kit can take from several weeks up to a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI-powered software, trained on open-source data, can identify various target types—including infantry, civilian automobiles, minivans, trucks, air defense systems, artillery, armored vehicles, and tanks. It automatically detects targets and locks on them from 1 km away and operates autonomously up to 3 km away, even in tough EW environments. With precision of roughly 90 cm, it can also engage moving targets traveling at speeds up to 64 km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is pursuing the goal of full autonomy by developing a system that can independently fly and detect and engage targets. To advance this goal, the company employs ArduPilot, an open-source autopilot software for unmanned vehicles that supports autonomous navigation, waypoint planning, and real-time telemetry. Through ArduPilot, the system can operate without communication by uploading missions to locate and neutralize targets within a specified zone. Additionally, optical navigation replaces GPS in environments lacking satellite coverage, a capability tested and validated by a successful three-mile test range flight that returned to its starting point without GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional key consideration for the company is the system’s ease of use and the speed at which operators can train to use it. To achieve this, the company continuously collects feedback from new pilots, identifying issues they encounter and addressing these areas for improvement. The company also provides both video and written instructions for its software and hardware usage and collaborates with drone schools by integrating the training for its system into their curriculum. Operators can learn the fundamental principles of targeting systems in a single day and enhance their proficiency with further practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 7: Skydio’s ATR Evolution from Consumer Tech to Battlefield AI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with CSIS, the Skydio team shared that their journey in Ukraine began with a critical weakness: Its older drone, the X2, operated on static frequencies, making them highly vulnerable to EW. Initially designed based on U.S. military procurement requirements from the early 2010s, these drones lacked frequency agility, as they were intended for environments like Iraq and Afghanistan, where EW challenges were minimal or absent. Consequently, when the war in Ukraine erupted in 2022, the drones struggled against Russian jamming. Just as the Skydio team had warned, EW led to communication failures, reduced operational range, and a damaged reputation among Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to address these shortcomings, Skydio teams made over 30 visits to Ukraine between 2022 and 2024, which helped to incorporate insights from the battlefield into the development of the the X10D drone. While the drone can resist jamming, navigate without GPS, and integrate into various command and control systems, the X10D mainly addresses broader requirements from the commercial sector and for public safety. However, the focus in this case study is a breakthrough in ATR that became central to the drone’s effectiveness in ISR missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skydio’s ATR capabilities have evolved from simple object tracking—first developed for consumer drones in 2014—to a sophisticated detection system that uses deep learning. Initially used to track athletes in sports applications, the software was later adapted for military use. Today, Skydio’s deep learning and computer vision teams continuously refine these models, enhancing detection accuracy for both electro-optical and infrared imagery. The X10D now features the most advanced thermal camera in its class, providing radiometric infrared imaging, which allows operators to assess temperature variations, detect heat signatures, and determine whether, for example, a vehicle was recently active or has been abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATR capabilities are enhanced with Skydio’s focus visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The X10D drone is equipped with six ultra-wide-angle navigation cameras, covering more than 200 degrees each, allowing it to create a 3D map for obstacle avoidance. Initially, VIO was limited to flights below 30 m in altitude, as higher altitudes lacked sufficient visual features for stable navigation. However, by using improved traditional geometric computer vision techniques and leveraging a large amount of internal Skydio data, Skydio extended its GPS-denied navigation to 300 m in altitude, making it far more practical for tactical reconnaissance in both open battlefields and urban environments. This improvement has been crucial for urban warfare and ISR missions in dense cityscapes, where GPS signals are often unreliable due to EW or structural interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maximize its impact, Skydio has worked to integrate X10D drones into Ukraine’s command and control networks, including the Delta system, used by the military and other agencies’ systems. This integration allows sharing drone ISR feeds across multiple units, enhancing battlefield situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these advancements, Skydio has shipped about a 1,000 drones to Ukraine, many of which are now deployed on the Ukrainian battlefield. They are primarily used for tactical ISR, helping to detect, track, and target enemy assets, including other drones, ground vehicles, and EW units. Their ability to resist jamming, navigate without GPS, and provide high-fidelity ATR data has significantly improved their effectiveness in combined drone and artillery strike operations, a key tactic in Ukraine’s evolving drone warfare strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned-1&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegating target recognition tasks to AI-enabled ATR systems onboard unmanned platforms has proved highly effective in reducing human-related limitations and enhancing mission outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt; By automating equipment identification and other object-detection processes, drones lessen the burden on frontline personnel, who might be hindered by fatigue, stress, or skill level. This shift allows operators to concentrate on more complex, high-level decisionmaking, ultimately improving operational efficiency and situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian drone manufacturers prioritize developing specialized autonomy features that can integrate with any unmanned platform.&lt;/strong&gt; These companies have developed their core business models around refining standalone autonomous capabilities, such as AI-enabled ATR. They aim to ensure seamless implementation across a variety of unmanned systems, thereby accelerating overall technological advancement in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian engineers leverage open-source technologies and existing computer vision models to accelerate research and development and make it more affordable.&lt;/strong&gt; By incorporating readily available software solutions, including open-source computer vision frameworks, developers can expedite the creation and deployment of ATR systems. This cost-effective strategy is particularly appealing for attritable or expendable platforms, where reduced unit and development costs outweigh the benefits of highly customized solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trends-1&quot;&gt;Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The proven efficiency of ATR-equipped systems drives the Ukrainian military to start procuring more drones with autonomous capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2024, recognizing the operational advantages of ATR, Ukrainian forces initiated the procurement of 10,000 drones featuring AI-enhanced autonomy—an early step toward broader adoption of advanced autonomous systems. Although this number remains a fraction of the nearly 2 million drones contracted in 2024, it signals a significant move toward more autonomous and capable platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipping drones with affordable onboard computers enables AI models to perform real-time target recognition.&lt;/strong&gt; By installing low-cost processors directly into drone hardware, Ukrainian forces can deploy compact AI modules capable of identifying targets without relying on extensive external processing. This approach reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, and provides greater operational flexibility, particularly in environments where connectivity or remote computing may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AI training techniques that require smaller datasets simplifies target recognition for drone missions.&lt;/strong&gt; Training AI algorithms typically demands extensive high-quality data. However, newer models designed for smaller datasets allow for more rapid development and adaptation. This efficiency leads to quicker deployment of ATR functionalities, even when comprehensive training data for certain target types is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To address evolving countermeasures like decoys and camouflage, Ukrainian engineers make continuous model upgrades and frequently retrain on updated operational data.&lt;/strong&gt; As adversaries adopt innovative methods to evade detection, ATR models must be repeatedly refined with real-world data. Regular updates not only keep the AI current but also mitigate the risk of misidentification due to emerging tactics, ensuring consistent target recognition performance under varying battlefield conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A modular approach to ATR integration extends the technology’s applicability across a wide range of unmanned platforms.&lt;/strong&gt; For instance, when turrets are equipped with ATR systems, their precision in targeting and firing increases significantly. These turrets, in turn, may be mounted on trucks or unmanned ground vehicles, broadening their operational use and enhancing overall mission versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ai-in-autonomous-navigation&quot;&gt;AI in Autonomous Navigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While impressive footage of drones striking fleeing Russian soldiers and estimates valuing destroyed equipment in the millions of dollars may captivate public attention, these visuals do not fully represent the complexities involved. Ukrainian operators on the front lines shared in interviews with CSIS that most small, low-cost FPV drone missions succeed only about 10 to 15 percent of the time, and even highly skilled operators typically reach only a 30 to 50 percent success rate. A last-mile navigation system can offer a significant boost to these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Ukrainian military, last-mile navigation specifically refers to the mechanism that guides the drone through its final approach once it is within visual range and the operator has confirmed the target. Although originally designed as an integrated feature, last-mile solutions are now procured as standalone systems that may be installed on various drone platforms. While their integration requires certain hardware upgrades—such as adding a compact computing chip or replacing analog cameras with digital ones—these modifications remain relatively simple, providing a flexible pathway toward more autonomous drone operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-challenges-in-autonomous-navigation&quot;&gt;Current Challenges in Autonomous Navigation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low success rate of drone strike missions reveals several critical challenges, which can be divided into four major issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Human Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Operating FPV drones demands a specialized skill set that differs significantly from piloting consumer drones such as the DJI Mavic—often referred to in Ukrainian military circles as the “iPhone of drones” for its self-stabilization and automated flight functions. FPV drones require precise manual control of pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle, leaving little room for error.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This complexity is magnified by a range of operational stressors, including signal latency delays of two to three seconds, harsh weather conditions, and fast-moving, unpredictable targets. Drone operators must adapt quickly to these variables while facing the added pressure of battlefield threats, such as the risk of detection and counterattack. Combined, these factors considerably increase the likelihood of operator mistakes and the attractiveness of last-mile autonomous navigation. For example, if the target is on a fast-moving vehicle, the signal latency alone may mean that autonomous last-mile navigation (sometimes referred to as “terminal navigation”) is required for a successful strike.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; EW remains a constant threat to drone operations, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces deploying advanced jamming and spoofing techniques. Jamming specifically involves broadcasting high‑power electromagnetic energy over a particular frequency band—commonly used for radio control or GPS—to drown out legitimate signals, severing the communication link between a drone and its operator. Once the drone loses access to navigational or positional data, it becomes nearly impossible to steer or monitor unless it has alternative capabilities onboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the Russian side, EW units employ two main strategies. The first consists of localized protection bubbles, a type of portable equipment that jams signals within a radius of roughly 200–300 m around high‑value assets, thwarting drones during their final approach. The second strategy, long‑range jamming, relies on large power generators and specialized equipment to project disruption across much larger areas. Although localized jamming affects only a confined zone, both methods pose formidable challenges for UAVs dependent on sustained operator remote control.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notably, Ukraine’s EW efforts sometimes intensify these difficulties. According to Colonel Vadym Sukharevskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces, friendly jamming in shared airspace frequently interferes with Ukrainian drones, creating additional layers of complexity for operators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radio Wave Physics:&lt;/strong&gt; The physical limitations of radio wave propagation present another challenge. The radio horizon, where terrain or obstacles such as hills and buildings interrupt signals, can isolate drones from their operators, leaving them stranded and unable to complete missions. Although relay systems can partially address this issue, they are not always available or reliable in the fast-changing and unpredictable conditions of the battlefield, further complicating effective navigation and final approach to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaging a Moving Target:&lt;/strong&gt; This issue is an especially challenging task and a unique skill for drone operators to master. When a drone chases a target from behind, the relative speed of its approach is reduced due to their simultaneous movement in the same direction, which gives an operator more time to react to changes in movement. In contrast, a head-on approach increases difficulty because both drone and target converge at high speed, limiting the window for flight path adjustments and often requiring some prediction. Lateral or perpendicular movements exacerbate the problem further, as an operator must constantly align with the target’s shifting position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ai-can-address-challenges&quot;&gt;How AI Can Address Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major step toward overcoming the challenges of battlefield drone operations is autonomous navigation, which leverages machine learning instead of using fixed, rule-based commands. By integrating advanced AI algorithms and sensor suites directly onto the drone, these platforms can make instantaneous decisions about flight paths, localization, and obstacle avoidance independently of a constant operator feed. In essence, the drone constructs an evolving picture of its environment using machine vision and deep learning algorithms, enabling it to map surroundings, pinpoint its location without GPS, and dynamically chart a course around unforeseen hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition to autonomous flight becomes most critical once a target is identified, whether via ATR or manual operator input. At this stage, a last-mile guidance system assumes direct control over flight, charting a final approach and engagement path. By relying on real-time sensor inputs, the drone adjusts for variables like wind gusts, shifting terrain, or unanticipated obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques such as visual odometry allow the drone to continuously assess its position, maintaining stable flight even under degraded communications. Consequently, localized EW efforts—often limited to a specific radius—lose much of their disruptive power: the drone locks onto a target from beyond jamming range and proceeds without a human in the loop, significantly lowering the risk of signal loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future iterations of last-mile guidance can achieve an even higher degree of precision against moving targets. With adaptive flight path corrections and predictive modeling informed by large datasets of vehicle or human movement, AI systems can anticipate potential maneuvers. Simultaneously, continuous optical tracking further refines these forecasts, allowing the drone to rapidly respond to sudden deviations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although current systems still operate within what drone operators call a “reasonable impact radius”—meaning a tank or trench is likely to be hit, though not necessarily at its most vulnerable point—ongoing AI advancements and refinements in onboard hardware promise to narrow this margin considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 8: VGI-9, an Autonomous Navigation System&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As drone manufacturers shared with CSIS, VGI-9 is one of the most widely used targeting systems. It transforms an FPV drone into a semiautonomous weapons system capable of locking on the target and striking even moving targets at speeds of up to 80 km/h with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the system requires a secure PIN code to activate the targeting function before each mission. Consequently, adversaries capturing the drone without the code cannot use its targeting capabilities. Once the drone is airborne, the pilot guides it to the operational zone while observing a real-time video feed with an enlarged picture in the corner of the screen to facilitate precise target identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system continuously monitors EW threats. The on-screen interface provides real-time feedback on signal interference through received signal strength (RSS) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indications. If enemy jamming is present, the SNR value drops close to or below zero, indicating that the drone connection is heavily disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counteract this, the drone is equipped with a cruise control mode. If the drone encounters a disruption, the operator maintains a steady altitude and activates cruise control. As the name suggests, once engaged, the mode locks the drone’s altitude, speed, and direction, allowing it to continue its flight path even in areas with severe signal jamming. This fail-safe ensures the drone does not crash due to signal loss but instead bypasses jamming zones and remains operational beyond them, where the enemy forces or precious equipment can be located. This feature alone significantly increases the chances of mission success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the drone approaches the target area, the pilot searches for the target. Once the target is visually confirmed, the pilot activates the target lock-on function. At this point, control transitions from manual flight to autonomous engagement. The drone’s onboard system locks on to the selected point and begins its final descent toward the target without requiring further input from the pilot. If communication is still available, the pilot retains limited ability to make microadjustments. Using the right control stick, the pilot can slightly adjust the drone’s trajectory to ensure an optimal strike (e.g., the least-armored portion of an enemy tank).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fully autonomous strike, the system ensures the drone stays on course, even without pilot intervention. The drone’s onboard AI handles the last moments of navigation, ensuring the maximum probability of a successful hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current state of this technology has limitations. The system significantly enhances effectiveness against large, high-value targets like tanks and artillery, but its precision is limited when targeting specific parts of a vehicle. While it ensures the drone reaches the target, it does not guarantee a strike on an exact point, such as a vulnerable section of a tank, to destroy the target completely, though disabling the target remains feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 9: Autonomous Navigation from The Fourth Law&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yaroslav Azhnyuk, founder of the company The Fourth Law, told CSIS that his company’s goal is to develop an AI-enabled guidance system for UAVs that allows them to operate in fully autonomous mode. The Fourth Law developed a module for FPV drones—an inexpensive yet powerful electronic component that includes a camera and a small computer board with software that costs around $50 to $100. This module may be installed on any of the most common configurations of FPV drones, whether 7 or 10 inch, between the two mounting rails where the drone’s front camera is usually placed. This technology is already operational and in serial production, integrated with dozens of manufacturers, and these systems are actively in use on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstration made to CSIS showed an FPV feed with added zoom and an active “target seeker,” illustrating how analog video, despite its poor resolution, remains widely used for its low cost and reliability. Once the pilot identifies a moving truck within the zoomed area, flipping a single switch encases the target in a red square and hands control over to the onboard AI. Two algorithms then work together: one continuously tracks the target’s movement, while the other manages the drone’s complex flight mechanics. A separate neural network refines the target’s boundaries in real time, ensuring precise engagement despite the vehicle’s ongoing motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company representatives told CSIS that The Fourth Law will soon introduce last-mile guidance for fixed-wing drones, allowing greater flight range, overcoming radio horizon limitations, and extending the operational distance by 48–96 km. However, the last-mile guidance system is just the first step in the company’s five-step road map to full autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage is the development of autonomous last-mile bombing. The process works like the current system, but instead of crashing into the target, the drone drops a bomb. This autonomous payload release system is already being tested in a lab. A computer can execute a drop with far greater precision than a human, even from complex maneuvers that a human pilot could not perform in time. After bombing is finished, the pilot regains control, bringing the drone back instead of losing it after every mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third crucial technology is also undergoing testing. Automatic targeting uses neural networks to identify and track targets autonomously. The team has successfully optimized object recognition using neural networks to run efficiently on very inexpensive hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By combining all three technologies, the company hopes pilots need only launch the drone and assign a waypoint on the map. The drone would take off, fly to the target, execute the drop, return, and land—all in complete radio silence and full autonomy, without requiring pilot intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fourth step, the system will be able to navigate without GPS, using preloaded maps, onboard sensors, and optical navigation, ensuring mission success even in GPS-denied areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth stage of development involves automating takeoff and landing processes for both copter and fixed-wing drones, a critical advancement for the autonomous engagement of airborne threats such as enemy FPV drones. For instance, in a scenario in which troops are positioned in a trench under attack by enemy FPV drones, several sentry drones could be deployed in front of the trench and equipped with cameras to scan the sky. Upon detecting an incoming enemy FPV drone, these sentry drones could launch autonomously, either colliding with the threat or detonating nearby, thereby neutralizing the danger and safeguarding allied forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, The Fourth Law’s road map to full autonomy reflects the general approach Ukrainian companies take in developing autonomous capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 10: Ukrainian Long-Range-Strike Drones&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many military systems Ukraine is enhancing with AI capabilities are one-way attack drones (OWA-UAVs). While these kamikaze drones are used everywhere along the front line, long-range-strike drones with some elements of autonomy represent a particularly interesting case. These drones are developed exclusively in Ukraine and have seen widespread use across various Ukrainian agencies. Their effectiveness and fast evolution demonstrate their ability to reach nearly any strategically significant target inside Russia, carrying enough explosives to destroy critical infrastructure, including factories, buildings, and airfields, along with the aircraft stationed there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous navigation has become an indispensable feature of long-range-strike drones, as flying long distances into enemy territory requires overcoming the enemy’s air defense and a 60 km-wide strip of EW systems along the border. While official sources in Ukraine refuse to comment on the technology they use, an industry representative revealed in an interview with CSIS that some of these advanced drones leverage basic AI technology for navigation and antijamming capabilities. An onboard computer allows the drones to navigate in EW environments and follow the preplanned flight route, often developed using large amounts of intelligence data collected by Ukraine or shared by allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually such a flight path consists of more than 1,000 waypoints to evade Russia’s air defense systems. The computer uses machine vision algorithms to compare what the drone “sees” using its sensors with the satellite and terrain data preloaded in its computer. AI models, trained to recognize geography and targets, allow the drone to autonomously identify its location and navigate to its target during the final approach with high precision and without requiring satellite communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One prominent example of a successful long-range-strike drone is the Lyutyi, which is reportedly responsible for up to 80 percent of successful attacks on Russian oil refineries. However, this drone is not yet fully autonomous. It can conduct some parts of the flight route autonomously, but its final approach to the target is mainly a manual process. Ukrainian officials declined to comment on how the system maintains communication with operators during the final approach phase. Also, such long-range-strike missions require meticulous preparation by analysts, intelligence officers, special services, and the operators themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Lyutyi operator noted he usually receives a detailed target analysis before the mission. He does not know the people who create the analysis, but the mission plan is a 15–20-page document describing the target and mission plan in minute-by-minute detail. It includes comprehensive information on factors such as air defense systems, satellite imagery, and radar data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same operator illustrated the complexity of planning an attack route by describing the challenges associated with a drone’s approach to its target. The drone must approach the target against the wind, and can face additional obstacles in its trajectory, such as pipes or other structural elements, necessitating careful navigation to ensure precise strikes. Moreover, the target is situated over 1,250 km away, and the operation often proceeds without an optical channel, thereby intensifying the level of difficulty involved and showing that the drone is operated manually in the last-mile approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study 11: Autonomous Long-Range ISR Capability from Shield AI&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2024, CSIS conducted several discussions with Shield AI, a U.S. defense technology firm focused on AI and drone systems. These conversations provided insights into how the company’s technology and collaboration with the Ukrainian military have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in the summer of 2024, Shield AI delivered a small batch of V-BAT systems to Ukraine for testing. At the time, to contend with EW, the V-BATs relied on sophisticated frequency hopping, spectrum changes, and higher-powered communication links rather than fully autonomous functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in 2024, Shield AI organized a two-part demonstration of the V-BAT’s capabilities in Ukraine. The first phase took place at a testing range, where seven powerful jammers operated simultaneously to challenge the aircraft’s resilience—an exercise the V-BAT passed successfully. In the second phase, Ukrainian forces launched the V-BAT from roughly 40 km behind the front lines, flew it an additional 95 km into contested territory, and located a battery of SA-11 Buk surface-to-air missiles. During this mission, the V-BAT relayed the target coordinates for a successful High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) strike, with Shield AI engineers providing field support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both phases, the aircraft was equipped with Shield AI’s Hivemind software, which offers state estimation capability in GPS-denied environments. The company stated that such capabilities are crucial to mission success. This state estimation software employs factor graph optimization, enabling unmanned vehicles to accurately determine their position, orientation, and velocity in real time by integrating sensor data from cameras, GPS, and inertial measurement units, even in environments with limited communication or GPS access. The system continuously refines this sensor information, recognizing potential hazards and adapting its flight path accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstrations revealed another advantage of V-BAT for Ukrainian battlefield operations—its flight range and loiter times. When the operation time of a drone increases to 8 to 10 hours instead of 1 to 2, it dramatically enlarges the window for ISR missions to identify and track critical targets. Therefore, AI-driven navigation in GPS-denied environments has proved a cornerstone for long-duration reconnaissance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the Ukrainian military placed an order with Shield AI for more than 200 Shield AI drones, though the company’s production capacity at the time was only 120 units per year, according to an interview with company representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-learned-2&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous navigation makes drones strikes three to four times more likely to succeed.&lt;/strong&gt; By removing the need for constant manual control and stable communications—both vulnerable to EW and human stress—autonomous drones raise the target engagement success rate from around 10 to 20 percent to around 70 to 80 percent. Multiple interviewees from different Ukrainian military organizations and companies agreed that these figures are correct. This high level of reliability reduces demands on the skill level of the operator and makes the weapons system accessible to a greater number of warfighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drones with autonomous navigation reduce overall strike costs by minimizing both drone losses and mission attempts.&lt;/strong&gt; Because these drones can conduct missions effectively and then return to base, fewer replacement units are required. In turn, military budgets may be allocated more strategically, focusing on additional research and development or acquiring specialized assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster, more precise strikes decrease the time frame for enemy detection and retaliation, ultimately reducing the risk of counterattack.&lt;/strong&gt; When missions are completed in fewer attempts, adversaries have less opportunity to pinpoint the location or timing of an attack. This improved operational tempo decreases the likelihood of immediate enemy responses and increases the odds of mission success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal training time for autonomous drone operation broadens access for frontline personnel.&lt;/strong&gt; Training that used to require extensive flight hours can now be condensed into a matter of hours or even minutes, according to a CSIS conversation with a Ukrainian military drone pilot instructor. This development empowers a larger pool of soldiers to operate drones effectively with minimal specialized skills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypting onboard AI software preserves Ukraine’s technological lead by making autonomous systems difficult to reverse engineer.&lt;/strong&gt; Although adversaries can replicate hardware designs within weeks, sophisticated encryption measures on AI-enabled software slow down their ability to produce comparable systems. By maintaining a secure software advantage, Ukrainian forces continue to outpace opposing drone autonomy initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trends-2&quot;&gt;Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian authorities proactively introduce standalone autonomous modules into service, paving the way for scalable procurement and frontline deployment.&lt;/strong&gt; The Ukrainian military has initiated the process of codifying autonomous modules and introducing them into service in order to scale their procurement. By standardizing these modules as distinct components and developing guidelines on their integration and usage, the military can enable quicker adaptation of its arsenal and tactics to operational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drone training programs are incorporating autonomous navigation into their core curriculum to address the growing prevalence of self-guided systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing the shift toward AI-assisted flight, educational institutions for drone operators now equip students with the skills to manage both manual and autonomous functionalities. On average, training to use autonomous functionalities takes less than a day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling fully autonomous flights—from takeoff through mission execution to landing—reduces operational costs and the need for constant equipment replenishment.&lt;/strong&gt; This holistic approach to autonomy mirrors advances in commercial aerospace, where reusability significantly lowers costs. By extending the life cycle of unmanned systems, militaries can allocate resources more efficiently while maintaining readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementing AI-enabled navigation in ground, sea, and undersea platforms marks the next major challenge, given the higher complexity and cost of these systems.&lt;/strong&gt; While aerial drones have led the way in autonomous operations, adapting similar capabilities for multidomain use requires tackling tougher technical and environmental hurdles. The promise to integrate autonomous navigation for ground systems is big, but practical implementation represents a challenge that Ukrainian defense companies have not yet tackled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous navigation serves as a key building block for drone swarms, though fully autonomous swarm operations remain in the early stages.&lt;/strong&gt; While Ukrainian forces have conducted small-scale experiments, they have yet to field true swarms in which drones communicate, make decisions, and adjust actions collaboratively. Developing this level of coordination will require substantial progress in AI algorithms, communication protocols, and real-time decisionmaking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern unmanned systems in Ukraine are not yet fully autonomous. While AI substantially enhances certain functions—from ISR to ATR and navigation—these enhancements are still partial in scope. The need to remove humans from direct combat remains a driving vision, but the limited scale of true autonomy reveals the extent of current technological limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than rely on comprehensive end-to-end solutions, Ukraine has adopted a step-by-step approach, incrementally introducing AI-driven capabilities to address specific operational challenges. This approach not only reflects the realities of ongoing warfare but also demonstrates the practical ways that military concepts, such as target selection and last-mile navigation, are being converted into battlefield-ready functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, AI has made a substantial difference in streamlining data analysis, reducing human error, and coping with EW, but it still requires human oversight—particularly for engagement decisions. Although these discrete functions bring Ukrainian unmanned systems closer to a vision of full autonomy, they have not converged into a seamlessly integrated autonomous process. In addition, a number of factors should be considered for future autonomy deployment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Model Complexity and Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; Modern AI systems may be smaller and faster to train, but their black-box nature makes outcomes unpredictable in combat. Full autonomy remains high risk unless human operators can understand AI decisionmaking, ensuring reliable performance in life-or-death situations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Readiness and Integration in Military Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting autonomous systems calls for thorough planning, including clear concepts of operation and inclusion in every part of the doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) framework, so that processes and policies match the demands of new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory and Legal Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; Autonomy’s legal boundaries vary by country and remain largely undefined. Ukraine, for example, lacks definitions for “autonomy” and “autonomous weapons systems.” At the same time, it plans to align with international law, which also has critical uncertainties regarding ethical and legal questions related to autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data for AI Training Enabling Autonomy:&lt;/strong&gt; The war in Ukraine provides ample datasets to accelerate AI development and training using real-world data on enemy equipment. Nations lacking such direct battlefield information must plan well ahead to build and refine suitable datasets on enemy equipment for training and validating autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, key trends in Ukraine point toward a future in which reliable full autonomy might become a reality. First, the adoption of modular architectures for both hardware and software demonstrates a flexible approach that reduces development costs and streamlines upgrades. By separating AI software from the physical platforms, Ukrainian defense companies can more quickly update or replace specific functions, such as target recognition, without redesigning entire systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a strong emphasis on open-source technologies and separate software sales demonstrates the benefits of leveraging existing innovations rather than reinventing each component from scratch. This helps maintain a rapid research and development cycle while keeping hardware affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the growing miniaturization of AI models, trained on smaller, carefully curated datasets, makes onboard real-time processing increasingly feasible. The resulting ability to execute advanced tasks, such as last-mile autonomous navigation, without depending on stable communications or satellite guidance reduces susceptibility to EW and expands operational reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, broader integration of unmanned systems into military strategy and operations, from common operating pictures to doctrinal reforms, signals that Ukrainian forces are serious about scaling AI beyond the experimental stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these measures do not yet combine into an entirely autonomous battlefield, they form the essential foundations of a technology road map that one day might yield fully autonomous warfare—but with continued human involvement where critical ethical and strategic judgments are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;將道德權威比喻為核武-黎再被問及核武意思&quot;&gt;將道德權威比喻為「核武」 黎再被問及「核武」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英第51日作供。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行周一（3日）結束24日盤問。辯方代表大律師關文渭今開始覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證供提到，黎於2019年7月10日參與美國智庫「保衛民主基金會」公開對談，期間黎稱香港極需要美國的支持，因美國政府有「道德權威」，好比「核武」。黎並強調中美之間的「戰爭」乃價值上的爭鋒，「他們（中國）好像沒有任何武器便上戰場，當你使用核武的話，只需一分鐘便可擺平他們。（It’s like they’re like going to the battle without any weapon, and you have the nuclear weapon you can finish them in a minute.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，他口中的「核武」是什麼意思。黎稱他當時是指在這個新冷戰中的「道德權威」，而這是中共不具備的，但美國則具備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到黎在座談會中另一處再度使用「武器」字眼，問黎的意思是否與「核武」不同？黎指「核武」和「武器」的意思是相同，均是以誇張的手法形容某些事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，道德權威怎樣在一分鐘內擺平中國？黎則稱這是一種寫作的修辭手法。李素蘭追問，但黎當時不是在寫作，而是在談話？黎則認為兩者沒有分別，均是表達的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問到，黎口中的「擺平（finish）」是什麼意思。黎指即是「打敗（defect）」。辯方問，「擺平」之後會有什麼結果？黎則稱，很難說結果會是怎樣。他又解釋，這番言論用意是想指出美國人忘記了自己的道德權威有多強大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問黎談論道德權威是否與中美貿易談判有關-黎稱僅談論一般情況&quot;&gt;官問黎談論道德權威是否與中美貿易談判有關 黎稱僅談論一般情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰接著問，黎是否在談論貿易談判，所以才提及道德權威。黎則稱道德權威不一定與貿易談判有關，他只是想說當時有很多人認為中國有貿易談判，因此覺得：「不要令他們失望、不要冒犯他們。」法官杜麗冰指，黎在接下來的言論，卻提到道德權威是「談判桌上的一個重要籌碼」。黎重申道德權威不一定與貿易談判直接有關，他在座談會上只是談論一般情況，並指出當美國與中國交往時，美國忘記了其道德權威有多重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官回應，他以為黎在座談會上說道德權威是談判籌碼，但似乎黎現在庭上提出了另一種說法。李素蘭指，當觀眾聽到黎的言論時，他們不會追問黎這句意思是什麼、那句意思是什麼，而是從黎的言論得出他們的理解。黎回應稱，他當時只是說一般情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方展示訊息顯示黎憂慮掟磚和掟汽油彈-惟沒有渠道向年輕人傳達訊息&quot;&gt;辯方展示訊息顯示黎憂慮掟磚和掟汽油彈 惟沒有渠道向年輕人傳達訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前供稱，與同案被告、律師助理陳梓華聯絡，是為了叫他聯絡勇武派領袖，平息示威暴力及要求勇武派成立領導團隊。控方早前盤問時質疑，黎為何認為和平的人能夠說服勇武的人？黎僅稱：「我們要嘗試所有辦法」，因暴力事件會破壞當時的運動。控方又質疑會否最後變成勇武的人反過來說服到和平的人使用暴力呢？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎從何時開始有平息暴力的想法？黎則稱這不是「想法」，而是「邏輯思維」，因為當李柱銘介紹陳梓華時，將陳形容為「勇武派之中的保守派」，因此黎當時認為陳應該是聯絡激進人士的渠道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂向黎展示 Mark Simon 在2019年8月6日的訊息，他向黎表示關注有示威者投擲石頭，「他們應該知道，如果投擲石頭及殺死了人，便會在短期內嚴重地影響到運動。」黎回覆：「我對掟磚和掟汽油彈感到憂慮，但我沒有渠道向那些年輕人傳達這個訊息，除了我的專欄以外，我會在這星期的專欄提及這點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱從沒跟陳梓華談及國際戰線&quot;&gt;黎稱從沒跟陳梓華談及國際戰線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年區議會選舉之後，黎和陳梓華於2019年11月27日在停泊在金鐘的車上會面。陳梓華早前供稱黎說過要結合議會力量、街頭力量和國際力量，「推爆個政府」。黎早前則供稱自己可能講過議會和街頭力量，但是否認講過國際力量，因他從沒想過國際線的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在控方的盤問下說法卻有所不同，稱記不起自己有否跟陳梓華提及過國際戰線。辯方今再問黎，他有否跟陳梓華談及國際戰線？黎表示他從沒向陳談及國際戰線，所以這從不是二人之間的話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱未曾跟陳梓華談及初選沒參與籌辦初選&quot;&gt;黎堅稱未曾跟陳梓華談及初選、沒參與籌辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月31日，黎與陳梓華第四次見面。陳早前供稱，黎在該次見面中談及民主派初選。今在辯方覆問下，黎表示很難回憶起有否說過初選，但他認為自己未曾跟陳談及初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到2020年7月12日初選結束後，陳向黎傳送 Signal 訊息：「感謝你為初選所做的一切，這是香港歷史上重要的一頁（Hi Jimmy, thanks for everything on the primary election. It’s remarkable on our HK history.）。」辯方問黎，為何陳梓華在初選翌日傳送這個訊息？黎認為陳純粹告知他，或者純粹向他表達感受。辯方又問，在7月12日之前，黎有否與陳談論過初選？黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，陳在訊息中「感謝你為初選所做的一切」，問陳是感謝黎什麼？黎估計是感謝《蘋果》在初選期間提供了平台，但黎強調他並沒有參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又提到2020年2月26日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「眾志聯盟」的出選名單，新西派出朱凱廸、新東派出何桂藍、九東派出黃之鋒、梁凱晴做「Plan B」、九西派出張崑陽、港島派出羅冠聰、超區則派出岑敖暉。黎當時回覆陳：「我們要努力說服他們，如果初選有認受性，他們也必須參與。且看看事態發展如何。（Thanks. We’ve to work on them. But if the primary has legitimacy, they will have to join. Let’s see.）」陳回覆：「我會盡力說服。（I will try my best to work on it.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否涉及安排出選名單？黎則稱從來沒有聯絡過名單上的人士，但是他相信民主黨林卓廷有參與初選，而他經常與林卓廷、李永達和何俊仁等人吃晚飯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱陽明山會議有可能談及國際線-因劉祖廸在場&quot;&gt;黎稱陽明山會議有可能談及國際線 因劉祖廸在場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月11日，黎智英在台灣陽明山別墅，與陳梓華、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和一名女子會面。陳梓華早前供稱，黎在會議中稱要團結「不同的板塊」，包括議會、海外組織、街頭力量、國際線及商人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述黎在主問時稱，自己從沒有這種想法，反指這種想法是來自陳，然後將說話塞進他的嘴裏。惟黎在控方盤問之下，卻改稱他有可能談及國際、議會和街頭這三條戰線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂問黎，有否在會議中談及國際、議會和街頭戰線？黎回應，在他與陳梓華的交流中，國際線從不是話題之一。他稱他可能談及街頭和議會戰線，但他亦有可能談及國際線，因為劉祖廸當時在場。惟黎同時補充，他從不知道陳梓華參與國際線。辯方追問，劉祖廸在會議中談及國際線時說了什麼？黎則稱已不記得他說過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，為何邀請劉祖廸出席會議？黎稱因為當時是籲勇武派自我組織、組成領袖團隊的好時機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒參與籌備初選-官質疑黎曾叫陳梓華說服眾志聯盟參選者&quot;&gt;黎稱沒參與籌備初選 官質疑黎曾叫陳梓華說服「眾志聯盟」參選者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方盤問期間，曾追問黎是否關注（concerned about）民主派初選。黎當時稱他不關注，因為他與初選無關。控方質疑從訊息紀錄可見，黎一直緊貼初選的事態發展，並問黎的「concern」是什麼。黎僅稱「My concern is that I am not concerned about Primary Election anymore.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認上述對答，並稱這是他英文用字不小心。辯方要求黎澄清他口中的「concern」是什麼意思（註：英文“concern”可理解為「關注」、「擔憂」或「與某事情有關」）。黎稱當時他們正在研究電子投票的可能性，而他作為初選組織者李永達和物色電子投票程式的李兆富之間的「中間人」，他認為電子投票的主意很好，因可以方便市民，吸引更多人投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問黎是否有興趣參與初選工作？黎則稱他對於電子投票感興趣，但是他沒有參與初選的籌備工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則反駁指，當陳梓華傳送眾志聯盟的初選名單給黎之後，黎回應陳：「我們要努力說服他們（We’ve to work on them.）」，因此黎的確有牽涉初選。黎則稱訊息中的「我們」泛指民主派陣營的人士，因為他們在同一陣營之中，所以使用「我們」一字。辯方問黎有否說服名單上的人士？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭質疑，陳梓華回覆說：「我會盡力說服」，是否因為黎叫陳去說服？黎指陳只是告訴他會盡力說服，但他不知道陳有否真的說服名單上的人，他亦表示對於陳認識名單上的人感到意外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，黎將「眾志聯盟」的出選名單轉發給李卓人，並傳送相似訊息：「我們要努力說服他們，至少我們透過得到大部份泛民的支持，使初選有認受性，（We have to work on them. At least we’ve make our primary legitimised by support of majority of Pan Democrats.）」李卓人回覆：「會努力說服他們。會告訴戴耀廷和區諾軒。（Will work on them. Will tell Benny and 區諾軒）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，正如剛才所說，他在訊息中使用「我們」，是因為泛指民主派。法官李運騰指從李卓人的回覆「會努力說服他們」，可以理解至少黎正在要求李卓人說服他們，又問黎是否要求李卓人說服名單上的人？黎則同意。惟他指李卓人不是初選的組織者之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎專欄文章稱中共撕掉基本法-今稱從新聞得知&quot;&gt;黎專欄文章稱中共「撕掉《基本法》」 今稱從新聞得知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前控方證據提到，黎在2020年4月26日的專欄文章〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉中稱：「中共出擊撕掉《基本法》，摧殘香港一國兩制特別行政區地位。沒有釋法權利的港澳辦和中聯辦高調曲線釋法，稱兩辦並非《基本法》22條所指的一般意義上的『中央人民政府所屬各部門』，公然向港府奪權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方曾問黎，「撕掉《基本法》」和「高調曲線釋法」的說法，是從什麼官方渠道得知。黎堅稱有官方出處，但是他不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今再問黎，他當時是指哪個官方出處。黎稱不記得，相信當時是李柱銘或何俊仁告知他，而二人均是律師，因此相信二人。黎又稱，他肯定因閱讀新聞報導而得知，所以才會在其專欄文章中引述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否知道有沒有任何官方資訊來源，指稱「撕掉《基本法》」和「高調曲線釋法」？黎澄清他意思是從新聞得知上述說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向高院申請離港時未提及會見美國官員計劃-黎解釋過於政治敏感&quot;&gt;黎向高院申請離港時未提及會見美國官員計劃 黎解釋：過於政治敏感&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前盤問時指，黎於2020年6月向高院申請更改保釋條件，要求獲准出境到美國探望剛出生的孫女。控方質疑黎以孫女出生作為藉口和掩飾，反指黎向法庭隱瞞前往美國的真正原因是要會見美國官員和議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎，即使沒有會見美國官員的計劃，黎會否依然向法庭申請更改保釋條件？黎稱會，因為要探望孫女。辯方提到，黎在申請離港期間，未有提及會見美國官員的計劃，問黎為什麼？黎認為前往美國的主要原因是探望孫女；雖然在當時而言，會見美國官員不是違法，但是向法庭提及的話便會過於政治敏感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否有意圖誤導法庭？黎稱認為沒有需要告知法庭其會見官員計劃，所以便沒有披露。法官李運騰問，黎是否認為若然不告知法庭的話，便有較大機會獲批准出境？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱與袁弓夷相處感不安-惟未想過停止袁使用蘋果平台&quot;&gt;黎稱與袁弓夷相處感不安 惟未想過停止袁使用《蘋果》平台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，黎安排員工替袁彌明父親、現被警方通緝的袁弓夷拍攝影片，向特朗普作公開呼籲。黎早前在庭上稱，後來他與袁弓夷數次交流之後，便開始感到不安（uneasy），並嘗試疏遠他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎為何有這種不安感？黎稱源於一次晚飯期間袁所說的說話，但他已不記得具體內容。但黎記得時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹的訊息談及袁及一名逃往紐約的「逃犯」，而該人士十分可疑。辯方遂展示有關訊息，黎在訊息中告訴張：「他（袁）是郭文貴的人」，又告訴張：「他（袁）想與我合作反共。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，既然黎對袁感到不安，黎有否停止讓他使用《蘋果》這個平台。黎則稱沒有想過這問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法生效後-黎未要求mark-simon撤回制裁名單提議&quot;&gt;國安法生效後 黎未要求Mark Simon撤回制裁名單提議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月23日黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 在訊息中提到，華盛頓正在討論制裁名單，而 Mark 提出只將香港官員列入制裁名單。控方早前盤問指，在2020年7月國安法生效之後，黎並未有要求 Mark Simon 撤回他向美國國安委所提議的制裁名單。當時黎要求庭上解釋為何當時未有如此做，惟遭法官杜麗冰制止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎相關原因。黎稱在國安法生效之後，他可能忘記了這件事，又稱他當時可能認為國安法使以往合法的事情變得非法，然而生效之前的事情便會變為過時（obsolete）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;專欄稱勾結外國勢力是叛國罪可以被槍斃-黎稱僅複述蕭若元言論&quot;&gt;專欄稱勾結外國勢力是叛國罪、可以被槍斃 黎稱僅複述蕭若元言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月5日黎的專欄文章〈飛翔吧 良知的脊樑在撐著〉提到：「有心人說，快點走，勾結外國勢力是叛國罪，可以是槍斃的啊！」控方盤問時質疑，黎明知上述言論明顯不實，並揶揄黎：「你似乎毫不在乎真相。」黎則反複重申，他只是複述別人告訴他的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今問黎，為什麼會說「勾結外國勢力是叛國罪」。黎則稱因為網上有一名被稱為「神燈」的人士，惟一時想不起對方全名，並突然轉用廣東話，稱：「佢個仔係做電影」、「咩元吖？」、「佢以前係做編劇⋯⋯喺亞視。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指該人士在網上頻道中提及他的姓名，以及叫他離開香港，「我認為他只是說一些說話嚇我，叫我離開。」被問到是否私下認識該「有心人」，黎稱認識，但是一時忘記他的名字。後來在小休之後，黎向法庭表示，記起該「有心人」可能是蕭若元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎回覆蓬佩奧助手問題-承認不小心使用制裁一字&quot;&gt;黎回覆蓬佩奧助手問題 承認不小心使用「制裁」一字&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證據顯示2020年7月15日，Mark Simon 轉發時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 的訊息，要求黎澄清對於撤銷香港特殊地位的立場。黎回覆：「我是說撤銷香港特殊地位是不需要的，因為在《國安法》下，香港怎樣也好都會完蛋。重點不在於香港而在於中國。制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港。但是就此思考後，我認為他們撤回香港特殊地位是正確的，因為一旦美國和中國之間脫鈎，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到黎與 Mary Kissel 之間的交情。黎稱截至2020年為止，他與 Mary Kissel 相識超過15年。因 Mary Kissel 曾在香港替《華爾街日報》擔任社評撰稿人，黎在當時開始認識她。後來她返回美國繼續替《華爾街日報》工作，然後在華爾街工作，繼而成為蓬佩奧的助手。黎又稱，在這15年期間，他與 Mary Kissel 不常聯絡，但他記得每年 Mary Kissel 的生日，他都會送花給她，直至她離開《華爾街日報》。被問到有否在2019至2020年期間送花，黎稱在她成為蓬佩奧助理之後便沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱因為 Mary Kissel 是蓬佩奧的助手，所以如果她直接跟他對話，便會很敏感。黎又指，當時只是打算經 Mark Simon 回答 Mary Kissel 的問題，沒想過她會使用其回覆作其他目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述控方指黎透過 Mark Simon，直接請求美國撤銷香港特殊地位，辯方問黎有沒有這個意圖？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，為什麼黎在訊息中提及「制裁」？黎則稱：「我不知道為什麼，我估計就是這樣不小心。」法官李素蘭追問「不小心」是什麼意思。黎稱：「我不知道這是一個危險的字眼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter帖文問選舉主任應負責任嗎&quot;&gt;Twitter帖文問「選舉主任應負責任嗎？」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月7日，美國財政部宣佈制裁11名侵犯人權及損害香港自治的中港官員，包括時任特首林鄭月娥。翌日黎 Twitter 發布帖文：「那些取消候選人資格的選舉主任又如何呢？他們應該在個人層面上為這些決定負責任嗎？」控方盤問時指，黎透過上述帖文請求外國制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今要求黎澄清有否在帖文中請求制裁。黎稱他沒有請求制裁，但同時承認帖文用字帶有暗示制裁的意味，因帖文意思是選舉主任應該為他們所作的決定負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示尚餘 Slack 群組裡的「飯盒會」紀錄需要覆問。案件明日下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

The continent is on the verge of a “big bang” moment which could unlock more than a trillion dollars in defense funding over the next decade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “three-day war” in Ukraine passed the three-year mark. This dark anniversary came with a glimmer of light: the growing prospect of peace talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a surprise phone call between Putin and President Donald J. Trump, the only ones showing much optimism were Russian leaders. By the end of last week, this optimism had turned to delight after Washington voted with Moscow on two UN resolutions and a disastrous public Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the talk about talks, the only real change to the dynamics surrounding the conflict since President Trump took office is the creeping loss of Ukraine’s single biggest backer, the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was confirmed yesterday when the White House announced it would suspend all military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to compel Kyiv—and induce Moscow—into making a peace deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin was quick to welcome this move. It is good news for Putin, who has been waiting three years for Ukraine’s supporters to capitulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the same events were met with shock and horror in Europe, whose leaders quickly rallied around Zelensky and Ukraine. An informal meeting of European leaders in London on Sunday hosted by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was rapidly reconfigured into a crisis summit with the stated goal of “securing our future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their unstated goal was to say loud and clear to the people of Ukraine: Europe has got your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message was also aimed at Washington and Moscow. Europe’s leaders are hoping Trump and Putin heard their call that, in Starmer’s words, “Europe must do the heavy lifting”—on both Ukraine and European security. They want to convince Trump they are taking his demands to share the burden of transatlantic security seriously, and Putin that “we are doubling down in our support” to Ukraine for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving all three goals—backing Ukraine, placating Trump, and outlasting Putin—will take more than crisis meetings and strong words. Since 2014, Europe has been taking defense more seriously. But thanks to Trump’s dramatic policy shift away from transatlantic security, the price tag of strengthening Ukraine and defending Europe just went up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Europe is on the verge of a “big bang” moment, which could unlock more than a trillion dollars in funding for European defense over the next decade. An emergency EU summit on Thursday will see European leaders take the first steps in their journey to save Ukraine and lead the free world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;peace-through-ukrainian-strength&quot;&gt;Peace Through Ukrainian Strength&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s most urgent task is to forge peace through strength in Ukraine. Getting Putin to the negotiating table will mean convincing him he cannot win the war now; getting a lasting ceasefire and peace deal will require convincing him he cannot try again later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the London summit committed Europe to “keep the military aid flowing . . . To strengthen Ukraine now,” and to “keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities . . . To deter any future invasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These commitments are even more pertinent in the absence of security guarantees for Ukraine. In London, leaders committed only to develop a “coalition of the willing,” but made any guarantees contingent on “strong US backing.” This is something President Trump has consistently played down—in part because preemptive security guarantees could undermine Trump’s main goal of getting Putin to the negotiating table. If Putin judges that guarantees—and European troops—will only appear once the fighting stops, then he won’t stop fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if Trump can bring Putin to the negotiating table, it will be a tall order to persuade him to make peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin thinks he is winning in Ukraine and has little incentive to end the war. Russia may have lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers and up to a million (mostly young, educated) emigrants, but Putin has consolidated power at home and abroad. He has forged a wartime economy that is now producing more than all of Europe, tightened his grip on power through political repression and media control, and deepened his alliances with China, Iran, and North Korea. History suggests wars are good for dictators—even necessary. Besides, what Putin wants is not a slice of territory, but a Ukraine subjugated and neutered. No talks could ever satisfy those desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more likely scenario is a repeat of the Minsk I and II process, in which Russia dragged out talks and repeatedly broke ceasefire agreements with little intention of reaching a lasting settlement. In the short term, this would provide cover for Russian forces to press forward and exploit Ukraine’s weakening position on the battlefield. In the longer term, it would buy time for Russian forces to regroup and reconstitute to attack again en masse when the time is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suggests what really matters among all the noise about peace talks is Ukraine’s military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong Ukrainian military, which cannot be defeated on the battlefield, is the only realistic impediment to Russia’s crude but effective attempts to dominate its near abroad using military force. President Trump’s attempts at coercion and accommodation might be worth a shot, but diplomacy is no match for “brute force” when it comes to warlike leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wisdom was famously applied by the U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan in his 1946 long telegram, assessing Soviet power under Joseph Stalin as “impervious to logic of reason, and . . . highly sensitive to logic of force.” Kennan’s prescription was “a policy of firm containment” based on political, economic, and military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same words also describe Russian power under Vladimir Putin today. Zelensky echoed Kennan’s diagnosis when he addressed Ukraine’s parliament in October: “The Russian leadership acts aggressively only when it is convinced that it will not receive an adequate destructive response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address, Zelensky also channeled Kennan in his own prescription to secure Ukraine’s security via “peace through strength.” This phrase echoed one used by another U.S. official: Keith Kellogg. In a report published months before he was appointed as President Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Lt. General (Ret.) Kellogg describes Trump’s approach as promoting “deterrence and peace through strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and EU leaders have also identified peace through Ukrainian strength as the best solution for keeping their own citizens safe. As NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte declared after allied defense ministers met this month, NATO’s task is to “help Ukraine in its fight today and to build up Ukraine’s armed forces in the long-term.” And as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated in the commission’s political guidelines last year: “The best investment in European security is investing in the security of Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europe-unable-america-unwilling&quot;&gt;Europe Unable, America Unwilling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the war began, peace through strength in Ukraine has been pursued through a combination of Western-funded equipment and Ukrainian grit. As Trump put it last week: “They’re very brave,” but “without the United States and its money and its military equipment, this war would have been over in a very short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this formula is now in doubt because Ukraine’s main backers are reaching the political and economic limits of what they can provide. Europe, Ukraine’s largest backer to date, has plenty of political will but is hitting the limit of its fiscal and industrial capacity. Meanwhile, the United States has the opposite problem: It can afford and produce much more, but the political desire to do so has disappeared under the new administration. (Compare the administration’s stance on Ukraine to the $4 billion in military assistance and $12 billion in military sales expedited to Israel since January, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe and the United States have been Ukraine’s largest backers since 2022. Europe has been the most generous, providing $138 billion (and committing another $120 billion), compared to $119 billion (and $4 billion) from the United States. When measured proportionately, the United States lags much further behind—19 European nations have given more to Ukraine than the U.S. total of 0.53 percent of GDP since 2022, with some European nations even exceeding 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are large sums of money, but they are not enough to meet Ukraine’s needs. Russian forces continue to grind out small victories on the battlefield and attack civilian areas with hundreds of cost-effective drone and missile strikes. Zelensky has already warned that Ukraine is now running out of Patriot air defense missiles. Moreover, as the authors of a Kiel Institute report point out, for most nations this level of funding is “like a minor political ‘pet project’ rather than a major fiscal effort,” comparable to domestic subsidies for diesel fuel and company cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet even at these relatively low and inadequate levels, both Europe and the United States have significant constraints on their ability to maintain aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has a plentiful supply of political goodwill toward Ukraine but lacks the fiscal and industrial capacity to make good on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although overall European defense spending has risen sharply since 2022, spending levels vary widely. Nations closer to Moscow spend much more than others. But some of the leaders in spending measured by percentage of GDP are laggards in absolute investment, due to the size of their economies. (For example, in 2024, Latvia’s 3.15 percent of GDP equated to just $1.4 billion, while Poland and Italy both spend just under $35 billion even though Poland spent 4 percent of its GDP compared to Italy’s 1.5 percent.) Neither does the GDP measure indicate the quality or nature of investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the European Union is limited by its 2023 Stability and Growth Pact on borrowing large amounts to fund higher defense spending—like it did after Covid-19 through a recovery fund of $840 billion. EU member states have equivocated over removing borrowing limits on defense spending since the war began but have yet to pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if they do, increased spending might not solve the problem of Europe’s limited defense industrial capacity. Ukraine now depends on the defense industry in Europe and elsewhere for two-thirds of its military aid. But current capacity is either low or nonexistent in key areas such as guided weapons, tanks, and aircraft. “Europeans and the Ukrainians have nothing in their depots,” according to the CEO of Rheinmetall. Meanwhile, the Russian defense industry is now outproducing the whole of Europe (when measured by purchasing power parity). Hence the Kiel Institute’s assessment that the war has become “a battle of procurement and military production.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also has industrial capacity issues. However, Washington’s limits on providing support to Ukraine are primarily political.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good shorthand for President Trump’s policies is to assume he will do the exact opposite of the Biden administration. This is true for Ukraine. While Biden committed to support Kyiv “for as long as it takes,” Trump campaigned on removing support for Ukraine. Where Biden aimed to force Russia to negotiate (or capitulate) by putting Ukraine in a position of strength, Trump aims to compel Ukraine to accept compromises for the sake of a deal and use the potential for Ukrainian weakness to incentivize Moscow. As he said when asked if the United States would keep providing Ukraine with weapons: “Maybe until we have a deal with Russia . . . We need to have a deal, otherwise it’s going to continue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dramatic reversal in Washington’s policy leaves the burden of “peace through Ukrainian strength” resting on Europe’s shoulders. This may have been the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington’s shift in Ukraine policy was accompanied by a broader shift in its policy toward Europe. The last three weeks have cemented the new reality that transatlantic security is no longer Washington’s foreign policy priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stance is not new—the United States has been pivoting to Asia since at least 2011. Neither does it mean Washington will abandon Europe. As U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers on February 13: “We must make NATO great again . . . suggestions of abandonment otherwise continue to be disingenuous and we are—we are proud to be part of this alliance and stand by it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, Europe must now assume responsibility for its own security to an extent it has not done since before 1941. This will take decisive action and sustained investment to strengthen Ukraine’s hand and defend the continent from Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-trillion-dollar-big-bang-moment&quot;&gt;Europe’s Trillion Dollar “Big Bang” Moment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as they face an acute threat from Russia and an increasingly disinterested—or at least distracted—United States, Ukraine and Europe are in the same boat. If Europe is going to shoulder the burden of strengthening Ukraine and its own defenses, it is going to need a bigger boat. This means spending more on defense—a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that European defense is on the verge of a “big bang” moment that could transform its ability to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European defense was slow to rouse from its post–Cold War slumber. By 2022, EU defense spending was only 1.3 percent of GDP. This changed after Russia’s full-scale invasion, when European NATO allies raised defense investment to 2 percent of their collective GDP. Meanwhile, the European Union’s Versailles Declaration, adopted three weeks after the war began, led to several new initiatives designed to strengthen European defense and support Ukraine. These have provided tens of billions of euros for both European procurement and Ukrainian defense and reconstruction—including from the revenue of frozen Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the true potential of European defense remains largely untapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next NATO summit will take place in June in The Hague, the Netherlands. If every European member of NATO took that opportunity to raise defense spending from their current average of 2 percent to 3 percent—as at least four allies already did last year—it would raise nearly $200 billion. Germany alone could add $220 billion if it agrees on a new “whatever it takes” special fund for defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If EU leaders agreed to exempt defense spending from the current budget constraints, they could jointly borrow hundreds of billions toward their own target of investing over $500 billion in defense over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If negotiations this year over the European Union’s next budget cycle (2028–2034) meet the target set by the bloc’s new defence commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, that could add $110 billion to EU defense spending (defense spending in the current cycle was only around $11 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe agreed to liquidate Russia’s frozen assets, it could provide another $300 billion. As Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has urged: “Enough talking, it’s time to act! Let’s finance our aid for Ukraine from the Russian frozen assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the European Commission is able to repurpose untapped Covid-19 recovery funds, it would make available up to $100 billion, while redirecting portions of the $50 billion EU “Cohesion Fund”—designed to help lower income member states through investment in environment and transport—could make several billion available for defense and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original purpose of the London summit was to discuss the United Kingdom’s idea for a European “rearmament bank,” a joint fund to issue AAA-rated debt to finance increased defense spending across Europe. If agreed, this might raise up to $25 billion in government “seed funding,” which could underpin up to $250 billion of private capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of “ifs” on the table. But taken together, these measures would unlock vast amounts of new funding. European defense’s big-bang moment could be worth well over a trillion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, von der Leyen has already previewed some of the measures on the table as part of a package called “ReARM Europe.” These include relaxing the European Union’s fiscal rules on debt for defense spending, a loan program of up to €150 billion ($165 billion) backed by the European Union’s common budget, and reallocating some of the Cohesion Fund. These initial measures still require EU leaders to unanimously agree with them. The biggest threat comes from Hungary, although Budapest’s opposition appears to be narrowly focused on support to Ukraine rather than strengthening European defense writ large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-arsenal-of-democracy-in-europe&quot;&gt;The Arsenal Of Democracy in Europe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if EU leaders can agree to these measures, a flood of new spending will not amount to much without the capacity to produce the weapons, ammunition, and equipment that Ukraine—and Europe—needs. As Rutte put it: “Our industry must be able to produce what our extra money allows us to procure.” Europe must transform itself into a modern arsenal of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU leaders have repeatedly emphasized their aim of “ramping up defence production,” alongside financing defense and supporting Ukraine. This follows the 2024 European Defence Industrial Strategy (EDIS) and the Draghi report on competitiveness—both of which urged Europe to revitalize its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s defense industry has struggled to overcome three decades of relative neglect. One high profile example is the failure to deliver the flagship procurement of 1 million NATO-standard 155 millimeter artillery shells for Ukraine. This target was eventually met but only after significant delays. This episode suggests Europe may struggle to provide Ukraine with more complex systems at scale, such as air and missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Europe’s defense industry has retained a focus on quality and advanced technology, even while sacrificing capacity and increasing fragmentation. The challenge now is how to scale up and increase cooperation—a perennial challenge for Europe. The “big bang” approach advocated by Kubilius is designed to do this by aggregating demand and achieving economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of what could be achieved is the European Union’s first investment in support for common procurement, a new $330 million incentive that has led to over $12 billion in multinational contracts for air and missile defense systems, armored vehicles, and artillery ammunition. There are also several examples of joint procurement for Ukraine. These amount to at least $5.5 billion to date, including a $1.0 billion Czechia-led ammunition initiative and the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, which has provided at least $1.5 billion of military aid since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union and NATO have long deployed incentive-backed instruments to encourage cooperation and innovation. But the small amounts of funding attached—millions not billions—have not made much difference. If this model can be applied across the defense industrial landscape using the flood of funding that may be about to appear, it would lead to a revolutionary change in European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason for a “big bang” approach to transforming European defense is a continued dependence on defense industries beyond Europe. Ukraine currently builds or finances about 55 percent of its military hardware but relies on Europe (25 percent) and the United States (20 percent) for the rest. For Europe, most of the money spent on defense since the war began has left the continent. According to the EDIS, 78 percent of new EU spending in 2022 and 2023 left Europe, with 63 percent of this going to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this situation allows Ukraine and Europe to meet urgent combat requirements, recapitalize depleted stockpiles, and access complex systems they cannot produce on their own—such as Patriot missile defense systems or combat aircraft like the F-16 and F-35—it also undermines sovereign supply, exposing Europe to external supply challenges. This is why the EDIS gave member states the target of procuring at least 50 percent of defense equipment from within the European Union by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine would also benefit from a stronger, more self-sufficient European defense industry. It already has to some extent, given that at least half of the military aid it has received since the start of the war came from Europe and at least 25 percent of its current supply of weapons and equipment is produced there. One example of a weapon system that has been critical to Ukraine’s performance on the battlefield is strike drones, which have helped Ukrainian forces overcome a 5:1 manpower deficit to fight Russian forces to a standstill. This month the German company Helsing announced it would supply Ukraine with 6,000 HX-2 strike drones—adding to the 4,000 HX-1 drones already being delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of AI-enabled “precise mass” in Ukraine—and in modern warfare writ large—will place more emphasis on less exquisite technology like drones and artillery. This could be a boon for the European defense industry, and even a comparative advantage over the U.S. and Korean industries, which are more geared toward complex, high-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s own defense industry shows what’s possible. It already produces $30 billion a year in weapons, six times what it did just a year ago. Ukraine is now the world’s largest manufacturer of military autonomous systems, able to make over 4.5 million drones per year. It plans to make 30,000 long-range drones and 3,000 missiles this year. While the European Union struggled to make 1 million shells, Ukraine already makes 2.5 million artillery and mortar rounds annually. In the last year, Ukraine’s production of artillery systems tripled while production of armored vehicles increased fivefold. Europe will also benefit from this transformation if it can learn from Ukraine’s impressive ability to rapidly scale manufacturing, adopt commercial technology, and feed lessons from the front line into its procurement system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ukraine’s defense industry has grown so fast that its production capacity has outstripped financing. In a speech to the annual European Defence Agency conference last month, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov explained that while capacity will reach $37 billion this year, available funding is only $18 billion. Umerov appealed to Europe “to help us close this existing gap in financing” to make sure Ukraine’s production potential does not go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of doing this is the “Danish model” of procuring directly from Ukraine’s defense industry. In 2024, Denmark became the first country to order weapons made in Ukraine for use by Ukrainian armed forces. To date, around $950 million worth of Ukrainian-made artillery and drones have been ordered by Denmark and delivered to Ukraine. Denmark has also set up a “Defence Industry Hub” in Kyiv to enhance cooperation between the Danish and Ukrainian defense industries. At least two other countries have also adopted the “Danish model.” In October, the Netherlands announced a plan to purchase around $440 million of drones from Ukraine, with a 50–50 production share. Last week Norway also committed to buy $312 million of drones and other military equipment from Ukrainian firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transforming European defense would also benefit the United States’ defense industry—the original arsenal of democracy—in three important ways. First, by giving even more buying power to the largest global importer of U.S. arms: Europe. No matter how quickly Europe revitalizes its own defense industry, it will continue to rely on U.S. companies for advanced air defense, combat aircraft, missile and long-range artillery systems, plus other technology. Second, expanded coproduction arrangements provide European leaders political and economic incentives to buy more U.S. weapons. They also lower the unit cost of weapons for Washington through economies of scale. Examples range from a recent $5.5 billion coproduction agreement for 1,000 Patriot interceptors, to a Cold War agreement to produce Sidewinder missiles in West Germany. Third, by enabling the United States to focus more squarely on its declared priority of Indo-Pacific security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe can generate a flood of new funding and transform its defense industry, the only remaining question is what purpose would all this military power serve? The answer for Ukraine was provided by President von der Leyen: “It is basically turning Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.” A “porcupine” military strategy is the best way for Ukraine to credibly deter Russia within the constraints it has on manpower, industrial capacity, and cost. It would also minimize any security dilemma with Russia by being a conspicuously defensive force. For Europe, the answer is much more of the same: deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leaders-of-the-free-world&quot;&gt;Leaders of the Free World?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 10, 2022, just days after Russia’s invasion began, EU leaders met in Versailles. They declared that “Russia’s war of aggression constitutes a tectonic shift in European history” and agreed on an ambitious agenda to strengthen European defense and support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday’s summit could be another Versailles moment for Europe. The last two weeks have produced another tectonic shift that demands a continent-wide response. Through their urgent plan to “rearm Europe,” European leaders must find a way to unlock a trillion euros to fund large increases in defense spending and transform Europe’s industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moment was years in the making. Since 2014, the pressure on European defense has been building. Increased spending and a proliferation of initiatives to strengthen EU defense and the “European pillar” of NATO have laid the foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing missing was a spark to ignite the big bang—until President Trump provided a shower of sparks in a week that “shook up the world.” The events which followed his February 12 call with the Kremlin threatened to put transatlantic relations back to 1941 as he considered appeasing Putin, called Zelensky a “dictator,” berated Europe, and cut off Ukraine (even if only temporarily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of these watershed events was summarized by one Wall Street Journal headline: “Trump, Not Putin, Forces Europe to Get Serious About Defense.” Or as one observer on Bluesky put it: “European defence was born this week—by caesarian, but still.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after Friday’s shouting match in the Oval Office added more fuel to the fire, Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs, declared: “Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Europe’s big bang comes to fruition, it could generate vast amounts of new defense investment in the coming years. But this moment is about more than funding, as Kallas implies. The most important thing Europe can do for Ukraine and the free world is transform its ability to defend the continent from Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Putin’s Russia is the biggest threat to a Europe whole and free. And just like the Cold War, the consequences of the confrontation between Russia and the West are global. Unlike his Soviet-communist counterparts, Putin might not want to “run the world”—but he would like to see the world run by fellow autocrats. This world would eschew the liberal rules and norms that have guided the conduct of international relations since 1945, a period of unprecedented global peace, prosperity, and liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the world would be a much darker place where might makes right. Powerful countries would be entitled to spheres of influence within which they would be free to dominate and subjugate weaker countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine shows what a world of authoritarian “multipolarity” would look like. It is not just a battle for Ukrainian sovereignty, but for the future of global order. Ukraine is the first bulwark against a world of authoritarian disorder—which is why it must be strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second bulwark is Europe itself—hence the need to rearm, quickly, and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third bulwark is the United States. By withdrawing its support for Ukraine, questioning its own role in transatlantic security, and appearing to align with Russia on key issues, President Trump risks weakening the West’s defense against authoritarian disorder. It is possible that Trump is betting that his unprecedented actions will provide the spark Europe needed to ignite its big bang transformation into a defense superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, Europe’s leaders now have the motivation and the means to save Ukraine and stop Putin. As Starmer put it, they are at a “crossroads in our history.” It is now up to them to lead the free world through this crucial moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s Maritime Sanctions Taskforce first convened in November 2024, to assess the threats posed by Russia’s circumvention of maritime sanctions, in particular through its shadow fleet, and to identify enforcement priorities for G7+ partners. The findings from this inaugural meeting were reflected in the first Taskforce report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, the Taskforce held its second meeting, to examine the evolving strategies of the shadow fleet and provide operational recommendations to enhance collective enforcement efforts. The discussion addressed the shifting patterns of the shadow fleet, the need to refine designations, the importance of diplomatic engagement with flag states, and the potential leverage of international legal frameworks to strengthen maritime sanctions enforcement. This report summarises the findings and recommendations of the second Taskforce meeting, in order to inform policy decisions, enhance international coordination, and bolster the effectiveness of maritime sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributions from Taskforce members are made on an unattributable basis and this summary report does not necessarily represent the views of all Taskforce members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-on-the-shadow-fleets-shifting-patterns&quot;&gt;Update on the Shadow Fleet’s Shifting Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce began by assessing recent shifts in shadow fleet routes and operational methods. Participants highlighted that the fleet is evolving in response to ongoing enforcement measures and heightened regional coordination efforts by Nordic and Baltic states and other G7+ countries. The ability to accurately track these changes is key to ensuring the continued effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the term “shadow fleet” is often used broadly, some Taskforce members distinguished three main categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The cleared fleet, consisting of vessels with no suspicious activity or opaque ownership structures;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The grey fleet, comprising vessels operating within legal ambiguities and/or benefiting from weak regulatory oversight, but not necessarily violating sanctions outright;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dark fleet, which includes vessels engaged in clear illicit activity, such as deceptive shipping practices, fraudulent cargo documentation and false flagging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this categorisation, some Taskforce members shared their observations based on active tracking of the maritime domain. They noted an increase in the size of the grey fleet following the new measures introduced by the US sanctions package of 10 January 2025. The dark fleet, however, has remained relatively stable, with an estimated 1,600 vessels continuing to engage in illicit activity operations. According to some Taskforce members, the core fleet dedicated to Russia’s shadow oil trade currently comprises approximately 350 tankers without International Group of Professional and Indemnity Clubs (IGP&amp;amp;I) insurance and with opaque ownership structures. Unlike the activity of some other global shadow fleet operations, such as those servicing Iran or Venezuela, Russian vessels still need to transit strategic chokepoints such as the Danish and Turkish Straits, making it difficult for them to operate entirely unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also highlighted the emergence of new hubs for shadow fleet activity, most notably in Brazil and the Arctic Sea. Moreover, there has been a marked increase in the manipulation of Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) or location tampering as means of evading detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce agreed that the 10 January sanctions package had led to a significant shift in vessel behaviour. Notably, there was a sharp increase in vessels drifting in the South China Sea and a rise in ship-to-ship transfers occurring in more remote anchorage locations. These changes highlight the shadow fleet’s adaptability in response to regulatory actions and further emphasise the need for sustained vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Taskforce members from the protection and indemnity (P&amp;amp;I) insurance community commented on the recent uplift of the carriage of 2707 cargoes from Russia. Some members had observed in trade data that cargo corresponding to Harmonized System (HS) code 2707 – that is, oils and other products of the distillation of high temperature coal tar – are increasingly being reported as exports from Russia. 2707 cargoes are not subject to the Oil Price Cap (OPC), unlike oil and petroleum cargo matching codes 2709 or 2710.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-the-shadow-fleet&quot;&gt;Defining the Shadow Fleet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that a clear definition of the shadow fleet is necessary to underpin legal and enforcement actions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) defines the shadow fleet as “ships that are engaged in illegal operations for the purposes of circumventing sanctions, evading compliance with safety or environmental regulations, avoiding insurance costs or engaging in other illegal activities, which may include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;carrying out unsafe operations which do not adhere to international regulations and well-established and strict industry standards and best practices;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;intentionally avoiding flag State and port State control inspections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;not maintaining adequate liability insurance or other financial security;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;intentionally avoiding commercial screenings or inspections;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;not operating under a transparent corporate governance policy that assures the welfare and safety of those on board and the protection of the marine environment; or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;intentionally taking measures to avoid ship detection such as switching off their AIS [Automatic Identification System] or LRIT [long-range identification and tracking] transmissions or concealing the ship’s actual identity when there is no legitimate safety or security concern sufficient to justify such action”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd’s List offers a complementary definition, categorising a tanker as part of the “dark fleet” if it is “aged 15 years or over, anonymously owned and/or has a corporate structure designed to obfuscate beneficial ownership discovery, solely deployed in sanctioned oil trades, and engaged in one or more of the deceptive shipping practices outlined in US State Department guidance issued in May 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kyiv School of Economics offers a broader definition, arguing that the shadow fleet comprises “all vessels that simultaneously meet two conditions: They lack Western insurance coverage as they rely on providers outside of the International Group of P&amp;amp;I Clubs … They are owned and managed by companies not from G7/EU countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce concluded that the IMO definition remains the most viable, as it provides a legal foundation for tracking and targeting shadow fleet activity by an internationally recognised multilateral body. A universally accepted definition will enable greater consistency of enforcement actions, reducing the risk of ambiguity and ensuring that shadow fleet vessels are subjected to uniform scrutiny across jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refining-designations-for-maximum-impact&quot;&gt;Refining Designations for Maximum Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce debated how to refine vessel designations to ensure that sanctions remain effective while preventing unintended economic consequences. The pace of vessel designations has accelerated, with a sharp increase in deep-sea vessels designated over the past year, yet concerns persist about the clarity, consistency and long-term implications and sustainability of these designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the Taskforce considered expanding designation targets beyond vessels towards maritime facilitators. This would explicitly exclude individual seafarers, as it was widely agreed that targeting ship crews would be ineffective and ethically questionable, since they often lack decision-making power and have little choice but to accept employment on sanctioned vessels. Instead, Taskforce members advocated for designating ship management companies (including those offering crew management and technical management services) and other intermediaries that knowingly facilitate shadow fleet activities. The decision by Chinese ports in Shandong to refuse berthing to US-sanctioned vessels just ahead of the 10 January sanctions package might signal that direct pressure on port operators could be an effective mechanism for curtailing shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flag registries also came under scrutiny, with some members noting that many registries remain unaware of the risks associated with accepting shadow fleet vessels. By targeting the infrastructure that supports illicit shipping, including through greater engagement with flag states and the services companies that manage many of their registries, enforcement efforts could be not only more effective, but also less disruptive to innocent parties. This is explored in greater depth below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce explored the unintended consequences of aggressively driving vessels out of regulated systems. While strict enforcement is essential, some participants warned that pushing shadow fleet vessels further into opaque, unregulated markets could exacerbate risks rather than mitigate them. When vessels lose access to legitimate insurance, classification societies and flag registries, they often resort to clandestine operations with reduced oversight, increasing the likelihood of fraudulent documentation, illicit trading and maritime safety violations. This creates a regulatory blind spot where these vessels continue to operate under even riskier conditions, heightening environmental and security concerns. The Taskforce discussed the need for a balanced approach that targets bad actors while maintaining enough oversight to prevent a complete loss of regulatory control over shadow fleet operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Taskforce members suggested the possibility of an advisory or probationary list for flag registries that demonstrate a pattern of registering vessels engaged in illicit activities, following advisories from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and, more recently, Taiwan. While such measures would need to be carefully designed to avoid overreach, they could serve as a useful tool in encouraging higher compliance standards across the industry. However, the listing of vessels without imposing formal sanctions raised concerns among some Taskforce members, who highlighted the need for more robust and clear designation criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US has demonstrated a more precise approach, providing detailed justifications for vessel listings. By contrast, the UK and the EU have relied on broader, less specific statements, often citing general involvement in the Russian oil trade without clearly outlining whether vessels have violated the OPC, are Russian-owned, or have engaged in deceptive shipping practices. Taskforce members discussed the fact that this lack of transparency creates uncertainty in the market, making it difficult for insurers, shipowners and financial institutions to determine compliance requirements and assess risk accurately. Regulators have the tools and intelligence necessary to refine this process, and greater transparency in the designation process would enable industry stakeholders to adjust their risk management frameworks accordingly and achieve stronger adherence to maritime sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key issue discussed was the potential for a structured delisting mechanism for vessels that demonstrate compliance or seek to reintegrate into legitimate trade. Some Taskforce members argued that an expedited delisting process could incentivise vessels to cease shadow fleet operations and return to the mainstream fleet, provided they meet stringent compliance criteria. The notion of allowing vessels to correct their behaviour and regain access to legitimate markets was seen as a potential means of encouraging compliance, rather than forcing vessels further into the illicit market. However, scepticism remains regarding whether such a system could be effectively implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some industry representatives expressed reluctance to reintegrate vessels that have a history of sanctions evasion. Reputable shipowners and insurers posit that vessels that have profited from sanctions violations should not be allowed to re-enter the legitimate market without significant scrutiny. Allowing such vessels to return to normal operations without facing penalties might risk encouraging others to engage in similar violations, with the expectation that they could later return to compliant trade with little consequence. This resistance from some actors in the insurance and shipping industries highlights the challenge of designing a delisting framework that balances the need for deterrence with the potential benefits of encouraging vessels back into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-term implications of prolonged vessel designations complicate matters further. Some Taskforce members noted that, without a viable delisting mechanism, sanctioned vessels could eventually be abandoned, creating serious environmental and humanitarian hazards. When shipowners realise that their vessels are permanently excluded from the mainstream market, they may choose to scrap or neglect them, increasing the risk of oil spills, maritime accidents, and seafarer abandonment. This issue is particularly pressing given that many vessels operating within the shadow fleet are approaching or beyond the end of their operational lifespan. Without a structured means of decommissioning or scrapping these vessels, there is a growing risk of a buildup of obsolete tankers that are both environmentally hazardous and legally problematic for insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final consideration discussed was the need for improved collaboration between regulatory authorities and the private sector. Participants noted that in the US, the White House, the US State Department and the US Treasury Department are reportedly exploring the establishment of specialised maritime desks dedicated to addressing Russian and Iranian sanctions. Taskforce members suggested that, if these efforts materialise, a formal government–private sector partnership could prove invaluable to streamlining enforcement efforts. This would facilitate the dialogue between policymakers and industry experts, with a partnership that could improve information sharing, enhance due diligence processes, and develop more effective strategies for addressing illicit shipping practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengthening-engagement-with-flag-states&quot;&gt;Strengthening Engagement with Flag States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the Taskforce agreed that engagement with flag states remains a critical element in enforcing maritime sanctions and limiting the operations of the shadow fleet. Flag states enable vessels to operate internationally, granting them the necessary legal status to navigate global waters. This makes them a pivotal point of leverage for policymakers seeking to reinforce compliance measures. While flag states retain sovereign control over their registries, participants noted that many remain unaware of the reputational risks associated with facilitating illicit shipping activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between flag states and their registries varies considerably, which influences how receptive flag states are to diplomatic engagement. Some countries, such as Panama, for example, maintain direct governmental oversight of their registries, integrating them into national maritime policy and economic strategy. Others, such as Gabon, outsource their registries to private entities (in the case of Gabon, located in the UAE) that operate with minimal governmental involvement. Panama, the world’s second-largest flag registry, has demonstrated a willingness to enhance compliance measures following leadership changes and strategic diplomatic outreach, leading to the deregistration of several sanctioned vessels. Liberia, the world’s largest registry, has also engaged in constructive discussions with enforcement authorities, and participants shared that the country is in the process of formalising a memorandum of understanding with the UK to bolster transparency and cooperation in flagging policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to government officials, the UK’s diplomatic approach has prioritised what is commonly referred to as “carrot and stick” diplomacy, with a strong emphasis on incentives rather than just on coercion. This strategy involves understanding the economic aspirations of flag states and their strategic interests within the IMO. Recognising that many flag states do not explicitly align themselves with Western geopolitical interests, UK officials have instead focused on highlighting the long-term economic and reputational benefits of maintaining high compliance standards. Flag registries that cultivate a reputation for professionalism and reliability stand to gain broader access to mainstream shipping markets, whereas those associated with illicit activities risk being marginalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Taskforce members added that a key aspect of this progress has been leveraging competition between flag registries. Countries such as Panama and Liberia compete vigorously for market share in the global registry business. This rivalry presents an opportunity to encourage better regulatory standards, as each seeks to position itself as the preferred choice for legitimate shipowners. For instance, Panama’s decision to deregister vessels associated with the Russian shadow fleet was influenced in part by concerns about being outflanked by Liberia in the registry business, according to participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, engagement has yielded mixed results with newer registries that have emerged as key enablers of shadow fleet operations. Gabon, for instance, has played an increasingly prominent role in registering Russian-linked vessels, particularly following the delisting of Sovcomflot tankers in Liberia. The Gabonese registry began registering Russian oil tankers in late 2023, rapidly expanding its presence in the shadow fleet sector. Diplomatic efforts have focused on encouraging Gabon to reconsider its role in facilitating illicit shipping, and there have been some positive signals, though results remain inconclusive. Similarly, Cameroon’s registry has been identified as a growing concern, requiring further engagement to determine whether it can be persuaded to adopt stronger compliance measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the economic incentives for some flag states to maintain lax oversight remain a significant barrier to enforcement. Many registries derive substantial revenue from vessel registrations and are hesitant to impose stricter controls that could deter business. Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach that not only emphasises reputational risks but also explores ways to provide alternative economic incentives for compliance. Thus, the Taskforce agreed that one of the key lessons from diplomatic engagement has been the effectiveness of framing discussions around environmental and safety concerns, rather than directly addressing the shadow fleet. Flag states often respond more positively to arguments highlighting the risks posed by substandard vessels to marine ecosystems and maritime safety than to discussions explicitly tied to sanctions enforcement. This approach has proven particularly useful in encouraging deregistration efforts, as flag states can justify compliance actions based on broader regulatory concerns, rather than on political alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical aspect of flag state engagement involves the interconnected nature of regulatory enforcement. Flag registries do not operate in isolation, but are part of a broader ecosystem that includes insurers, classification societies and financial institutions. Taskforce members discussed the diplomatic engagement which has sought to connect these dots, ensuring that actions taken against shadow fleet vessels trigger cascading consequences that reinforce compliance across multiple sectors. For instance, vessels that lose their flag status often face difficulties securing insurance and financing, creating a compounding effect that increases the cost of illicit operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite progress in some areas, the rapid reflagging of shadow fleet vessels from one jurisdiction to another underscores the adaptability of illicit operators. Participants agreed that efforts to deregister sanctioned vessels must be accompanied by measures to prevent them from simply shifting to another accommodating flag. This “Whac-a-Mole” dynamic highlights the need for sustained engagement and ongoing monitoring to ensure that flag states do not simply replace deregistered vessels with new ones linked to the same illicit networks. Moving forward, G7+ partners must continue strengthening partnerships with flag states that have demonstrated a commitment to compliance, while increasing pressure on non-cooperative registries to achieve impactful measures against the shadow fleet’s illicit shipping activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-international-frameworks-and-institutions&quot;&gt;Leveraging International Frameworks and Institutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce examined the role of existing international frameworks in addressing the challenges posed by the shadow fleet, with a particular focus on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Participants emphasised that any enforcement measures must align with the rules-based international order to maintain legitimacy and avoid unintended consequences. However, discussions underscored the growing complexity of applying traditional legal instruments to contemporary threats, particularly as other states are increasingly weaponising vessels in hybrid warfare and ignoring longstanding global norms and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key concern was the legal interpretation of UNCLOS, which enshrines fundamental principles such as innocent passage and transit rights through international straits. These rights are not contingent upon a vessel’s ownership structure, insurance status or compliance history, posing a challenge for enforcement efforts. Some Taskforce members argued that a rigid interpretation of UNCLOS limits the ability of states to respond to emerging security threats – particularly as adversarial actors exploit these provisions to evade scrutiny – and argued for an evolution of international law and standards. Others cautioned against attempts to stretch UNCLOS beyond its intended scope, warning that such actions could establish precedents that adversarial states might use to justify their own violations of international maritime law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, sanctions enforcement – particularly when not resulting from a decision at the UN – remains outside the explicit remit of UNCLOS, as such action is inherently a political tool wielded by individual states, rather than a globally mandated mechanism. Some participants stressed that attempts to use UNCLOS as an enforcement vehicle for sanctions could undermine its credibility, particularly given that the convention was not designed to regulate economic restrictions. Others pointed out that while direct sanctions enforcement is not within UNCLOS’s scope, broader principles of maritime security and environmental protection could be leveraged to address the shadow fleet’s activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing use of civilian vessels in hybrid warfare adds another layer of complexity. Recent instances of suspected undersea cable sabotage, potentially linked to shadow fleet operations, have heightened concerns about maritime security. While the deliberate severing of cables constitutes a hostile act, proving intent remains challenging. Representatives from the P&amp;amp;I community noted that cable-severing incidents are common, with accidental damage occurring regularly due to anchor drags and fishing activity. The challenge, therefore, lies in distinguishing between genuine accidents and deliberate acts of aggression. Existing conventions, such as the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Telegraph Cables, were not designed to address such hybrid threats. Under this framework, if a country discovers a Russian vessel interfering with cables, the prescribed legal procedure involves collecting evidence and referring the matter to Russia for action – an entirely unrealistic scenario given current geopolitical tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This legal ambiguity presents a dilemma: while enforcement efforts must remain within established legal frameworks, the existing conventions do not adequately address emerging threats. The Taskforce debated whether it would be possible to introduce an evolutionary interpretation of UNCLOS, incorporating evolving security concerns. Some Taskforce members argued that, under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the interpretation of international law can be dynamic. Indeed, UNCLOS provisions have been revisited in other contexts, such as environmental protection, to reflect new developments. However, others stressed the risks of this approach, warning that novel legal interpretations could invite retaliatory actions from states that might also exploit such precedents for their own strategic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related challenge identified by the Taskforce was the lack of transparency in flag state oversight of vessel insurance. Many designated vessels do not publicly disclose their insurance coverage, relying instead on self-reported compliance. This raises significant concerns, as incidents, such as the Alpha I tanker spill in Greece, have demonstrated the risks of inadequate insurance coverage for sanctioned vessels. IMO guidelines on insurance disclosures remain non-mandatory, and efforts to strengthen these regulations have met resistance from certain flag states. Participants debated whether the IMO could be leveraged to introduce stronger disclosure requirements for tanker insurance, compelling insurers to provide verifiable information on capital adequacy and financial transparency. This, in turn, could improve risk assessment and reduce the likelihood of uninsured vessels causing environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the use of the IMO as a sanctions-enforcement tool remains controversial. Some Taskforce members emphasised that the IMO is a maritime safety and environmental protection body, not a sanctions-enforcement agency. Others argued that while the IMO should not be co-opted for political objectives, there is scope to use its regulatory mechanisms to address risks that overlap with the shadow fleet’s activities. Empowering the IMO to strengthen transparency requirements for insurance and flag state oversight could directly contribute to enforcement efforts without explicitly linking them to sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploring-hard-security-responses&quot;&gt;Exploring Hard Security Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond legal and institutional frameworks, the Taskforce also explored the potential role of military partnerships in addressing the shadow fleet. The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), a UK-led coalition consisting predominantly of Nordic and Baltic states, was identified as a potential enforcement tool. Unlike NATO, which requires consensus for action, the JEF can operate with the agreement of just two member states, making it a more flexible mechanism for targeted interventions. Given that JEF states oversee key Russian oil export routes, including the Arctic, Baltic and Nordic straits, the English Channel and even the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal (due to the presence of UK overseas bases in Gibraltar and Cyprus), the coalition is well-positioned to monitor and report on shadow fleet activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce considered how the JEF could be leveraged to enhance maritime domain awareness, which remains suboptimal in many countries that are overly reliant on AIS tracking, which shadow fleet vessels frequently manipulate to evade detection. While military interdiction of vessels remains a highly sensitive issue, the JEF’s role as an intelligence-gathering and monitoring entity could prove valuable. There was discussion about whether the JEF could conduct targeted surveillance operations, tracking sanctioned vessels and sharing intelligence with enforcement authorities. Another proposal involved the possibility of JEF vessels shadowing shadow fleet ships, demonstrating a deterrent presence without direct intervention. However, the legal and political implications of such actions would need to be carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce concluded that while international legal frameworks such as UNCLOS and the IMO remain foundational to maritime governance, they are not sufficient in isolation to address the complexities of the shadow fleet. A combination of diplomatic engagement, regulatory refinement, enhanced intelligence sharing and military deterrence will be necessary to curtail Russia’s shadow fleet illicit maritime activities. However, any enforcement strategy must carefully navigate the legal and political constraints inherent in the international maritime system to avoid unintended repercussions that could undermine broader maritime trade and security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-trump-administration&quot;&gt;Implications of the Trump Administration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, the Taskforce discussed the potential ramifications of the new US administration for maritime sanctions enforcement. Given the significant role the US plays in global sanctions enforcement, any policy changes under the second Trump presidency could have wide-reaching consequences for the shadow fleet, Russian oil trade, and broader energy markets. Taskforce members also anticipated a greater focus on the Iranian shadow fleet, something all felt should be a focus of a future Taskforce meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some speculated that a change in leadership might lead to a weakening of sanctions enforcement against Russia, recent indications suggest that President Donald Trump may maintain and even tighten Russian sanctions, at least in the short term, particularly if they align with broader strategic objectives, such as controlling oil prices. Trump has made statements linking oil prices to the longevity of Russia’s war in Ukraine, arguing that lower oil revenues would exert financial pressure on Moscow and potentially shorten the conflict. Unlike previous approaches that primarily targeted individual vessels and owners, some Taskforce members argued that a more assertive enforcement strategy could involve placing pressure on the key infrastructure facilitating sanctioned oil trade, including ports, refineries and intermediaries in third countries. However, it remains unclear whether this strategy would be as effective against Russian oil trade as it has been with Iran, given the complexities of and evasion opportunities presented by the OPC and the diverse range of non-aligned countries willing to continue purchasing Russian crude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the US reassesses its foreign policy priorities in the coming months, close monitoring of policy statements and enforcement actions – particularly a greater focus on Iran – will be essential for anticipating the next phase of sanctions strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce identified a number of actions to strengthen maritime sanctions and enhance their enforcement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refine designations:&lt;/strong&gt; G7+ authorities should continue targeting shadow fleet vessels and key maritime facilitators and related infrastructure. To enhance compliance and enforcement effectiveness, designations should include specific criteria, such as breaching the OPC, ownership links to sanctioned entities, or engagement in deceptive shipping practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expedite delisting for compliant vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; While strict enforcement remains a priority, authorities should facilitate delisting for vessels that demonstrate a commitment to compliance, provided they meet stringent regulatory conditions. Suspicious vessels should remain designated to prevent abuse of the delisting process. Such a system would incentivise behavioural change while mitigating risks of entrenching the shadow fleet’s parallel trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grant licenses to safely scrap sanctioned tankers:&lt;/strong&gt; Designated vessels that are past their operational life expectancy and have deteriorated are at risk of being neglected or abandoned, as they cannot be disposed of in a safe manner due to both a lack of adequate insurance and sanctions-related barriers. The G7+ should explore the introduction of a pooled insurance scheme or licensing regime to enable the navigation of listed vessels to scrappage facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance flag state engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; Diplomatic efforts should frame compliance as an environmental and safety issue to encourage deregistration of sanctioned vessels. As larger registries take steps against the shadow fleet, further engagement with high-risk registries such as those of Gabon and Cameroon should be prioritised to limit their role in facilitating illicit operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance maritime insurance oversight:&lt;/strong&gt; Authorities should mandate greater transparency in maritime insurance documentation, ensuring that insurers operating outside the IGP&amp;amp;I adhere to clear financial and compliance standards. The IMO should strengthen guidelines requiring public disclosure of insurance to mitigate environmental risks associated with shadow fleet operations by ensuring that vessels maintain adequate liability coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage international frameworks to strengthen sanctions enforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; Enforcement measures should align with existing international legal frameworks such as UNCLOS, while remaining effective in addressing contemporary security challenges such as hybrid warfare, shadow fleet activities and emerging security threats. While sanctions are not explicitly covered under UNCLOS, broader maritime security and environmental protection provisions can be utilised to enhance regulatory oversight. The IMO should be engaged to improve insurance transparency and flag state due diligence requirements. However, attempts to stretch UNCLOS beyond its intended scope should be approached cautiously, to avoid setting precedents that adversarial states could exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand regional cooperation and maritime surveillance:&lt;/strong&gt; The JEF presents an opportunity for coordinated and enhanced targeted monitoring of shadow fleet activities. Expanding and following the example of the JEF’s role in monitoring shadow fleet movements, reporting sanctions violations, and deterring illicit activity through strategic presence could bolster existing enforcement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor policy shifts in the US:&lt;/strong&gt; G7+ partners must monitor policy shifts under the new US administration and ensure alignment in enforcement strategies. While initial indications suggest that Trump may maintain Russian sanctions for now, potential changes in enforcement tactics could have significant implications. An expansion of sanctions activity against Iran and its oil export industry should also be anticipated. Proactive engagement with US policymakers will be essential to maintaining coordination and preventing enforcement gaps that could be exploited by the shadow fleet and its enablers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second meeting of the RUSI Maritime Sanctions Taskforce reinforced the importance of adaptive enforcement measures to counter Russia’s evolving circumvention tactics. While progress has been made on designations and flag state engagement, further refinement is needed to ensure sanctions remain effective without creating unintended consequences. Strengthening diplomatic engagement, leveraging international frameworks, and ensuring greater clarity in enforcement actions will be key to maintaining pressure on Russia’s shadow fleet while upholding the integrity of global maritime regulations. The Taskforce will continue to monitor developments – including an anticipated increase in focus from the new US administration on Iranian targets – and provide recommendations to enhance collective efforts in tackling maritime sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

However, internal security threats, transborder insurgencies, ethnic marginalization, and economic challenges reveal underlying instability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security governance is a broad subject ranging from security sector reform and human security to nonmilitary aspects of statecraft. Most discourse on the important dimension of governance, however, is at the international level and dictated by international norms. When it comes to Ghana, the typical question is: Does Ghana have a security problem? If so, how serious is it and what regional implications does it have? These concepts are most relevant when defined in practical terms at the citizen level, where they translate into civil-military relations. Instead of asking if Ghana has a security problem, policymakers should ask: Do Ghanaians feel safe? If not, then Ghana needs better security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, Ghana remains an important security and economic partner because of its political leverage over its West African neighbors. Developments in Ghana matter due to the threats they represent for the region, such as the recent rise in political violence, trafficking, and insecurity in urban centers and along the northern borders with Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, and Togo. Ghana’s weakened state of governance and the politicization of its military have created the type of conditions seen in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso before terrorist organizations overran those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on field research conducted in Accra and Tamale, Ghana, in March 2024. At the request of the interviewees, the researchers have kept the comments in this report anonymous. To conduct this study, the researchers met with a broad cross-section of civil society leaders representing youth, women, and various ethnic and regional groups; independent journalists; local political and security analysts and academics; military officers; and international diplomats and representatives of international organizations based in Accra and Tamale. Many respondents were not originally from Accra or Tamale, so they shared experiences and observations of life outside the capital in zones directly affected by insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By law, Ghana is a unitary state, but in practice it is far from that. The country has a national constitution, which is the source of national institutions such as the military, police, and legal system. As Ghana is a pluralistic nation, these institutions do not suit everyone, especially not recently, given several alarming developments such as the chieftaincy conflict in Bawku in the upper east region. Ghana is a democracy, but the democratic system and process have been tested in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ghana most people know enjoys a very positive image and deservingly so. It is home to a conference center for international peacekeeping and regional cultural preservation. A destination for well-heeled diaspora tourists, Ghana projects confidence, cultural prowess, and clout as a pioneer of Pan-Africanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political pundits and security analysts see Ghana as a stalwart for stability. In an area increasingly threatened by violent extremism, coups d’états, and political tyrants, it is one of the few democratic countries that has consistently seen the peaceful transfer of power over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana has an illustrious military history. Ghanaians took on leadership roles during the deployment of peace support operations by the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) into Sierra Leone and Liberia. Ghana is also an important troop contributor to UN peacekeeping operations. Ghanaian troops participated in UN operations during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and in the peacekeeping and stabilization operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the last two decades. The U.S. military’s decision to integrate Ghana into interregional and international military exercises, such as Flintlock, has underscored Ghana’s reputation as an important security actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists recognize Ghana as a regional powerhouse that attracts workers from across the region to its flourishing agri-business and mining industries. Despite conflicts over land management, particularly with farmers and pastoralists across the northern regions of the country, Ghana appears to manage the problem without provoking ethnic or political violence. And yet, behind the veneer, Ghana faces considerable challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international community increasingly looks to Ghana for regional leadership in a neighborhood where coups d’états and autocracy are gaining ground. Recognizing the longevity of Ghana’s democratic institutions, international leaders sometimes turn a blind eye to human rights irregularities or write blank checks. In 2023, Ghana cashed in on its credibility by convincing creditors to bank there even after its banks defaulted in late 2022 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had to float Ghana’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists and political allies fear, perhaps rightly, that IMF and World Bank funds might be diverted to political campaign ventures rather than provide desperately needed support for jobs and the education and health sectors. Shortly after the January 2020 election, President Nana Akufo-Addo pledged to “build a cathedral to glory and God” for granting his party, the New Patriotic Party (NPP), victory in the elections, but the project stalled due to lack of funds. The announcement in 2023 that the cash-strapped state would move ahead with building the $400 million state-funded cathedral confirmed fears that campaign strategy, not economics, would dictate government spending until Ghana holds its next presidential election in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As average Ghanaians struggle to make ends meet and officials make off with millions, the government is having difficulty convincing Ghanaians that it operates in the public’s interest. The population also questions the soundness of the IMF’s actions, which it sees as enabling government mismanagement. In December 2024, Ghanaians asserted their need for change by re-electing President John Dramani Mahama over the incumbent vice president, Mahamudu Bawumia. Mahama’s victory is attributed to dissatisfaction with the incumbent government’s handling of economic issues and Mahama’s campaign promise to renegotiate the $3 billion IMF bailout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, Ghana is an unwitting host to networks of smuggling rings. As in most countries, Ghana has porous international borders. Criminal networks exploit weak border controls to move people, weapons, tobacco, vehicles, cashews, stolen cattle, cocoa, and timber into or across the country. These so-called trades finance the activities of criminal groups in border areas, especially illegal mining, truck theft, fuel theft, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and above all the theft of cattle in neighboring countries to sell in northern Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profits from these trades also allegedly fall into the hands of violent extremist organizations (VEOs) operating in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Togo. An umbrella coalition of al Qaeda–aligned groups known as Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen ( JNIM) has aligned with criminal networks involved in the movement of legal and illegal goods. While the incidence of terrorism and the number of Ghanaians involved in terrorist activities were relatively low as of 2024, the growing appeal of international terrorist groups and the increasing exposure of Ghanaians to these groups point to a possible terrorist threat in Ghana. The situation in the northern border areas is becoming more tense and the populations more radicalized, especially due to social media, which increasingly spreads propaganda and calls to destabilize Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidents of political violence in Ghana, along with traditional ethnic and chieftaincy-related violence, underscore how using violence for political ends is becoming increasingly acceptable in Ghana. Recent years have seen an increase in violence related to land disputes and local and district-level elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of a Western diplomat, “Ghana has been spared terrorism but not violent extremism.” There is a commonly expressed fear that violent extremist groups could team up with disaffected community members in northern Ghana desperate for security governance dialogue and establish a parallel security protocol based on an exchange of services, information, and cooperation. To some degree, such arrangements already exist among the networks of smugglers and VEOs that operate in the northern border areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These networks have grown, in part, due to a normative environment in which local communities accept organized crime by situating it within a cultural ethos and the social welfare roles criminals play. Such norms develop unfettered due to the lack of government presence and control in these areas. These spaces are not ungoverned but rather undergoverned, with inadequate civil and security personnel to reverse the trends that have been developing for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much attention focuses on the north, Ghana also faces the growing threat of insecurity in urban centers. Despite official rhetoric on external challenges to the country’s security—such as cross-border crime, illegal arms trafficking, and the instability in neighboring Côte d’Ivoire—qualitative research shows that these concerns are dwarfed by concerns about everyday violence. For most Ghanaians, the main threats to their security are domestic violence, crime, food insecurity, poverty, disease, environmental degradation, and the erosion of the quality of state institutions. The state is failing in its duty as the “ultimate provider” of these dimensions of security—namely, economic security, physical security, environmental security, social security, and personal security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this failure is the antiquated colonial lens through which security forces preserve establishment interests and a narrow vision of the state. Rather than serve the welfare of all citizens, a ruling elite has captured the state for their own enrichment, and security is available only to those who can afford it. Such an attitude has triggered a widely repeated public discourse, mainly through social media, that discredits democratic institutions and governments and calls for an alternative system bordering on populism to address public grievances. In short, the threat of insecurity is much more diverse and politically sensitive than commonly acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to discussions with diplomats, security experts, and civil society organizations (CSOs) in the capital and upper provinces, Ghana is on the edge of a political and security crisis that it is ill-suited and ill-prepared to manage—in large part because it does not have an integrated mechanism to unite all actors in making Ghana a safer place to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security plays a pivotal role in enhancing economic development. The safer people feel, the greater the chances they will invest in economic ventures that expand socioeconomic activities and overall trust and confidence. Facing these threats would involve concerted efforts from the government and international community, with Ghanaian citizens taking the lead on identifying ways to manage fragile areas in need of security reform and protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security governance is more art than science, and no approach can claim to produce infallible results. However, whether a top-down institutional approach or a more organic bottom-up approach, nearly all approaches include some version of real or even perceived influence of civilians over government security policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big-picture security governance should strengthen state-society relations and enable participatory and inclusive security measures at the community level. An unavoidable component is the public image of the government’s approach. In Ghana, TikTok and Facebook content creators drive much of the political-social discourse. The combined influence of citizens’ legitimate concerns and a barrage of fake news and messages to manipulate public opinion against the state have placed Ghana’s democracy in the crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-recipe-for-safety&quot;&gt;A Recipe for Safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a visit to Ghana in February 2024, a short ride from the hotel to the center of Accra inspired a discussion on feelings of safety. “I don’t feel safe,” said Frank, the middle-aged Uber driver, “because the politicians are in control of the security apparatus, and they don’t care about me or my interests. They only look out for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Ghanaians feel the same way. A common notion is that Ghana’s social contract with its citizenry is missing a clause on citizen safety. Fortunately, public concerns have not gone unnoticed. The Ghanaian government is aware of its shortcomings in meeting citizens’ expectations. Over the past two decades, with donor support, it has laid out programs to increase public participation in developing its security strategies, including various forms of community policing to allay concerns and build trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the security governance system continues to suffer from an identity crisis due to the plurality of citizens’ backgrounds and experiences. Citizens feel less concerned with the state’s agenda to keep people safe and have prioritized their own security agendas. Security strategies vary across the country, from impromptu night patrols by village youths to more organized state-recognized militias. Local security groups are not strictly a response to the lack of state effectiveness. Some are linked to precolonial systems that were never disbanded, and their existence continues due to the lack of a better system to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many Ghanaian urban centers, civilian policing groups known as “Watch Dogs” attend to their own security and justice needs. Reliance on vigilante justice is not unique to Ghana; in urban centers across Africa, residents resort to community policing groups to meet their security needs. These entities typically emerge in a security vacuum when state-sanctioned security forces cannot provide security to the community’s satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few African states, public policing has not fully displaced other forms of Indigenous policing systems in the postcolonial era. The endurance of some of these Indigenous policing groups has been driven partly by internal dynamics, including the flexibility of civilian policing groups, the way these groups understand and address security concerns, and their sensitivity to local justice and security. Externally, the endurance of civilian policing groups has been sustained, in part, by the rollback of the state through structural adjustment programs. State support for Watch Dogs in some communities is partly a way to address local security needs while meeting local satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most visible program—the Community Policing Unit—unfolded in 2002, giving rise to somewhat controversial neighborhood watch committees (NWCs). The success of NWCs hinges on the notion that people who live and work in a neighborhood are best suited to understand their area’s resources, problems, and needs. The move was controversial because it led to the formal emergence of Watch Dogs, which sometimes became judge and jury in their communities and were allegedly responsible for human rights abuses. The Watch Dog title has been used to describe a broad range of community-based security units, from traditional security forces and informal patrol groups to more proactive trained units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana’s statutory legal framework promotes the codification and application of various forms of customary law but does not authorize traditional security systems to administer punishment beyond certain misdemeanors. The result is that some residents view these traditional security systems as weakened, judging them as lame and unattractive, as many local youths seek more aggressive action to establish order and mete out local justice. Hence, they see appeal in the Watch Dogs, which are formally licensed by police and receive some level of training and equipment. In 2023, security analysts warned that some Watch Dogs had begun to receive military-grade weapons and training to act as supports to existing security forces on the ground but without formal incorporation into the security hierarchy or recognized accountability for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the support of the German Agency for International Development (GIZ), the Ghana Police Service (GPS) launched the Enhanced Visibility and Community Policing Strategy in late 2022. The program builds on past community policing experiences to enhance police operations. But instead of relying on a civilian force, the program enlists professional police officers to establish rapport with residents by assigning units to patrol at-risk neighborhoods. The strongest benefit to this approach is that it reinforces the image of the state while including local stakeholders in developing security and crime prevention plans in their respective jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the format of the program emphasizes the right areas and warrants support, civil society actors call the program poorly planned. The approach is designed to circumvent some shortcomings of the traditional community policing models, but it fails to achieve the same level of presence. Despite attempts by the police administration to establish permanent police posts in some areas, the lack of accommodation has created an ad hoc police presence and frequent turnover of officers allocated to these posts. Because they are not permanently stationed, officers have had difficulty establishing trust with the community. Consequently, police units continue to experience conflict with residents who feel officers are not adequately performing their duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;citizen-justice&quot;&gt;Citizen Justice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsatiable Expectations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens of Ghana, like those of other West African countries, have long entrusted their security to local entities. These include community-borne safety groups, over which citizens have greater control and in which they have placed their trust to intervene in the local interest. Citizens do not see the national security apparatus as subject to public or citizen control or oversight. Importantly, they do not expect that the state will ensure their safety. That lack of expectation, which has roots in the colonial past, continues to undermine security governance in Ghana today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap between citizens’ expectations and what security forces can do legally is a major issue for African democracies. In absolute terms, security forces cannot fulfill their mandates and appear effective without citizens’ approval and consent. The legitimacy of security forces depends on citizens’ satisfaction with their performance, their level of accountability, and how well they adhere to procedural rules when interacting with citizens. In theory, when the public perceives the police as effective, they will defer to the police’s authority and directives and feel safer because of the services the police provide. In short, a responsive security service can be a good measure of governance, democracy, and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem emerges when public calls for street justice do not respect the rule of law and due process that police are required to follow. Civilian control is not about giving absolute power to civilians on all security-related matters but rather creating a system of checks and balances to ensure accountability of the security sector in the interests of both the state and communities. The security sector needs and should retain a degree of autonomy in internal operational matters to prevent the politicization of the security sector in the service of political interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police are the first, and often the only, point of contact Ghanaians have with the criminal justice system. Unfortunately, these interactions are marred by widespread corruption, illegal arrest and detention, excessive use of force, and a failure to respond to complaints, which are hallmarks of a regime-style police force unaccountable for its actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of national security in the context of Ghana—and indeed the rest of the former British colonies in West Africa—largely focused on the internal public order imperatives of the colonial state, with a secondary emphasis on suppressing “anti-imperial” threats—notably, nationalist agitations. The armed forces had been recruited largely to cope with the internal threat to the public order and colonial state posed by the Indigenes, whose initial hostility to British rule had been over land expropriation issues and resistance to taxes. The police and army, therefore, began as constabulary forces geared toward repressing insurrection, preventing civil violence, and managing rural disorder, rather than as traditional security forces. Indeed, the police force was designed to hold the people down at the least cost to the colonial administration. Mounting pressure for more African participation in the lower rungs of the colonial state led to the recruitment of a handful of locals into the police force. Only during World War II did the state take more meaningful strides toward developing a select local cadre of the officer class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since colonial times, the structure of the Ghanaian security forces has changed little. Ghanaians still see them primarily as an apparatus for protecting the ruling elite instead of the people of Ghana. Today, security institutions such as the military and police continue to see themselves as the source of power, which they have retained for the past six decades and are not in the least interested in relinquishing. Public hearings on security matters are not broadcast on television, and transcripts of these hearings are not available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low public opinion, corrupt recruitment practices, and underequipped forces have been at the core of low morale within the police. While the GPS recognizes the misconduct that has garnered its poor reputation and low public trust, it is attempting to repair its public face. For instance, as part of the “See Something, Say Something” public safety campaign, authorities are more willing, open, and available to meet with CSOs. But these conversations and platforms are few and far between, and civil society representatives cannot determine whether authorities have accepted their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police inspector general has been engaging with youths, going to schools to help them understand the role of defense and security institutions and bridging the gap between these institutions and the population. While the inspector general is popular and seen as a reformist, the public views the police as corrupt and not open to change. As one analyst put it, “In fact, to the populations, even the See Something, Say Something campaign is seen as a contradiction, given the mistrust between the citizens and the police, which often brutalizes and prevents the people from exercising their civic rights.” In the words of a security analyst, “Police officers are a nuisance when you do not need them and useless when you need them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police headquarters in Accra recently revamped its appearance, purchasing new vehicles and creating training protocols to boost professionalism in the police force. However, the shortage of materials leaves police feeling ill prepared and outgunned in neighborhoods where they are needed most. In a recent study, police rank and file complained about patrolling vast areas on foot without bulletproof vests or other protective equipment. Another formidable obstacle is alleged political influence on recruitment practices, wherein politicians fast-track recruitment of urban or rural youth into the police and military to help shore up support for a particular candidate. The recruitment process ensures that the recruits essentially become untouchable and unaccountable to the internal hierarchy, rendering a portion of the police force unmanageable, untrainable, and undisciplined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many parts of the world, security in Ghana is a salient and critical issue requiring the proper governance of the state to maintain peace and prevent threats to the lives and properties of its citizenry. The police, for now, appear to be a dead end when it comes to concerted, effective security governance efforts, especially along Ghana’s northern borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-potential-way-forward&quot;&gt;A Potential Way Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facilitated Civilian-Military Partnerships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on discussions with security entities, citizens, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and CSOs, the Ghanaian military holds a greater level of public trust today than the police and other security forces. The public sees the military as an entity that can get the job done. When faced with a security threat, most Ghanaians trust the military to remove the threat effectively. However, that trust has allowed the military’s presence to spill over into areas that are traditionally public or civilian domains, such as providing close protection for high-profile individuals, escorting bank armored vehicles, and even overseeing crowd control for public and political events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments may deploy the military to perform internal security duties to bolster the tasks of the police service in terms of logistics. During the colonial era in Ghana, the military was employed in various operations to quell disturbances and riots, meaning its historical roots are intertwined with the maintenance of internal security. However, more recently, deployment of the military has been associated with compensating for the lack of effectiveness and inefficiency of police units to fulfill tasks and meet public and private expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of combining military and police functions has inherent dangers. For this reason, upon attaining independence, Ghanaian leaders enacted a law that regulated the presence and conduct of the military employed in performing internal security functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable democratic changes that have reshaped Ghana over the past three decades, its defense and security institutions, including the military, have not changed much regarding civil-military relations, which are driven by both trust and fear. Ghanaians see the military as serving politicians who prefer the status quo, which allows them to co-opt the armed forces for their political agenda. In other words, political alternance has not necessarily brought change, as ruling parties instrumentalize the security apparatus to their benefit, setting off a vicious cycle. As a result, there is no real civilian oversight or demand for accountability and transparency. In recent years, civilian trust in the military has also eroded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in 2021, the military stormed the parliament during a vote for speaker, shocking and terrifying the population. But to date, there has been no public hearing on the matter. In a way, this is a consequence of the normalization of military involvement in domestic affairs. In 2020, the armed forces were deployed to secure the elections, further feeding the belief that they were protecting the interests of the ruling party. There have been violent encounters between military officers and civilians. In one case, an officer was killed in a community targeted by the military after an officer’s mobile telephone was stolen and several people were arrested. These incidents will continue as long as the armed forces undertake law enforcement activities. Sustained and strong civilian oversight of these institutions is the most efficient way to dial back on these deployments and one of the pillars of positive civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana establishes the framework for security agency operations and demarcates the roles of the military and those of the police, among other security agencies. However, the constitution also states clearly that the armed forces shall be equipped and maintained to perform their role of defending Ghana as well as performing other functions for the development of Ghana as the president may determine—a considerable window for a diversity of tasks and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most countries, the military is one of the most respected institutions. Using the military in roles that it has not been trained for and that are not prescribed by its doctrine can erode the respect it enjoys from the citizenry. In the long term, this erosion can threaten the foundation of the military as an institution. For these reasons, most political pundits recommend that Ghana restrict the military’s role and establish a paramilitary unit to assist the police in law enforcement. Allowing the military to serve in internal security operations will have detrimental effects on civilian policing, professionalization of the military, and national security. The loyalty of the military—and for that matter of the defense and security institutions—is not to the central government as such but to the established government as a political authority. Thus, the military’s duties should not extend to internal security except in circumstances of last resort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghanaian citizens may be grateful for their military stepping in to stabilize a dangerous civil disorder, and the military may perform this intervening role in a responsible and respectful manner. But its presence undermines the nation’s foundations of civilian control through a secret chain of martial command and accountability. Converting military capabilities to policing functions will have severe implications for the nation’s democratization process and for the military itself, especially as Ghana enters another electoral phase in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largely amiable relationship between the military and society may present an opportunity for an enduring and positive civilian-military dialogue in Ghana. The generally uncritical attitude civilians have toward the military may provide openings for local protocols or strategies for soldiers and the civilians they are meant to protect. Civil-military committees (CMCs) were designed as platforms for the military and civilians to exchange information and air grievances. Unfortunately, CMCs have been overly centralized and instrumentalized to impose political agendas rather than allow citizen feedback that could revolutionize information processing in remote sensitive areas of the country and stabilize violent regions such as in the upper east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last three decades, Ghana has undertaken governance reforms to improve the performance of its governing institutions. These reforms include modernization of the legal and judicial systems, decentralization of certain aspects of governance, and efforts to control corruption, among others. However, the citizen-military relations (CMR) institutional framework remains largely unaltered. Ghana has no legal provisions regarding CMR. Although the constitution mentions the armed forces in various places, it does not impose specific regulations on their relationship with civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMCs represent an opportunity to address the diversity of challenges and approaches to security governance with salient issues in each geographic area dictating concrete action. Unfortunately, CMCs in Ghana face several challenges. First, the administrative system is overcentralized, which weakens local committees’ ability to operate effectively. Second, the political environment in Ghana is heavily partisan. Government and opposition politicians sometimes use the military to advance their own political interests. In such a political environment, CMCs struggle to function independently and appear as neutral bodies. Third, the functions of CMCs are unclear. Most people think CMCs just implement government policy at the local level. Consequently, they sometimes see the military as an institution that implements policy instead of having direct input into policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral support for developing functional CMCs should clarify Ghana’s internal policy on incorporating active-duty military into programming that encourages understanding between civilians and the military. Considering Ghana’s history of political recruits, donors must insist on vetting military participants to ensure they are willing partners in the process and not subject to political influence or a history of disciplinary issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, CMR programs have fizzled out because they lack proper timing or urgency or they have been overly focused on subjecting the military to civilian rule and management. CSOs have expressed the need for training to understand the role they could play in revitalizing CMCs by convening citizens and military in a neutral, apolitical environment to discuss local security concerns and steps forward. Bilateral support from donors for this process may help increase NGOs’ and CSOs’ understanding of the roles and limitations of civil and military control and introduce civilian police entities, wherever possible, to boost the credibility of civilian law enforcement. The moment is ripe to formalize such a dynamic approach to security governance, especially in the north, where there is an increase in threats and a tacit recognition of the military as an ally. NGOs and CSOs already in contact with the military and in tune with community concerns offer the path of least resistance for establishing a frictionless framework for dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally important, members of the parliament and their staff need training in civil-military relations and oversight processes for this bilateral engagement to have the lasting impact Ghana needs as it faces real threats inside and outside its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana has come a long way. In 1957, it became the first sub-Saharan country to achieve independence, and it quickly established itself as a regional leader. However, due to domestic political and security dynamics, coupled with Cold War politics, Ghana experienced military coups from 1966 to 1979 before transitioning to democratic rule in 1992. For the past three decades, Ghanaians have embraced a democratic system and its inherent political alternance. They expect their leaders to deliver on the expectations and promises of good governance, security, and stability. Democratization has also helped professionalize the military and produce one of Africa’s rare republican armies striving to stay above the political fray. However, given the current economic, social, political, and security contexts, it behooves the country’s leadership to correct course and rebuild the people’s faith in democracy and trust in security and defense institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the Ghanaian government and the parliament should consider several initiatives to foster better citizen engagement and institutional responsiveness, and bridge the gap between security providers and civilians, by undertaking the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch dialogues with key civilian stakeholders, starting with traditional leaders—particularly in the areas where they wield great influence and including youths, women, and others—to get the full measure of the level of discontent and the drivers of mistrust between the population and institutions. CSOs involved in security issues should be allowed to speak without fear of harassment or retribution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adopt, promote, implement, and enforce policies that ensure accountability, transparency, and inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hold more public hearings in parliament and other avenues on matters of law enforcement, security, and defense, with expert contributions from CSOs that work closely with the population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand human rights training programs for security and defense institutions, including gender-sensitive training, to diffuse tensions between these institutions and the population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforce and augment the police’s capacity to carry out its mission, including overhauling and reforming procedures and structures, recruitment, training, and remuneration. These changes are necessary to help police perform better and rebuild the people’s trust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Depoliticize the military so it stays above the political fray and remains republican. This entails limiting the use of the military in law enforcement operations, which is critical in preserving discipline, unity, and professionalism. It will also preserve the military’s mystique and civilians’ trust in the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Address the citizenship issue of the Fulbes/Fulanis living in border regions. These disenfranchised and stigmatized communities are vulnerable to abuses by Ghanaian officials and extremist groups, with the latter recruiting from these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After facing setbacks in the Sahel, the United States must recognize that the lack of citizen access to the discourse on security represents an underlying driver of instability in coastal West Africa. The absence of state engagement in citizens’ concerns has emboldened alternate—and sometimes violent—local strategies for crime fighting, including tacit and overt alliances with groups linked to violent extremist organizations. Therefore, U.S. strategic security objectives in littoral West Africa should prioritize reducing the factors that have unraveled stability in the Sahel region—namely, the lack of localized security governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and other allies are best positioned to help Ghana address these challenges by supporting programs that accomplish the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train members of the parliament and their staff to build expertise in oversight of defense and security institutions through exchange programs with legislative bodies of partner countries, including the U.S. State Department’s International Visitor Leadership Program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build the capacity of CSOs working on security issues to acquire the necessary expertise for overseeing, monitoring, and sustaining effective civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build the capacity of defense and security institutions and provide the necessary expertise and best practices for communicating with CSOs and the population and sustaining effective civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana is a key partner for regional security. The telltale signs of a breakdown in civil-military relations cannot be missed. Given the worrisome security developments in neighboring countries, Ghana must address these challenges and correct course. Strong civil-military relations and oversight processes are crucial pillars of stability and have the lasting impact Ghana needs as the country faces real threats from within and outside its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and the United States have had a close partnership for over a century, fighting side by side in every major war since World War I. In recent years, as threats have evolved and challenges have multiplied, the U.S.-Australian alliance has become increasingly salient for policymakers in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, China has become increasingly aggressive with its stated intentions and its actions. There is a growing list of examples of China using economic coercion against those that contradict its specific interests. According to CSIS research, at least “eighteen Western and Asian countries, including Japan, Lithuania, Norway, and Australia, and over 123 private companies, including Walmart and the National Basketball Association, have been targeted, precipitating tens of billions of dollars in economic damage.” China is also increasing its gray zone tactics in the broader Indo-Pacific region, including violating the territorial waters and airspace of other nations. Over the last decade, China has routinely violated Japan’s territorial waters, and in August 2024, a Chinese military airplane entered Japanese airspace for the first time. Chinese actions in the South China Sea regularly violate international laws of the sea, such as deliberately ignoring the 2016 United Nations Arbitral Tribunal ruling, which ruled in favor of the Philippines, and attacking Australian divers with dangerous sonar pulses. China has been quite vocal about its goal of unifying Taiwan with the mainland, which would have profound consequences for regional stability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concern over China’s posturing is laid out in each nation’s strategic planning documents. In the United States, the National Security Strategy characterizes China as the U.S. military’s pacing challenge, with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to advance that objective.” The document highlights the importance of working with allies and partners to maintain a rules-based international order and notes that, “The war in Ukraine highlights the criticality of a vibrant Defense Industrial Base for the United States and its allies and partners.” Australia’s 2024 National Defense Strategy identified Chinese actions in the Indo-Pacific—and especially in the South China Sea—as directly endangering regional stability and Australia’s national security interests, while also emphasizing Australia’s role as an active shaper of the Indo-Pacific strategic environment. This “National Defence” doctrine recognizes Australia’s contribution beyond its national borders and the increasing importance of military and industrial cooperation with the United States to uphold the international rules-based order through enhancing deterrence, strengthening force posture, and increasing production of munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and the United States are well postured to work in partnership against global threats. The two nations first became treaty allies with the passing of the Australia-New Zealand-U.S. (ANZUS) treaty in 1951 and now have multiple other formal relationships, including the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement along with Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The U.S. and Australian militaries train together, and U.S. Marines rotate annually through Darwin, in Australia’s Northern Territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formal bilateral arrangements include the Agreement concerning the Status of United States Forces in Australia (SOFA) of 1963, the Logistics Support Agreement (LSA) of 1989, the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) of 2010, the Treaty concerning Defense Trade Cooperation of 2013, and the Force Posture Agreement of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is also a key U.S. trade and investment partner. Australia has a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (RDP-MOU) as well as a Security of Supply Arrangement with the United States. In 2016, the U.S. Congress added Australia to the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB) arrangement. The Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) came into force in 2005. The arrangement that has received the most attention recently is the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) partnership, announced in 2021. AUKUS, which has two pillars, is designed to counter twenty-first-century threats through enhanced technology partnerships. Pillar I is designed to bolster Australia’s military capability with a new fleet of conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines. Pillar II focuses on developing new technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence and autonomy; quantum technology; hypersonic, undersea, and advanced cyber capabilities; electronic warfare; and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these arrangements support the goal of stronger economic ties while creating opportunities for business enterprises to grow their markets and build economies of scale by selling in partner nations. Rising defense budgets in both the United States and Australia offer new opportunities, even in a highly competitive international arms market. Australian defense companies have been constrained in their growth by the smaller size of the domestic Australian defense market, which has limited their ability to produce competitively at scale. The local prominence of global defense primes’ subsidiaries has filled some of this gap. The United States’ market presents an opportunity to increase sales, build the scale of production by building systems that both nations use (commonality), and invest in innovation and new product development. Simultaneously, larger U.S. prime contractors might look to increase the market for their products in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in both nations have affirmed their goals of enhanced defense industrial cooperation. In the United States, the National Defense Industrial Strategy highlights the goal of “building enduring industrial advantages through a resilient defense ecosystem . . . to include supporting our allies and partners with key capabilities to strengthen integrated deterrence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s Defence Industry Development Strategy focuses on growing the country’s sovereign industrial base and includes engaging with allies and partners as part of the broader strategy. The sovereign industrial base aims to provide sufficient capacity to ensure that Australia is a key stakeholder in a short list of pivotal domains while also enjoying the benefits of being incorporated into a larger web of production. The strategy aims to avoid the trap of trying to autarkically produce all its defense needs locally. As the strategy details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Co-design, co-development, co-production and co-sustainment of capability will make effective use of combined resources, strengthening collective defence industrial capacity, enhancing interoperability, and accelerating technology development. The goal is to build capable, resilient, competitive, and secure supply chains that include Australian businesses, and create economies of scale for the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries’ visions recognize the importance of a strong industrial base and how working with allies and partners can contribute to this goal. Turning these ideas into action will require time and attention from senior policymakers to translate the strategic vision into tactical-level steps to identify and fund requirements and overcome existing barriers. Necessary actions include facilitating critical technology transfers, allowing for the sharing of classified and sensitive information, and providing opportunities for defense firms to enter each other’s markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been important recent steps to address some of the policy challenges, such as changes to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) regime, which is designed to limit the proliferation of advanced technology to problematic actors. On September 1, 2024, the AUKUS exemptions to ITAR went into effect, granting Australia and the United Kingdom the same privileged status within the U.S. defense industrial base (DIB) as Canada, after the State Department determined that the export control systems of both countries are “comparable” to those of the United States. The reforms add an expedited licensing process for exporting some defense articles to AUKUS partners and increase the scope of exemptions for transferring defense articles to some dual nationals who have security clearances from Australia and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there has been less research on the experiences that private enterprises face when trying to do business in the partner nation. If the U.S. and Australian governments truly want to encourage defense industrial cooperation, they should address the full spectrum of challenges and adjust policies accordingly. The research analyzed in this report aims to support this goal by providing a framework to better understand barriers and catalysts to cooperation. This framework builds off existing research by diving deeper into the defense industrial cooperation component of security cooperation, assessing the challenges faced by industry, and providing recommendations to both government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-report-outline&quot;&gt;Methodology and Report Outline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on research, interviews, and workshops, this paper gives an overview of the goals of the U.S.-Australia alliance, with a focus on strengthening the entire defense industrial ecosystem. The project team reviewed policy documents focused on the strategic goals of the partnership—the “demand” signal for enhanced collaboration—as well as documents describing the breadth and depth of defense industrial ties between Australia and the United States. The research also touched on the laws, policies, and cultural barriers that limit these ties, including the export control regimes of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews included discussions with government personnel on both sides of the Pacific. The team gathered data from engagements with government representatives at the working and senior levels. These engagements included a conference in Canberra, Australia, with a public keynote by Hugh Jeffrey, deputy secretary of strategy, policy, and industry at Australia’s Department of Defence, and a follow-on conference in Washington, D.C., with a public keynote panel featuring Brian Burton, senior advisor for international and industry engagement with the Office of the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy, and Graham Chynoweth, former director of international policy and global investments with Office of Strategic Capital at the U.S. Department of Defense. The panel discussion in Washington began with opening remarks from Paul Myler, former deputy head of mission at the Embassy of Australia in Washington, D.C. Each conference included private track 1.5 dialogues to establish space for forthright discussion, and the twin conferences allowed both Australian and U.S. stakeholders to have the opportunity to take center stage. Some of the industry executives interviewed for the project had previously worked in government, allowing them to offer perspectives from both viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team also conducted interviews with business leaders from Australian and U.S. companies on their experiences doing business in the partner nation. The interviews were structured around three questions: What are the catalysts for defense industrial cooperation? What are the barriers to this cooperation? What are your recommendations for overcoming these barriers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees included representatives from 9 large U.S. defense contractors, 8 of which are doing business with Australia. The team also spoke with representatives from 19 Australian companies. Only one of these had decided not to pursue business with the United States because of perceived challenges. The other 18 are either doing business with the United States or are trying to break into the market. These companies were identified through two means. The Austrade representative in the Australian embassy in Washington offered a list of companies that they worked with on marketing to U.S. and global industry. To avoid any bias by using a sample defined by the Australian government, the study team also worked with a Washington-based consultant who advised Australian companies more generally, including those trying to break into the U.S. market. While the challenges offered by the two groups were not notably different, the second group did include an enterprise that viewed the challenges as too daunting to even explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this introductory chapter, Chapter 2 gives an overview of the history and strategic vision of the U.S.-Australia alliance. Chapter 3 describes a framework for defense industrial cooperation. Chapter 4 puts the experience of the interviewees into the context of this framework. Chapter 5 looks at catalysts for cooperation and the larger ecosystem challenges. Chapter 6 summarizes the report, offers recommendations, and concludes the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-history-and-vision&quot;&gt;Strategic History and Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-strategic-challenge&quot;&gt;Current Strategic Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States and Australia share a long history of deep cooperation, the contemporary strategic environment is propelling both countries to pursue a significantly expanded and deepening set of initiatives. The rapidly deteriorating strategic environment has been a key driver in strengthening the U.S.-Australia alliance in recent years, with an increasingly assertive China, and its ever-more-aligned partner Russia, standing at the forefront of this challenge. Not only has Beijing undertaken an unprecedented buildup of its military power, it also has increasingly used that power to rewrite the international rules-based order to favor its autocratic view of the world. China’s malign actions in the South China Sea, weaponization of trade, aggressive activities in cyberspace, confrontational posturing toward Taiwan, and tacit support for Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine have reinforced the critical role that allies and partners play in countering these destabilizing actions and working together to reinforce the rules-based international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, efforts to counter these threats to security have only grown more complex as cyber capabilities have proliferated, potent technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing have emerged, and warfare has quickly evolved to include the widespread use of unmanned systems. These new capabilities have enabled China’s and Russia’s increasingly bold activities, whether by exploiting gray zone tactics to meddle with critical infrastructure like undersea cables, employing unprecedented force to bully smaller nations in their own exclusive economic zones (EEZs), or threatening stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size and scale of these challenges demand collective action. In many respects, deterrence is a numbers game counted in production capability. This is especially true in conflicts that demand large quantities of munitions and platforms. Here, China and Russia have surged ahead, putting their defense industrial bases on a wartime footing. On their own, nations that value a free and open international rules-based system will struggle to match Chinese and Russian production capacity and deter destabilizing activities. This is a fight the United States and its like-minded partners and allies can win—or, better yet, can avoid through deterrence. In this new age of partnerships and alliances, deterrence must become a collective endeavor, and this endeavor demands integration and alignment of defense systems and industries in ways never seen before. There is no place more promising to start than by revamping the U.S.-Australia alliance to ensure that it can both align national strategic visions and also produce the vital defense equipment needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;history-of-the-strategic-partnership&quot;&gt;History of the Strategic Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 U.S.-Australia Joint Leaders’ Statement presented an alliance at historic heights—aligned in global outlook and committed to partnering to address the most pressing threats of the twenty-first century. This statement was not a sudden anomaly of foreign policy; the U.S.-Australia relationship has over a century of cooperation upon which a deep-seated foundation of trust has been built. The two countries celebrated the 80th anniversary of diplomatic ties in 2020, but defense relations go back even further, with the United States and Australia having fought side by side in every conflict since World War I. The alliance has defined the relationship almost as long, with 2021 marking the 70th anniversary of the ANZUS treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more recent times, Australia’s participation in the Gulf War (1990–1991), Iraq War (2003–2011), and War in Afghanistan (2001–2021) has endured and loomed in the minds of politicians and the public alike. During the Gulf War, Australia committed over 1,800 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel, three frigates, a destroyer, and two supply ships as part of a wider international coalition under directive of the United Nations. In 2003, Australia contributed a significant military force for the initial invasion of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia was one of the first nations to join the coalition force for Afghanistan, consisting of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, with forces numbering 1,550 ADF personnel. Prime Minister John Howard invoked Article IV of the ANZUS Treaty in support of Australia’s involvement—the only time the treaty has been invoked. The Australian parliament supported the commitment on September 17, 2001, and Canberra committed forces to Afghanistan in October 2001 after the 9/11 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting side by side over decades has forged increasingly strong defense and security ties, as exemplified by the establishment of the annual U.S. Marine Rotational Forces to Darwin (MRF-D), increased U.S. Air Force deployments to Australia, and the U.S.-Australia Force Posture Agreement in 2015. The Joint Statement on Defense Cooperation, signed in October 2015, was put in place to further bolster security collaboration, with an eye to a changing strategic environment. And, of course, the 2021 signing of AUKUS demonstrated an unprecedented leap for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolution-of-us-australia-alignment&quot;&gt;Evolution of U.S.-Australia Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhanced security ties such as MRF-D evolved out of the United States’ initial “pivot” toward Asia, which began in 2011. This pivot was a result of a growing realization within the U.S. government that Asia—subsequently broadened in linguistic and geographic scope to the Indo-Pacific—would be the center of gravity for economic and geopolitical developments over the next several decades. Concurrent with this realization was the understanding of the threat China posed to not just the international rules-based order, but the United States’ position as a global and regional leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that no single country can alone meet the global challenge posed by China. As stated in the most recent U.S. National Security Strategy, “shared challenges that impact people everywhere demand increased global cooperation and nations stepping up to their responsibilities at a moment when this has become more difficult.” The role of allies and partners has taken center stage in U.S. national security thinking, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the Indo-Pacific, where “a free and open Indo-Pacific can only be achieved if we build collective capacity for a new age; common action is now a strategic necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past decade has also seen a dramatic shift in Australia’s perception of China as a growing threat, and with this shift has come a converging alignment of U.S. and Australian outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s 2016 Defence White Paper recognized that the country’s “strategic planning is not limited to defending [Australia’s] borders,” and that part of Australia’s strategic defense interest was “in a stable Indo-Pacific region and rules-based global order which supports our interests.” However, the report avoids direct reference to China’s role in challenging this rules-based order, instead noting that Australia’s strategic environment faced “uncertainty” due to the evolving U.S.-China relationship. It states that a key “driver” of (not threat to) the strategic environment is the competition between the United States and China but does not single out China’s actions in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2016 white paper was the product of an Australia that in many ways framed itself as a passive recipient of its proximate strategic environment. It aimed to protect the homeland and its immediate interests through maintaining relationships and procuring appropriate defense equipment. The white paper deemed the alliance with the United States of primary importance for Australia, but mainly from the perspective of the United States as the global power through which the rules-based order could best be maintained. In fact, the paper even referenced a continuing defense relationship with China: “The Government will seek to deepen and broaden our important defence relationship with China while recognising that our strategic interests may differ in relation to some regional and global security issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s 2020 Defence Strategic Update represented a marked shift in the framing of the country’s role in the region as one that had both agency and responsibility to proactively shape the regional environment. The update presented three new strategic objectives: to shape Australia’s strategic environment, to deter actions against Australia’s interests, and to respond with credible military force when required. It noted that the “drivers of change” from the 2016 review had “accelerated faster than anticipated,” requiring a relook at defense priorities. The update stated bluntly that the reason it was written was that “the Government has directed Defence to implement a new strategic policy framework that signals Australia’s ability—and willingness—to project military power and deter actions against us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This update pointed to “grey-zone activities” and coercive behavior to alter the rules-based order (although not directly attributed to China) as primary threats to Australia’s security, rather than just two of many challenges. It continued to hold up the U.S.-Australia alliance as central to Australian strategic planning, but here Australia’s role was framed as one of a capable partner that must work alongside the United States to “build defence cooperation in the region to meet security challenges,” and “should be most capable of military cooperation with the United States” in the immediate Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR) further underscored an evolving strategic perspective in Canberra, laying out the argument that Chinese actions in the South China Sea and Australia’s “near neighborhood” directly threatened Australian security and national interests, and further stating that Australia has the responsibility to directly contribute to the collective security of the region and the maintenance of the international rules-based order. The review recommended a shift in focus from a “defence of Australia” doctrine, which it stated was “no longer fit for purpose,” to one of “National Defence.” Accomplishing this, according to the DSR, would require a whole-of-nation and whole-of-government approach that recognizes the integral role Australia must play in the region. This sentiment is echoed in the 2024 National Defence Strategy (NDS), which emphasizes that “Australia [has] a vital role and interest in maintaining a region where state sovereignty is protected, international law is followed, and all nations can make decisions free from coercion.” The NDS reinforces the centrality of the U.S.-Australia alliance to Australia’s national security and specifically calls out AUKUS for its role within the larger architecture of critical security arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-goal-of-a-stronger-us-australia-defense-industrial-cooperative-ecosystem&quot;&gt;The Goal of a Stronger U.S.-Australia Defense Industrial Cooperative Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bold initiatives require actualization. Maximizing the potential of the U.S.-Australia alliance requires alignment among relevant policymakers, political leadership, and industry. The 2023 DSR astutely recognized that the “current approach to capability acquisition is not fit for purpose.” The entirety of the review sets out commitments that knit together a system more willing and able than ever before to support greater defense industry integration with the United States and other partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving defense integration presents several difficult challenges, including facilitating critical technology transfers, allowing for sharing of classified and sensitive information, and providing opportunities for defense firms to enter each other’s markets. There have been previous efforts to facilitate greater defense industry collaboration and lower the barriers to such collaboration, but these efforts have largely stalled due to the complexity of the task overshadowing the possibility of success. The drivers of action, however, have now changed. The strategic imperative of the day and direction from the highest levels of the U.S. and Australian governments demand renewed effort toward the goal of a truly cooperative ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there is already a strong history of alignment upon which to build. Australia’s close strategic relationship with the United States has translated into support in the U.S. Congress and from the president for closer industrial relationships. This was shown in 2017 with the expansion of the U.S. National Technological and Industrial Base (NTIB) to include Australia and the United Kingdom. That unilateral legislative act extended many of the benefits enjoyed in the close U.S.-Canada partnership to two more of the United States’ closest allies (but crucially a partial ITAR exemption like that enjoyed by Canada would only come years later). In theory, NTIB membership means that, for many purposes, U.S. purchases from Australia and the United Kingdom count as domestic. In practice, however, this status often falls short. For example, U.S. acquisition officials and those in industry will often apply “No Foreign” restrictions or other limitations that undercut the meaning of this designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three countries hold a bilateral Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreement (RDP-A) with the United States, which means that “Buy American” provisions do not apply to U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) purchases from those nations. Along with New Zealand, these countries also enjoy a close intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States through the Five Eyes arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrangement that has received the most attention recently is the AUKUS partnership, announced in 2021. AUKUS, including its two pillars, is designed to counter twenty-first-century threats through enhanced technology partnerships. Pillar I is designed to enhance Australia’s military capability with a new fleet of conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines. The Pillar II technology partnership focuses on new technologies, including artificial intelligence and autonomy; quantum technologies; hypersonic, undersea, and advanced cyber capabilities; electronic warfare; and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout its modern history, Australia has primarily been an arms importer, albeit one whose largest projects tend to have an aspect of local production. The United States has been its largest supplier, as seen in Figure 2.1, with the United Kingdom being the second-largest supplier since the 1950s, though that flow has weakened in the post–Cold War period. Australia’s largest purchases from the United States have been in the aviation sector, including fighter aircraft—the F-35A and F-18A—as well as the E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and the P-8A maritime patrol aircraft. Australia has exported to the United States, most prominently the expeditionary fast transport (EPF), which had a major role for Australian domestic production. The United Kingdom and France have provided aircraft to Australia as well, predominantly the Hawk-100 trainer and the A-330 MRTT tanker and transport, respectively. Spain’s and Germany’s biggest transfers have been ships, Hobart destroyers and MEKO-200ANZ frigates, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral cooperation between Australia and the United States has been strong and enduring. It has also been influenced by the relative size of the two nations’ economies and defense budgets. The United States has built up a world-leading industrial base, supported both by national acquisition programs and strong exports to allies and partners. U.S. firms have set up subsidiaries in many allied nations, selling advanced technologies to those governments. Thus, the present push toward greater Australian cooperation with the United States builds on an Australian defense industrial base that is already highly internationalized, with local representation from the United States and other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ge6U1WI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been ownership turnover of several Australian firms in recent decades. Government-owned prime Australian Defense Industries (ADI) was first sold to a mix of international owners in 1999. In 2006, ADI, the largest Australian defense firm, was granted permission to become a fully owned subsidiary of Thales. In that same year, the third-, fourth-, and fifth-largest Australian firms were BAE Systems Australia, Raytheon Australia, and Boeing Australia, respectively, all of which are international subsidiaries. The second-largest Australian prime in 2006, Tenix Defence, similarly became a subsidiary of BAE Systems in January 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade data is a useful supplement to the major weapon systems tracked by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) because trade data can capture the back-and-forth flow of components as well as completed systems. The bilateral trade data for Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as seen in Figure 2.2, reveals that the underlying U.S.-Australia trade relationship remains rather one sided and lacks the full extent of industrial integration that exists with the other large U.S. NTIB partners. Geography is one factor here, as the United States and Canada share a major land border and have been integrating their defense industrial bases for decades, including the United States’ first partial exemption to arms control regulations. The Australia-to-U.S. export relationship has been growing, and for the reasons discussed above, trade flows in both directions are likely to further deepen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the size of the U.S. defense enterprise, prime contracts by the DOD provide another illuminating angle on U.S.-Australia cooperation, with U.S. relationships with Canada and the United Kingdom adding further context. Figures 2.3, 5.4, and 5.5 have an NTIB-4 or Australia-specific aspect, indicating an international (non-U.S.) origin, international vendor headquarters or nationality, or place of performance outside of the United States. In a striking contrast to Figure 2.2, the magnitude of acquisition is roughly comparable in this time period to that between Canada and Australia. When looking at the structure of prime contractors, Australia resembles the United Kingdom, with the bulk of its market share being taken by U.S. subsidiaries of international firms; in Australia’s case, this is largely due to work by the U.S. subsidiary of Australian shipbuilder Austal on the aforementioned EPF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with formal treaties and the variety of strategic frameworks supporting a strong relationship between Australia and the United States, both nations have recently published strategies focusing on strengthening their defense industrial bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, the U.S. Office of Industrial Base Policy within the DOD’s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment put forth a National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS) designed to “catalyze generational change from the existing defense industrial base to a more robust, resilient, and dynamic modernized defense industrial ecosystem.” The strategy has four strategic priorities: resilient supply chains, workforce readiness, flexible acquisition, and economic deterrence. Economic deterrence specifically recognizes the role of working with allies and partners to strengthen capabilities and deter adversaries. The strategy’s June 2024 implementation report highlighted that Australia has been designated as a domestic source for U.S. Defense Production Act funds in the FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD also published a new Regional Sustainment Framework in 2024 that recognizes the important role of partner nations in conducting maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) on U.S. systems, especially if there is a conflict. Australia’s location in the Pacific will help reduce the transportation of systems from the Pacific area of responsibility (AOR) that need repair, especially useful given concerns about increasingly contested logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Australia released a Defence Industry Development Strategy (DIDS) that also highlights international industrial partnerships, described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Close industrial collaboration with trusted international partners [that] will help build the strategic weight Australia needs to shape the future, making the nation less vulnerable to coercion and helping to deter conflict by increasing the cost of aggression against Australia and its interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Co-design, co-development, co-production and co-sustainment of capability will make effective use of combined resources, strengthening collective defence industrial capacity, enhancing interoperability, and accelerating technology development. The goal is to build capable, resilient, competitive, and secure supply chains that include Australian businesses, and create economies of scale for the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alignment in strategies offers a promising foundation for further defense industrial cooperation as part of a larger framework. The next chapter offers a more detailed discussion of defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defense-cooperation-and-defense-industrial-cooperation&quot;&gt;Defense Cooperation and Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;understanding-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;Understanding Defense Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of public statements and formal policies affirm the strength and endurance of the defense relationship between Australia and the United States. This relationship fits into a broader frame of U.S. defense cooperation, which the DOD defines as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a generic term for the range of activity undertaken by DoD with its allies and other friendly nations to promote international security. Such activity includes, but need not be confined to, security assistance, industrial cooperation, armaments cooperation, Foreign Military Sales (FMS), training, logistics cooperation, cooperative research and development (R&amp;amp;D), Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT), and Host-Nation Support (HNS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One highlighted approach is industrial cooperation, which can take a variety of forms. McGinn’s 2023 study highlights five pathways for a “Build Allied” approach to defense industrial cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an increase in the number of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign defense companies,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;co-development of systems or subsystems across two or more countries,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;co-production of defense systems across two or more countries,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;second-sourcing or licensed production to qualify multiple producers for the same part or system, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;foreign sustainment (maintenance, repair, or overhaul) of existing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy statements highlight the role of government, the specific pathways above require the participation of industry at the tactical level to execute the strategic vision. (Specific catalysts and barriers to industrial participation are the subject of this research and are covered in more detail later in the report.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature highlights numerous benefits that drive governments and industry to pursue defense industrial cooperation. Big picture benefits include strengthened ties between nations and national militaries through the enhanced interoperability and interchangeability that common systems may yield. From an economic perspective, defense industrial cooperation brings a range of advantages that mirror benefits of non-defense trade. Supply chains that cross national lines mean that complex modern systems can access a wider range of ideas, technologies, parts, and raw materials. Technological alliances between private firms, which provide access to information from partners, bolster these firms’ performance in innovating within high-tech industries such as aerospace and defense. Systems can be produced with greater economies of scale, moving down learning curves to lower unit prices and reducing fixed costs such as research and development (R&amp;amp;D), facilities, and advanced machinery as a proportion of production costs. Scholars have long noted that firms, and indeed nations, can specialize and take advantage of comparative advantage. Even if the United States were the leading allied producer across all categories of systems, allied capacity would be increased at the margins by firms and countries focusing on their relative strengths rather than seeking to do it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific economics of the defense sector also make international defense cooperation attractive to governments interested in lowering costs, fostering innovation, and building production capacity. The barriers to entry into the secretive and complicated sector of weapon system production are high, making competition—which can lower unit costs to the government and foster innovation—difficult to foster. This is particularly true if a nation’s addressable defense market is small. Integration across national lines brings the possibility of new competition, often provided by domestic subsidiaries of international firms or through joint international ventures. Integration may also help solve challenges in the industrial base (e.g., labor shortages) if nations are able to engage those capacities in other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the benefits of industrial cooperation, which are based on well-established and demonstrated economic principles, there are a variety of concerns. The cooperative production or transfer of weapons brings with it humanitarian, destabilization, and other foreign policy concerns. Nations cooperating on defense manufacturing can be reluctant to embrace production specialization, as it can cause the loss of a full range of domestic military supply. That loss of supply brings sovereignty concerns and may make it harder to address the needs of individual militaries because partner nations may have imperfectly shared national military objectives. Insufficient controls on the spread of technical information by partner government or industry actors can diminish a nation’s advantage in military technologies. Finally, even when fighting wars together, nations may be tempted to put their own military requirements at the front of the line ahead of equipment ordered by allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the politics of justifying military or civil acquisition spending often intersects with job benefits in the producing countries. Cooperation may raise concerns about exporting jobs, which will affect the calculus of elected leaders. Research shows that it is possible for the economic benefits of cooperation to overcome political opposition and even generate new vested business interests and defense communities of trust to accelerate further cooperation. However, that requires a long-term political and strategic view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major challenge to defense industrial cooperation is managing the inherent complexity of working across multiple industrial and acquisition systems. Research has highlighted management complexity as a compounding program risk factor on top of technical complexity—the difficulty of producing systems due to their technological needs—given that the scale and expense of major weapons systems frequently exceeds the capacity of individual firms and nation-states. One response to both management and technical complexity is adopting a minimalist approach to international cooperation which avoids cooperation on large or critical systems, favors co-production or modification over co-development of systems, and prioritizes maintenance and sustainment cooperation above R&amp;amp;D and procurement cooperation. These challenges—humanitarian concerns, proliferation, trust, politics, and management and technical complexity—are all long recognized and addressed by a mix of laws, regulations, and policy approaches, but these approaches in turn can become barriers to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;categorizing-catalysts-for-and-barriers-to-defense-industrial-cooperation&quot;&gt;Categorizing Catalysts for and Barriers to Defense Industrial Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation across national borders requires catalysts—reasons for action—as well as deliberate efforts to overcome barriers. The challenges described above tend to be more abstract than the experiences of government and industry personnel who are working to make cooperation happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach to specify barriers is offered by Jennifer D. P. Moroney et al. in a 2023 report on U.S. security cooperation, which provides a typology of barriers that impede U.S. security cooperation with highly capable allies and partners in the air, space, and cyber domains. The authors examine defense industrial cooperation as part of the broader framework and note that it is subject to numerous barriers. The author’s research and framework focus on security cooperation, which is led by government actors. Adding information derived from CSIS interviews with industry conducted as part of this research, this report expands the framework to include a broader range of issues which government policies may help resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3.1 includes an overview of barriers and is an extension of the framework offered in the work of Moroney et al. The figure includes the addition of the economic barriers experienced by industry, as derived from the literature and informed by this project’s interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS expanded Moroney’s framework by including an “economic” barrier category with three representative examples. The first is an insufficient business case to incentivize industry to conduct international cooperation activities. The second identifies the costs—both financial and the opportunity cost of personnel time—associated with learning a new acquisition system in the partner country or the cost of acquiring or establishing a subsidiary company and offices in the partner nation. The third is the potential misalignment of corporate strategies between defense firms which prioritize different end markets and products, thereby hampering their ability to effectively cooperate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pathways-for-us-australia-defense-industrial-connections&quot;&gt;Pathways for U.S.-Australia Defense Industrial Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial cooperation requires the support of governments to set the vision, define the policies, and provide the funding. Most defense industrial cooperation requires the participation of industry, which employs the wide range of skills required to develop and produce systems, run the factories, and manage the supply chains. Industrial organizations may appreciate that defense cooperation supports the foundation of a peaceful and stable society, but they are also profit-seeking organizations looking for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying recommendations to overcome barriers to industrial cooperation must start with an overview of how that cooperation happens. Interviews with Australian and U.S. government officials and industry leaders revealed a complex system of integration across the two nations’ defense ecosystems. These included industry in one nation selling systems to the other government, a company supplying components to government or industry, or firms developing programs and technologies together in various forms of partnership. This web of corporate relationships is further complicated by the fact that industries may establish subsidiaries within the partner nation and that companies may sell to the partner government via both their main business units and their partner-nation subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry-to-government relationships can include Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) from U.S.-based primes to the Australian government. Sales from Australian firms to the DOD employ a variety of pathways, from direct contracts, routing contracts through their U.S.-based subsidiaries, selling subsystems or components to U.S. primes, or even selling to the Australian subsidiaries of U.S. primes for later resale. Government-to-government relations add another layer, revolving around Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreements and co-development and co-production efforts. Table 3.2 summarizes these from a market (buyer/seller) construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z1L4v4f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3.2: Types of Industrial Connection.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms reported four primary pathways to sell to the DOD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contracts via a U.S. subsidiary that they have established&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Direct contracts from their Australian entity&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selling systems or components to a U.S. prime that then resells or passes them through to the DOD&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Selling systems or components to the Australian subsidiaries of global defense primes, which then sell products with Australian content to the DOD&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding complexity to these four main pathways are two further interlinkages between them: U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms could sell products to U.S. primes that then were resold to the U.S. government, or Australian products sold to U.S. primes could be transferred to that prime’s Australian entity for integration into a system before being sold to the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, there are several pathways of connection whereby U.S. firms interface with the Australian Department of Defence (ADOD):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. arms sold to Australia, with the U.S. government facilitating via the FMS process&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. prime contractors selling systems to Australia via DCS&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian subsidiaries of U.S. defense primes selling products to the ADOD&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;some developed independently in Australia with Australian suppliers&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;some all or partially based on content from the United States&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Australian firms selling systems to the ADOD that include U.S. content in the supply chain or place of performance content from their U.S. subsidiaries&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-development and co-production efforts are additional, government-enabled frameworks for cooperation which can occur between firms with varying degrees of government intermediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the two lists are not the same, which can be explained in large part by the fact that the DOD has a significantly larger budget than the ADOD, which has led to a larger and more capable U.S. defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the pathways is a critical step toward enhanced and increased cooperation. The next step is identifying and assessing the existing barriers. CSIS interviews with Australian firms and DOD officials indicated that direct sales to partner governments are difficult due to complexities in information sharing and U.S. acquisition processes. Interviewees revealed that easier pathways to defense industry cooperation were via their own U.S. subsidiaries, U.S. defense primes, or the Australian subsidiaries of U.S. defense primes, even if these routes were less direct. In Figure 3.1, the pathways of cooperation are portrayed to clarify the various interactions in the cross-Pacific defense industry ecosystem. Chapter 4 will discuss barriers encountered on each pathway, and Chapter 5 includes a version of Figure 3.1: Pathways to Connection with the lines colored by reported difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barriers to Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy benefits of defense industrial cooperation between Australia and the United States are well understood and have led to the many cooperation agreements, mentioned in previous chapters. Despite those agreements, however, the interviews conducted for this project revealed numerous tactical-level barriers to cooperation, with roots both in the government and within industry itself. This chapter summarizes this project’s research on those challenges, with a deliberate focus on the industry experience of business enterprises that work in Australia and the United States. This chapter is organized using the framework discussed in Chapter 3 and captures data from the interviews in each of the framework categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the data analysis, it became clear that the categories are not independent. Regulatory barriers on export controls create cultural barriers of risk avoidance. The budgetary challenges of limited government funding diminish the business case for investing in cooperation. Many of these challenges could be placed in more than one category and, therefore, will be highlighted where they are particularly pertinent. This supports the finding that the challenge of cooperation is a broader ecosystem issue, one that requires simultaneous changes across multiple levels instead of narrow policies focused on one challenge. This chapter will lay out the tactical challenges presented by individual barriers to cooperation, and Chapter 5 will discuss an ecosystem approach to these barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budgetary-getting-the-money-from-budgets-to-contracts&quot;&gt;Budgetary: Getting the Money, from Budgets to Contracts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business organizations must continually consider their financial picture, and interviewees frequently mentioned budget concerns when working with both the United States and Australia. These concerns related both to budgets on the national level (making this a political issue as well) along with the timely and long-term funding of projects (overlapping with bureaucratic acquisition concerns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Australia, businesses’ budgetary concerns centered on how government funding levels impacted the extent of what the government of Australia was able to invest in. For example, one U.S. company speculated that a large project was terminated because the Australian government wanted to put those resources toward AUKUS Pillar I nuclear-powered submarines instead. Another issue raised was a lack of consistent funding across governments, without which industry is less able to access the resources necessary to invest in production to scale and sustain production over time. One interviewee summarized this as “lots of promises are being made and not a lot of money is flowing.” This impacts both Australian and U.S. companies working to do business in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the U.S. government does not face the same overall funding issues. Funding stability is mostly ensured once new requirements become programs of record, with the caveat that frequent continual resolutions limit new program starts. However, the delays caused by the budget process are seen as a barrier by both Australian and U.S. industry when doing business with the U.S. government, indicating that some of the challenges identified by industry when considering international cooperation projects are in fact generic challenges endemic to working in the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be difficult for companies to get longer-term, multiyear funding. More complex projects benefit from firm commitments for funding across multiple years. Companies may be eager to work together across national lines, but as the U.S. subsidiary of an Australian firm noted, “both governments struggle to give long-term contracts” which would enable this cooperation. Ramping up a supply chain and the workforce requires a multiyear commitment to be economically worthwhile, but those longer-term commitments are difficult to extract and run into political barriers within both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are solutions to all these issues, but they are challenging to enact. The Australia budget challenge could be addressed by the government consistently funding defense over time, but this is a policy that will depend on national government decisions. Another approach for the Australian government is to deliberately help Australian industry strengthen its export market to ensure a more consistent customer base over time. In fact, this is the approach being taken in the Guided Weapons Explosive Ammunition (GWEO) enterprise, which is focused on munitions production. An export-focused approach could build upon Australia’s 2018 Defence Export Strategy, which advocated for Australia to become a top 10 defense exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge links budgeting and contracting processes. For small businesses, delays in finalizing a contract, which can relate to the government’s availability of funds, can mean that they do not have the resources to pay their employees and, moreover, will otherwise interfere with the longer-term viability of the enterprise itself. Small enterprises frequently noted that “the government does not understand cash flow.” Payment delays are disruptive to any business, but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may be particularly vulnerable. Furthermore, Australian firms often complain that banks and venture capital groups in Australia lack sufficient capital supply because of reliance on foreign sources, exacerbating critical balance-of-payment issues for Australian SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one DOD interviewee suggested that the United States has more funding streams available than Australia does to bring projects from early-stage science and technology into more advanced stages of development, using vehicles such as the Defense Innovation Unit or the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The individual recommended creating a dedicated pot of funds in Australia for investing in these early-stage efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other discussions raised the specifics of getting paid. One Australian company highlighted that a U.S. defense innovation organization’s default payment method was via check, and that it cost more to get them to wire funds. Another complained that the aforementioned organization did not know what a SWIFT key was, delaying payment by eight months. This was reported to create months-long delays before the DOD could find the correct form to process the payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of industry being able to access stable funding with enough certainty to grow production to scale and scope is by no means unique to the international cooperation context, and it represents a challenge for business enterprises doing business for their own national governments as well as for those of partner nations. While strengthening relations with partner nations via defense industrial ties is not the main goal of any nation’s budget process, the negative impacts on partners of budget perturbations are real and should be a consideration in deciding if industrial cooperation with allies is a true priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-navigating-complex-acquisition-systems&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic: Navigating Complex Acquisition Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. defense acquisition system can be difficult to navigate, even for U.S. firms. This difficulty is magnified for small Australian firms and amplified by the lack of personal connections with decisionmakers, societal and cultural differences, and the tyranny of distance and tight travel budgets. Australian firms report finding it hard to understand who U.S. decisionmakers are and how to connect with them, a challenge also shared by small U.S. businesses. Interviews with Australian industry often noted that “if Australian companies don’t understand the U.S. procurement system, they can’t sell.” Many of these Australian firms added that hiring U.S. advisers as guides to understanding the system is expensive, which serves as a deterrent for trying to make the jump into the U.S. defense ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. government organizations need a contract vehicle as a pathway to get funds to performers. Many Australian SMEs reported that U.S. contracting vehicles are difficult for them to use, requiring them to go through larger U.S. companies as resellers, which reduces the SMEs’ profit margins and, therefore, their incentive to cooperate across the Pacific. The issue of the reseller dynamic arose several times as a complicating factor in Australian firms closing deals. An Australian firm going through a U.S.-based reseller is going to have longer lead times for contracts and may miss out on business opportunities due to speed (or lack thereof ) rather than capability—an issue complicated and magnified by the already long lead times for export control licenses and security clearance processes. Another complicating factor is the U.S. acquisition workforce’s unfamiliarity with acquisition processes for foreign firms, which leads some DOD acquisition staff to encourage Australian firms to work with resellers. This well-meaning advice may be given without fully considering the impact it could have on the speed of the Australian firm’s subsequent contract and therefore the firm’s business case for working with the DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia does have a dedicated agency called Austrade whose mission includes helping Australian exporting companies grow their business. Austrade has representatives stationed in the United States, and according to this project’s interviewees, the agency has provided useful guidance in navigating U.S. processes and providing information about tenders. One company noted that “We would not have been able to do what we did without Austrade.” Another offered, “Austrade has been incredibly helpful—[they help companies] plug into shows and be part of delegations and make it easier to go to [conferences] like SeaAirSpace.” On the other hand, other companies noted that Austrade has provided briefings on a less detailed (and therefore less useful) level and has not helped them navigate the U.S. market, largely due to Austrade lacking the necessary contacts with customers. Smaller businesses interested in exporting did not always know how to access Austrade’s tools. Policymakers should consider providing additional support for the agency so that it could more effectively reach out to new defense companies interested in exporting. A throughline in Australian interviews was the necessity of education both for industry and the government in terms of the opportunities for partnership and the specific bureaucratic challenges that need to be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultural-two-nations-divided-by-a-common-language-and-an-ocean&quot;&gt;Cultural: Two Nations Divided by a Common Language and an Ocean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural barriers were among the most common types of impediments mentioned by the interviewees and spanned across most of the pathways of connection in the defense industrial relationship. One challenge centers on the differences between corporate culture in Australia and the United States regarding considerations like self-promotion and seeking legal advice from counsel. According to both Australian and U.S. interviewees, Australian firms tend to be much less self-promoting when discussing their products with U.S. officials or businesspeople than Americans are used to, leading to occasional moments of mismatched expectations and underappreciated offerings from Australia. One interviewee noted that “Australians are not pushy. . . . They don’t puff themselves up.” Furthermore, Australian firms are much less likely than their U.S. counterparts to seek legal recourse or the advice of counsel when encountering regulatory difficulties in U.S. acquisition efforts or business-to-business (B2B) engagements, such as with export controls restrictions. This can hamper the ability of Australian firms to get contracts compared to U.S. entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Cultural differences get overlooked between the U.S. and Australia. . . . We like to believe that they are very similar, but the cultures are very dissimilar. The similarities outweigh the dissimilarities, but they are very different cultures.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-firm&quot;&gt;— U.S. firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another cultural barrier identified by interviewees relates to bureaucratic and regulatory issues. Both nations prefer local suppliers, which affects the relationship on both sides of the Pacific and limits cooperation. Even as the countries align closer on defense cooperation, and senior officials make statements and policies about the essential nature of AUKUS and U.S.-Australia cooperation, interviewees noted persistent parochial favoritism from mid-level officials in acquisition and business decisionmaking processes. This was pervasive in the United States, including with the DOD acquisition workforce and when partnering with U.S. companies. One Australian company noted, “Americans like things made in America, a culture which flows through to procurement people from corporate leadership.” Government and industry preference for local suppliers is a known factor across global procurement, with the literature highlighting an even greater local preference by government than industry actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk aversion is a persistent cultural challenge across the defense cooperation space, one often linked to other barriers, including regulatory ones. Australian interviewees noted that U.S. government officials are hesitant to green-light cooperation with Australia, even if they have the authority to do so. Working-level officials are perceived as adhering to the status quo, even as senior leaders advance new visions of cooperation. This is mirrored in industry, where companies are sometimes overly cautious despite encouragement from government officials with regulatory authority. This occurs even when considering sharing information already publicly available on corporate websites. One Australian company offered an example where a U.S. government agency approved the use of their products, but then lawyers at the prime contractor directed an additional review out of an excess of caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee highlighted risk aversion as a serious problem when thinking about the competitive global landscape, which links cultural factors to political ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If China is our pacing threat, [we should] find things we can go jointly after. Not in the 50 people in a room, hierarchical setup, 18 months to deliver first article, another 18 for testing. Time is our enemy; we’re squandering opportunity. Only so long we can say PRC won’t catch up with us; they have smart people too. Creativity and adaptability only go so far. $50 million and fail on the prototype, that’s acceptable. Accept some amount of failure. There’s chatter on working an innovative way, but hard if afraid of failure/losing job. [Requires] more of a culture shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increased recognition of the strategic challenge may help the U.S. government embrace a global supply chain. Policies like the National Defense Industrial Strategy highlight the importance of allies and partners as part of an economic deterrence strategy. Consistent messaging across administrations in both nations (which demands strong leadership support) is required to evolve government and industry cultures over time—though this alone may not be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-moving-from-policy-announcements-to-tactical-support&quot;&gt;Political: Moving from Policy Announcements to Tactical Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry in both nations observed that even with the necessary political support, translating policymaker intent into action has proven difficult. One interviewee observed that all politicians “love announceables” but that moving from the policy level into tactical execution was more of a problem. In spite of pronouncements, there was some cynicism as to whether national governments were truly behind cooperation. In general, businesses did not always see the next steps necessary to move the vision into action even though they thought the governments believed what they were saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One U.S. prime interviewee argued that the most likely business successes came from U.S. companies selling systems to Australia but getting beyond that was difficult, observing that the goals of highly publicized agreements like “AUKUS . . . [don’t] trickle down to the small companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The ambiguity around how these high-level strategic agreements translate into business opportunities is harmful to the Australian business community because they are making assumptions on how to export and if they lose money they may exit the business.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-australian-firm&quot;&gt;— Australian firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Australian interviewees expressed frustration with inconsistent signals from the United States, where government policies seemed to support cooperation but failed to result in business opportunities for Australian companies. One employee stated that “If the U.S. is just saying no to Australian products, that’s fine. . . . The problem is unclear messaging. [When] he talks to other defense companies . . . they all don’t have clarity.” The offered solution was that the ADOD “needs to be more direct about the need for the United States to understand and support Australia business,” which would depend on the DOD listening to and valuing this message from the ADOD over its other priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are government efforts in support of industrial cooperation, such as Australia’s investment in the Global Supply Chain (GSC) Program and Austrade (covered above). The GSC Program is an export initiative aiming to give Australian companies better opportunities to enter the supply chains of global defense primes by providing funding to “establish a team within their company dedicated to identifying export opportunities leading to contract award for Australian suppliers in both Civil and Defence businesses of the Prime.” Not every interviewee at the U.S. primes mentioned the GSC Program, but at least one found it to be a very useful support for bringing Australian firms into their supply chain. That said, in the interviews, many Australian SMEs expressed distrust of the commitment of the major U.S. primes—or their Australian subsidiaries—to incorporating Australian companies into their supply chains. The SMEs were concerned that U.S. primes use Australian SMEs as “window dressing” for their Australian government bids to comply with local preference regulations, only to squeeze the Australian SMEs out of these contracts later. One colorful Australian interviewee, describing the defense system in Australia, said that the “organ grinder is the [U.S.] primes, and the monkey varies between the government and the Australian industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One U.S.-based Australian interviewee was a former employee at a U.S. prime contractor and had also spent time working in the U.S. government. They suggested that that while the United States says it wants cooperation, what it really wants is “U.S. companies to split off units and do business for Australia. We are much less interested in building up native Australia companies—don’t want them to be too competitive.” Nevertheless, other U.S. defense prime figures repeatedly stressed their commitment to the GSC Program and noted the successes they had seen under it. U.S. industry individuals did note that the GSC Program was more effective when the Australian government had previously provided funding for Australian SMEs to qualify as subcontractors under the program, an initiative that could be revitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulatory-policy-underpins-many-cooperation-challenges&quot;&gt;Regulatory: Policy Underpins Many Cooperation Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government regulatory policy, including national export control regimes, shapes and limits defense industrial cooperation. Export controls have multiple goals, including limiting the export of sensitive military technologies that could find their way into the hands of adversaries. The challenge that export controls create is extensively highlighted in the literature on cooperation, but changes are being instituted to support AUKUS. In the U.S. system, there are at least 37 departments, agencies, and commissions with export control authority, including the Departments of State, Commerce, and the Treasury. The State Department handles International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) compliance and the U.S. Munitions List for traditional military capabilities, and the Commerce Department enforces the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the Commerce Control List for dual-use technology. The Defence Export Controls (DEC), part of ADOD, oversees military and dual-use export controls through the Defence Trade Controls Act 2012, Defence Trade Controls Regulations 2013, and the Defence and Strategic Goods List. In March 2024, Australia changed legislation to place controls on the re-export of articles originally from Australia, information sharing on controlled technology areas to certain foreign persons in Australia, and various defense services, which went into effect on September 1, 2024. Following changes approved to Australian export controls, the U.S. State Department amended ITAR to provide licensing exemptions for Australia in technology areas not included on the Excluded Technology List, which also went into effect on September 1, 2024. The U.S. Commerce Department implemented EAR changes as well, proposed and in effect by April 2024, enabling Australia to be treated in the same manner as Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department’s goal for export controls is to “mitigate diversion and proliferation risks, which both bolsters U.S. national security and contributes to regional and international security and stability.” Interviewees universally understood and supported the goals for ITAR and other methods of information and export control regulation, but they highlighted that these regulations also create delays and other challenges for industrial cooperation. One U.S. prime specifically noted that the pace of the regulatory review did not match the pace of the acquisition cycle. Australian export controls are simpler, but export controls from each country are not the only regulatory barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Australian companies, fear of U.S. export control penalties can affect their business dealings with the United States. One U.S. company stated that “if they violate ITAR . . . [Australian firms] are worried about getting put out of business by a foreign regulator.” Smaller vendors fear that they will be put out of business if they receive a penalty for violating ITAR. On the other hand, one larger Australian firm noted that the concern is often misplaced: “People think ‘I am at the risk of going to jail,’ but if they follow the process then that’s just not going to happen.” The small scale of many Australian firms amplifies the stifling effects of information security regulations, as their compliance teams and their financial margins for error are much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protracted wait times can also be barriers to business. A U.S. prime interviewee indicated that if they wanted to work with an Australian SME, they could face production delays of up to 90 days while waiting for a license. They noted that “oftentimes those opportunities come and go within 90 days.” There can also be holdups if a firm changes suppliers, and delays can be detrimental to smaller companies. One U.S. firm argued that “Regulation shouldn’t be easier [to navigate] for those with resources.” Australian regulators have their own resource limitations and likely will need additional resources and funding following the enactment of new export controls to successfully implement these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information sharing is another barrier for foreign suppliers interacting with U.S. primes, as foreign suppliers can face hurdles that in-country business dealings will never encounter. From the very start, conversations between a U.S. company and a foreign partner on sensitive topics can require ITAR approval—and the line between the two can be unclear, causing delays while this is determined. If the Department of State issues approvals only for a portion of the conversations needed, that is insufficient for building international cooperation. While some State Department personnel interviewed noted their progress in approving thousands of these approvals, a U.S. industry figure argued that the department needs “to approve millions to cover all the potential conversations—or else to change policy.” The September 1, 2024, ITAR reforms between the United States and Australia may be able to abate this problem once companies become part of the “authorized user list,” although there is still a range of excluded technologies which remain a concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. export and information control apparatus has led participants in the U.S. defense sector to proceed with caution when dealing with foreign actors, even if allies. For the United States, “they’re built to never engage with a foreigner.” While export control reforms have taken place in both Australia and the United States, there will likely be questions over who can operate license-free. Moreover, if businesses expect to need licenses and face delays, they could avoid certain suppliers or partners. Stakeholders need to allow time for industry to understand these changes and feel safe operating under the greater flexibility of a new export control policy. The regulatory barrier posed by export controls is therefore intertwined with the cultural barriers of risk aversion and resistance to change within the U.S. acquisition workforce and compliance departments in U.S. defense primes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“ITAR/export controls focus on a thing or a defense article. Even if all of these are removed [after reforms], we need to accept that it will take time for folks to understand what it means and to execute it. The real barrier, when that’s gone, there will be a hesitation/blockage of the systems. It will be ok if it takes 3 to 6 months. But if it takes years…”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-firm-1&quot;&gt;— U.S. firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another regulatory barrier relates to limitations on sharing information, including classification and controlled unclassified information (CUI). Classification of information is meant to prevent damage to national security by controlling information release. The challenge this presents is not always visible to Australian companies, but their employees with military experience sometimes remarked that it is much easier to share information between the partner militaries than it is to access classified information on the industry side. This creates challenges for partnering on some national security projects and also sometimes limits Australian access to marketing opportunities in cases where tenders are classified. Even though it notionally presents less of a danger to national security, CUI was described as sometimes more difficult to handle than classified information because, while there are carefully established channels for classified information, the way to properly handle CUI is not as clear-cut. Interviewees also raised concerns about NOFORN markings prohibiting access to non-U.S. persons, which creates similar difficulties for access and also lacks a clear-cut and expeditious process for removal. One industry representative suggested that to enhance cooperation “YESFORN is the objective, NOFORN is the barrier.” Interviewees suspected that NOFORN labels are sometimes simply the default habit of an overly cautious acquisition and industrial workforce, rather than reflective of the contents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-the-need-for-a-common-view-of-the-challenge&quot;&gt;Strategic: The Need for a Common View of the Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Australian governments are closely aligned on their strategic outlooks, with both seeing China as the main strategic concern. However, one area where the United States and Australia have been reported not to see eye-to-eye on strategic issues is the ability of Australia to acquire certain U.S. systems. Interviewees noted that Australia often wants to purchase advanced U.S. technology that is still in the early R&amp;amp;D phase using the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) approach. The U.S. government, however, does not like to sell equipment that is still in early-stage R&amp;amp;D because, as one U.S. government official noted, “we don’t sell systems that won’t meet the requirements. . . . This is the problem with FMS, which is transactional, not meant to be flexible and have vision and work with different strategies and designs.” U.S. caution on FMS sales processes has occasionally clashed with Australian eagerness to acquire cutting-edge U.S. tech, a downstream problem from slight misalignments on strategy and timing of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-aligning-engineering-details&quot;&gt;Technical: Aligning Engineering Details&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ongoing challenge to cooperation is the existence of different technical standards and varying technical standards regimes. These differences may be physical incompatibilities, or there may be regulations that impose specific policies depending on the source. Differing standards can impede the ability of companies to work together and limit their ability to sell to partner governments or participate in partner supply chains. This issue was raised in several of the interviews as one of the tactical challenges that the interviewees did not see being addressed in policy statements: “People want to get technology as fast as possible, [but] a company will have to produce a completely different variant for different [customers].” This challenge demonstrates that strategic vision in support of partnership cannot drive industrial cooperation without the identification and solving of specific challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the examples raised during the interviews is the fact that the two nations have different regimes for the non-destructive testing of defense articles. Australia has the National Australian Testing Authority (NATA), but this authority is not recognized by the United States. Meanwhile, the United States has the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (Nadcap), an industry-led cooperative accreditation program for aerospace and defense industries. These two programs have different training of test operators and different standards for test success. Companies can put their articles through the other nation’s test regimes, but this duplication of testing adds time and additional costs. One interviewee argued that standards could be assessed to see if they are close to those of the other nation; if they were, companies could then be permitted to test in only one nation while being certified in both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Standards is a small thing but could be impactful moving forward. Under AUKUS, there are working groups at technology levels, [but they have] not extended into standards . . . those are the big barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-australian-firm-1&quot;&gt;— Australian firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any deviation in standards also means that when technical details or parts need to be changed, even slightly, the part may need to be recertified. This increases the costs of non-recurring engineering, which can then increase the average cost of a part. One company raised the issue of different voltage standards as a source of recertification requirements (standard voltage in the United States is 120 V, Australia’s is 240 V): “We meet a higher standard, but we don’t meet the U.S. standard. Because the standard is slightly different, we have to recertify.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee noted that there is an AUKUS working group to address technical standards, but this challenge is complex and cross-cutting from the defense industrial base to the broader national manufacturing industrial base. To fully tackle this long-term challenge, the interviewee recommended that the working group should have the authority to create an action plan to address different standards, with the goal of continually identifying and addressing differences that create challenges for cooperation and cross-border sales. Other frameworks and organizations have found ways to establish common standards. One interviewee pointed out that NATO has a common standard, demonstrating that a solution across national borders is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one interviewee raised a complication to overcoming this barrier: there may be benefits for incumbents in maintaining different standards, as it limits competition: “The primes developed this and don’t allow outsiders in.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-making-it-worthwhile-to-invest&quot;&gt;Economic: Making It Worthwhile to Invest&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic challenges for industry are intertwined with their access to capital, the scale of their firm, and their corporate aspirations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies mentioned the challenge of finding funding, which plays out differently in the two economies. It is perceived to be easier to raise funds in the United States because of the size and strength of the venture capital community. In Australia, there is “skepticism in their own market,” and the “investment community [is] skeptical about the U.S. market.” Better funding from government could bridge this funding gap. One company argued that we “need to unlock funding . . . quickly to win opportunity—look at process, what Australia does well and what [the] U.S. does well, look at convergence of how we do funding and financing for small business.” In the United States, the DOD’s Office of Strategic Capital has been set up to try to “crowd in” private capital for defense and dual-use technologies, a model that could be adopted in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We haven’t seen a lot of actionable things come to market about workforce problems, and how we will share knowledge and skills across the two continents. . . . The broader population is completely unaware of what all the jobs and job opportunities will be. Joe plumber doesn’t know about this. There is available talent that is disconnected from the demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-australian-firm-2&quot;&gt;— Australian firm&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue highlighted was the challenge of scale, especially when partnering with, selling to, or competing with U.S. firms. Australian companies are often much smaller than their U.S. partners, and a deal that is a matter of survival for an Australian company may be relatively unimportant for their U.S. partner. One Australian firm noted that they “have to partner with U.S. companies and then [work] at the whim of their creative ambitions. [U.S.] companies were making huge gains in passing through the work.” For a small company, the costs of the procurement process can be overwhelming: “How do I compete with a 10-person team at IBM focused on this Request for Proposal (RFP) when I’m three people and a cat.” Industry as a whole faces strong government pressure to manage costs, but the customer can be oblivious to the economic repercussions of delays and other bureaucracy. One U.S. firm noted that “government regulators on both sides don’t seem to be concerned about the economic impacts. They are focused on national security. . . . The Hill underestimates the scale of these transaction costs. Industry doesn’t make the case effectively about the impact of delays.” Small companies feel these burdens acutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Australian SMEs noted that small firms occasionally hold unrealistic expectations about what their role in U.S.-Australian business-to-business cooperation could look like given their size and production capacity. As a recent Australian Strategic Policy Institute report on AUKUS Pillar II cooperation notes, “size matters” in defense cooperation. Medium or large enterprises have greater scale than small ones, which allows them to more easily upscale their production when needed and to navigate complex bureaucratic tasks like export controls or acquisition. An Australian firm noted that being a “perennial smaller company working with larger companies,” their firm faces the “challenge of being treated as a peer or equal. Larger or established companies, [find it hard] to take the reputational risk of partnering with a start up.” Multiple Australian SMEs noted that they had more success working with small U.S. firms than with the primes. One ADOD official similarly commented that companies needed to find firms of similar sizes with which to match up. U.S. firms stated that they believe Australian companies are less willing than U.S. ones to partner up in order to conquer new, non-U.S. markets and are naive about what technology is required to compete globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another barrier is a lack of industry alignment between Australia and the United States regarding the form and focus of possible future industrial collaboration. Indeed, some of the aforementioned Australian SMEs’ lack of trust in U.S. primes and their frustration with the GSC Program may stem from misaligned expectations of what Australian firms and U.S. firms can productively partner on. The GSC Program identified second sourcing and exploiting innovative technology as potential inroads for Australian firms into prime supply chains, with success seeming to have been found more in the latter than the former. Interviewed companies reported that it is very difficult to bring in Australian firms as new second-source suppliers due to non-recurring engineering costs, the difficulties of technology transfer, and a high learning curve leading to a production cost well above target price. In short, Australian firms struggle to compete against entrenched, typically U.S., firms. In DOD contracting, even when second sources of products or systems are identified, there is no guarantee they will be cost competitive, and those which are competitive are often U.S. firms that do not face the same challenges as Australian SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In connection with the cultural barrier of parochialism, more than one Australian company highlighted the necessity of being both aggressive and sensitive to local issues to successfully enter the U.S. market. Simple steps such as registering a website with a “.com” address instead of a “.com.au” address may overcome initial U.S. suspicion about working with foreign suppliers and lead to companies getting past an initial screen. Australian businesspeople will need to travel to the United States and do their own marketing. Another Australian firm stated that “they [Austrade] won’t do business for you—you have to knock on doors, build [your] own pipeline [and sell] into [your] own market. . . . I look for what events are happening and go to as many as possible to meet in person.” Oftentimes, success relies on the personal determination of entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-final-challenge-and-concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;A Final Challenge and Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last barrier, mentioned in almost every interview, is the “tyranny of distance.” Australia and the United States are half a world away from each other. Vastly different time zones mean that connecting on the phone during business hours is a challenge, and the flights take almost a day in both directions and cross the International Date Line. There is no easy solution for this. The fact that industry continues to press to cooperate despite this challenge is a signal of a broad commitment to cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One company offered this bottom line: “It’s hard to break into the U.S. market as an innovative Australian firm (just as it is for an innovative U.S. firm). Partnering with U.S. companies can help. However, it takes time to meet people and understand the market space. The Australian government can invest in this kind of education, bringing people to the U.S., helping them identify partners. It won’t happen all at once.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can encourage these efforts and lessen barriers where possible. Continual problem-solving can occur if the right spaces are available to bring together industry and government to tackle challenges. One interviewee suggested “forums for capturing and progressing innovative ideas” in support of AUKUS with sufficient “industry submissions.” This could be a path forward for quickly fixing barriers as they arise, especially with recent export control changes in each country and a new regulatory operating environment for companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ecosystem-dynamics&quot;&gt;Ecosystem Dynamics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding and resolving the challenges that industry faces when working in partner economies is a necessary step toward enhancing cooperation. As the experiences reported in the last chapter indicate, barriers to cooperation are pervasive and complex. Furthermore, many of the individual challenges have broader implications. Regulatory issues contribute to cultural challenges. Government budget churn can harm companies, and instability can drive companies out of business. This chapter will examine the implications of these specific challenges to the broader ecosystem of defense industrial cooperation, looking for lessons on cooperation, including positive catalysts and cross-cutting barriers. Fixing individual challenges is a critical part of the solution, but experience shows that getting the right stakeholders aligned with the proper incentives across the entire ecosystem is also necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation can start with government-to-government initiatives such as those included in the AUKUS initiatives, referred to here as the “G2G” pathway. Governments can purchase goods from a partner nation’s defense industries, a business-to-government or “B2G” approach. Efforts to foster industrial cooperation should also focus on international business-to-business cooperation between defense companies, or “B2B.” The G2G and B2G relationships are foundational for defense industrial cooperation, but the B2B relationship can lead to a market-driven form of cooperation. Lasting bottom-up cooperation occurs when companies integrate across national lines into each other’s individual ecosystems: becoming part of each other’s supply chains, co-developing products, and competing against each other to sell to the same corporate and government customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After surveying cross-cutting barriers in the ecosystem, this chapter will examine the three types of relationships shaping the ecosystem. It starts by surveying the G2G policy space and incentives. This chapter will then examine some aspects of the U.S. acquisition system relating to international defense procurement, which can be a B2G challenge for Australian firms working to grow their defense businesses in the United States. Lastly, the chapter will examine B2B dynamics between the United States and Australia and identify current and future catalysts to cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;identifying-systemic-challenges-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;Identifying Systemic Challenges and Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barriers highlighted in Chapter 4 represent specific challenges industry experienced when doing business with the partner nation. Industry shared several pathways to cooperation, including directly selling to the partner government through one of the avenues for defense acquisition, getting incorporated into a partner industry’s supply chain, or setting up a local subsidiary. The barriers to cooperation differed across each pathway and are denoted in Table 5.1 with an X if reported for that pathway in the interviews conducted for the study. (For example, the second row denotes which kinds of barriers were reported during interviews with Australian firms which have direct contracts with the U.S. government.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GSgJ1FE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5.1: Barrier Crosswalk Across Pathways of Connection.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping these barriers as they relate to the pathways for cooperation reveals two insights. The first is that some of the barriers are cross-pathway, meaning that they are pervasive across multiple paths. For example, cultural challenges are present across most pathways of defense industrial cooperation. The second insight is that some pathways encounter multifaceted barriers, where many barriers in one pathway reinforce each other, increasing the difficulty of using that pathway. Notably, Australian firms working to sell directly to the U.S. government face multiple interlinked barriers. On the other hand, U.S.-based subsidiaries of Australian companies working with U.S. prime contractors face far fewer of these same barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5.1 reveals the complexity of these often-interrelated barriers. More specifically, cross-pathway barriers include cultural barriers such as risk aversion within industry and parochialism within government, which is a reported factor across all actors and pathways (except those within a single nation). Regulatory barriers, especially export controls and compliance requirements for the DOD, pervade many pathways. Two types of bureaucratic barriers are endemic across different pathway types: (1) Australian entities interacting with U.S. ones indicated that overuse of NOFORN markings limited the information they could see; and (2) both U.S. and Australian entities selling to the U.S. government reported that the U.S. acquisition workforce suffers from personnel shortages and lack of training on working with foreign businesses. Economic barriers, especially funding uncertainty, appeared across many pathways and were often linked to budgetary barriers in government and to regulatory barriers in industry, both slowing funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multifaceted barriers afflict certain pathways more than others, leading these pathways to be even more difficult. This dynamic is visualized in Figure 5.1. This chart takes the connections presented in Figure 3.1—the original pathway wire chart—and colors them by the reported difficulty of overcoming the barriers endemic to each pathway noted in Table 5.1. The “reported difficulty” assessment is informed by interviews with both industry and government figures. Note that Figure 5.1 does not offer a measure of the desirability of different paths, as a difficult path may offer a good risk-reward balance as long as the challenges can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OuoePYs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.1: Pathways of Connection by Difficulty.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms selling directly to U.S. primes face a variety of multifaceted obstacles, including bureaucratic, cultural, regulatory, strategic, technical, and economic barriers. A hypothetical example of an Australian firm trying to sell product to a U.S. prime can be used to illustrate how barriers can reinforce each other within a given pathway. In this example, a U.S. prime considering buying an Australian firm’s product might find that it is unable to freely discuss product requirements and capabilities due to how its culturally cautious legal department interprets complex U.S. export control regulations. This hurdle is worsened by the Australian firm’s cultural reluctance to seek legal counsel to push back on this interpretation of ITAR rules, either with the U.S. prime or either government. Even if the U.S. firm applies for the export control license requested by its compliance department to show its own systems or discuss its requirements with the Australian firm, bureaucratic delays in the processing of these licenses could delay the process by months—and the same delay would happen if the Australian firm ever wanted to export its product to the United States. The potential sale is then further afflicted by the U.S. prime’s reported cultural disinclination to buy from non-U.S. suppliers, which is only heightened by the technical challenge of non-reciprocal testing and certification regimes requiring the product to be recertified under U.S. systems—yet another expense and time cost. Furthermore, if the U.S. prime is seeking to replace an existing inferior supplier with a superior Australian offering, the cost and challenge of reworking supply chains would be an additional economic barrier. These kinds of multifaceted challenges present wicked problems which can be overcome—but only with sufficient catalysts for cooperation. And the solutions must go beyond simplistic diagnosis and simple recommendations to make a difference. Addressing the export control regime alone is insufficient to catalyze cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis of cooperation is not entirely bad news. In addition to showing current barriers, Figure 5.1 also highlights easier pathways in the ecosystem. For example, the interviews showed that bilateral cooperation is taking place in lower-resistance pathways such as the creation of U.S.-incorporated subsidiaries of Australian firms, which are displayed in green. The next part of this chapter discusses current catalysts to cooperation within G2G, B2G, and B2B interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-to-government-dynamics&quot;&gt;Government-to-Government Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and the United States have long been strategic partners. The main catalyst for a new emphasis on cooperation between Australia and the United States is the shared view of the changing threat picture, as described in Chapter 2. Policymakers in the United States and Australia have made concerted efforts to align their countries’ security efforts. Agreements such as AUKUS and GWEO are major political efforts and are representative of an increased strategic emphasis on the importance of direct industrial cooperation. During public events conducted for this project, Australian government figures have offered strong statements in support of cooperation. Hugh Jeffrey, Australia’s deputy secretary of strategy, policy, and industry, has said that “we can no longer afford to really have our cooperation exist only at the rhetorical domain. It’s got to actually exist at the operational domain.” Paul Myler, then deputy head of mission for the Embassy of Australia in Washington, D.C., stated that “never has it been more important for Australia and the U.S. to work together to ensure our collective deterrence efforts are sufficient to prevent escalation into regional conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G2G arrangements within the acquisition realm include supporting co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, and exports via foreign military sales which employ the U.S. acquisition system to deliver a product or service to the recipient government. G2G arrangements fall into the broader category of security cooperation, a topic which has been the subject of extensive research and is the source of the Moroney et al. framework which this research expanded to include business issues. With the exceptions of the organic industrial base and the transfer of systems already in inventory, G2G activities to support security cooperation in the acquisition realm almost inherently imply additional B2G relationships both within and across national borders. To better understand defense industrial integration, this report draws out the B2G and B2B pathways that may be embedded within or overlooked by analyses that focus only on government actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G2G agreements are critical enablers of defense industries working together, and government actors seek a range of benefits from cooperation, such as innovation, cost savings, economies of scale, enhanced operational interoperability and interchangeability, and support for industry and jobs in their own country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as many interviewees noted, while policymakers on both sides of the Pacific have offered strong public support for cooperation, both governments have struggled to convert policy pronouncements into concrete actions and funding. Government actors collectively face conflicting incentives due to the difficulties inherent in issuing new policy, along with a lack of direct rewards for the hard effort of making cooperation happen. According to William Greenwalt and Tom Corben, these conflicting impulses contributed to the lack of success of at least one previous major effort at defense industry integration between the two nations, the United States-Australia Defence Trade Cooperation Treaty. The researchers report that many in industry found this treaty ineffective due to its slow implementation and a lack of support among dedicated pockets of the U.S. export control workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry also faces conflicting impulses when considering international integration and benefits from G2G efforts as a signal to act. In the defense production realm, integrating new foreign suppliers or forming international joint ventures will often bring into play obstacles that do not exist when working with domestic partners. These more difficult forms of corporate activity are more likely to be undertaken when industry is responding to a clear government demand signal, especially when otherwise easier options exist domestically. Nonetheless, government actors typically do not experience the same urgency or incentives to act as industry figures, who are driven to international buyers by the pursuit of profits. While government action can create a strong demand signal for actors in industry to cooperate across the Pacific, the independent push from industry to expand their business is a vital driver of defense industrial integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;business-to-government-dynamics&quot;&gt;Business-to-Government Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire for profit and for the capital needed to invest in and expand business operations is a significant catalyst driving industry interest in working with partner governments. The vastly larger defense budget of the DOD compared to the ADOD means that the U.S. market represents a significant opportunity for Australian firms. U.S. and international defense primes already sell to the Australian government, often through local subsidiaries. They have personnel dedicated to understanding international markets and working with local governments. Discussions with government officials for this project confirmed that the Australian defense industry has fewer prime contractors and a greater emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises. The relative purchasing power and budget of the DOD compared to the ADOD means that U.S. government purchases from Australian industry offer a stronger opportunity for cooperation than the inverse. The DOD’s role as one of the institutions with oversight of defense cooperation efforts also gives it a leading role in promoting and facilitating cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the purchasing power of the DOD and the productive and innovative capacity of the Australian defense industry, there is much latent potential to be catalyzed upon via a closer cross-Pacific relationship. Several specific incentives emerged from CSIS’s research and interviews that have the potential to build an even deeper DOD relationship with Australian producers. These included growing government demand—both in the United States and in Australia—for military products and services, as well as efforts within the United States to change acquisition workforce culture to build willingness and capacity for contracting with foreign firms. (An overarching consideration for the DOD is an increased emphasis on supply chain resilience and economic deterrence. While a driver for cooperation, this may not be as evident to Australian industry.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGIC AND BUDGETARY CATALYST TO COOPERATION: GROWING GOVERNMENT DEMAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first catalyst to cooperation is the growing and unmet government demand for military-industrial capacity, particularly from the U.S. government. A confluence of factors—wars in Ukraine and the Middle East coupled with growing concern over China’s increasing military investments and economic warfare—has increased the U.S. demand for military goods, and revealed challenges surrounding the strength of the U.S. defense industrial base and its ability to surge production. The United States has begun considering a variety of solutions, many of which involve working closely with allies and partners to bolster production. Specific to Australia, the Joint Statement on the Australia–United States Ministerial Consultation (AUSMIN) 2024 reaffirmed the importance of Australia’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordinance initiative, as it “provides a pathway for the co-development, co-production, and co-sustainment of critical long-range fires and their component supply chains for both nations.” Policymaker energy and attention in the United States is focused on working with allies and partners to expand defense production capacity. As shown earlier in Figure 2.3, there is an existing foundation of Australian work for the DOD that shows that this is possible and offers a springboard upon which Australian firms can build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4NzweEy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.2: DOD Prime Contract Obligations by Origin of Good or Service and Region of Performance.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS; and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian companies are clear-eyed about the market benefits of selling to the DOD. As the left graph in Figure 5.2 shows, operational priorities such as the War in Afghanistan can dramatically shape contract trends. As seen in the right graph in Figure 5.2, even with the drawdown and eventual end of the conflict, defense contract spending has increased dramatically from the low point in FY 2015. In recent years, this has translated into a greater willingness by the DOD to buy international products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As depicted in Figure 5.3 below, there is a strong foundation of existing Australian work with the DOD for Australian firms to build upon. Furthermore, as one Australian interviewee offered, the United States has an “appetite for adoption [of new technology] that is more conducive” to scaling innovation than the Australian market. Another Australian manufacturing firm noted that the U.S. market is the largest on the planet and that any company interested in growing needs to take advantage of these opportunities. U.S. technology companies also noted the “hyperscale” platform of the DOD, which “becomes the enabler for everyone to use it to design, develop, test, and deploy software.” A powerful catalyst to cooperation is therefore simply the size of the DOD market, as the scale of DOD platforms is very attractive to innovative Australian firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R2vHCw0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.3: DOD Prime Contract Obligations with an Australian Aspect.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS; and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a growing U.S. government demand for military goods, Australia is also experiencing an increasing desire for sustainable sovereign production capacity. As mentioned in Chapter 2, Australia’s Defense Industry Development Strategy (DIDS) identified seven Sovereign Defence Industrial Priorities (SDIPs), that is, areas of particular focus for its sovereign industry capabilities. This prioritization scheme is not only useful for concentrating the focus of domestic industry but also serves to further close industrial collaboration with trusted international partners, another stated aim of the DIDS. Australia’s emphasis on becoming a key stakeholder in selected pivotal domains as part of an alliance web of production is part of the intragovernmental push for cooperation. Australia’s sovereign capacity concept—which places Australia within a web of allied production—has not only led to G2G initiatives like AUKUS and GWEO but is also based upon Australia’s history of acquisitions from the Australian subsidiaries of U.S. defense primes, another key form of international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A striking finding from the interviews is that one catalyst for international cooperation is Australian firms’ desire to raise their standing with the Australian government. Winning a contract in the United States or the United Kingdom establishes the bona fides of an Australian firm that may otherwise be overlooked, should they attempt to sell directly to their own government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CULTURAL CATALYST TO COOPERATION: CHANGE WITHIN THE DOD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. strategic documents have increasingly highlighted the importance of industrial cooperation with allies and partners, demonstrating the senior leadership support essential for innovative change. The 2024 National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS) places significant emphasis on two vectors of international security cooperation and defense industrial base integration: first, arms exports using the U.S. acquisition system, namely the foreign military sales process, and second, building a network of cooperation with allies and partners as part of an overarching concept of “production diplomacy.” Greater integration would come through NDIS section 2.1.2.6, which seeks to boost production and resilience by “incorporating allies and partners into a more networked or web-like production chain,” reinforced by both foreign production through licensing and domestic production via foreign subsidiaries. NDIS section 2.3.2.1 also notes the importance of “standards, modularity, and interoperability” for international collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDIS’s emphasis on incorporating allies into the U.S. production chain provides a strong signal to the U.S. acquisition workforce that working with allied firms is not just permitted, but desired. Along with strong leadership guidance, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology Doug Bush has stressed the importance of education via training and support of personnel as well as rewarding reasonable, thoughtful risk-taking as foundational to creating cultural change. The availability of business process improvements like the Adaptive Acquisition Framework can also help drive this shift toward incorporating allied firms into DOD acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;business-to-business-dynamics&quot;&gt;Business-to-Business Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desires to increase sales, build market share, and gain capital for investment and expansion are major drivers for industry-to-industry cooperation. A key element of international defense cooperation between the United States and Australia is building connections between the defense industries of the two nations. Industry-to-industry cooperation has the potential to integrate supply chains, build manufacturing capacity resilience, and deepen cross-border security relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An active and fluid business environment between the two nations’ defense industries is critical to ensuring the success of U.S.-Australian defense initiatives, including AUKUS. The U.S. defense industrial base is heavily integrated with global supply chains, especially those involving its allies and partners, and reducing barriers to cooperation for U.S. and Australian industry will spur further cooperative initiatives—especially those that require less government attention and direction than full co-development initiatives like the F-35 program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial cooperation occurs because of a spur to action—be it a strong business case on the industry side or strategic guidance as a precursor to orders from the government. Given the flurry of policymaking in recent years, both currently exist. Both governments’ strategic visions encourage industry to create strategic partnerships in anticipation of funding in both the present and future. Given the expansion of U.S.-Australian security ties, industry-to-industry relationships have been increasing and, if AUKUS and GWEO succeed, will continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. and Australian governments take action to amplify these catalysts with decisive policies, there is the potential for a rapid growth in both the breadth and depth of this bilateral relationship. The two primary catalysts to cooperation identified in CSIS’s interviews and research are the growing U.S. demand for military industrial capacity across the globe and the greater use of U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms as a pathway to supplying U.S. defense primes or the DOD itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC AND BUDGETARY CATALYSTS TO COOPERATION: THE GROWING BUSINESS CASE DUE TO U.S. INDUSTRY DEMAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied support for Ukraine in its self-defense against Russia’s invasion has led to the realization that U.S. defense industry surge capacity is limited. The greater need for capacity is a catalyst for cooperation as the United States looks to enhance its industrial base. The U.S. government’s demand for military industrial goods has translated into a greater need for capacity from overstretched U.S. defense firms—as well as from the second-, third-, and lower-tier suppliers in their supply chains. Second-source suppliers for materials and technology can help fill this gap if enabling contracts are in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is well positioned to take advantage of this growing U.S. defense industry need. Australia can provide technological and engineering excellence in areas of interest to the defense industry. The recent AUSMIN 2024 joint statement stressed “the important role that Australian critical minerals will play in supporting defense and wider economic supply chains,” highlighting Australia’s role as a reliable and strategically aligned source of these key inputs. One major Australian defense manufacturing company noted that they are “seeing more engagement now with the U.S. defense primes, specifically in the last twelve months, than ever before,” implying a “far greater willingness to work with Australia.” The firm attributed this to a combination of the DOD supply chain report highlighting the need for more resilient sources of supply and the AUKUS and GWEO initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY CATALYSTS TO COOPERATION: AUSTRALIAN FIRMS ARE MAKING GREATER USE OF U.S. SUBSIDIARIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms have been establishing subsidiary companies in the United States to facilitate partnerships with and sales to the DOD and defense primes in attempts to overcome barriers to cooperation. Responding in part to greater demand from U.S. primes and the U.S. government itself, Australian firms have created relationships with subsidiary firms to facilitate trade. As Figure 5.4 illustrates, most of the funding from DOD contracts with Australian firms for the past two decades has gone to the U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms, not to Australian entities directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZUm3EMX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5.4: DOD Prime Contracts with Australian Vendors and Their U.S. Subsidiaries, FY 2012–FY 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: FPDS; and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By examining DOD contracts with its first-tier suppliers with an Australian aspect (either Australian headquartered or owned by an Australian firm) by fiscal year, two stories emerge. Interviewees’ reporting high difficulty of selling directly to the DOD are supported by U.S. contracting data shown in Figure 5.4, although the data shows small but consistent gains since FY 2016 of Australian firms selling directly to the DOD. This success is massively outweighed by the much larger volume of sales by U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms to the DOD. This distinction has supply chain implications, as despite the predominance of U.S. subsidiaries of Australian firms, direct sales by Australian firms are the larger provider of goods and services originating outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, both contracting data and interview findings make clear that having some form of U.S. corporate identity helps overcome some of the barriers for Australian firms selling to the DOD or working with U.S. primes. The first key advantage is having staff on the ground to connect with the personnel from the DOD and U.S. primes. Subsidiaries also make the legal and technical structuring of partnerships with U.S. entities easier—many Australian firms reported that their commercialization strategies involved bringing in more established U.S. companies to act as resellers or intermediaries. A U.S. entity with local staff also avoids many of the regulatory issues with ITAR and security clearances that prevent company staff from going on-site to classified areas in a timely manner. On top of local access and regulatory ease, one Australian manufacturer described buying a U.S. subsidiary as lowering the “activation energy” needed to do business in the United States, as U.S. companies often prefer dealing with a U.S. entity. U.S. defense primes also appreciate working with the U.S. subsidiaries of Australian defense firms, as it allows them to more easily communicate their requirements, hear about the Australian company’s capacities, and then decide about working with either the U.S. or Australian entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian firms that have had success working in the United States can help illustrate the benefits of establishing a U.S. subsidiary to navigate the challenges of doing business in the United States. One Australian engineering and manufacturing firm has contracts both with U.S. defense primes and with their Australian subsidiaries. This firm established a U.S. subsidiary to sell its products more easily to U.S. primes and to mitigate exchange rate issues with the U.S. dollar. The firm uses its U.S. subsidiary to manage capacity requirements—some of its products are manufactured in the United States and then transferred to its Australian entity to be sold to the end customer. Furthermore, some U.S. primes prefer to buy from the firm’s subsidiary to avoid any potential ITAR issues when buying from an Australian location. The Australian firm noted that some of the Australian products it transferred to its U.S. subsidiary were then sold to U.S. defense primes and then ultimately resold to the Australian government via FMS and DCS—a long way home for these Australian defense goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barriers to cooperation appear as specific challenges but in fact have larger systemic causes and effects. Overcoming barriers means both recognizing and addressing challenges (e.g., the delays caused by ITAR and other export controls) and seeing how they are connected to other challenges (e.g., a broader cultural reluctance on the part of U.S. industry to do business with foreign suppliers). This research has affirmed that there are no simple solutions and that a consistent, deliberate, big-picture approach to continually scanning for barriers and working on solutions will be necessary to enhance defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic significance of enhancing defense industrial cooperation between Australia and the United States requires a response grounded in a clear understanding of the specific challenges of this bilateral relationship combined with a broader mastery of the acquisition process and the numerous obstacles to any form of defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation can happen, and there are examples of the United States and Australia working together on defense production. The question is not whether this occurs but rather how to make such cooperation easier and more frequent by reducing the individual and systemic barriers identified here. Specific recommendations that can address these barriers are presented below and grouped by the type of barrier that they are intended to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the recommendations focus on very specific problems, and others are broader. As discussed in Chapter 5, these barriers are often mutually reinforcing. For these reasons, some topics, such as standards, appear under multiple categories of barriers, and many recommendations have implications that go beyond the barrier that they primarily address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-budgetary-and-technical-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Budgetary and Technical Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and Australia, increasing the speed and quantity of defense production is crucial to addressing the threats that have been identified by their respective national strategies. Achieving these goals will be expensive, even with the opportunity provided by rising defense budgets. Australia recognizes that its desired sovereign defense industrial capabilities cannot be sustained without integration into other defense ecosystems and funding streams. The U.S. National Defense Industrial Strategy correctly identifies greater commonality with partners as an imperative. In short, commonality is an area where industrial integration can and should have a return on investment that offsets fiscal barriers to cooperation. The recommendations below take aim at the technical obstacles to commonality, which in turn will aid in justifying the budgetary investments in cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and Australia should endeavor to align their requirements for new weapons systems or produce shared requirements, where possible, especially in the context of AUKUS.&lt;/strong&gt; This would allow Australian and U.S. companies to more easily innovate, manufacture, and sell systems to both governments. A crucial related benefit is making operational forces more interoperable or even interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groupings such as AUKUS or the overlapping members of Five Eyes and the NTIB should be used as venues for implementing shared standards working groups.&lt;/strong&gt; Common use of open standards, such as those pursued under the U.S. Modular Open System Approaches, would help standardize components and subsystems to support recommendation 1. To be successful, standards setters should allow partner nations to provide input into the process, to ensure that standards do not unwittingly create unnecessary barriers. The Future Airborne Capability is one example of this form of collaboration that could be emulated elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-regulatory-and-bureaucratic-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Regulatory and Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory and bureaucratic barriers inevitably add friction to international cooperation. To alleviate some of these obstacles, the U.S. Congress legislated a partial ITAR exemption for AUKUS countries, only the second such exemption in existence. This AUKUS ITAR exemption is a generational shift in U.S. export and technology control policies, moving from mandating licensing to requiring tracking for a range of technology in the territories of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This change has the potential to be transformative not just for AUKUS projects but also for the bilateral U.S.-Australia relationship. Some analysts, such as William Greenwalt and Tom Corben, call for further liberalization in the next steps of implementation. The interviews for this project took place before the implementation language was released; therefore, the recommendations below do not seek to evaluate the implementation of the AUKUS ITAR exemption itself but instead focus on findings from the interviews and data that remain relevant in this rapidly changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measures to address regulatory and bureaucratic barriers can be mutually reinforcing, as they decrease regulatory burden and streamline administrative workload. As part of the AUKUS implementing regulation, licensing will be expedited for transfers between Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States in those cases when it is not exempted. Some of the recommendations below follow a similar logic by seeking regulatory or broad bureaucratic changes that would remove the need for approvals for recurring sources of friction that can be addressed on a systematic rather than a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia should enact equivalency agreements that recognize that certain defense standards are close enough to be mutually acceptable, even if these standards are not made in common. Currently, pursuing approvals for defense standards that are similar but not entirely in common is a grinding process that wastes staff time and incurs additional delay. To help alleviate this barrier, AUKUS governments could authorize existing technical working groups to extend their mandates to harmonizing standards and achieving equivalency agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia should mutually recognize each other’s accreditation standards regimes where the requirements are close enough to be functionally interchangeable. The National Australian Testing Authority (NATA) is not currently recognized in the United States, which instead employs the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (Nadcap). U.S.-Australia cooperation would benefit from wider adoption in Australia of U.S. National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST) standards for document handling. Doing so would facilitate easier crossing of national lines for defense firms by reducing the need for duplicative and time-consuming reaccreditation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A joint procurement vehicle, such as a pan-AUKUS panel, could be created to deepen AUKUS collaboration, especially in the key areas of AUKUS Pillar II. This panel—similar to what the General Services Administration and Australian government offer—would provide a common framework on which innovative companies could sell to all three countries. A combined Australian, UK, and U.S. call for innovation on electronic warfare within AUKUS resulted in prizes being awarded by innovation units within each country to high-performing national vendors. This “adjacent pools” approach could serve as a useful stepping stone toward a true “common pool” style of joint procurement in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and Australia should fully embrace mutual recognition of security clearances, within necessary parameters. Doing so would assist the efficient sharing of information that undergirds high-technology security cooperation. This recognition could fall under the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement or be a separate trilateral agreement among AUKUS countries. This step would build on the fact that classified information already appears on the AUKUS ITAR excluded technology list, which, alongside the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement, indicates significant existing trust on classified information sharing. The September 1, 2024, ITAR reforms include a provision for exemptions for dual nationals or third-country nationals, which allows for security clearances approved by the host-nation government for its employees to count toward the fulfillment of exemption requirements. AUKUS nations should continue to build on this approach to enable as wide an implementation as reasonably practicable of cross-recognition of clearances and should pay attention to the proper enabling changes needed to make such reforms widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress should explore passing legislation which would connect the AUKUS and Canadian ITAR exemptions to allow cross-compatibility. The larger NTIB would be invigorated by allowing free movement between the four countries of any technology that met the conditions of both the Canada and AUKUS exemptions. Though the excluded technology lists for AUKUS and Canada are different, they do share large areas of overlap. If the four nations were to agree to this step, it would facilitate NTIB expedited licensing by eliminating the need to consider technology that has already been approved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-cultural-political-and-strategic-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Cultural, Political, and Strategic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislative and regulatory changes alone are often not sufficient to effectively overcome barriers to cooperation. Cultural change is often necessary to fully institutionalize new authorities or integrate regulations into everyday practice. In the absence of cultural change, new authorities and strategic objectives may be hindered by inertia. Cultural change can be further hampered by competing messages, such as when the United States’ Buy American Office was launched just before AUKUS materialized. Measures such as these create an acquisition culture of defaulting to what is known, streamlined, and easy. Overcoming this cultural default requires not just direction from senior leaders but also consistent reinforcement at all levels and periodic evaluation of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and ADOD should conduct an audit of the implementation and outcomes of industrial cooperation efforts in preparation for each annual Australia–United States Ministerial Consultation (AUSMIN). Tracking NDIS and DIDS implementation and measuring outcomes allows leaders to identify where strategic goals and rule changes have not yet translated into changed behavior. By looking at the types and levels of cooperation, and building on the larger independent efforts to track NDIS and DIDS goals, relevant departmental leadership can observe and reward cultural change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and ADOD should furnish an annual report on the implementation of cross-national industrial integration initiatives to their respective legislatures. This report could be derived from the AUSMIN audit in recommendation 3.1. The national legislatures of both the United States and Australia have taken crucial steps to reform their respective export control processes as part of AUKUS. Annual reporting would facilitate legislative action in support of AUKUS and the broader bilateral relationship. This report would ideally be public, with a classified annex as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of State should conduct a rigorous and proactive outreach campaign to inform industry about the specific requirements of the 2024 new AUKUS waiver; Austrade should establish a pipeline to refer companies to the Defence Export Controls office to provide clear messaging and education to industry about ITAR rules and boundaries. ITAR is managed by the State Department and is generally regarded as exceptionally complex and difficult to understand. Both governments’ direct messaging and education on ITAR could help overcome industry’s inclination to be more conservative than the rules require.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-economic-barriers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Economic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic barriers to defense industrial cooperation are mainly the product of uncertain returns for vendors supporting international cooperation, which make it difficult to justify addressing the forms of friction introduced by borders. A common kind of friction is the difficulty of incorporating a foreign supplier into an established supply chain or the costs of establishing a subsidiary and building contacts in a distant foreign nation. Insufficient incentives undercut the role the U.S. and Australian defense industrial bases can play in support of defense cooperation. Barriers to international cooperation can resemble those of small or non-traditional U.S. vendors. The lack of a perceived “front door” access for AUKUS applicants complicates what would otherwise be a comparatively easy path for Australian vendors that have established a U.S. subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defense industry groups in the AUKUS countries should consider creating an AUKUS-focused consortium. Consortia are often used to gather a set of vendors with a common interest, such as working with a particular technology or involving a standard or architecture. They can be an entry point for vendors and can ease the discovery process for government customers. The innovation-seeking acquisition mechanism Other Transaction Authority (OTA) arrangements often rely on consortia for ease of entry. However, because consortium management companies want to avoid export controls, many consortiums are limited to U.S. companies (including those with foreign headquarters). Yet, there is precedent for allowing international participants in U.S. consortia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The governments of Australia and the United Kingdom should consider subsidizing the overhead costs of establishing these AUKUS-focused consortia for AUKUS Pillar II topics. This would be similar to how the Canadian Commercial Corporation takes on the overhead burden for Canadian firms selling to the U.S. government. This step would allow smaller Australian firms to explore the U.S. market before taking the larger leap of establishing a U.S. subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. acquisition workforce should use Other Transaction Authority arrangements for AUKUS acquisition coordination. This approach would build on the success of AUKUS prize challenges by creating a mechanism to manage intergovernmental AUKUS procurement. As covered in previous recommendations, AUKUS procurement vehicles and consortiums could address some of the multifaceted barriers to business-to-government cooperation. Multinational procurement vehicles would require top acquisition personnel from all three countries to pool their expertise and address the considerable challenges of designing a vehicle that meets the need of all three systems. Despite requiring up-front costs, this approach could bear significant fruit by resolving the challenge of reconciling the rules of three different national acquisition systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Australian government should empower and provide additional funding to Austrade to enhance Australian industry understanding of the U.S. acquisition system and to aid Australian SMEs in establishing U.S. domestic subsidiaries. Building on its success assisting Australian firms through trade shows and personnel introductions, Austrade could also provide more detailed information on complex and lesser-known export options (e.g., EAR 600 and DSP5). Assistance with domestic U.S. subsidiaries would require Australian funding for firms in the United States, but this initiative would yield an overall benefit for Australian firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD should expand the training and education of its acquisition workforce to include the financial and bureaucratic complexities of working with international companies. DOD officials are occasionally unprepared for the bureaucratic requirements of paying foreign entities via international wires, despite the availability of existing mechanisms. Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) staff were also unfamiliar with constraints unique to Australian firms, such as time zone differences and the difficulty of rapid travel to the United States. Small Australian firms reported funding difficulties created by slow payments, vague programs, and shifting deadlines. More rigorous international cooperation training could be usefully paired with hiring more U.S. acquisition personnel to alleviate the challenge of incorporating Australian firms into the U.S. defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and ADOD should embrace Modular Open Systems Approaches to lower barriers to entry and encourage competition. There is often the perception of industry gatekeeping by U.S. primes to prevent Australian firms from competing. U.S. law encourages the adoption of Modular Open Systems Approaches to the maximum extent practicable, though in practice more can be done. Private industry still retains key intellectual property under these arrangements, but the U.S. government has the ability to bring in new competitors, for example, by holding a competition for Australian vendors to compete to support an existing system built on open architectures that are accessible to Australians firms. This option would also be available to the Australian government when purchasing systems using Modular Open Systems Approaches from the United States or when employing such open standards in their own systems, even when developing them with international partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;concluding-thoughts-1&quot;&gt;Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing defense industrial cooperation between Australia and the United States will take concerted efforts by government and industry from both nations. Senior government leaders need to reaffirm the importance of this integration through policy pronouncements and regular reviews. Ensuring that business practices and industry and government culture support cooperation will require both resources and a thoughtful requirement-setting process that enhances opportunities for collaboration. Simple solutions and single policy changes (e.g., “fix ITAR”) alone will not yield the results desired. To enhance cooperation outcomes, both systems must commit to a longer-term plan for change management, with a focus on sharing the strategic vision, providing necessary resources and training, and continually identifying and addressing barriers. Measuring and tracking cooperative activities can provide a useful metric to assess whether policy changes are having the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real and sustained change can only start once policymakers embrace a mindset that believes time is of the essence and that approaches the challenges of national and allied preparedness with a sense of urgency. The case for changing the model of defense industrial cooperation between the United States and Australia has been made and is widely acknowledged across both governments. Overcoming bureaucratic inertia to realize a tangible shift in how the U.S. and Australian industrial bases integrate, however, demands greater commitment. Given new collaborations between Beijing, Moscow, Pyongyang, and Tehran, as well as the rapidly deteriorating security conditions globally and in the Indo-Pacific region specifically, allied deterrence must transform into a collective endeavor. Such an enterprise necessarily demands more integration and alignment of defense systems and industries. AUKUS provides a superb opportunity to expand defense industrial collaborations by revitalizing the U.S.-Australian alliance with a laser-like focus on industrial policy. The national security of both counties, and the stability of the region, might well depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著圍繞黎有否鼓吹外國與中國貿易時，將非貿易相關議題扣連。在2020年11月29日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，節目嘉賓、美國記者兼時評作家 Nicholas Kristof 提到，有的人指稱美國替香港和黎發聲，是與「西方分裂中國（Western dismemberment）」有關。黎回應稱這論述「不完全是錯誤」，香港與自由世界抱持相同價值，是這些自由世界價值的堡壘，而對於中國來說這些是「危險」的思想，如果獲容許在中國散播的話，「必定可以分裂中國政權（it definitely can dismember the Chinese regime）」，這是中國如此進取地打壓香港的原因。黎又表示，希望拜登政府不只談論人權，而是作出行動，如果可以的話，在貿易談判中，將香港和新疆的人權、自由和法治議題扣連。在控方盤問下，黎確認上述主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後表示，不認為特朗普只是基於人權議題而向中國實施禁運，而他希望拜登回復與中國貿易談判，並且希望談判能夠扣連香港和新疆的人權議題。控方問是否將人權議題作為先決條件？黎則稱是「一個組合（a package）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指出，黎在節目中使用的「dismember」一字，帶有分裂國家的意思。黎否認提倡西方分裂中國，並解釋稱當時使用「dismember」的意思是指中國與西方價值觀相異，不把中國視為國際社會一員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認希望拜登延續特朗普的強硬態度&quot;&gt;黎否認希望拜登延續特朗普的強硬態度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年12月1日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎稱拜登政府應該明白到，與中共交往時須以強硬態度而非軟弱或綏靖態度。控方質疑黎希望拜登盡可能對中國強硬。黎否認，強調只是陳述當時情況，不代表他希望拜登延續特朗普的強硬態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指，2020年12月1日播出的《霍士新聞》訪問中，黎稱很多人想美國民主黨的拜登政府與中國談判時，將人權、法治、自由和新疆人權議題等，列為首要條件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰文稱迫使中國尊重人權-控方質疑為了給特朗普閱讀&quot;&gt;黎撰文稱迫使中國尊重人權 控方質疑為了給特朗普閱讀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息紀錄，2019年8月7至8日期間，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送一篇時評文章的草稿，打算交給其教父兼《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn 。該草稿提及中國經濟正在衰退，同時面對美國貿易戰和科技禁運，這是一個良機迫使中國尊重人權，籲美國人向當地的議員寫信，利用制裁來阻止中國侵害香港的自由，舉例指拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證，並在結尾提到：「我們已經清除奴隸制度，為何不清除暴政！（We have eliminated slavery, why not tyranny!）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問黎希望想清除哪一個暴政？是否指中共政府？黎同意。控方指，黎要求美國人清除中共？黎否認，強調他只是說「我們已經清除奴隸制度，為何不清除暴政」。控方問誰是「我們」，黎稱：「全人類。（Humanity.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，Mark Simon 於同年8月9日傳送訊息給黎：「Trump has pushed back. OAN is his new favourite channel. I was told to watch for something. This is it. It’s a response to WSJ piece. Crack down in HK, no trade talks, lots of pain coming.（特朗普剛推遲了（貿易談判）。OAN 是他最近喜歡的頻道，有人叫我去觀看。就這樣。這是一個對《華爾街日報》文章的回應。在香港的打壓，沒有貿易談判，大量痛苦來臨。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，「OAN」是否即是 One America News？黎稱不知道。控方指，訊息再一次證明 Mark Simon 獲得美國政府的內部消息，因他知道特朗普喜歡的頻道。控方又指，訊息稱「這是一個對《華爾街日報》文章的回應」，顯示黎的文章草稿是打算給特朗普看？黎稱不知道。法官李素蘭追問，特朗普的舉動是與黎刊登在《華爾街日報》的文章有關係？黎亦表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息稱美國撤銷香港特殊地位是正確-黎否認屬請求&quot;&gt;訊息稱美國撤銷香港特殊地位是「正確」 黎否認屬請求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著圍繞黎有否請求美國撤銷香港特殊地位提問。2020年7月15日，Mark Simon 轉發時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 的訊息，要求黎澄清對於撤銷香港特殊地位的立場。黎回覆：「我是說撤銷香港特殊地位是不需要的，因為在《國安法》下，香港怎樣也好都會完蛋。重點不在於香港而在於中國。制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港。但是就此思考後，我認為他們撤回香港特殊地位是正確的，因為一旦美國和中國之間脫鈎，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。（I said that it’s not necessary to revoke the special status of HK because with national security law HK is finished anyway. The point is not HK but China. Sanction China as to stop it from clamping down on HK. But after I thought about it I think they’re right to revoke HK’s special status, because once US and China decoupled HK would be a way out for China. To close this outlet of China would force it to come to term easier to demands of US.）」其後 Mark Simon 回覆：「謝謝，會傳達。（Thanks… will relay）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否支持美國撤銷香港特殊地位？黎相信當時美國已經撤銷香港特殊地位，因此不是「支持」，而是認同美國撤銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，美國每年檢視香港情況而決定是否維持香港特殊地位，質疑從上述訊息可見，黎想美國繼續撤銷香港特殊地位。黎表示沒有這樣說過。法官李運騰指，黎在訊息稱香港是中國通往世界的出口，若然關閉這個出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。李官問黎，若然中國一直不回應美國的要求，那麼黎便不想美國恢復香港的特殊地位？黎表示沒有想到這麼長遠，重申他只是說香港是中國通往世界的通道（conduit），若然關閉這個通道的話，中國會更易回應美國的訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎的訊息提及「制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港」，質疑黎的意思是既然《國安法》已經實施，「為何不撤銷香港特殊地位？」，因此黎的最終目的是制裁中國。控方又指，上述訊息是黎透過 Mark Simon，直接請求美國撤銷香港特殊地位。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎直接促請美國政府制裁中國，以制止中國打壓香港，又指黎向美國提倡針對中國的敵對行動。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎為美國而戰-犧牲香港和中國的利益&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎為美國而戰 犧牲香港和中國的利益&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎為了美國的利益而犧牲香港和中國的利益，而黎並非為香港爭取利益，一直以來他只是爭取美國的利益。黎否認，堅稱他是爭取香港的利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎不是說過「我們為與美國共同抱持的價值戰鬥」嗎？黎則表示，他是為了香港，而爭取與美國共同擁有的價值。控方追問，黎是為了美國而戰鬥？黎否認這樣說過，反指自己是在戰爭的前線戰鬥，為了與美國一致的價值戰鬥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又質疑，黎發送訊息的時候，《國安法》經已實施，質疑黎並非如他所稱的謹慎。黎則堅稱他只是在訊息中回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱希望拜登繼續對中國採取毫不留情態度-惟否認希望制裁措施持續&quot;&gt;黎稱希望拜登繼續對中國採取毫不留情態度 惟否認希望制裁措施持續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2020年11月29日，黎在專欄文章〈天下圍中 拜登騎虎難下〉中稱：「川普取消香港的特殊貿易地位⋯⋯此外又制裁某些協助中共鎮壓港人的官員，要他們承受個人損失，令其他有可能參與鎮壓的官員多一重顧慮，對中共肆意鎮壓港人或多或少有個牽制作用，令為國安法蹂躪喘不過氣來的港人感到有人為我們出氣而寄存希望。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎希望針對中國的制裁措施能夠持續。黎否認。控方續指，黎在文章中強調制裁對於官員的負面作用，想突出制裁對中國的不利效果。黎同意有提及過，但否認是提倡。控方又問，對於黎而言，美國制裁中共官員是否令他感到有人替他「出氣」？黎認同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，文章的網上版本新增了一些段落，當中稱：「有人說拜登比川普更重視人權，會更關心香港人的抗爭運動，言辭上的確或如此，但政客從來講一套做又是另一套，而行動方為最實際。與中共談判緩和貿易戰，拜登倘能以香港的法治、自由和新疆的人權狀況為談判的先決條件，那就功德無量了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否想拜登繼續對中國採取毫不留情（relentless）的態度？黎表示：「我希望。」控方指，在《國安法》生效之後，黎有繼續提倡制裁。黎否認提倡制裁，但承認有說過美國應該在與中國貿易的時候將人權議題扣連。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒說過中共應該低頭和拚死一戰&quot;&gt;黎稱沒說過中共應該「低頭」和「拚死一戰」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2021年6月6日的《蘋果》社評〈美國離間中俄，中共有苦自知〉，由筆名「方圓」的顏純鈎撰寫。控方引述其中一段：「拜登爭取普京中立，已經贏了一大半，此後西方各強國齊心，脅迫中共遵守國際規則，又在經濟和科技上圍堵，中共遲早吃不消。到最後，除了低頭，也只有拚死一戰了。」控方問黎，上述段落是否與黎的想法一致？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱文章與他的想法相似，但是非完全一致，因他沒有說過中共應該「低頭」和「拚死一戰」。控方質疑，黎在早上不是說過想「清除暴政」嗎？黎稱只是說過想清除暴政而非指明中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎當時知道顏的文章有意引起對政府的憎恨、蔑視和不滿；有意慫使他人不守法；以及有意請求外國針對中國進行敵對行動。黎一概否認，並重申他不是作者也不是發布者，該文章與他無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方最後指出案情-黎一概否認一派胡言&quot;&gt;控方最後指出案情 黎一概否認：「一派胡言」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後總結案情，指在2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日期間，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，與張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇、Mark Simon、張志偉、李兆富和其他不知名人士，一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及或複製煽動刊物，包括161篇涉案文章，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎沉默數秒後，回答：「當然不同意。」，並指：「一派胡言！（Totally rubbish!）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」，控方指黎及3間涉案公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日期間，與張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇、Mark Simon、張志偉、李兆富和其他不知名人士一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員，對中國或香港特區實施制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎與上述涉案人士之間達成請求外國制裁的協議，是從2019年3至4月開始，直至2021年6月24日結束。黎則稱控方編造故事，堅稱沒有協議，反問：「我怎樣同意？」，其後表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎面對的另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」，控方指黎於2020年7月1日至2021年2月15日期間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸、IPAC 創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）、時任日本議員菅野志櫻里、英國金融家 Bill Browder 及其他不知名人士串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，對中國或香港特區實施制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。黎表示：「我連李宇軒是誰也不知道」，又批評控方編造故事然後來問他是否同意。黎最終表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎與上述涉案人士的協議，最遲從2020年1月開始，其後持續，直至2021年2月15日結束。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方完成盤問-辯方料覆問需時一天&quot;&gt;控方完成盤問 辯方料覆問需時一天&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示沒有進一步問題，意味控方完成盤問。辯方代表大律師關文渭表示，希望在周三才開始進行覆問，因需時整理覆問流程；此外，就著控方指稱黎的文章和言論欠缺事實基礎，辯方從網上公開資料搜尋到相關事實基礎，希望在覆問之前，將該些材料交給控方檢視，因此希望押後至周三，並且預料一天內能夠完成覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，黎完成作供之後，預料會處理控辯雙方承認事實、有關通訊軟件中轉發訊息功能的專家證供，以及有關網上下載公開紀錄的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師彭耀鴻則表示，將會與控方商討結案陳詞日子，若然雙方各自需時六星期撰寫書面陳詞的話，可能會在6月回來法庭作口頭陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that cumulative capital spending in the most aggressive scenario could reach $2.35 trillion by 2030, with compute deployment reaching 7.0E+30 total floating-point operations (FLOP) and power demands adding 83.7 gigawatts (GWs) to the U.S. grid. While financing appears manageable with U.S. capital markets, and graphics processing unit (GPU) production constraints seem surmountable through technological advancement, the unprecedented scale of electrical power demands—equivalent to adding a new state the size of Texas to the grid—poses significant infrastructure and policy challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) rapidly became the focus of technology sector investment after the release of ChatGPT 3.5 in November of 2022. Since then, genAI has consistently captured the attention and resources of industry leaders, solidifying its place as a transformative technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projections for genAI investment are staggering. Sam Altman, CEO of the leading genAI provider OpenAI, has reportedly discussed creating a $7 trillion fund for genAI investment before 2030. Such an enormous number underscores industry leaders’ confidence in the transformative potential of genAI for the technology sector and the global economy. Nvidia, the leading producer of GPUs that provide compute for genAI, saw its revenue grow from $5 billion in the last quarter of fiscal year 2021 to $35 billion in the final quarter of FY 2024. This growth has been fueled by the increasing demand for advanced computational hardware capable of handling the exponential increase in genAI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel to the rapid increase in investment in GPUs, the electricity sector has seen a jump in power demand. Like factories or refineries, data centers attempt to maximize the return on capital by operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as close to full capacity as possible. A new data center can demand as much as one GW of constant power, and the genAI industry plans to increase the scale and quantity of new data centers added every year. As of 2024, the additional demand from data centers has already reversed a six-decade-long trend of falling growth. Estimates of future demand have been revised sharply upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debut of DeepSeek’s R1 model introduced a significant shift in the genAI landscape. When delivering cutting-edge performance at a fraction of the computational cost compared to frontier models, R1 has fueled speculation that hyperscale data centers may no longer be the limiting factor in genAI progress. Some argue that the trillion-dollar arms race in genAI infrastructure could prove unnecessary if leading models can be trained and deployed with dramatically lower resource requirements. Yet, among industry leaders, there is little indication that infrastructure investment plans are being scaled back. Rather than being viewed as a cap to genAI’s expansion, DeepSeek’s efficiency gains are understood as a catalyst for even more aggressive genAI deployment. Moreover, lower costs do not imply diminishing demand; instead, they further extend the frontier of what is economically viable, broadening genAI’s reach across industries and accelerating its integration into the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly announced Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment led by OpenAI in partnership with SoftBank and Oracle, reinforces this interpretation. Stargate represents the largest genAI infrastructure initiative to date, with plans for a vast network of hyperscale data centers across the United States. If DeepSeek’s breakthrough demonstrated that state-of-the-art genAI can be achieved more efficiently, Stargate underscores that the response from key players is to expand investment, not to temper it. The fundamental premise remains unchanged: No matter how rapidly genAI efficiency improves, the demand for compute continues to scale beyond prior projections. Far from reducing the need for capital expenditure, cost declines in training and inference are expected to unlock new applications, driving even more infrastructure buildout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing dominance in genAI has emerged as a focus for U.S. policymakers, who see it as vital for maintaining economic leadership and safeguarding national security. Achieving such dominance requires capitalizing on the transformative benefits of genAI and ensuring that the United States can train and deploy the most advanced genAI models in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we describe a model designed to explore the following questions: Will the recent acceleration in genAI growth continue over the short, medium, and long term, and, if so, does the United States have the economic capacity and infrastructure to support that growth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model connects three possible constraints on the growth of the U.S. genAI industry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financing:&lt;/strong&gt; Could the sheer cost of capital hinder genAI development and deployment?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware:&lt;/strong&gt; Could the production and supply of specialized genAI hardware, particularly GPUs, create bottlenecks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Could the energy demands of genAI models and supporting infrastructure outpace available resources?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three illustrative scenarios represent different durations over which the post-ChatGPT acceleration in genAI growth might last:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Industrial Revolution:&lt;/strong&gt; eight or more years&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PC Explosion:&lt;/strong&gt; five years&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dot-Com Boom:&lt;/strong&gt; two years&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most aggressive scenario is modeled after the growth experienced during the Second Industrial Revolution—between 1870 and 1914—when electricity, Bessemer steel, and internal combustion engines fundamentally altered the nature of production. If genAI facilitates this level of economic transformation, we expect the investment in genAI to continue at its present rate over the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that leading AI labs are raising hundreds of billions of dollars in capital based on an anticipated transformation of this magnitude. We include two additional scenarios because market expectations have been thwarted in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first alternative scenario is modeled after the PC revolution. The development of personal computers revolutionized the business sector and radically altered the nature of clerical work but did not dramatically transform the US economy. A similar path for genAI might mean that industries like software development and media are completely overhauled, but the rest of the economy sees only modest adjustments. In that case, we would expect the period of rapid genAI investment that began in 2023 to continue until 2028 before petering out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second alternative scenario is modeled after the dot-com boom. While interest in internet-centric companies began in 1995, the lion’s share of venture capital investment occurred between the last two quarters of 1999 and the first two quarters of 2021. If AI takes a similar trajectory, the surge in investment that began in late 2023 is now coming to a close. This scenario defies most conventional wisdom but is crucial as a robustness check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-results&quot;&gt;Scenario Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offer some representative top-line results from our model below. Table 1 displays cumulative totals relative to 2022 for each scenario. The three categories of capital spending, compute deployed in total FLOP, and GWs added are the aggregate demand metrics for each of the three enablers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XP1WcWh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Key Metrics in 2030&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three categories of Capital Spending, Compute Deployed in total Flops, and GWs added are our aggregate demand metrics for each of our three enablers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began by projecting recent investment trends using census data from 2014 to 2024 to create coherent scenarios across these three metrics. We then used trends in the decline in GPU prices to estimate the number of GPUs purchased annually consistent with that projection. Finally, we employed trends in power efficiency to calculate the additional power required by our projection of yearly GPU growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave us a mathematical relationship linking investment, GPUs, and power at the macro level. Because individual data centers are rated by their power usage, we were able to use proprietary microdata provided by Semianalysis to calibrate our macro-level relationship to actual fine-grained deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financing&quot;&gt;Financing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capital availability has been robust, with major players such as tech giants, venture capitalists, and governments prioritizing genAI investments. However, some analysts are concerned that genAI’s revenue generation will not be sufficient to sustain the large profit margins technology companies have had to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proprietary analysis of greenfield projects indicates that the six firms currently leading in genAI investment collectively expect growth to continue at this pace in the foreseeable future. This is consistent with public statements made by the CEOs of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to evaluate whether this growth is financially sustainable by treating financing data centers like industrial investments. Datacenter creation involves a sizable industrial investment in physical chips and infrastructure. Interest and depreciation will govern the overall cost of such an investment. Additionally, the power needs of data centers will be operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrying costs are what an industrial firm expects to pay yearly to maintain its physical plant, machines, and other equipment. These types of expenses are dominated by the interest payments on the original construction and the loss of worn-out and obsolete physical structures, machines, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a five-year straight-line depreciation schedule and a financial cost of 300 basis points over the ten-year treasury, we find that, assuming present trends continue, the total carrying cost of capital would rise from roughly $30 billion in 2024 to $430 billion in 2030 in the most optimistic scenarios for genAI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$430 billion is an eye-popping number, but it must be considered in context. In 2023, U.S. businesses spent $5.2 trillion on interest and depreciation alone. The long-term, economy-wide interest and depreciation growth trend is 5 percent per year. Assuming this trend holds, that number will reach $7.3 trillion in 2030, a gain of $2.1 trillion in six years. Adding the $430 billion genAI will cost would increase that change by less than 20 percent to $2.5 trillion, a substantial, but not impossible, boost. Looking at it another way, accommodating the genAI increase would require spending on depreciation and interest to grow by 6.4 percent a year rather than 5 percent. For comparison, that is roughly equal to the growth rate in interest and depreciation from $1.27 trillion in 1993 to $1.97 trillion in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is little indication that the carrying cost of genAI will be an unbearable strain on U.S. capital markets. Although a complete analysis of whether the industry-specific gains from that investment outweigh the costs is well beyond the scope of this paper, we can provide some benchmarks for realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, productivity gains from genAI seem promising in software engineering. This may be because genAI firms tailor their models specifically to be helpful to themselves, which may suggest that tailoring for other industries could produce widespread gains over time. Assuming the current pattern holds, how much productivity gain would software engineering have to see to “pay for” the depreciation and interest on computing facilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that by 2030, the total wage bill of software engineers in the United States will exceed $1 trillion. These estimates are based on historical numbers and do not include the effects of genAI. With this estimated wage bill, genAI would need to increase the productivity of the average software engineer by 42 percent to cover the cost of depreciation and interest. Put simply, if in 2030, genAI could allow U.S. companies to hire 40 percent fewer software engineers and produce the same output, that alone could justify the cost of depreciation and interest for the entire genAI industry. As a last heuristic, if genAI is used primarily for entertainment, and roughly 20 percent of residents in the developed world signed up for a genAI streaming service, then the cost of capital would amount to approximately $160 a month per subscription. GenAI would have to be roughly as appealing as cable television to justify depreciation and interest costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gpu-availability&quot;&gt;GPU Availability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze the potential problems posed by GPU production, we took our baseline capital expenditure estimates and calculated how much chip production would be implied. This required several steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the state-of-the-art GPU is the H100, produced by Nvidia. We define an H100 equivalent as a hypothetical GPU in any given year that produces the same compute as a current H100 using state-of-the-art technology for that year. Thus, we expect the cost of H100 equivalents to decline precipitously over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed of that decline is a matter of contention. Nvidia’s CEO points out that GPU performance nearly doubles every year. However, critics say that this ignores the fact that Nvidia’s chips have become larger over time, thus representing more silicon and higher production costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epoch AI estimates that the cost per FLOP (a technical metric of GPU performance) halves every 2.5 years. However, this estimate does not include the effect of algorithmic efficiency. Essentially, better genAI algorithms reduce the hardware cost of each computation, thus boosting the total computations that any GPU can perform within a given period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Fist and Arnab Datta at the Institute for Progress estimate that performance per dollar triples roughly every two years using hardware and algorithmic computing. This metric is consistent with our field reading and is the basis for our model H100 equivalents. Consequently, we assume that the cost per H100 equivalent will drop by 48 percent per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Semianlaysis and Census Bureau data, we estimate that the GPU’s cost is two to three times the full cost, including facilities, installation, cooling, etc. Moreover, the non-GPU costs depend on how many megawatts (MWs) of power are used. Therefore, in order to arrive at a consistent figure over time, we must determine how watts per H100 equivalent evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, we turned to data from researchers at Northeastern University, which suggest that energy efficiency per square millimeter of silicon falls by 28 percent annually. Since our H100 equivalent has a fixed amount of silicon, we can use 28 percent as our energy efficiency trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using that rate of efficiency decline, we multiply the H100 equivalent per MW times the H100 equivalent price to find the GPU energy cost for a single MW facility. This allows us to match the energy cost for facilities and GPUs in any given year. We then calculate the gross MWs added in any given year as capital spending divided by the price per MW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our baseline capital spending estimates show that gross MWs increased from 3,000 in 2024 to 39,000 in 2030. We use that figure to calculate the number of H100 equivalents, estimating that the wattage per H100 equivalent will have fallen from 1,400 in 2024 to 249 in 2030. Thus, the total H100 equivalents should climb from 2.9 million in 2024 to 159 million in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To validate our estimate, we turn to a brief analysis of semiconductor manufacturing. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has a 90 percent market share in state-of-the-art GPUs. Although there is substantial evidence that other microchip manufacturers are ramping up GPU production capabilities to match the sharply increasing demand, we focus solely on TSMC’s capacity to be conservative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epoch AI projects that TSMC’s total silicon wafer production will reach 300–900 million H100 equivalents by 2030. Based on our projection of capital spending on H100 equivalents, the genAI industry must use between 15 and 50 percent of TSMC’s total capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers are significant but entirely plausible, given that TSMC is a state-of-the-art manufacturer and genAI is a state-of-the-art application. In the worst-case scenario, most of TSMC’s non-AI customers will be priced out and forced to depend on less advanced producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis has one large caveat: It does not account for a severe non-economic bottleneck—specifically, warfare on the island of Taiwan. Identifying the military and diplomatic options available to prevent or mitigate such an outcome is beyond the scope of this paper. Still, it’s important to note that the conclusions of this study depend on the continued supply of Taiwanese semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electric-power&quot;&gt;Electric Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the number of H100 equivalents installed in any given year has been determined, calculating the power requirement is simple. The depreciation of GPUs eliminates the power demand that would have come from worn-out, unusable chips. With the same 5-year straight-line depreciation used above to calculate MWs, the total power requirement rises from 4,000 MW in 2024 to 84,000 MW in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure implies unprecedented growth for the data center industry and a profound change in the overall growth trajectory for the U.S. electric power sector. In 2024, the peak electricity demand in the United States was 745 GW, which has not changed significantly in over a decade. For context, the electricity demand for genAI technology will exceed that of most states: peak demand for New York is about 33 GW (summer 2023), and the all-time peak for CAISO, the California power grid, is 52 GW (September 2022). In 2024, the primary grid operator in Texas, ERCOT, hit its peak production at 85 GW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model’s demand estimates are roughly in line with forecasts generated by other research teams. A 2024 study by LBNL, which takes a detailed “bottom-up” approach estimating the energy usage of GPUs and other IT infrastructure, shows that total U.S. data center demand could grow from a base of roughly 40 GW in 2024 to 74–132 GW by 2028, that is, an increase in demand of 34–92 GWs in four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably for policymakers, this model’s 80 GW production excludes any additional drivers of electric demand growth, such as enterprise, cloud service computation, and crypto mining, each seeing growth, albeit at a slower rate than genAI. Other considerable sources of demand growth include the expansion of electricity-intensive industries—e.g., semiconductor fabrication and battery manufacturing—and the slow but sure increase in electric vehicles. Together, these demand drivers could easily contribute an additional 50-plus GWs of peak load to the grid by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant sources of uncertainty for our projections are whether the electricity supply and the requisite grid infrastructure can be deployed quickly enough to meet this increased demand. The reliability imperative retains ultimate priority in the power sector, so utilities and grid operators across the United States will only connect and serve demand resources they can reliably supply. This energy supply constraint is present in the data center development sector as well, where “speed-to-power”—how fast a site can receive energy—has rapidly emerged as the most critical factor driving siting and investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A host of well-documented factors constrain the rapid scaling of supply in the power sector, including heavily backlogged generation interconnection queues, median wait times for new projects reaching over five years in 2023, persistent hurdles to the crucial high-voltage transmission expansion necessary to support new generation and demand, and the poor permitting environment for infrastructure of all types. In addition, crucial equipment like transformers and gas turbines are increasingly on multi-year backorders, further increasing project delays and costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-1970s, all U.S. electric power sector aspects—commercial, policy, and regulatory—have adapted to slowing growth rates. Over the last two decades, moreover, growth has been effectively zero. However, with the crucial national security loads of genAI at the forefront, the new paradigm of surging electric demand growth requires a new model of ambitious policymaking at both the state and federal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major policy questions include addressing back-logged interconnection queues, accelerating transmission system expansion, streamlining the permitting environment, resolving the thorny issue of gas-electric coordination, and expanding the federal government’s role in unlocking new nuclear construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis suggests that the recent acceleration in genAI growth could continue through 2030, but with significant infrastructure challenges that must be addressed. Examining three potential constraints—financing, hardware availability, and electric power demands—we find that while the first two obstacles appear surmountable, the unprecedented scale of electrical power requirements poses the most serious challenge to sustained growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a financing perspective, even our most aggressive scenario, requiring $2.35 trillion in cumulative capital spending by 2030, appears manageable within U.S. capital markets. The projected annual carrying costs of $430 billion by 2030 would represent less than 20 percent of the expected growth in economy-wide interest and depreciation. Moreover, our analysis suggests that relatively modest productivity gains in the software engineering sector alone could justify these capital costs, with a 42 percent increase in productivity sufficient to cover the industry’s depreciation and interest expenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware constraints, particularly GPU availability, also appear manageable given expected technological advances and manufacturing capacity. Our projections indicate that the genAI industry would require between 15 percent and 50 percent of TSMC’s total manufacturing capacity by 2030—a substantial but feasible share. However, this assessment assumes continued access to Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing, highlighting a critical geopolitical vulnerability in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant challenge to sustained genAI growth lies in meeting its unprecedented electrical power demands. Our model projects that genAI technology will require approximately 84 GW of power by 2030—equivalent to adding another Texas to the U.S. grid. This dramatic increase in power demand, combined with other growing sectors such as electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing, will require a fundamental transformation of the U.S. power sector, which has been oriented toward minimal growth since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical infrastructure bottlenecks threaten to impede this necessary scaling of power capacity. Addressing these challenges will require coordinated policy action at both state and federal levels, including reforms to permitting processes, transmission planning, and nuclear power development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, while the United States possesses the economic capacity to support continued genAI growth through 2030, realizing this potential will require unprecedented coordination between industry and government to modernize and expand critical infrastructure, particularly in the power sector. The success of this endeavor will likely determine whether the United States can maintain its leadership position in genAI development and deployment. Future research should focus on detailed policy frameworks for accelerating power sector transformation while maintaining grid reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第141日審訊，黎智英第49日作供。控方繼續圍繞黎在《國安法》前後有否持續行為盤問，並指稱黎有意圖繼續「照常」營運《蘋果》，包括一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，而不管《國安法》的後果。黎表示：「我們不會自殺，當然不同意！」，強調想《蘋果》合法地營運下去，反問：「我們怎樣可以非法地營運下去？我們不是犯罪公司！」在2020年11月的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎提到勾結外國勢力是大罪，「但是我要繼續及維護我們一直在做的事情，因為有那麼多人敬仰我。如果我退縮，他們也會退縮。」控方質疑黎執意繼續做非法的事情。黎則稱他不認為跟外國人談話構成勾結外國勢力及違法，但是有可能被視為勾結；他堅稱不會做非法的事情，「但是我會在模糊的紅線之中冒險。」法官李運騰問黎為什麼不遠離紅線；黎回應：「如果你想爭取自由的話，你不能令自己遠離紅線。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行向法庭報告，昨日散庭後，當三名法官離開法庭之後，惟被告和雙方律師仍在場的時候，公眾席有人叫喊口號包括：「香港人，加油！」、「黃皮膚香港人，加油！」控方表示，所有人均需要尊重法庭，縱使法官已經不在庭內，但是公眾仍需要保持法庭莊嚴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰遂向庭內人士表示，不要騷擾法庭程序，即使法官已經離開法庭，而律師和被告仍在庭內的時候，旁聽人士不得發表他們的感受或想法；不論法官是否在場，均應該保持「絕對安靜」。杜官並指，任何人若然騷擾法庭程序，都會被要求離開正庭，只允許到庭外位置觀看實時直播，而他們不獲准再進入正庭。若果任何人不遵守法官命令，法庭保安會把有關人士的資料記錄下來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方補充指，警方已辨認出某些涉事人士，將會與法庭保安協商。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認蘋果會以一直以來的方式運作下去-批評控方扭曲&quot;&gt;黎否認《蘋果》會以一直以來的方式運作下去 批評控方扭曲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續盤問，指稱《國安法》生效前後，黎執意持續涉案行為。控方向黎出示網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」謄本，當中黎稱會繼續經營《蘋果》。控方質疑黎言論的背後意思是不管《國安法》的效力，《蘋果》都會「如常（as usual）」運作下去。黎否認，堅稱其意思是繼續營運下去、繼續努力（keep going and fighting），而沒有說過「如常」，因不會非法地營運下去，批評控方：「在這個公正的法庭裡，你這樣扭曲我！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰打斷黎，提醒他控方只是履行職責指出案情，黎只需回答同意或不同意，否則案件需審至明年。黎反指：「但是他（控方）把話塞進我的口中！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰向黎解釋，控方重述黎的說話，並以一種與黎有別的方式說出其案情，其實是一種對黎公平的做法，因控方指出其案情，然後黎不同意，那麼他們可以在結案陳情時處理相關議題；否則在結案陳詞階段，辯方會基於控方從未指出相關案情，而反對提出相關議題，因此這是控方的職責及對黎公平起見的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎聽畢表示明白，並解釋：「我不習慣這種迫害（persecution）。」杜官隨即指正：「這不是迫害（persecution）！」黎其後表示：「對不起⋯⋯我不習慣這些程序。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認國安法後意圖非法地營運下去-我們不會自殺&quot;&gt;黎否認國安法後意圖非法地營運下去 「我們不會自殺」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎出示2020年9月27日的專欄文章〈繼續打壓香港 還是以身報國？〉，當中稱：「二百警察殺入蘋果日報大樓，大肆搜查檔案文件，更是警權侵犯新聞自由；旨在殺雞儆猴，震懾所有傳媒。經此一役，以後傳媒哪還敢不靠邊站？有人說『反中亂港』的壹傳媒仍未被冚檔，依然一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，可見香港還有新聞自由。是的，我們照常運作，但我們每一天都要冒著被拉人封艇的風險。當你要提心吊膽寫東西、講說話時，你還自由嗎？自由是無憂無慮的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從「是的，我們照常運作」一句，可見黎有意圖「照常」營運《蘋果》？黎否認，強調「照常」的是《蘋果》的「運作」，不代表他們會以非法的方式營運。控方引述文章提及：「有人說『反中亂港』的壹傳媒仍未被冚檔，依然一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，可見香港還有新聞自由。」黎則強調是合法地營運下去，反問：「我們怎樣可以非法地營運下去？我們不是犯罪公司！」黎又指，因《國安法》生效後，過往的營運方式變成不合法，因此沒有人會以非法的方式經營下去，「誰人可以用非法的方式繼續經營？告訴我！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章稱：「當你要提心吊膽寫東西、講說話時，你還自由嗎？自由是無憂無慮的」，質疑《國安法》並非黎的關注。黎堅稱《國安法》是他們的關注，但是他們不能百份百肯定他們做的事情會否觸犯《國安法》，因紅線模糊。他又指，在《國安法》之下總是有風險，因他們不會知道他們使用的哪一個字眼是不合法，重申紅線不清晰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提及「冒著被拉人封艇的風險」，控方指出黎有意圖繼續「照常」營運《蘋果》，包括一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，而不管《國安法》的後果。黎稱：「這會是自殺式的事情。」控方追問黎同意還是不同意？黎表示：「我們不會自殺，當然不同意！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰引述文章稱警方「悍然修改」《警察通例》中「傳媒代表」的定義，做法明顯違憲，「可是違憲又怎樣？警權大曬呀！吹咩！」杜官指黎的說法基於錯誤的事實，加上警方乃基於搜查令而搜查壹傳媒大樓，惟黎未有在文章提及這事實，質疑黎有意向讀者呈現警方違憲和「警權大曬」等形象。黎否認這是他的意圖，反稱只是陳述他所見到的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2020年8月10日，警方搜查蘋果日報大樓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方補充指，這是另一個例子，顯示黎作出毫無事實基礎的指控。黎否認沒有基礎，並稱《蘋果》是首個被警方搜查的傳媒。此時法官李運騰表示，記憶中曾發生過一次事件，當時《星島》被廉政公署搜查，因此《蘋果》並非第一間被搜查的傳媒。黎則稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認明知違法但有意繼續做相同的事情不要以為我是白痴&quot;&gt;黎否認明知違法但有意繼續做相同的事情：「不要以為我是白痴！」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎於2020年8月10日首次被捕。他在同年10月6日的 Live Chat 節目中，表示會繼續做同樣的事情。控方指黎再一次重申他會做同樣的事情。黎則回應，顯然沒有人會明知而繼續做非法的事情，因這是荒謬的。控方聞言指這不是荒謬。黎堅稱沒有人會明知一件事非法而繼續做同樣的事情，反問：「你覺得我是瘋狂的嗎？」、「有沒有任何人不理智到這樣做？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎明知違法但有意圖繼續做相同的事情。黎否認，「不要以為我是傻子！不要以為我是白痴！」他又稱若然他繼續做明知非法的事情會是瘋狂的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不會犯法但會冒險-官問為何不遠離紅線&quot;&gt;黎稱不會犯法但會冒險 官問：為何不遠離紅線？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月20日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎提到勾結外國勢力是大罪，「但是我要繼續及維護我們一直在做的事情，因為有那麼多人敬仰我。如果我退縮，他們也會退縮。」控方質疑黎執意繼續做非法的事情。黎則稱他不認為跟外國人談話是勾結外國勢力及違法，但是認為有相關風險，因為有可能被視為勾結，「所有事情都是有可能」、「你永遠不知道他們怎樣詮釋勾結罪。」他又指紅線是模糊，但是他知道有一些清晰的界線，他不會明知而做非法的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，黎知道跟外國人談話有風險，但是會冒險？因黎在節目中稱因為很多人敬仰他，所以他繼續一直在做的事情，並且不會退縮。黎則稱他不會做非法的事情，「但是我會在模糊的紅線之中冒險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，既然黎知道有風險的話，「為什麼你不令自己遠離紅線？」黎回應：「如果你想爭取自由的話，你不能令自己遠離紅線。」李官問，黎準備冒險？黎同意，但強調不是做犯法的事情，而是冒險，又指如果他做犯法的事情便會是很愚蠢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問黎所做的事是否正如中文詞語「擦邊球」？黎同意當時是在「擦邊球」。控方問，所以在《國安法》之後，黎繼續冒險？黎同意，但重申：「我不能排除紅線的含糊性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方展示國安法後twitter帖文-黎稱惡行將有後果&quot;&gt;控方展示國安法後Twitter帖文 黎稱惡行將有後果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎展示數個《國安法》生效之後發表的 Twitter 帖文，其中2020年7月23日帖文談及美國勒令關閉侯斯頓（Houston）的中國領事館，並稱：「Trump is taking actions through different measures, while Biden can only make claims. Action is louder than words!（特朗普透過不同措施來作出行動，然而拜登只光說不做。行動勝千言萬語！）」控方質疑，縱使《國安法》生效後，黎持續請求制裁，而不如他早前所稱的謹慎。黎稱他只是談論已經發生的事情。控方續指，黎想制裁措施繼續。黎否認這樣說過，帖文沒有任何字眼有這種暗示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月23日帖文，轉載《蘋果》英文版新聞報導〈Firms with Hong Kong ties face US sanctions, linked to human rights abuses in Xinjiang（有香港聯繫的企業面臨美國制裁 扣連在新疆發生的人權侵犯）〉，並說：「The most effective way to prevent human rights violations is to hold people who do the heinous act personally accountable.（防止人權侵犯的最有效方法，是使作出劣行的人替其個人負責任。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，2020年9月17日的帖文，談及新民黨立法會議員葉劉淑儀撤走美國資產，並稱：「當美國人及全個自由世界都在聯成一線和實行制裁，中共的同謀無處可逃，而他們的資產也無處隱藏。他們迫害香港人的惡行將會有後果。（When American and the rest of the free world are aligned with and put in place sanctions. CCP’s accomplices have nowhere to turn, and their assets have nowhere to hide. Their evil deeds persecuting of HKers will have consequences.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎從沒有要求將上述帖文從其帳戶下架？黎確認沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認制裁在某程度上給予希望&quot;&gt;黎否認制裁在某程度上給予希望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2020年11月29日，黎發表專欄文章〈天下圍中 拜登騎虎難下〉，當中稱：「川普取消香港的特殊貿易地位⋯⋯此外又制裁某些協助中共鎮壓港人的官員，要他們承受個人損失，令其他有可能參與鎮壓的官員多一重顧慮，對中共肆意鎮壓港人或多或少有個牽制作用，令為國安法蹂躪喘不過氣來的港人感到有人為我們出氣而寄存希望。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎透過文章，來強調制裁可以令官員有多一重顧慮及帶來牽制作用，是不是在請求外國制裁能夠繼續？黎強調只是陳述已經發生了的事情，以及「感到有人為我們出氣而寄存希望」。控方追問，黎認為制裁是希望？黎僅稱：「希望是希望」，重申只是提及已發生了的事情。控方又問，黎認為制裁在某程度上給予他希望嗎？黎否認，反指是因為見到有人為他們站起來，所以給他帶來希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter帖文問選舉主任應負責任嗎-黎否認請求制裁&quot;&gt;Twitter帖文問選舉主任應負責任嗎？ 黎否認請求制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月7日，美國財政部宣佈制裁11名侵犯人權及損害香港自治的中港官員，包括時任特首林鄭月娥。同日黎向「徒弟」李兆富傳送訊息：「But how about those election PRO (主任)? Should they be personally responsible for DQ candidates for political reasons?」黎庭上稱，當時只是詢問李，選舉主任是否已被制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示8月8日的 Twitter 帖文：「那些取消候選人資格的選舉主任又如何呢？他們應該在個人方面為這些決定負責任嗎？（How about those election officers (選舉主任) who disqualified #DQ the candidate nominations? Should they be personally responsible for making the decisions?）」控方指帖文顯示黎在《國安法》生效後，繼續請求外國制裁。黎不同意，又稱只是說選舉主任應該負責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認鼓吹對中國實施科技制裁&quot;&gt;黎否認鼓吹對中國實施科技制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示接著圍繞黎有否鼓吹科技制裁或禁運提問。2020年9月24日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎指若果中國被制裁的話，將難以研發製造晶片的技術，對科技和經濟造成打擊，屆時台灣在製造半導體的角色便會變得更重要，成為「亞洲版矽谷（Asia Silicon Valley）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月1日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，黎形容外國跟隨美國的制裁措施，禁止進口晶片科技到中國，是「做了正確的事情」。控方質疑黎認為向中國實施科技禁運是「正確的事情」。黎稱僅評論已經發生的事情。控方又問黎希望相關措施能夠持續嗎？黎多次強調自己沒有沒有資格想或不想美國做任何事。在追問下，黎稱自己沒有想過這個問題。控方指出，黎有意圖或希望美國對中國實施科技制裁。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年10月11日黎的專欄文章〈台灣也要感謝黨〉，當中提到：「美國對中國的高科技和晶片封鎖，也將牽制西方陣營和日本澳洲等國家，封鎖他們出口高科技和晶片到中國。這將大大打擊中國經濟發展和科技研發。含有晶片和外國科技零件配合的產品將停產，這不僅影響經濟发展，軍事和對人民電子監控的發展也會局部停頓。」黎否認在文章中提倡科技制裁，強調只是說出當時狀況和作出分析。黎並否認提倡科技制裁要持續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

What are the president’s options for reducing U.S. oil prices?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his second term began on January 20, 2025, President Trump has clearly signaled a desire for lower oil prices. Executive orders, including “Unleashing American Energy,” as well as his remarks to the Davos World Economic Forum audience on January 23, outline Trump’s case for bringing down the price of oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the obvious direct advantage of reducing costs for consumers and businesses, Trump has associated the benefits of lower energy prices with two strategic priorities: first, as an instrument for taming inflation. Trump believes that a lower energy price environment will pave the way for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates and stimulate economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Trump has asserted that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the war in Ukraine, ostensibly because Moscow would be deprived of oil export revenues sufficient to sustain its war effort. This reason, however, may have been superseded by recent events, including a February 12 phone call between Trump and Putin, a bilateral meeting of advisors in Riyadh on February 18, and Trump’s February 24 prediction that the war could end within a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-oil-price-does-trump-prefer&quot;&gt;What Oil Price Does Trump Prefer?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an October 21, 2024, campaign rally in Greenville, NC, Trump said of U.S. energy prices, “We’re going to get your prices down so low. We’re going to get them down 50 percent.” This may have included a bit of election campaign hyperbole, seeing as crude oil and gasoline prices that day were $71 per barrel and $3.14 per gallon, respectively, implying targets of $36 per barrel and $1.57 per gallon were the 50 percent reduction applied literally to the price of oil. Moreover, Trump was speaking about energy prices in general, not crude oil and gasoline per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is surely mindful that oil prices were substantially lower during his first administration than those that prevailed both before and after. The price of benchmark US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged just $58 per barrel during Trump’s first term (excluding 2020).1 This was $17 (or 24 percent) lower than the $70 per barrel that prevailed during Obama’s second term (2013–16), and $26 (33 percent) lower than the $79 average price during the Biden administration (2021–24).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, the $58 average price of WTI crude oil coincided with an annual inflation rate of just 2.1 percent and an annual federal funds interest rate of 1.5 percent. It is reasonable, then, to assume Trump favors a WTI price below $60 in hopes of replicating those favorable macroeconomic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If $60 constitutes Trump’s upper limit, what about the lower boundary? Here the outlier year of 2020 is instructive, as oil prices apparently fell too low for even Trump’s preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, global oil demand plunged an astounding ten percent as economic activity sharply retreated due to worldwide pandemic shutdowns. At the same time, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers (OPEC+) failed to agree on oil supply targets, effectively ending its March ministerial meeting with a “free for all” that saw Saudi Arabia and Russia ramp up output in a short-lived market share war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As oil prices nosedived (WTI futures famously fell below $0 for the first time ever on April 20, 2020), US oil companies faced the prospect of severe losses and appealed for political intervention to increase oil prices. Trump is credited with brokering a deal between Riyadh and Moscow to restore production limits; the arrangement stanched the price collapse and paved the way for a rebound. Prices came back to $40 in April 2020 and held there for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current oil price in the $70 range clearly too high and early 2020s prices below $40 too low, it can be inferred that Trump prefers WTI to range from $40 to $60 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-can-reduce-oil-prices&quot;&gt;Who Can Reduce Oil Prices?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump is looking to two sources of potential supply increases in his campaign to drive oil prices lower: the U.S. oil industry and the OPEC+ coalition. He has so far taken very different approaches toward these two audiences: aggressively slashing regulations to incentivize domestic production increases, and publicly castigating OPEC+ for withholding supply from the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unleashing-us-energy-resources&quot;&gt;Unleashing U.S. Energy Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s preliminary executive orders on energy read like a wish list for the U.S. oil patch. Nearly all of the industry’s longstanding policy asks are included: rolling back costly oilfield emission controls, liberalizing permit applications for drilling on federal lands and in offshore waters, a commitment to step up oil and gas lease sales, and reopening the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to exploration activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these measures are not likely to move the needle on U.S. oil and gas production anytime soon. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts U.S. crude oil will grow just 520 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) (4 percent) during the next two years, through 2026. Although this forecast was made before the executive orders were published, there is little sign that the U.S. exploration and production (E&amp;amp;P) industry is eager to exploit the aforementioned opportunities. Companies are not discussing and publicizing plans for significantly expanding E&amp;amp;P activities in Alaska or the Outer Continental Shelf. And if they did pursue new E&amp;amp;P opportunities in these areas, it would be years before new production affected global balances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1bOPo85.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: U.S. Crude Oil Growth Trajectory.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Short Term Energy Outlook, February 2025, Table 3D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the objective is to return U.S crude oil production to high single-digit percent annual growth as seen in 2022–23, there is cause for pessimism. Those years were outliers unlikely to be repeated, primarily for geological reasons but also because of capital investment constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, U.S. production was still rebounding from the low levels sustained during the pandemic downturn. The extraordinary 1 million barrel per day (mb/d) (8.6 percent) surge in U.S. oil production in 2023 was a one-off phenomenon that happened largely because privately held drillers drastically increased spending to gussy up their production profiles and enhance their attractiveness as acquisition targets. The capital they invested that year was obtained through windfall earnings from unusually high prices ($80 per barrel average) during the “Russia crisis” year of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late 2023, the windfall profits had been spent, and much of the easy-to-access oil reserves had been exploited. The Permian Basin emerged as the only major remaining growth engine of U.S. supply, with other previously prolific shale plays like North Dakota’s Bakken and South Texas’s Eagle Ford well below their peak output levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With reduced prospects for profitability compared to shale’s heyday in the 2010s, the U.S. oil patch moved toward consolidation, with major deals announced in late 2023 by ExxonMobil to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources and by Chevron to acquire Hess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ep-investors-demand-capital-discipline&quot;&gt;E&amp;amp;P Investors Demand Capital Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s strategy posits that overturning federal government regulations facing the oil and gas industry and expediting drilling permits will incentivize operating companies to surge output. To wit, the “Unleashing” executive order asserts that “burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of” U.S. energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumption downplays the most important above-ground (non-geological) feature of today’s U.S. oil industry: Wall Street, not government regulation, is the limiting factor for U.S. supply growth. Investor mandates, informed by supply-demand realities, have not allowed E&amp;amp;P companies to “drill baby drill” themselves into a supply overhang and reduced profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, U.S. E&amp;amp;P companies do not share Trump’s desire for lower oil and gas prices, which would negatively impact their financial performance. A recent survey conducted by the Dallas Branch of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank found that oil companies are expecting $71 per barrel WTI by the end of 2025 and $74 per barrel by the end of 2026. The branch’s Q1 2024 survey on the breakeven cost of U.S. oil production identified an average $64 per barrel and for some wells as high as $70—well above the $50 range that prevailed during the first Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were WTI to spend significant time in the $50 range, E&amp;amp;P profits would deteriorate and operators would further reduce capital expenditures on drilling and fracking new wells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil companies are mindful that domestic oil demand growth is barely treading water. EIA sees it slowing to 250 kb/d (1 percent) this year and to virtually zero in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ample appetite for U.S. crudes exists overseas, exports are not likely to materially exceed 5.5 mb/d, the current record-high level, unless projections for multiyear trade opportunities lead to investments in building new export facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With limited opportunities to expand crude marketing to domestic and international customers, operators are unlikely to materially increase production—at least according to the conventional playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-the-equation&quot;&gt;Changing the Equation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Trump’s aggressive deregulation fail to boost supply and lower prices, there are several cards he could play to shake up the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offer an oil and gas production tax credit.&lt;/strong&gt; The February 14, 2025, executive order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council obliquely references “incentives to attract and retain private sector energy-production investments.” A production tax credit (PTC) for hydrocarbons could potentially serve as one such novel incentive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;PTCs are an established tool in the energy policy toolkit, used in recent years to boost production of energy from renewable sources like wind and solar projects. Trump could potentially use a new tax credit for traditional hydrocarbons to entice E&amp;amp;P companies to ramp oil and gas output beyond the level justified by supply and demand, as the financial benefit of reducing a company’s tax burden could potentially enable it to maintain expected shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One possible advantage of an oil and gas PTC would be to incentivize individual company performance over macro oil market stewardship. Presently, companies’ desire to avoid oversupplying the market is well aligned with their shareholders’ interests to distribute free cash flow instead of investing in drilling programs (more than already required by shale’s aggressive decline rates).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An oil and gas PTC could potentially decouple these elements—an individual company might be willing to overlook the macro supply consequences of ramping up production if the government reduces its tax burden enough to deliver a net financial improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In the short term, this could increase competition among E&amp;amp;P firms to more aggressively market their oil and succeed in driving prices lower. Longer term, however, the laws of supply and demand will prevail, and with more supply offered into a market with limited demand, prices will (all else equal) eventually fall below breakeven prices, causing drillers to reduce output and prices to rebound.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggressively lobby drillers to join the supply-increase bandwagon.&lt;/strong&gt; While Trump and the oil and gas industry would seem to be the closest of allies, that could change if he comes to see drillers as impeding his economic plans. This was potentially foreshadowed by the Greenville campaign remarks, in which Trump said of oil and gas companies, “If they drill themselves out of business, I don’t give a damn.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Trump has previously berated corporate leaders who failed to comply with his policy prerogatives; the public lambasting of General Motors, Harley-Davidson, and Carrier come to mind, although the track record of success in those campaigns (judged by having nudged those companies into compliance) was mixed at best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit or ban oil exports.&lt;/strong&gt; This option would be highly ironic for the U.S. oil industry that spent much of the last four years concerned that the Biden administration might impose restrictions on exports in an effort to reduce prices. Although the concept was flawed and prone to backfiring, the motivation to bring down high prices was understandable as crude oil had spiked above $120 per barrel and national gasoline pump prices hit $5.10 per gallon in June 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Throttling or halting U.S. refined product exports would immediately create an overhang of gasoline, diesel, and similar fuels in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, as the transportation modes to distribute those fuels to other parts of the country (pipeline, ship) are limited (which is why international export markets are so important for U.S. refiners and the E&amp;amp;P operators that supply them with crude oil). Refiners would respond by slashing refinery operations, causing producers to cut back on crude oil output. Any domestic fuel price reduction, which would be centered in the Gulf Coast, would therefore be short lived.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A similar dynamic would occur if crude exports were limited or banned. U.S. operators, shellshocked by the cutoff of their international customers that purchase 30 percent (4 mb/d) of total U.S. crude output, would immediately curtail output. In a severe overhang dynamic, some E&amp;amp;P companies would go out of business, manifesting Trump’s aforementioned remark from the October 21 campaign rally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pressuring-opec-plus-to-ramp-up-production&quot;&gt;Pressuring OPEC-Plus to Ramp Up Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his January 23, 2025, remarks to the audience at Davos, Trump chastised Saudi Arabia and OPEC for failing to increase oil supply and urged it to change course:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You got to bring it down, which, frankly, I’m surprised they didn’t do before the election. That didn’t show a lot of love by them not doing it. I was a little surprised by that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But OPEC+ does not want lower oil prices. It has taken a very conservative stance on oil supply for more than two years, deferring an initiative to increase output multiple times since it was first announced in summer 2024 on account of weaker-than-expected demand. Its current plan calls for very small supply increases of about 120 kb/d per month beginning in April 2025 and lasting for 18 months, assuming demand and inventories continue signaling a need for extra volumes. For its part, Saudi Arabia has gone to great lengths to maintain unity within the OPEC+ coalition, and Riyadh has absorbed an outsized sacrifice in market share to hold back supply in support of stable prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s first choice to get more oil from the producer group is probably cutting one or more deals that incentivize Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the UAE to significantly increase output, despite this being adverse to U.S. drillers’ interests and despite the risk of a supply glut developing amid ongoing demand weakness in China. This could involve stepped up arms transactions and defense arrangements in the case of the Gulf states, and potentially even U.S. acquiescence to security terms in Europe that are favorable to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If additional oil supplies are not forthcoming, Trump could turn more adversarial toward Saudi Arabia and other OPEC+ members. This could take the form of threats to reduce arms provisions and military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further up the “escalation ladder” would be moving the longstanding but dormant No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (“NOPEC”) legislation that characterizes OPEC as a cartel and paves the way for antitrust litigation. The likelihood of reciprocal moves by Saudi Arabia and other members against the United States has loomed over this initiative since its inception and may deter implementation in this case too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-trump-priorities-are-at-odds-with-lower-prices&quot;&gt;Other Trump Priorities Are at Odds with Lower Prices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Trump’s signaled desire for lower oil prices is unmistakable, other related policy initiatives are neutral-to-bullish for oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enacting tougher sanctions on certain exporting countries, particularly Iran but potentially also Russia, Venezuela, and Iraq.&lt;/strong&gt; New sanctions and stricter enforcement of existing sanctions will remove some barrels from the market and tighten supply-demand balances—a conundrum recently experienced by the outgoing Biden administration. Even the first Trump administration showed leniency on sanctions against Iran with consideration to the inevitable market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump has declared an intention to fully refill the reserve, which is approximately half full at around 350 million barrels today. There are both budgetary impediments (no money left for new purchases) and policy considerations (more sales are scheduled for 2026–31 as mandated by bipartisan agreement), but Trump can surely overcome these headwinds by lobbying the Republican-controlled Congress. The price effect of removing barrels from the commercial market (available to refineries) and placing them into the reserve would be bullish—working against Trump’s desire for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As for setting expectations for a fast refill, the SPR’s “plumbing” is designed for very fast drawdowns (4.1 mb/d) but only slow fill rates. Theoretical fill capacity is 785 kb/d; the real rate is less because of ongoing maintenance and the status of each salt cavern at the four facilities. In round numbers, filling the reserve to its 714-million-barrel authorized maximum would likely take 18–27 months. Reducing or canceling the congressionally mandated sales could expedite the fill rate; if the sales remain on track the full refill would take longer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Levying tariffs on Mexico and Canada.&lt;/strong&gt; Trump’s threatened tariffs on energy from Mexico and Canada are slated to take effect on March 4, 2025. Tariffs on oil imports would increase costs for U.S. refiners; these costs will in turn be passed on to businesses and consumers in the form of higher fuel prices. Many economists expect tariffs to raise prices generally in the United States, a headwind in the struggle to tame inflation and a drag on overall GDP. As oil demand turns lower with overall economic activity, oil prices may well follow—but not in a way likely to satisfy Trump and his constituents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-an-imposed-settlement-in-ukraine-reduce-oil-prices&quot;&gt;Does An Imposed Settlement in Ukraine Reduce Oil Prices?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s stance on Russia has changed dramatically during his first month in office. In his remarks to the Davos audience in January, Trump said of oil prices, “If the price came down, the Russia-Ukraine war would end immediately. Right now, the price is high enough that that war will continue.” Trump’s remarks implied that only a substantial reduction in Moscow’s oil revenues would cause Putin sufficient pain to compel him to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 18, Trump had apparently sided with Putin; immediately after his top advisors met their Russian counterparts in Riyadh, Trump blamed Ukraine for initiating the war and chided Kyiv for not cutting a deal to end it sooner. This new stance seems inconsistent with the previously declared need to reduce oil prices to force an end to the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two policies to watch in reaction to the initiatives to force a Ukraine ceasefire are the ban on Russian oil imports and the cap on Russian oil sales, imposed respectively by the European Union and the G7. Unless an arrangement to end the fighting is endorsed by key European powers, both measures are likely to remain in force and maintain the status quo for Russian oil exports: its crude oil headed only to India and China, significant discounts for Russian oil cargoes, and full employment of the shadow fleet and other instruments used to evade the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日法官杜麗冰指黎是中國人時，他反駁稱自己是香港人。今天甫開庭，黎智英主動表示，要求法庭容許他更正昨日證供，他澄清自己並非內地的中國人（a Mainland Chinese），而是香港的中國人（a Hong Kong Chinese），這與他早前的證供一致，即是：「我愛中國作為我的國家，但不是作為一個政府。（I love China as my country but not as a state.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎從新聞得悉若李文亮事件-控方質疑黎無法知道新聞是否真確&quot;&gt;黎：從新聞得悉若李文亮事件 控方質疑黎無法知道新聞是否真確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，在2020年11月29日的網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，黎稱新冠病毒之所以擴散至全球，是因為中國沒有言論自由。黎在庭上稱，他有在節目中解釋理由，指若然中國容許言論自由，當醫生李文亮最初發現病毒時，可以在社交媒體通報的話，那麼人們便可以較警覺，政府也可以從病毒源頭控制疫情，而新冠肺炎災難便得以避免。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎怎樣知道上述事件？黎稱新聞有報導。控方質疑黎無法知道新聞所述是否真確？黎指很多媒體都有報導，他認為這是真確。控方質疑，這是黎的臆測。黎稱這是「具知識基礎的臆測（educated supposition）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎從新聞得悉相關資訊，而未有查核事實，黎純粹依賴傳媒。黎確認，但同時強調傳媒有一套查核事實的制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎有意著節目言論煽動對中央政府的憎恨。黎回應，他想說的是言論自由對於社會的透明度是非常重要。控方指這只是黎的個人意見。黎反駁這是很多人的意見，包括他本人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目稱某些人叫停螞蟻集團上市反映內地人治-控方質疑黎未有查核事實&quot;&gt;黎節目稱「某些人」叫停螞蟻集團上市反映內地「人治」 控方質疑黎未有查核事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中提及中國內地的螞蟻集團，擬於2020年10月在上海和香港交易所招股上市，但是在兩天之前突然撤回上市計劃。黎稱事件反映內地是「人治」而非「法治」，因為所有事情都應該經過立法和司法程序，然而是次僅因為「某些人（somebody）」叫停，而導致上市最終「剎停」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱是從新聞得悉有關事件，控方質疑黎未有自行做事實查核。黎反駁：「如果所有人讀報紙的時候都要查核事實，那麼沒有人會閱讀報紙，因為這樣太花時間了。」控方問黎，是否認為每份報紙都會做事實查核？黎同意，因為每份報紙發表新聞報導之前，都需要從兩個或以上的消息來源核實。控方指這只是黎的猜測。黎繼續反駁：「這是傳媒的守則。」法官杜麗冰指：「但不是所有人都遵守規則。」黎指若然不遵守傳媒守則的話，他們便會犯錯及需要倒閉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又追問，所以黎是不知道叫停上市的「某些人」是誰？黎重申其節目言論來自新聞報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎稱中國當局用科技監控人民屬猜測&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎稱中國當局用科技監控人民屬猜測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黎在節目形容前特首林鄭月娥是「魔鬼」。黎確認，並強調：「這是我的意見。」控方指，黎在網上直播節目作出這番公開言論，不是有意圖引起觀眾對特區官員和政府的不滿嗎？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目形容習近平是史上最強大的獨裁者，比毛澤東更強大，因毛的時代經濟不如現在那般強大，也還未有監控人民的科技。黎庭上指：「這是事實。」，因現時當局可以透過監控系統和人民的 iPhone 等，便可追蹤到人民身處位置及與誰人一起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑這是黎的猜測？黎說：「這不是猜測，你可以查看中國發生什麼事。」控方問，黎有什麼事實基礎？黎稱新聞報導。控方再度質疑黎未有自行查核有關事實。黎反問他怎樣自行查核事實？控方指黎透過沒有事實根據的批評，意圖挑起人們反政府情緒，以及意圖煽惑讀者的恐懼。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎透過11月29日這一集節目，意圖引起觀眾憎恨政府、激使別人以非法手段改變現有合法制度及慫使他人不守法等。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱批評是要求改善和修正的一種方式&quot;&gt;黎稱批評是要求改善和修正的一種方式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，黎的節目沒有任何言論是旨在指出政府錯處及不足，以求改善施政。黎稱：「我認為批評是要求改善和修正的一種方式。」控方則反駁，黎的批評是有意煽惑仇恨。黎回應：「批評是為了當局察覺我們的想法，而這對於改革是有需要的。」控方質疑黎僅作出個人陳述，針對林鄭作出攻擊。黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後問到，若然黎的說法是批評政府，為什麼對前特首作出人身攻擊，而不是評論她的施政表現？黎稱：「因為她的表現已反映了她是怎樣的人。（Because her performance came from her, is what she was.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;霍士新聞主持人稱會將黎受訪片段傳送給特朗普&quot;&gt;《霍士新聞》主持人稱會將黎受訪片段傳送給特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著圍繞黎在《國安法》生效前後，有否持續其行為的議題。有關《國安法》生效之前的時段，控方提及黎於2020年5月26日接受《霍士新聞》訪問時，當節目主持人 Maria Bartiromo 問黎，美國可以怎樣改變中國，黎回答稱美國應該向中國官員實施制裁、凍結銀行帳戶，以及停止向中國輸出技術等。黎確認當時提倡制裁，並強調當時《國安法》並未生效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著出示黎與 Maria Bartiromo 之間的訊息對話，Maria 向黎稱她會將該次訪問片段，傳送給時任美國總統特朗普。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎確認在-twitter-帖文呼籲外國實施更強硬的制裁&quot;&gt;黎確認在 Twitter 帖文呼籲外國實施更強硬的制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方盤問下，黎確認他於2019年6月9日在史丹福大學胡佛學院的公開講座中呼籲外國制裁。控方接著展示2020年6月11日的 Twitter 帖文，當中上載《蘋果》報紙標題「警設國安部門 生效首天即執法」，並稱：「中共似乎減弱了《國安法》。不要被愚弄。這只是停止制裁的暴怒，使他們失去聲勢，以及後來中共再次逼迫我們的時候不能恢復聲勢。中共懼怕制裁，而這是一個好理由去實施更強硬的制裁。」控方問黎是否在帖文中呼籲外國實施更強硬的制裁？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月13日的 Twitter 帖文，當中黎稱線上對話程式 ZOOM 會遵從中國當局要求，將用戶資料交給中國當局，「中共去得太盡（CCP is going too far.）」，美國可以向出賣用戶私隱、與中共有聯繫的企業，以制裁來報復。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指帖文是「徒弟」李兆富所撰寫，但是他會對帖文負責。控方指，帖文提及的事件是發生在美國，與《國安法》沒有任何關係。黎則認為與《國安法》有關係，「《國安法》將來臨，所有人都很緊張，因此在這個壓力底下，李兆富寫了這帖文。」控方追問，帖文談及的事件與《國安法》無關，但是黎依然要求美國去「報復」？黎同意，指李兆富這樣寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指國安法後-黎從沒要求將twitter帖文及外媒訪問下架&quot;&gt;控方指國安法後 黎從沒要求將Twitter帖文及外媒訪問下架&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示多個《國安法》前發布的 Twitter 帖文，黎稱部份帖文非出自他手筆，而是由李兆富撰寫。被問到是否同意帖文內容，黎稱：「我沒有權不同意，因為我需要負責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則反駁指，「沒有權不同意」的意思是黎對 Twitter 帳戶沒有控制權；「但是你有權，因為這是你的 Twitter 帳戶！」杜官又指黎回覆李兆富的訊息指帖文內容「很棒（Great）」。黎重申：「我沒有權不同意，因為我要同意，因為我要負責任。」杜官批評，合理的人不會理解黎的答案，「這是不合理的！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，直至6月30日，即《國安法》生效之前，黎有呼籲外國針對中國及香港特區實施制裁和敵對行動。黎同意有呼籲制裁，但堅稱沒有呼籲敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，《國安法》生效之後，黎從沒要求將涉及制裁的 Twitter 帖文，從其帳戶下架。黎確認未曾要求下架，但強調該些帖文是《國安法》之前發布，他沒有想過是不合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎從沒要求外媒將其訪問片段下架，包括《霍士新聞》、《自由亞洲電台》和胡佛學院。黎同樣表示，該些訪問是《國安法》之前進行，他未曾想過是不合法，所以認為沒有需要要求下架。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱若擔心便不能做任何事情或講任何說話&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱若擔心便不能做任何事情或講任何說話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年7月1日接受《霍士新聞》訪問，主持人 Maria Bartiromo 問黎智英，《國安法》生效之後會否擔心被捕，黎則表示：「我不擔心，因為我不能擔心，如果我擔心，就不能做任何事情或講任何說話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當時黎的意圖是繼續做任何他一直做的事情及說他一直說的話，而無視《國安法》的後果。黎不同意，因為如果是這樣的話，他理應會非常擔心。他又稱，他會合法地繼續做，而不是非法地做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎出示他與 Maria Bartiromo 之間的訊息對話。黎確認他將接受外媒訪問，視為向美國人交流想法及向美國尋求援助的方式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國官員經mark-simon提出要求會見陳日君樞機&quot;&gt;美國官員經Mark Simon提出要求會見陳日君樞機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 於7月2日的訊息，指時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧、其助手 Mary Kissel 及時任美國司法部長觀看了《霍士新聞》的訪問，並且正在留意黎。Mark Simon 亦表示：「他們有一個重要的請求，來自上級，他們想見樞機（陳日君）。他是一個可以影響跨黨派的人物。」，並問黎樞機是否能夠外遊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FJHpP1i.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 天主教香港教區榮休主教 陳日君樞機&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這訊息是否另一個例子證明 Mark Simon 向黎傳達美國政府的內部消息？黎則稱這些不是內部消息，而且《霍士新聞》可以公開在網上觀看。法官杜麗冰則指，Mark Simon 轉述美國官員與樞機對話的重要性，不是一種內部消息嗎？黎則堅稱這只是一個經 Mark Simon 作出的請求，不論它重要與否，都是屬於「請求」而非「內部消息」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭則指，Mark Simon 告訴黎，當時至少有三名美國官員觀看過黎的訪問片段。黎同意，但是不代表他們其後有觀看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎文章沒叫人不要觸犯國安法-黎反問這是我的責任嗎&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎文章沒叫人不要觸犯國安法 黎反問：這是我的責任嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月5日黎的專欄文章〈飛翔吧 良知的脊樑在撐著〉，當中稱：「有心人說，快點走，勾結外國勢力是叛國罪，可以是槍斃的啊！我說，我不走，煮到來就食，走了我還怎能做人。很久前已決定不讓恐懼震懾我，否則每說一句話，每做一件事都忌諱後果，我還可以說什麼，還可以做啥事，還可以抬起頭做人嗎！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上確認他沒有被《國安法》嚇怕。控方指黎不害怕《國安法》帶來的後果？黎表示：「我對《國安法》的嚴重後果有所警覺，但是我不感到害怕。」控方追問，黎會繼續做一直做的事情？黎回答：「合法地做，但不會以非法的形式繼續。」控方問，如果某人的行為是合法，那麼在《國安法》生效後也不會有後果。黎表示：「這個⋯⋯你永遠不知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎的回答是什麼意思。黎解釋，他不會做犯法的事情，但是他會繼續做任何他要做的事情，說任何他要說的話，只要是合法的方式；但是《國安法》的紅線模糊，沒有清晰的界線，即使他做的事情是合法，也可能有後果。控方問黎不是看過《國安法》條文嗎？黎稱這不代表他清楚明白紅線在哪裡，因為它是含糊（opaque）和不清晰。控方指黎無視《國安法》的後果。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，沒有一篇黎撰寫的文章是叫人們不要觸犯《國安法》？黎反問：「要這樣做，是我的責任嗎？我認為所有人都知道不要觸犯《國安法》！我應該跟他們說『不要犯罪！不要犯罪！』嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎不擔心《國安法》，所以會繼續做一直以來做的事情。黎否認這樣說過，反稱他不擔心是因為他所做的事情不會犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目稱會依然走相同的路-否認不惜觸犯國安法&quot;&gt;黎節目稱會依然走相同的路 否認不惜觸犯國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年8月18日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，黎在節目中稱回望過去，「我會依然做相同的事情？我會依然走相同的路嗎？我幾乎立即有頭緒，是的，我會，因為這是我的個性。」控方指，上述言論反映即使會觸犯《國安法》也好，黎都會繼續做他一直以來做的事情。黎不同意，強調這番言論是回望過去，他依然會做相同的事，而非展望未來。黎一度反問控方：「我說回望過去，你理解英文嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s key findings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As NATO’s European air forces attempt to transition towards a primary focus on the threat from Russia, and the need to have credible capability in that high-threat, high-intensity context, most are likely to struggle to do so without reducing the breadth of mission sets and capability areas that they currently attempt to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fast jet pilots must work in an extremely physically and mentally demanding role. Despite the vital role of advanced synthetic training, many European air forces will struggle to afford sufficient live and synthetic flight hours to enable pilots to build and maintain the levels of skill required in a Russia–NATO threat context across the full range of missions possible for modern multi-role fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Even where air forces can provide sufficient high-quality training flying, both live and synthetic, to generate pilot mission competencies at the required level across the full multi-role mission set, this is not enough to ensure effectiveness without adequate stockpiles of suitable munitions. In particular, the munitions required to be effective against Russian ground-based air defences and Russian combat aircraft in an air-to-air role are very expensive and would be required in much greater quantities than currently owned by most European air forces in any serious clash with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, to afford a meaningful stockpile of suppression and destruction of enemy air defences, long-range precision strike or long-range air-to-air missiles, most European nations would need to either greatly increase defence spending allocated to combat air, or cut other areas of capability, to afford to specialise in building out munitions stocks required for one or more specific mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The political and geographical location of different countries, as well as the type of combat aircraft currently operated or on order, will affect the potential mission areas in which any given country could credibly and relatively quickly build up seriously high-intensity readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries can only take risk against some mission areas in order to specialise in being really good at others if this approach is pursued in close coordination with trusted allies who are doing the same in a complementary way, to ensure that, as European air forces, all the required mission areas are well covered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;However, the current approach of most states attempting to field small multirole fighter fleets that has preserved apparent sovereign freedom of choice in the relatively permissive or semi-permissive operations since the end of the Cold War may not be practical as a deterrent to Russia. Meeting the cost of ensuring that pilots are sufficiently well trained to survive and be effective against the high-end ground-based and airborne threats that they would face, and that they have adequate stockpiles of suitable munitions, decoys and other enablers, is likely to only be possible for most European air forces if they focus such efforts on a few mission sets each. The only viable alternative would seem to be a huge increase in funding to fill in the gaps across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional assumptions about the direct threat Russian forces could pose to NATO countries in the coming years need to be urgently revised following the failure of the Ukrainian summer offensive in 2023 and Russia’s unfortunately successful pivot to a long war strategy throughout 2024. After a low point in early 2023, Russian industry has significantly increased production output of weapons and ammunition of almost all kinds. This trend is likely to accelerate, as the Russian parliament approved a 68% increase in defence spending in the state plans for the 2024/25 financial year compared with 2023/24. The increase will take Russian military spending to over 6% of GDP and cement a structural economic bias towards long-term conflict, as well as the industrial output to support such a posture. Depleted European stocks of heavy equipment and ammunition – due to donations to Ukraine not having been replaced promptly in many cases – are exacerbating the worsening battlefield situation in Ukraine and the risks posed by the reconstitution of Russian conventional military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dependence-on-the-us&quot;&gt;Dependence on the US&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, conventional deterrence in Europe of any potential Russian threat to NATO has been essentially assured by the overwhelming power of the US military. Unfortunately, the growth of Chinese capabilities is forcing the US to reallocate ever more of its military capacity to the Indo-Pacific at the expense of other theatres. Many in the Pentagon assess that the period of greatest risk of the Chinese military attempting to blockade or invade Taiwan (sometimes known as the “Davidson Window”) is 2026–28. In the event of a dangerous stand-off or a military conflict in the Indo-Pacific during the coming decade, it is likely that a high proportion of American fifth-generation fighters, electronic attack aircraft, long-range stand-off weapons, air and missile defence systems, and tankers deployed in European Command and Central Command would be transferred to Indo-Pacific Command. This would greatly reduce NATO combat power in Europe. The demands of such a conflict would also limit US capacity to provide rapid large-scale resupply of long-range munitions and spare parts to European militaries in the event of a concurrent Russian attack on NATO territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who argue that the military threat from either China in the Indo-Pacific or from Russia in Europe should be prioritised as the more likely miss a fundamental point. China has a strong interest in supporting Russia to ensure it remains a serious military threat in Europe, as that will split NATO attention and resources. More importantly, in the event of a serious stand-off or actual conflict with China that leaves US forces largely fixed in the Indo-Pacific in the mid-to-late 2020s, Russia will have a strong incentive to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to break NATO by testing Article 5 while the US is unable to reinforce NATO effectively. Another factor that must be considered is the risk that President Donald Trump follows through with his repeated threats to either officially or de facto remove US defence guarantees to other NATO nations if transatlantic relations sour during his second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent a future war with Russia, NATO’s European member states must be capable of largely shouldering the task of deterring Russian military aggression. Historically, states do not start premeditated wars that they perceive as likely to be long, costly and with an uncertain outcome; the opportunistic and cynical nature of aggression under President Vladimir Putin suggests Russia is no exception. However, once at war, Russia has repeatedly shown an unmatched capacity to absorb catastrophic casualties and setbacks without backing down. Deterrence, therefore, requires a demonstrable capability to rapidly defeat any opportunistic aggression by Russia, thus denying the Kremlin any perceived opportunity for an “easy win” that could discredit Article 5 and NATO’s collective defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-vital-role-of-air-superiority&quot;&gt;The Vital Role of Air Superiority&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air superiority is a necessity if European states are to rapidly demonstrate the capability to quickly repulse Russian conventional aggression. Without air superiority, NATO’s European powers lack the recruitment capacity, munitions manufacturing capacity and defence funding to field the scale and quality of high-readiness ground forces and land-based firepower needed to rapidly and definitively repulse a determined Russian attack. Land power is vital, of course, and heavy manoeuvre forces – such as those being built up by Poland, Finland and Germany – are essential to deterrence. However, such forces are still dependent on the ISTAR overwatch and massive firepower that air superiority enables for sustainable effectiveness against larger, battle-hardened Russian forces which possess far more ground-based firepower. This is especially the case for forward-deployed forces since, as the potential aggressor, Russia can mass forces at a point and time of its choosing, whereas NATO has committed to defending “every inch of Alliance territory”. Thus, to avoid being left seriously vulnerable when or if US rapid reinforcement is unlikely, European air forces must be able to achieve and exploit air superiority in a contested area. This requires the capacity to locate, suppress and then destroy the Russian surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems that currently would make air superiority over contested Alliance territory impossible to achieve without a major US suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) campaign, while also keeping the fighters and long-range missile-carrying bombers of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, few European air forces have the stockpiles of specialised weapons needed, nor dedicate the focused aircrew training time required, to field high-end SEAD/DEAD capabilities. As a result, NATO’s practical SEAD/DEAD capabilities against Russia in a direct conflict are heavily dependent on the US Air Force and the US Navy’s Carrier Air Wings. While SEAD/DEAD is perhaps the most glaring area of Europe’s dependence, there are other critical mission sets – such as airborne electronic warfare (EW) and penetrating ISTAR – that are also almost exclusively provided by the US. The primary reason for this is that most other NATO air forces spread their limited budgets thinly by trying to maintain and modernise a range of different multi-role fighters, helicopter fleets and relatively small quantities of enablers such as aerial refuelling tankers. Even for those states that successfully cover these “basics”, there is precious little money and usually too few personnel to allocate to comparatively specialised capabilities such as electronic attack (EA) or penetrating ISTAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;greater-specialisation-needed&quot;&gt;Greater Specialisation Needed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change this situation quickly, European air forces should explore specialisation along national lines within the Alliance – accepting risk against some mission sets/capabilities in order to free up the required funding, personnel and enabling capabilities that will allow other mission sets to be enacted more credibly. This paper aims to explain why such specialisation is necessary and to suggest areas where collective, coordinated mission specialisation could enable a rapid improvement in the combat capability of European NATO air forces, thus helping to deter future Russian aggression. The paper does this by examining two primary areas, divided over two chapters: Chapter I looks at fast jet pilot training and currency requirements for high-intensity conflict scenarios; and Chapter II examines the requirements and costs for suitable munitions across key mission sets. The paper concludes with some recommendations, including several examples of potential specialisation choices that might be made, given: (i) the resource and force structure outlook for certain states’ air forces; and (ii) the differing political conditions often attached to the use of kinetic force for some Allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper draws heavily on interviews with instructor pilots and unit leaders conducted during research visits by the author to frontline fighter units across multiple NATO air forces throughout 2023 and 2024, often including backseat observation during numerous live training sorties. This research included frontline visits with the RAF, the French Air Force, the US Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Italian Air Force, the German Air Force, the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the Swedish Air Force and the Finnish Air Force. The paper was also informed by observations and interviews with senior leaders and instructors accrued during multinational training and exercises at the NATO Tactical Leadership Programme in Albacete, Spain, and at NATO Air Command in Ramstein, Germany. It also builds directly on similar research conducted throughout 2022, which examined the gaps in NATO air force capabilities exposed by the return of overt Russian military aggression to the European security landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-pilot-proficiency&quot;&gt;I. Pilot Proficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating and maintaining a truly combat-ready force of multi-role fast jet aircrew is one of the most difficult and expensive tasks that Western militaries regularly undertake. A frequent misperception among non-specialists is that the difficult challenge is training pilots to fly fast jets. It is true that it takes anywhere from three to seven years and millions of pounds/dollars to train a pilot to fly a succession of faster, heavier and more complex aircraft to the standard required to join a frontline fast jet squadron, but this is actually only the beginning of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When aircrew complete their conversion onto a type of fast jet, they are qualified to fly the aircraft in question – such as an F-16, Typhoon or F-35 – and will have been taught how to operate the sensors, subsystems and weapons, as well as learning basic tactics, in the operational conversion unit, before graduating to the frontline. At this stage of their careers they will already have attained several hundred flying hours and around 80–100 hours of live and simulated flying on the frontline type onto which they are converting. According to recent figures released by the UK’s minister of state for the armed forces, the cost of training a British pilot to this stage is approximately £5.4 million. Despite this, in the fast jet world such pilots are still generally not considered to be ready to go into combat: additional mission-specific tactical and procedural training and testing by the instructor pilots on their frontline squadron are needed before they can be certified as “combat-ready” for simple mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the RAF, as with many other Western air forces, the first mission that most junior pilots are qualified to fly when they are certified as combat ready is quick reaction alert (QRA). QRA is essentially basic air defence and peacetime air policing, where pairs of armed fighters are maintained at a few minutes’ notice, 24/7, to scramble to intercept, identify, assist or even (if necessary) shoot down unidentified or unresponsive civilian or military aircraft inside or close to national airspace. The mission carries huge responsibility and requires pilots to be on duty for 24 hours at a time, ready to scramble without knowing, initially, the situation they will face. However, in terms of tactical complexity it is relatively simple, since in most QRA scenarios there is no ground-based threat and the assumption is that even if the aircraft is from a hostile state such as Russia, the encounter will not involve weapons release – although, of course, the aircraft are armed, and the risk is always there. Despite the relative simplicity of QRA sorties, the workload and the demands placed on pilots during them can be intense. As such, newly combat-ready pilots with perhaps 100 hours of fast jet flying time and a year on a frontline squadron will remain junior “wingmen” – meaning that in the air they follow and provide support/backup for a more experienced formation leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different air forces have different approaches to how quickly pilots can progress through various qualifications and which mission sets are prioritised. For example, in the RAF or the US Air Force, new pilots are typically combat ready within six to eight months of joining a frontline squadron, and usually progress to their two-ship lead qualifications in the second year. Exceptional pilots might be judged ready to undertake the qualification to lead the basic formation for more advanced tactics, which is four fighters – known as a four-ship – by the end of their first three-year frontline tour. Most others will achieve their four-ship lead qualification midway through their second frontline tour of three years. Particularly tactically competent pilots might then be judged suitable as candidates to attempt the extremely demanding RAF Qualified Weapons Instructor or American Fighter Weapons Instructor courses after a single frontline tour (although two tours is preferred due to the pass rate on the course generally being higher for candidates who have more experience). By contrast, progress is slower in the Swedish Air Force or the Finnish Air Force, where a dispersed operating model and requirement to fly missions regularly against peer (Russian) air threats at low altitudes in bad weather and at night as standard equates to higher complexity. Pilots are likely to be combat ready around a year after joining the frontline, but are generally not considered for two-ship lead upgrade until at least three years on squadron; four-ship lead qualifications usually come after a minimum of about six years. Swedish or Finnish pilots will have typically served about 10 years on a frontline squadron before some are considered suitable candidates for weapons instructor/mission commander training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These total training times should be understood in a context where the traditional minimum NATO standard required for fast jet aircrew in terms of annual flying hours is 180, of which 40 can be in a full mission simulator. However, different air forces’ pilots accrue different flying hour totals depending on financial position, simulator capabilities and cultural attitudes; and 120–40 live flying hours a year is now fairly common across Europe. With costs per flying hour for most fast jets sitting in the range of tens of thousands of pounds/dollars, it is not hard to see why training proficient combat-ready fast jet aircrew is extremely expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;physical-demands-on-pilots&quot;&gt;Physical Demands on Pilots&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of pilot training hours can seem strange to the non-specialist, given the sophistication of modern fly-by-wire flight controls and consequently how comparatively easy modern fighter aircraft are to fly from a “stick and rudder” point of view. It becomes more logical, however, once it is understood that a fast jet cockpit is a physically demanding environment to work in, and quite how many things fast jet pilots must be able to do simultaneously in order to perform their missions safely and effectively. Pilots work strapped into rocket-powered ejection seats under a canopy (which acts as a “greenhouse” in hot weather) in seating positions that often rapidly become uncomfortable during longer sorties; pilots also have to wear many layers of uncomfortable protective equipment, which can rapidly cause their bodies to overheat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During flight, pilots are subjected to constant noise and vibration, as well as rapid pressure changes due to varying altitude, and they must deal with the rapid onset of often sustained g-forces whenever the aircraft is being manoeuvred at high speeds. The g-forces in particular place huge strain on the body, especially during basic fighter manoeuvres (BFM) – otherwise known as dogfighting – or when “cranking”, which involves turning hard and sometimes diving to evade incoming missile threats. Under high-g forces of 7–9 g, internal organs are displaced by several inches, and pilots must constantly strain their core and leg muscles and force themselves to pressure-breathe to keep enough blood in their head to avoid loss of vision and consciousness. Staying conscious under high-g is hard work and physically painful for passengers, or in a centrifuge for training, but fast jet pilots must continue to work through it. This means monitoring their radar and EW systems, and maintaining situational awareness through the sensors in the cockpit, constantly mentally assessing their own and adversaries’ weapons ranges and kill probability as each aircraft manoeuvres, and craning their necks to look behind and above to keep visual tally on the enemy and other members of their own formation. All the while, they must make split-second tactical decisions, and constantly communicate with other members of the formation and air battle managers on the ground or in allied AWACS aircraft to maintain deconfliction and tactical effectiveness. For those not regularly acclimatised to such extreme conditions, the overwhelming physical sensations and information overload are also often accompanied by rapid spatial disorientation and severe airsickness. This is one of the reasons why pilots – especially in the first few years of their frontline careers – need to fly at least two to three hours per week to stay physically acclimatised, and be able to work efficiently and constantly learn additional skills despite the intense physical and mental demands of the fast jet cockpit environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-mission-complexity&quot;&gt;Increasing Mission Complexity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with mission sets beyond BFM and QRA, things become increasingly complex. For example, relatively basic beyond visual range (BVR) tactics involve four-ship formations operating together as a group. This allows them to efficiently allocate radar scan areas and settings to search for (and target) multiple incoming enemy aircraft across a large vertical and horizontal area. It also allows mutual defensive support, and presents opponents with multiple concurrent missile threats as the distance between opposing formations narrows, which hopefully keeps them flying defensively and thus unable to gain a positional or energy advantage. However, employing such tactics requires experienced pilots who can lead a formation of four aircraft, keep track of what all of them are doing in real time, and coordinate them while manoeuvring hard and managing their own radar, weapons and deconfliction. Such four-ship lead pilots must also be familiar enough with such tactics to plan, brief and debrief each mission thoroughly so that all involved learn lessons from it. This involves providing detailed critical feedback and corrective guidance on every manoeuvre, every missile shot, and every decision taken by friendly and enemy aircraft in a flight – which for complex missions can take many hours. The tactical complexity, weapon and fuel management, deconfliction and communication requirements placed on pilots increases even further for missions such as those that might be required against Russian forces, which would involve not only a hostile air element but also ground-based SAM threats and/or ground targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way that even carefully selected human beings can reach the level of capability required to be effective operators of fast jets in a complex combat environment is by gradually building up currency in myriad component skill sets involved in operating such aircraft, to the point that each task requires very little conscious mental effort or capacity. At each stage where sufficient familiarity has been reached in one set of skills, mental capacity is freed up, enabling pilots to learn to perform additional mission-specific tasks and ultimately also to undertake tactical leadership functions in the air. However, this means that mission currency is critical. If pilots are not able to fly multiple times per week – both for real and in the simulator – they will rapidly start to lose familiarity with key procedures and skill sets for certain missions. The less that pilots fly, the less mental capacity they have for tactical decision-making when flying, because they are no longer able to do the huge number of more basic tasks smoothly without conscious thought while under heavy physical stress. Consequently, the more mission sets that a given fighter force is liable to perform and thus compelled to train for, the more flying hours it will need to be funded for, so that its pilots can gain and then maintain the requisite skills and ability to perform those mission sets under pressure, while managing all the other tasks that must be constantly undertaken in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Trade-Offs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many NATO air forces fly multi-role fighter aircraft, but currently do not fund sufficient core flying training hours for their aircrew to allow them to maintain high-level proficiency beyond the most common mission sets – meaning that they do not necessarily have truly multi-role capability at any given point in time. During the past 20 years, this has not necessarily been a major problem. Most multi-role fighter pilots who were deployed to perform complex close air support (CAS) and/or battlefield interdiction tasks during counterinsurgency or overseas intervention operations had the luxury of a “work up” training period prior to their deployment. Because campaigns such as Iraq (from 2003) and Afghanistan (from 2006) were enduring operations, fighter units were deployed on rotation from across many air forces, and before each rotation into theatre, pilots would generally undertake anything from several weeks to several months of intensive and focused pre-deployment training to make sure that their CAS skills and other interoperability requirements – such as multi-type tanker qualifications – were fully current. In the current context, however, the skills needed to be effective and survivable when operating as part of NATO’s Regional Defence Plans, including complex mission planning and mutually supportive multinational four-ship tactics in offensive counter-air (OCA), SEAD/DEAD and contested CAS, need to be ready in a crisis, without long work-up times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, where funding for core flying training hours is a major constraint, it may be more effective for air forces to purchase light fighter types such as the Gripen or the newest variants of F-16, which lack some of the top-end capabilities of more expensive types such as the F-35, Typhoon or Rafale. Fighters that are cheap and efficient to maintain and operate can be flown much more for a given flying training budget and so can often enable pilots from cash-constrained air forces to achieve higher levels of mission proficiency and thus capability – at least in non-penetrating mission sets such as defensive counter-air (DCA) – than if they were flying more expensive jets that they could not train with very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it is a false economy for countries that operate more expensive heavy or stealth fighter types to try to save money by not funding enough flying hours to hit the NATO requirement. Doing so means that aircrew may struggle to be genuinely capable across the multiple high-threat mission sets that those aircraft were designed to be capable of performing in high-threat scenarios. This is especially problematic in air forces such as the RAF that heavily task their fast jet fleets with conducting relatively small-scale operational and exercise deployments all over the world. If operational flying hours – many of which are spent in long transits or on combat air patrol (CAP) with little training value – are substituted for core flying hours, then key skills and currencies for high-intensity mission sets will quickly begin to atrophy across the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where it is not possible to fund additional core flying training hours to allow pilots to genuinely gain and retain high levels of currency across multiple complex mission sets beyond “basic” QRA, permissive CAS and air-to-air proficiencies, the logical alternative is to reduce the number of mission sets that aircrew train to fulfil. This can be done either by assigning individual squadrons specific mission sets on which to focus a greater proportion of their training time and hold primary liability for; or, at a national level, by deprioritising certain mission areas (to which other Allies are better suited) in order to concentrate training resources on making sure that some mission sets are deliverable to a very high standard as a specialised national contribution within NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although specialisation in medium and small air forces would reduce overall sovereign “choice” in which mission sets to tackle in any given campaign (and has been avoided by most air forces during the post-Cold War decades as a result), the alternative multi-role approach entails a loss of high-end skills. This was generally judged to be acceptable when most operations were expected to be relatively permissive counterinsurgency and intervention campaigns in which massive US military support led the way. However, the costs of trying to maintain a full spectrum of multi-role proficiencies with limited core training hours and regular deployments is much more problematic when facing the threat systems that Russian forces deploy, and is likely to lead to serious losses in an actual conflict. Where nations have retained either a primary focus on deterring Russia or where a mission set has been maintained that inherently focuses on high-threat scenarios such as SEAD, unit-level specialisation already exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Swedish Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sweden, for example, despite relatively healthy live flying hours of around 120–60 hours per year, each of the country’s three fighter wings has a different multi-role training focus. Every Swedish fighter pilot flying the Gripen C/D first learns to be combat ready in the BVR air-to-air tactics that would be used in the event of a major war with Russia, and all maintain both BVR and BFM tactical proficiency throughout their careers. Then, depending on which fighter wing they are stationed at, pilots will spend most of the remainder of their flying hours training for a specific secondary mission set. F 21 Wing at Luleå specialises in CAS, while F 17 Wing at Ronneby specialises in anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and maritime tactical reconnaissance in cooperation with the Swedish Navy; F 7 Wing at Såtenäs, meanwhile, specialises in producing instructor pilots responsible for converting new pilots onto the Gripen C/D, and also maintains ASuW proficiency. This approach means that even with flying hour totals that are lower than some other NATO air forces, and given somewhat limited use of simulator resources for tactical training, the Swedish Air Force in aggregate is still able to generate and sustain high levels of pilot proficiency across all its core mission sets. At the national level, the Swedish Air Force has – unlike all other European air forces – maintained a very credible ASuW capability. However, currently, Sweden has little in the way of credible SEAD/DEAD or penetrating ISTAR capabilities. It is a prime example of the benefits in terms of credible high-intensity capabilities that can be maintained by medium-sized air forces that choose to specialise in mission sets both at the unit level and the national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other European Approaches to Specialisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other European examples, such as the almost exclusive training focus on the SEAD mission by the Tornado ECR crews within the Luftwaffe’s Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51 and the Italian Air Force’s 155° Gruppo. These units will soon be converted – to the Eurofighter EK variant in Germany and the F-35A in the case of the Italian Air Force – but should retain their focus on the SEAD mission when fully re-equipped. While the Tornado ECR is outdated as a platform, the mission training focus of the units which fly it means that the relevant aircrew possess rare skills among NATO peers, as they are able to specialise in understanding Russian threat systems and the integration tactics required to perform SEAD against them in a supportive role within composite air operations (COMAOs). Even with comparatively high numbers of available flying training hours, the US Air Force in Europe takes a similar approach. Each of the F-16 units based in the theatre maintains multi-role proficiencies, but has a specialist area of expertise to which they devote a greater proportion of their flying training time, and for which they are specifically equipped. For the 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem that specialist mission set is SEAD, while for the 31st Fighter Wing at Aviano it is CAS. When called to operations at short notice, both units consistently perform better in these two roles than other units that maintain a less focused multi-role training syllabus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-the-specialist-approach&quot;&gt;Expanding the Specialist Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong case for other NATO countries in Europe to explore a similar approach, through specialisation at either the fighter wing/squadron level or the national level. Modern air combat between states is highly punishing for “spirited amateurs”. The lethality of modern threat systems and the tactical complexity involved in executing effective COMAOs against Russian ground-based and aerial threats mean that genuine combat readiness and credibility require intensive training for key mission sets such as SEAD/DEAD and OCA. Consequently, NATO aircrew will have to either fly significantly more training hours (both live and synthetic), or better focus the hours they have by specialising in fewer mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be explained in the next chapter, the case for specialisation is strengthened when one examines munitions requirements for the various mission sets involved in establishing air superiority against Russian forces. After all, even the best trained pilot is of little utility in a high-end conflict if their air force does not have access to a ready stockpile of suitable munitions for the mission sets for which they are to be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-munitions&quot;&gt;II. Munitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other aspects of Western military capability, the munitions stocks held by most NATO air forces have been significantly distorted by the specific requirements of decades of expeditionary counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations. These were typically long campaigns against irregular forces that lacked any serious surface-to-air threat or air force, and where ground force numbers were limited by political considerations, making them heavily reliant on CAS to enable them to defend themselves while spread thinly over large areas. Consequently, during the 2000s and early 2010s, most NATO air forces pursued munitions strategies that prioritised the acquisition of bombs and short-range missiles with high accuracy and limited explosive power (to minimise collateral damage), which were also affordable enough to use on a sustained basis during long campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these are generally not the kind of weapons that are needed to roll back Russia’s ground-based air defences and conduct OCA and DCA at large scale in a high-intensity defensive NATO context. Ordering and increasing stockpiles of more suitable munitions is, therefore, essential and urgent – but this will inevitably be expensive, making it an additional argument for national specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-european-air-launched-munitions-types&quot;&gt;Current European Air-Launched Munitions Types&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent times, the RAF, for example, has standardised air-to-ground armament for fast jets around the Paveway IV dual-mode laser and GPS/INS-guided bomb and the Brimstone anti-armour/low collateral missile. This consolidation around only a few munition types enabled these sophisticated weapons to be procured at significant scale from high-efficiency production lines that operated continuously (but at relatively low output volumes) over the past decade. The development of long-range stand-off weapons during much of the post-Cold War period, meanwhile, was limited to obsolescence-mitigation upgrades for the Storm Shadow cruise missile that was developed in the mid-1990s, and procurement volumes were low. Likewise, procurement volumes of the advanced ramjet-powered European Meteor missile for BVR air-to-air combat and the US-made AIM-120C/D AMRAAM (advanced medium-range air-to-air missile) were very low by Cold War standards, since there was perceived to be a very limited air-to-air threat. Cluster bombs and the WE.177 air-delivered tactical nuclear bomb were retired in the 1990s, and the ALARM anti-radiation missile for SEAD was retired from service, without replacement, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of the RAF air-to-surface arsenal was arguably a justifiable response to the operational pressures of Iraq, Afghanistan and latterly Libya and Operation Shader. However, the consequence today is that the RAF has no air-delivered weapons suitable for SEAD/DEAD and only a limited remaining inventory of Storm Shadow cruise missiles capable of deep strikes against fixed targets such as bunkers. In contrast to almost any other country with operational F-35 squadrons, the UK’s F-35B fleet is currently only equipped with free-fall Paveway IVs for strikes against ground targets – an almost comically inadequate weapon for any seriously contested airspace, let alone for use inside a Russian integrated air defence system (IADS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the same period as the RAF developments outlined above, France developed its own range of AASM “Hammer” (Armement Air-Sol Modulaire, or Modular Air-to-Ground Armament) bombs to provide the primary air-to-ground armament for its Mirage 2000D and Rafale fleets. The AASM can be used with 250-lb, 500-lb, 1,000-lb and 2,000-lb explosive sections and incorporates laser and GPS guidance, with the additional option of imaging seeker heads for automatic terminal guidance against fixed targets. The AASM can also be fitted with a rocket booster section and pop-out glide wings to significantly extend its stand-off range in contested areas, especially when employed from low altitudes with a pop-up manoeuvre. Consequently, the AASM series is significantly more usable in contested airspace than most NATO bomb families or short-range missile types, thanks to greater stand-off range and terminal accuracy in GPS-denied environments. They have already proven useful in Ukraine when fired from the Ukraine Air Force’s Mig-29 and Su-27 fighters in pop-up lofting profiles after a low-level ingress to minimise risks from Russian SAM systems. Excellent integration with the air-to-ground radar and other systems on the Rafale means that this munition would be significantly more effective still in either French or Greek service. However, the trade-off is a higher unit cost than other utility weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) or Paveway II/IV families that form the primary air-to-surface armament across European NATO air forces. The AASM is also still not particularly suited for use as a dedicated SEAD/DEAD munition, since it lacks the range to engage long-range Russian systems inside a layered IADS, and is not designed to engage highly mobile targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other European air forces rely on US-made JDAM GPS-guided and Paveway series laser and GPS-guided bombs for their air-to-surface weaponry. More recently, a significant number, including the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the Swedish Air Force and the Italian Air Force, have also acquired the 250-lb GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) to provide a low-cost stand-off capability. However, as a glide bomb, the SDB is slow and highly susceptible to being intercepted by ground-based air defence systems, and it is also reliant on GPS, which means that its terminal accuracy can be degraded by Russian EW systems and it also cannot hit moving targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One weapon that is significantly more suitable for a high-intensity conflict in a NATO context is the AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM). Italy has acquired the AARGM for its ageing Tornado ECR SEAD fleet, and the missile has been ordered by Germany for its upcoming Eurofighter EK derivative that will replace the ECR in Luftwaffe service. It offers significantly greater range and terminal accuracy than the older AGM-88B HARM (High-Speed Anti-Radiation Missile), and also functions as a highly effective airborne electromagnetic intelligence (ELINT) sensor when carried. However, the weapon’s fairly large radar cross-section makes it unlikely to have significantly greater survivability against Russian long-range SAMs and their accompanying short-range air defence (SHORAD) systems than the older AGM-88 HARM family that has been regularly intercepted in Ukraine for around 18 months. Thus, while the baseline AARGM – when used by Tornado ECR or future Eurofighter EK – can provide a very useful suppressive effect that can bolster the effectiveness of a broader COMAO (much like the HARM in previous decades), it is not an ideal primary weapon for destroying SAM threats directly. The Tornado ECR itself is rapidly reaching the end of its operational life and was never designed to face modern layered Russian air defences. The AGM-88E is not currently used by other non-US NATO air forces and, since it does not fit inside the weapons bays of the F-35, it has not been integrated with that aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;munitions-requirements-for-seaddead-campaigns&quot;&gt;Munitions Requirements for SEAD/DEAD Campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate truth is that almost all NATO air forces other than the US’s currently lack stockpiles of munitions suitable for a serious SEAD/DEAD campaign. Such weapons need to combine several properties if they are to be effective. First, the weapon must have sufficient stand-off range to be launched from beyond the range at which a hostile IADS can reliably engage the launch aircraft. That stand-off range will obviously vary depending on the penetrating capabilities of the launch aircraft itself, since stealth aircraft can get closer to a given threat than conventional equivalents, for a given level of risk. Second, the weapon must be able to navigate automatically to the rough position of a target SAM or radar system with the aid of an anti-radiation seeker or a GPS-denial-resistant navigation suite that uses coordinates obtained in close to real time, either from the launch aircraft or from other assets that can pass data to the weapon before launch or in-flight. Third, the weapon must be able to actively detect, identify and conduct terminal homing against the target SAM system or radar even once the latter has ceased emitting radar energy and is moving to avoid the incoming missile. Finally, it must be able to reliably penetrate the self-defence capabilities of Russian SAM and SHORAD systems such as the SA-15 Tor and the SA-22 Pantsir; either by being cheap enough to use in large numbers – simultaneously and on a sustainable basis – or by being manoeuvrable, stealthy or fast enough in terminal phases of flight to be hard to shoot down. These requirements are very different from the characteristics of the utility weapons that most NATO air forces are equipped with after decades of counterinsurgency focus, and there are only a few currently available options that can meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candidate Munitions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first weapon that could meet these needs is the significantly more capable and stealthier extended-range variant of the AARGM – the AARGM-ER. In Europe, the AARGM-ER has so far been ordered by Finland, Poland and the Netherlands for use with their F-35A fleets, with likely delivery timeframes commencing in the mid-to-late 2020s. A rough comparison of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notices related to 265 missiles for the Netherlands (for $700 million) and 360 missiles for Poland (for $1.275 billion) suggests a unit cost of between $2.64 million and $3.54 million per missile. Training, mission planning tools and other non-recurring costs will also have been included in the DSCA figures, however, so the cost of each missile is probably closer to $2.53 million–$3 million. An even more advanced derivative of the AARGM-ER is also in development, called the Stand-in Attack Weapon, although initially this will be for US Air Force F-35As only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option for a suitable SEAD/DEAD munition is the UK-developed SPEAR miniature cruise missile, a 250-lb-class turbojet-powered weapon designed for a stand-off range of more than 140 km and featuring a millimetric radar seeker to allow autonomous terminal homing against SAMs and other mobile targets within a target area. Up to eight will fit inside the weapons bays of a single F-35 and the weapon is designed specifically to work with that aircraft’s advanced threat detection, geolocation and targeting capabilities. SPEAR can also be carried on triple launchers by Typhoon, and could provide a useful stand-off SEAD/DEAD effector to support F-35s further forward in an IADS if the weapon were fully integrated and purchased in significant quantities. However, while SPEAR has been in development since 2010 for use with the F-35B, technical challenges and funding limitations have caused serious delays. These delays, coupled with the Ministry of Defence’s limited order size for production weapons, mean that the cost per weapon is high, and initial operational capability on the F-35B may not be achieved until 2028. The US Joint Programme Office has instead given integration priority within the F-35’s flight test and software upgrade schedule to other US and Allied weapons that have been ordered in greater numbers by more countries – such as the AARGM-ER and the Norwegian Joint Strike Missile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Strike Missile, known as the AGM-184A Kraken in US service, represents another potentially useful option for SEAD/DEAD munitions. This subsonic air-launched cruise missile can be carried either externally or internally in the F-35A. According to US Department of Defense budget documents, the weapon features an imaging infra-red seeker for terminal guidance and has a combined GPS, inertial and terrain reference navigation system that allows it to be effective in “GPS-denied environments”, with stealth properties that confer survivability “against advanced threat systems”. However, like the much faster but probably shorter-ranged AARGM-ER, the Joint Strike Missile costs about $3 million per missile (using the US order of 268 missiles, for $848 million, as a guide).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cost-implications-and-trade-offs&quot;&gt;Cost Implications and Trade-Offs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should be clear at this stage is that dedicated SEAD/DEAD munitions that are capable of reliably penetrating the defences around key Russian SAM systems to start dismantling the ground-based IADS are very expensive, specialised weapons. There are also only a fairly small number of potentially suitable existing weapons that meet the requirements. It is encouraging to see Norway, the Netherlands, Poland and Finland investing in Joint Strike Missile and AARGM-ER at a reasonable scale. Italy has also brought the AARGM into service with the Tornado ECR to replace HARM, and with a planned order for AARGM-ER to equip its F-35As, these are causes for celebration. However, for all these countries, the quantities purchased so far would still run out fairly quickly in a major campaign, and delivery timeframes remain a concern. There is potential for the UK to significantly improve its own capabilities in this area with a large joint order of SPEAR and its stand-in EA variant, the SPEAR-EW. To continue – and ideally rapidly expand – these European SEAD/DEAD munitions purchasing efforts, it will probably be necessary for several of these states to forgo building up significant stockpile levels of other types of munitions. The unit costs of AARGM-ER, SPEAR or Joint Strike Missile are many times higher than those of the sort of direct attack munitions that all NATO air forces have become accustomed to fighting with since the end of the Cold War. It therefore stands to reason that countries that purchase serious stockpiles of SEAD/DEAD munitions will have far less money available for CAS, ASuW and air-to-air weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to increase stockpiles and the opportunity costs of doing so for SEAD/DEAD munitions also hold true, at least to a certain degree, for air-to-air missiles. European NATO air forces have faced little serious prospect of large-scale air-to-air combat since 1991. Consequently, stockpiles of AIM-120 AMRAAM medium-range radar-guided missiles, the very long-range Meteor missile and short-range missiles such as the AIM-132 ASRAAM, AIM-9X and AIM-2000 IRIS-T are far smaller than stocks of comparable missile classes were during the Cold War, across most air forces. The provision of some of these missiles to Ukraine for use as ground-based air defence interceptors in NASAMS, IRIS-T surface launch standard and surface launched missile and other improvised SAM systems has further eroded stockpiles. However, in any conflict with Russia, units tasked with conducting DCA or OCA would need to expend significant numbers of such weapons over a sustained period. Pilots engaging Russian aircraft would be doing so within the constraints imposed by the ground-based IADS threat, probably requiring a high proportion of BVR engagements. When fighting Russian aircraft equipped with modern radars and long-range missiles such as the R-37M (AA-13), BVR tactics would be likely to rely on significant numbers of low probability-of-kill shots with AMRAAM and Meteor to force hostile pilots to “go defensive” early (thus gaining control of engagements). Such tactics would inherently involve expending multiple weapons per target destroyed in many situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCA missions to intercept salvoes of cruise missiles and Shahed-136/Geran-2 one-way attack drones would also consume large volumes of short-range missiles. This was vividly demonstrated during the DCA missions flown successfully by Israeli, American, British and French fighter aircraft against the Iranian attack on Israel on 13 April 2024. Such DCA interceptions are nevertheless an essential component of any strategy to enable the UK – and NATO more broadly – to rapidly improve integrated air and missile defence coverage in Europe, alongside ground-based SAM systems. Consequently, fielding robust capability across the DCA or OCA mission sets during a conflict of any meaningful duration will require having not only aircrew with sufficient proficiency and currency for the tasks against realistic Russian threats, as well as suitable aircraft, but also a significantly greater inventory of air-to-air missiles than most European air forces currently possess. In the absence of significant increases in overall air force funding, procuring such missiles in sufficient quantities is likely to require most European nations to forgo purchasing other classes of munitions – in other words, de facto mission specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gps-dependence&quot;&gt;GPS Dependence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the need to rapidly expand dedicated SEAD/DEAD, stand-off precision strike and air-to-air munitions stocks, another problem facing NATO air forces is the heavy reliance on GPS guidance for many counterinsurgency-era weapons systems. Russian forces have routinely used a wide range of tactical-, operational- and strategic-level GPS denial and/or spoofing systems during the war against Ukraine, as well as periodically demonstrating the ability to disrupt GPS at significant distances during NATO exercises and via disruption of civilian GPS services in the Baltic region. Perhaps even more worrying for NATO forces is that Russian forces have demonstrated the capability to rapidly adapt their EW tactics and waveforms to seriously degrade the accuracy of Western ground-launched and air-launched GPS-guided munitions. Generally, weapons such as the GMLRS rocket, GBU-62 JDAM and Excalibur GPS-guided artillery shell proved highly effective for the first month or two after they were supplied to Ukrainian forces, but once Russian EW operators started to dial in their effects, the performance of these systems began to rapidly degrade, to the point that in some cases they are now less precise than unguided equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the versions of weapons supplied to Ukraine may not be the most up to date in the NATO arsenal, due to security concerns around Russian capture of the most sensitive guidance kits, and so performance in Ukraine should not be taken as entirely indicative of a given weapon’s performance in NATO service. However, for the initial period of any clash with Russian forces, GPS guidance for existing weapons should not be assumed to be 100% reliable, and accuracy is likely to degrade fairly quickly after the initial few weeks of a conflict. Even where a high level of jamming resistance has been successfully designed into a weapon, it will still need to be rapidly upgraded once in service, or else risk losing effectiveness within months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is a need to invest in a greater number of weapons, ideally across a wider variety of types than a basic analysis of target numbers to stockpiles would suggest, since effectiveness will be degraded by GPS spoofing/denial and other EW techniques, as well as Russian SHORAD coverage. In addition, air forces will need to invest in improving the rate at which they upgrade weapon guidance/seeker programming and aircraft mission data to keep pace with the increasingly rapid pace of adversary EW adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that if a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign can be mounted despite the likely denial or serious degradation of GPS in the first phases of a clash, airpower assets may be able to reduce the EW threat to munitions and sensors over time. This is because a NATO air campaign, in the wake of initial SEAD/DEAD successes, would probably include dedicated efforts to rapidly locate and destroy high-end Russian EW systems. Many of these EW systems must emit significant amounts of energy to have effects at longer ranges, and so can be detected and triangulated relatively easily, especially by the F-35 with its combination of sensor fusion, passive ELINT collection capabilities and geolocation capabilities. Destroying or suppressing major EW systems deployed by forward Russian forces would then allow effective use of GPS guidance against remaining Russian ground forces, at least in localised areas and/or for specific periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it appears to be an unavoidable conclusion that regenerating the wartime capacity of the non-US air forces in NATO in a defensive context against Russia in the short to medium term will require states to make hard prioritisation decisions on munitions stockpile investments. The counterinsurgency-era solution of a consolidated mix of precision-guided bombs and short-range missiles optimised for efficient low-volume production and low collateral damage cannot deliver what is needed for SEAD/DEAD, DCA, OCA or deep strike. The relatively high cost of the weapons required for these mission sets means that achieving adequate stockpiles to guarantee reasonable combat endurance and effectiveness will come at a major opportunity cost for most small/medium-sized air forces – unless they also receive significant increases in funding. Given limited industrial production capacity and consequent lengthy delays to desired delivery timescales for many advanced munition types, national specialisation choices on mission sets could also help to enable delivery schedule negotiations and optimisation within NATO for each munition class, replacing the current “first come, first served” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that Russia be deterred from using a perceived window of opportunity to directly attack a NATO member’s territory if, in the coming years, the US is either militarily overstretched by a concurrent crisis in the Indo-Pacific, or appears to have politically disengaged from European defence commitments. Airpower is critical to rebuilding European NATO members’ ability to collectively repel and thereby deter opportunistic Russian aggression without large-scale reliance on US assets. Put bluntly: Russian leaders are very unlikely to take the risk of direct conflict if they believe that European NATO members can roll back Russia’s IADS through a SEAD/DEAD campaign and establish air superiority over any contested territory. It is difficult to see how non-US NATO members could achieve a similar level of conventional force overmatch in the medium term via any approach other than doubling down on airpower, given the many demographic, industrial and timeframe constraints on attempts to rapidly expand and reform land forces and navies. By contrast, the air assets required to conduct a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign and push back the VKS already largely exist in Europe, with the notable exception of sufficient specialised munitions stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it will take significant investment and focus to realise the latent potential of Europe’s air forces in a high-intensity context. In this context, a number of recommendations can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There must be a wider recognition among air forces and ministries of defence that developing and maintaining aircrew proficiency and currency in many of the more complex mission sets – such as OCA, DCA and SEAD/DEAD – require a lot of both live and synthetic flying training time dedicated to those tasks. This means that maintaining multi-role proficiencies to the levels required will require either greater resources for core flying training, or greater mission specialisation and focus during training compared with the approach employed during the past few decades. While simulator time helps with the high-intensity side of aircrew proficiency generation and currency, there are only so many hours in the working week, especially if a small force is constantly deployed on real-world operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the high cost of flying hours for modern fast jets, it makes sense for countries that are unable to afford major increases in overall flying hours to concentrate a greater proportion of available flying training hours on the core tasks that they might credibly be allocated by NATO in a war. Such an approach might take the form of either a reduced mission liabilities set for squadrons or air forces as a whole; or a significant reduction in the tempo of overseas deployments and low-end exercise activities to allow the force to focus its valuable time on training for core mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the costs involved in purchasing relevant quantities of the specialised and expensive munitions needed for high-intensity conflict against Russian forces, there will be opportunity costs elsewhere in the inventory. Medium-sized air forces, therefore, should focus their efforts on specific mission sets rather than aim to purchase a full range of munitions types in totally inadequate quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where such specialisation decisions are to be made, however, they must be made in close coordination with other Allies and in accordance with an honest assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each country.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technical-and-geopolitical-considerations-for-implementation&quot;&gt;Technical and Geopolitical Considerations for Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of assessments that ought to contribute to decisions on increasing the mission specialisation of a given air force, one of the most obvious being the inherent capabilities and drawbacks of its existing aircraft. For example, it makes little sense for a country that exclusively flies the F-35 to focus on DCA, since the aircraft is specifically designed for operations inside contested airspace, incurring a considerable cost and complexity premium to be able to do so. Essentially, the F-35 is a relatively inefficient asset for conducting QRA scrambles or holding DCA CAP stations to guard against hostile aircraft or missiles, at least compared with aircraft designed for those tasks, such as Typhoon or Gripen. Equally, for nations that operate exclusively 4th- or 4.5th-generation fighter fleets, a choice to focus on SEAD/DEAD and OCA would be comparatively inefficient, since, compared with the F-35, their assets inherently require a much greater degree of enablement and suppressive weapons use at scale to be survivable in a high-threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also political and geographical factors that might naturally lead certain NATO countries to choose to specialise in certain mission sets rather than others. For example, political conventions and constraints on the use of lethal force in Germany, alongside its geographic position at the heart of Europe, make it logical to suggest that the Luftwaffe focus primarily on DCA, and potentially supportive SEAD from stand-off, but not DEAD, OCA or deep strike. Experience from multiple conflicts since the end of the Cold War suggests that policy decisions in Berlin to authorise the Bundeswehr to take part in offensive strike operations as part of any NATO response to an attack by Russia would take significantly longer than in many other European capitals. In stark contrast, flying DCA CAPs and holding extended numbers of QRA assets at readiness in multiple locations would probably be authorised almost immediately. Given that the Luftwaffe already has a large and growing fleet of Eurofighter Typhoons, a decision to focus its capability-development efforts on acquiring large quantities of air-to-air munitions and realistic training and exercising for DCA at larger scale would make a great deal of sense. This might well come at the expense of integration and acquisition funding for other strike and stand-off weapons, and of training time for tasks such as interdiction and CAS. However, such a trade-off would be a price worth paying if it enabled Germany to demonstrate commitment to seriously enhancing its practical DCA and QRA capabilities in a NATO context. Such a demonstration by Germany could also provide risk mitigation, allowing Allies such as the Netherlands or Belgium – which have smaller fleets of F-35s – to take more risk on DCA and QRA training, readiness and weapons stocks, thus allowing them to focus on SEAD/DEAD and OCA. Clearly, geographical location relative to other Allied nations and proximity to various potential threat vectors will also influence the options that different countries feel that they have (or do not have) for taking on certain tasks or accepting risks against others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nordic Air Forces grouping is perhaps the best current example of the potential benefits available via cooperative specialisation. Norway and Finland – frontline states with both maritime and land borders with Russia – will soon operate fighter fleets solely comprising F-35As. Denmark will also shortly exchange its F-16s for F-35As, albeit at a significantly smaller scale. Sweden, by contrast, has a more protected land position, and operates a larger number of Gripen C/D (and soon new Gripen E) fighters. Following decades of close cooperation on a more ad hoc basis, these four air forces have recently committed to the Nordic air forces grouping, which includes a combined air operations centre. The joint planning visibility and regular exercises together allow each of the four nations to plan its own capability and training focus around a very significant level of trust in what the other three will provide in the event of a war. Sweden not only has more fighter aircraft than any of the other three Nordic states, but the Swedish Air Force can also afford to fly them more, as the Gripen is very economical to operate. Under the new concept, there is the opportunity for the Swedish Air Force to specialise in training and equipping its squadrons for DCA, ASuW and contested CAS. It can accept risk against penetrating OCA and SEAD/DEAD capabilities in the knowledge that Norwegian (and soon Finnish and Danish) F-35s will fight alongside it in any conflict against Russia, and will be well trained and equipped to cover those mission sets. The reverse is also true: Norway, Finland and Denmark can focus more of their F-35 weapons acquisition and training time on making the most of that platform’s inherent offensive potential, in the knowledge that they have a significant degree of defensive and anti-ship cover in the form of Swedish fighters that will operate with them in any conflict. As a result, the Nordic model promises to deliver collective combat capabilities that are significantly more potent than the four countries could achieve separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trust-burden-sharing-and-credibility&quot;&gt;Trust, Burden Sharing and Credibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any air forces looking to the model of cooperative specialisation, with all the benefits that it promises, the key point to remember is that such cooperation relies on trust. Trust must be built up through consistent practical demonstrations of both military capability and political commitment. Burden sharing only works if both parties take on burdensome responsibilities and prove that they can carry them out. However, if medium and smaller European NATO air forces take the Russian threat seriously and are committed to building up warfare readiness and capacity quickly to ensure it is deterred, then cooperative mission specialisation appears to offer the most efficient route to doing so within the resource constraints and force structures available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be seen as a step too far for the traditionally largest and arguably most capable European air forces – in particular the RAF and the Armée de l’Air et de l’Espace – which are culturally and doctrinally wedded to maintaining broad-spectrum forces. But the fact remains that, even for the UK and France, trying to maintain a broad-spectrum force on inadequate budgets with heavy deployment schedules for real world tasks over the past decades has led to varying degrees of hollowness across high-intensity mission readiness and a stark lack of suitable munitions stocks for defending NATO against Russian aggression. Unless funding is significantly increased and discretionary activity cut down to enable a greater focus on core NATO missions, greater mission specialisation may be needed here too – albeit with more choices available, thanks to the larger existing force structure of these two air forces than in the case of most other Allies. In the harsh light shone on Western forces, industrial capacity and political decision-making by Russia’s war on Ukraine, hollow forces appear far more obvious and far less credible to allies and adversaries alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks to end the war in Ukraine are in motion. As the Trump administration seeks to keep its promise to end the war in Ukraine, negotiators must consider long-standing research on war termination and peace negotiations. Despite calls for a swift ceasefire, this body of work shows that peace talks tend to take longer than initially anticipated. War is an extension of politics, and negotiations are shaped by a broad range of factors beyond simply tallying battlefield successes or assessing when combatants will exhaust their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), drawing on data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), found that 60 percent of all wars conclude through some form of compromise. While wars can end in various ways, a negotiated settlement remains a distinct option for Ukraine. Therefore, identifying the factors that influence the complex process of war termination is essential for understanding how negotiations between the United States, Russia, Ukraine, other key states in Europe, and the broader international community may unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War negotiations are inherently complex, marked by uncertainty, competing interests, and shifting variables. While artificial intelligence (AI) can help navigate this complexity, its effectiveness depends on proper application. Large language models (LLMs) are generalists, but their outputs can be refined using techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The key lies not only in the model itself but in the quality of the data and the sequencing of questions. By curating datasets focused on historical peace negotiations and structuring prompts to reflect real-world decisionmaking, AI moves beyond simple summarization to become a tool for systematically analyzing war termination and the challenging path toward a negotiated settlement in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report leverages AI to explore possible pathways to peace between Russia and Ukraine. Researchers at the CSIS Futures Lab applied foundational literature on peace negotiations in international relations (IR) to curate datasets and refine their approach to prompt engineering, incorporating techniques such as few-shot learning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The study demonstrates that AI techniques like RAG can be effectively used to rapidly understand and summarize key documents related to a potential peace agreement in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LLM’s outputs provide key recommendations for policymakers and analysts assessing possible pathways to peace. First, territorial control and security guarantees will be central to any agreement. Both the AI-driven analysis using RAG and recent peace discussions in Munich and Riyadh highlight the significance of these factors. The findings of this report indicate that lasting peace requires a transparent, fair, and inclusive negotiation process—one that fully engages Ukraine and European states. This stands in contrast to emerging proposals that prioritize negotiations between Moscow and Washington while pressuring Ukraine into immediate elections and resource concessions. The real challenge isn’t merely bringing parties to the negotiating table but navigating the complex technical details that will shape long-term stability. Key issues include territorial arrangements, security guarantees, demilitarized zones, and verification mechanisms. The most difficult work in diplomacy lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, negotiators must identify clear trade-offs. Not all peace agreements follow the same blueprint. While historical precedent and AI-driven analysis emphasize the importance of postwar justice, economic recovery, and social welfare in achieving lasting peace, political realities will ultimately determine what is negotiable. Russia has hardened its demands rather than offering concessions, making prosecutions for war crimes—however justified—highly unlikely. Negotiators will have to balance upholding international norms with the imperative of ending the war. One area where leverage remains is economic reparations; if the international community is willing, frozen Russian assets could be seized to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a lasting peace won’t be shaped solely by Ukraine and Russia—it will require sustained international involvement. Both historical research and AI-driven analysis confirm that third-party mediation, security guarantees, and enforcement mechanisms are essential to durable agreements. This dynamic is already unfolding, with Saudi Arabia emerging as a mediator between the United States and Russia. However, beyond facilitating talks, global actors must assume responsibility for monitoring, verifying, and enforcing postwar stability. The United States, in particular, faces a strategic decision: provide Ukraine with unconditional security support or risk long-term instability by demanding economic concessions in exchange for assistance. How Washington and its allies navigate this moment will not only determine the outcome of the war but also shape the credibility of future peace efforts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, generative AI presents a powerful tool for foreign policy and national security, but it must be used wisely. Policymakers should experiment with AI for brainstorming and strategic analysis, but always in conjunction with expert judgment. The technology has clear limitations—without proper benchmarking and access to tailored, up-to-date data, LLMs cannot reliably generate accurate insights. To maximize effectiveness, policymakers must customize AI models for specific use cases, ensuring outputs align with real-world conditions and the broader bodies of knowledge that inform policy analysis. Ultimately, AI can process historical data and help structure policy discussions; however, it cannot replace the human decisionmaking that determines war and peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report begins by reviewing IR scholarship on war termination and peace processes, highlighting key drivers and roadblocks to achieving lasting peace. It then examines common techniques for working with generative AI, specifically RAG, to refine the performance of LLMs and improve model output. The third section applies the RAG approach to analyze peace agreement data and generate potential peace deals. The final section presents key takeaways and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-we-know-about-war-termination-and-peace-processes&quot;&gt;What Do We Know About War Termination and Peace Processes?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How wars start and end are central topics in IR. Scholars have identified numerous factors that influence peace negotiations and the terms of any eventual agreement. A key framework for understanding war termination is bargaining theory, which suggests that conflicts end when the perceived benefits of peace outweigh the costs of continued fighting. In this context, information plays a critical role, as combatants continually reassess their capabilities relative to those of their adversary. War, therefore, is not merely a failure of diplomacy but rather an extension of negotiations between belligerents in which coercion and force play a role. Accordingly, states are typically conceptualized as being able to rationally assess their position vis-à-vis a rival because the conflict’s progress provides information about what sort of negotiated settlement reflects—at least in a capabilities-focused conception of bargaining—the broader power differential between the belligerents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other dynamics, however, such as domestic political factors, will likely shape any peace negotiations. Scholars have highlighted how domestic political coalitions influence leaders’ calculations of the domestic political costs of defeat. Furthermore, shifts in domestic political coalitions can accelerate war termination by facilitating more effective reassessments of likely outcomes. However, domestic political factions have been shown to protect their interests in any international agreement, potentially complicating the route to a more “rational” negotiation outcome. In the case of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, domestic “spoilers”—groups who seek to sabotage any peace process due to their own interests—could obstruct progress, making a mutually acceptable outcome more difficult to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarship has also demonstrated that more durable peace agreements often include civil society actors, such as local religious organizations or human rights groups. However, the question of who gets a “seat at the table” in peacemaking is influenced by both practical and normative considerations. Additionally, some form of justice—whether through post-conflict trials, truth commissions, or reparations—can, in certain cases, contribute to the durability of peace agreements. These factors, however, add further complications to the already challenging task of achieving successful peace negotiations and ensuring their subsequent implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the international community is likely to play a crucial role in conflict termination through mediation efforts. Research indicates that “non-coercive” third-party mediation, whether conducted by states or international institutions, can play a role in “softening up” belligerents’ war aims, facilitating a cessation of hostilities. Beyond mediation, the international community can help ensure the long-term viability of peace agreements by providing monitoring and verification of the terms, as well as offering security guarantees. This role is particularly significant in the case of Ukraine, where international oversight may be necessary to prevent Russia from exploiting any cessation in hostilities to rebuild, rearm, and resume its pursuit of war aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the aforementioned factors are likely to shape any negotiated peace settlement between Ukraine and all involved parties. For instance, years of war have provided information into both sides’ combat capabilities; however, uncertainty remains regarding the long-term military commitment of the United States and European states, as well as the financial resources available for Ukraine’s reconstruction. Moreover, as suggested in the literature on peace negotiations, domestic political factions, civil society actors, questions of justice, and the role of the international community could all shape the process. Any peace negotiations will, therefore, be highly complex, with numerous variables at play. To explore ways to creatively navigate this complexity, the CSIS Futures Lab employed AI-enabled tools to analyze historical peace agreements as well as current discussions aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war. The research team sought to generate possible parameters for an eventual settlement and to conceptualize different versions of a potential peace agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applying-ai-to-analyze-war-and-peace&quot;&gt;Applying AI to Analyze War and Peace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the CSIS Futures Lab’s ongoing efforts to engage in data-driven analysis and experiment with AI-enabled technology, the research team took a creative approach to addressing the complex question of a potential peace agreement related to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. To do so, the Futures Lab leveraged specifically tailored data sources, Scale AI’s Donovan platform (an AI-enabled data analysis tool), and a data query method known as RAG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While off-the-shelf LLMs can generate responses or summarize text across a wide range of domains, their accuracy—particularly in “knowledge-intensive tasks”—can be inconsistent. RAG enhances LLM performance by directing models to leverage specific data sources when generating outputs. This approach relies on two key elements: a “retriever,” which queries relevant documents from a specified data source, and a “generator,” which synthesizes and summarizes the retrieved information. By structuring AI outputs in this way, RAG helps mitigate model “hallucinations,” or the tendency of LLMs to produce false or misleading information. The result is a more precise, reliable, and contextually informed response tailored to specific user queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAG is just one of several techniques that can enhance LLM outputs for domain-specific tasks. For example, “few-shot learning”—the practice of providing models with a small example set of demonstrations within a specific context—has been shown to improve model performance. This approach works by incorporating specific data examples and correct labeling within a model prompt. Further research suggests that combining multiple contextual prompts can enhance the effectiveness of in-context few-shot learning. In general, the goal is for models to use these examples to better understand the fundamental structure of a task. Additionally, chain-of-thought prompting—which involves breaking down each step in a task when prompting models and instructing them to decompose responses into intermediate steps—has demonstrated improvements in model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For data, the research team leveraged two primary sources. The first was the full text of peace agreements compiled by the UCDP. The second was a collection of published articles curated by CSIS scholars, analyzing possible pathways to peace between Russia and Ukraine. These data sources were then uploaded to the Donovan platform to implement the RAG approach using commercially available LLMs. Donovan enabled the research team to better optimize search vectors from RAG across larger datasets—a key capability for employing LLMs to explore complex, high-context research areas such as peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team incorporated key elements of chain-of-thought prompting to support step-by-step reasoning. The prompting strategy began by first ensuring that the LLM, consistent with few-shot and in-context learning, properly understood the dataset. Next, the researchers directed the LLM to analyze peace agreements in general before narrowing the focus to Ukraine and the specific factors likely to shape the negotiation process. Finally, the model was tasked with exploring possible peace scenarios. This structured approach ensured a logical progression, establishing key analytical steps before prompting the LLM to generate sample peace agreements. In other words, sequencing the right questions is a deliberate strategy when employing LLMs to support foreign policy decisionmaking. Asking a vague or overly simplistic question yields a correspondingly simplistic response. However, posing a series of logically connected questions, grounded in a broader analytical framework, increases the likelihood of generating a well-calibrated and insightful response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-negotiation-factors-and-challenges-in-the-case-of-ukraine-and-russia&quot;&gt;Key Negotiation Factors and Challenges in the Case of Ukraine and Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described above, effectively employing AI to analyze complex, high-context tasks requires both gathering the right data and developing a tailored approach to prompting. When applied to generating possible peace agreements for Ukraine, this process necessitates collecting data on peace agreements in general, as well as ongoing, reputable accounts of negotiations. To that end, the research team created two datasets. The first dataset consisted of 333 peace agreements from between 1989 and 2018, compiled by the UCDP. Each entry contained the full text of the respective treaty. The second dataset, developed in collaboration with Ukrainian researchers, included 79 articles from major news outlets discussing potential peace talks. This effort built on the earlier CSIS Futures Lab series, Strategic Headwinds, which analyzed key factors shaping negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure below outlines the prompting strategy. First, the CSIS Futures Lab ensured that the model used historical peace agreements as an anchor for analyzing Ukraine. Second, the research team integrated current factors influencing peace negotiations in Ukraine. Third, the questions shifted toward identifying potential spoilers and roadblocks that could obstruct the peace process—an approach designed to mitigate confirmation bias and integrate red teaming techniques. With this contextual foundation, the research team then tasked the model with generating possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TimuKb0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Major Logical Categories for RAG Prompting and Chain-of-Thought Reasoning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial prompt asked the model to analyze the peace treaties in the UCDP dataset and identify common negotiation parameters. The model’s output highlights several key considerations that have shaped historical peace agreements. These include establishing a clear agenda and methodology for negotiations on specific issue areas, as well as creating timelines and processes for conducting negotiations. Security guarantees and shared principles—such as territorial integrity—emerge as common factors across agreements. Moreover, the analysis indicates that monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are frequent features in historical peace agreements. Finally, the output suggests that economic factors and social welfare issues, including land access, economic development, and human rights, have played a role in shaping historical peace outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the model’s analysis, historical trends indicate that, over time, peace agreements have increasingly emphasized human rights and economic cooperation, and they tend to be more comprehensive while also involving the international community to a greater extent. These findings align with IR scholarship on war termination and peace agreements, which highlights the importance of security guarantees and addressing considerations such as human rights abuses that may have occurred during a conflict. Additionally, studies have shown that peace negotiations placed greater emphasis on human rights in the first decade of the 2000s compared to the previous decade. However, since 2010, there has been growing pessimism about incorporating human rights stipulations into peace mediation efforts. Consequently, these nuances suggest that a model’s empirical claims should always be validated through ongoing research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of the general parameters of the historical peace agreements, the research team next prompted the model to summarize the main points of the collected articles discussing possible peace processes between Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model’s output for this second prompt indicates that security guarantees—particularly Ukraine’s relationship with NATO—will be crucial for maintaining Ukraine’s territorial integrity. However, this could conflict with Russia’s interest in ensuring Ukraine remains neutral. Similarly, territorial disputes, including the status of areas currently occupied by Russian forces, are likely to be central to any negotiation. Additionally, Russia would likely demand assurances regarding sanctions relief. Beyond NATO, Ukraine’s potential membership in international organizations, such as the European Union, is also expected to shape negotiation parameters. Finally, the model’s analysis suggests that ceasefire agreements and monitoring mechanisms will be essential for ensuring the durability of any settlement. As with the first prompt, the model’s output aligns with key considerations identified in IR research on war termination. These include the role of the international community in monitoring agreements and the divergent interests surrounding Ukraine’s postwar status—particularly its aspirations to join NATO and the European Union. In the context of a bargaining model of war termination, such factors are likely to be central points of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team also wanted to ascertain whether the RAG methodology could help identify potential roadblocks to successful negotiations. To this end, the model was prompted to generate possible obstructions to a peace deal. The model’s output suggests that power imbalances between Ukraine and Russia, as well as divergent views on territorial control in regions such as Crimea, could hinder an agreement. Additionally, while Ukraine is likely to want robust security guarantees and possibly NATO membership, this remains a major sticking point for Russia. These factors highlight the ongoing competing interests and strategic priorities of both states in the war. Model analysis also underscores possible domestic factors, such as public opinion, political factions favoring a more hardline approach, and spoiler groups that could undermine the negotiation process. Furthermore, a lack of trust between the belligerents could reduce the likelihood of an agreement and complicate effective monitoring and verification. Here, the conclusions of IR research are particularly relevant. For example, existing models recognize the role of domestic actors and spoiler groups as potential barriers to achieving a lasting peace. Moreover, the balance of power has long been a central theoretical consideration in assessing outcomes in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final stage, the research team tested if this approach could generate different versions of peace agreements to assist analysts in thinking through alternative negotiated settlements. To achieve this, the model was prompted to generate three peace agreements, each with distinct parameters. The first agreement was a minimalist agreement, representing the least stringent version of a peace settlement generated by the model. Its key provisions include an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. However, it does not provide security guarantees for Ukraine, address competing territorial claims, or consider Ukraine’s potential NATO membership. Additionally, under this version of the deal, the international community would not offer technical assistance, monitoring, or support during the implementation phase.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second agreement was a moderate agreement, which also includes an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Additionally, it calls for the establishment of a buffer zone, along with international monitoring and verification. Beyond these measures, it introduces limited security guarantees through a nonaggression pact between the belligerents. While Ukraine would regain some of its internationally recognized territory, it would not recover all prewar land. Furthermore, Ukraine would agree to neutrality while expanding economic ties in trade and the energy sector. This agreement envisions a more substantial role for the international community, including the provision of technical assistance and support throughout the implementation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the third agreement was a comprehensive and ambitious agreement. This version incorporates all the components outlined in the previous two agreements. However, it also includes security guarantees that may be unappealing from a U.S./European perspective and within the current Ukrainian domestic political landscape. Specifically, it proposes a mutual defense pact between Ukraine and Russia. Moreover, the agreement stipulates Ukrainian-Russian cooperation on economic and security issues, including counterterrorism and nonproliferation efforts. In return, Russia agrees to withdraw all troops from disputed territories and formally recognize Ukrainian sovereignty over its internationally recognized land. Additionally, this version of the deal includes provisions for reconciliation and accountability, addressing human rights violations and war crimes committed during the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in the above output, the comprehensive agreement produces parameters that some may deem unfavorable to Ukraine. To account for this, the research team prompted the model to generate an alternative deal that aligns more closely with Ukrainian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of the agreement closely resembles the comprehensive agreement discussed above, particularly on issues related to Ukrainian territorial claims and addressing human rights violations and war crimes. However, one key difference is that this version does not include a Ukrainian-Russian defense pact. Instead, it grants Ukraine the autonomy to join NATO in the future. There is, however, a slight inconsistency in the agreement’s parameters. In this version, Ukraine agrees to maintain its “nonaligned” status, with the option to join organizations such as NATO at a later stage. It is unclear how agreeing to maintain a nonaligned status is compatible with any eventual plan to join the NATO alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, outputs leveraging RAG highlight several notable points. First, in the general analysis of the UCDP data and Ukrainian peace agreement articles, model outputs identified many agreement parameters consistent with those acknowledged in the IR literature. These include the importance of security guarantees, a role for the international community, and considerations of domestic political factors. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of recognizing broader trends in data, which can be useful for reflecting core topics of discussion in the field of IR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in terms of themes across the data specific to a Ukrainian peace deal, model output illustrates that issues of territorial integrity and Ukrainian neutrality emerge as key points of concern. For example, the model identifies that difficulties in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are likely to center around each country’s competing territorial claims and how territory currently occupied by Russian forces will be divided among the belligerents. Additionally, Ukraine’s relationship with NATO is a point of contention. Model outputs indicate discussions of Russian desires for Ukrainian neutrality within the articles in the dataset. However, due to long-term security concerns, the data suggests that Ukraine would likely prefer to join NATO to help guarantee that Russia will not take advantage of a ceasefire to rearm for a new stage in the conflict down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, as instructed, the approach of using RAG linked to specified data sources was able to generate alternatives for a peace deal, with each proposal varying in the level of comprehensiveness. The model-generated output was able to recognize many crucial points of discussion that are likely to shape any real-world negotiations. However, initial output demonstrated inconsistencies in how variations of a peace deal addressed territorial disputes between Ukraine and Russia. This required tweaking initial prompts to achieve improved results and logically consistent treaty parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, and problematic from a Ukrainian and U.S./European strategic viewpoint, the most comprehensive version of a deal generated by the model resulted in a Ukrainian-Russian mutual defense agreement, rather than Ukraine joining NATO. Considering Ukraine’s stated desire to join NATO and concerns that Russia may restart hostilities from a more advantageous position following any pause in the conflict, such an outcome diverges from the preferences of many Western states. Therefore, generating a deal more desirable to Ukraine using RAG required specific prompting to direct the model to create a deal more favorable to Ukrainian interests. In this version of the deal, Ukraine is directed to initially retain its neutrality but has the freedom to join international organizations, such as NATO, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s analysis, combining historical research and AI-driven modeling, identifies four core takeaways for policymakers navigating ongoing peace negotiations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Territorial control and security guarantees will define any deal.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s future relationship with NATO and its territorial integrity remain the central issues in negotiations. While full NATO membership may face obstacles, alternative security guarantees from Europe or the United States could provide a viable path forward. However, Ukraine must be an active participant in negotiations—excluding Kyiv and focusing talks solely between Moscow and Washington risks backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political realities will constrain peace terms.&lt;/strong&gt; While postwar justice, economic recovery, and social welfare are ideal components of durable agreements, Russia’s hardline stance makes concessions on war crimes trials unlikely. Negotiators must weigh international norms against the need for a practical settlement. One area where leverage remains is economic reparations—seizing frozen Russian assets could support Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The international community will determine whether peace holds.&lt;/strong&gt; Third-party mediation, security guarantees, and long-term enforcement mechanisms will be critical. Recent diplomacy, such as Saudi Arabia’s role in talks, highlights the need for global engagement. However, without credible monitoring and enforcement, a ceasefire could become a temporary pause before renewed conflict. The United States must also balance its security commitments with the reputational risks of demanding economic concessions from Ukraine in exchange for aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI can support negotiations, but it won’t replace strategic judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; Generative AI can help analyze historical agreements, structure policy discussions, and generate alternative scenarios. However, tailored data and expert oversight are essential—AI is a tool for analysis, not a substitute for political decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the analysis demonstrates that issues of territorial claims between the two belligerents, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine, will be core factors shaping any peace negotiations. In all variations of the deal generated by RAG, these issues emerged as key points of dialogue. Moreover, the findings align with ongoing political developments, as discussions of peace underscore the prominence of these themes. Model analysis of the collected texts indicates significant barriers to Ukraine’s NATO accession. However, this may not be the case for Ukraine attaining post-conflict security guarantees from Europe or the United States. The importance of these factors has been driven home by the recent discussions of a peace deal in both Munich and Saudi Arabia. Within these contexts, European states have proposed stationing forces in Ukraine for peacekeeping purposes, while Russia has demanded a retraction of the 2008 promise to allow Ukraine to join NATO at a future date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, making progress in these areas will require Ukrainian involvement. Notably, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia in hopes of diminishing the legitimacy of the recent talks between the United States and Russia. Policymakers must recognize that Ukraine retains the agency to accept or reject any deal, even amid an increasingly precarious military situation. This report’s analysis of historical peace agreements suggests that establishing a clear agenda and methodology for negotiations is important for achieving success. Future negotiations must acknowledge that this framework needs to include key political actors, such as Ukraine and Europe, to ensure a durable peace. Zelensky himself has emphasized this necessity, stating, “For the war to end with a reliable and lasting peace, no mistakes must be allowed. This is possible only when negotiations are fair, and guarantees are developed with the participation of all those who are truly capable of providing them.” Excluding Ukraine and Europe from the negotiation process could, therefore, have detrimental consequences. While the Trump administration may perceive direct talks with Moscow as the most expedient path to an agreement, such an approach risks undermining the legitimacy and sustainability of any potential settlement if key players are not involved. The fact is, research indicates that successful peace negotiations should not prioritize expediency at the expense of exclusivity, as agreements that exclude critical parties are less likely to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in terms of themes across the data specific to a Ukrainian peace deal, model output illustrates that issues of territorial integrity and Ukrainian neutrality emerge as key points of concern. For example, the model identifies that difficulties in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are likely to center around each country’s competing territorial claims and how territory currently occupied by Russian forces will be divided among the belligerents.

However, due to long-term security concerns, the data suggests that Ukraine would likely prefer to join NATO to help guarantee that Russia will not take advantage of a ceasefire to rearm for a new stage in the conflict down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, generating a deal more desirable to Ukraine using RAG required specific prompting to direct the model to create a deal more favorable to Ukrainian interests. In this version of the deal, Ukraine is directed to initially retain its neutrality but has the freedom to join international organizations, such as NATO, in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s analysis, combining historical research and AI-driven modeling, identifies four core takeaways for policymakers navigating ongoing peace negotiations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

While full NATO membership may face obstacles, alternative security guarantees from Europe or the United States could provide a viable path forward. However, Ukraine must be an active participant in negotiations—excluding Kyiv and focusing talks solely between Moscow and Washington risks backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI can support negotiations, but it won’t replace strategic judgment.&lt;/strong&gt; Generative AI can help analyze historical agreements, structure policy discussions, and generate alternative scenarios. However, tailored data and expert oversight are essential—AI is a tool for analysis, not a substitute for political decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the analysis demonstrates that issues of territorial claims between the two belligerents, as well as security guarantees for Ukraine, will be core factors shaping any peace negotiations. In all variations of the deal generated by RAG, these issues emerged as key points of dialogue. Moreover, the findings align with ongoing political developments, as discussions of peace underscore the prominence of these themes.

However, this may not be the case for Ukraine attaining post-conflict security guarantees from Europe or the United States.

&lt;p&gt;That said, making progress in these areas will require Ukrainian involvement. Notably, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky postponed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia in hopes of diminishing the legitimacy of the recent talks between the United States and Russia. Policymakers must recognize that Ukraine retains the agency to accept or reject any deal, even amid an increasingly precarious military situation. This report’s analysis of historical peace agreements suggests that establishing a clear agenda and methodology for negotiations is important for achieving success.

The fact is, research indicates that successful peace negotiations should not prioritize expediency at the expense of exclusivity, as agreements that exclude critical parties are less likely to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, generative AI, particularly techniques for refining LLM outputs like RAG and chain-of-thought prompting, can provide valuable insights for policymakers working toward a Ukraine-Russia peace settlement. When applied correctly, AI can summarize historical peace agreements, identify key negotiation patterns, and test alternative settlement scenarios. However, for AI to be effective in shaping the Ukraine peace process, it must be integrated thoughtfully alongside expert judgment and real-time intelligence. Policymakers should consider the following best practices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AI for comparative analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; AI can assess past conflicts involving territorial disputes, security guarantees, and international mediation, offering insights into potential roadblocks and successful settlement strategies. When combined with basic data science and statistical methods, this approach provides a solid analytical foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying structured prompting.&lt;/strong&gt; Logical, step-by-step questioning improves AI-generated outputs, ensuring they align with Ukraine’s core interests and avoid assumptions favoring Russian demands. Documenting the structure of the prompt sequence also enables alternative analyses, which are critical for complex policy issues like war termination and peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporating expert validation.&lt;/strong&gt; AI-generated scenarios must be assessed by national security experts—from diplomats to military leaders—to determine their feasibility given current political and battlefield realities. This validation process can further refine model outputs through techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customizing data inputs.&lt;/strong&gt; AI must be trained on the latest intelligence and negotiation positions, not just historical agreements, to ensure relevance in a fast-changing conflict. The challenge for analysts is how to weight current events in relation to the larger model and key concepts derived from techniques like graph theory and how models understand key relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging AI for scenario planning.&lt;/strong&gt; By generating multiple versions of a peace agreement—from minimal ceasefire terms to comprehensive security frameworks—AI can help negotiators assess trade-offs and anticipate Russian counteroffers as counterfactuals. This type of analysis supports the identification of key negotiation positions that maximize U.S., Ukrainian, and European interests across the broadest range of possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, AI is not a substitute for human negotiation, nor can it fully capture the complexity of war termination in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The war’s evolving nature presents challenges that AI alone cannot resolve. AI struggles to adapt to rapid shifts in U.S., European, and Ukrainian political dynamics, as models trained on past agreements cannot account for these changes without constant data updates. Additionally, without precise prompting, AI-generated peace scenarios risk defaulting to compromises that align with neither the United States’ nor Ukraine’s national interests. While AI can highlight broad themes like territorial disputes and ceasefire terms, it lacks specificity on implementation details such as monitoring mechanisms, verification protocols, and postwar security guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These gaps underscore that policymakers must avoid treating AI as a shortcut to diplomacy. AI can help structure negotiations, but it can’t replace strategy. War termination is ultimately a political process, not a computational exercise. While AI-driven tools like RAG can surface insights from historical agreements and test potential settlement scenarios, peace is achieved through intelligence assessments, strategic trade-offs, and tough diplomatic engagement—not automated outputs alone. This analysis suggests that AI tools do not serve as a replacement for human judgment, expertise, and creativity. Nor can models independently align with the political and strategic goals of their users, nor account for human factors such as emotion or individual leadership characteristics that shape foreign policy outcomes. To make AI useful, policymakers must treat it as a force multiplier, not a decisionmaker. That requires constantly refining prompts, integrating the latest battlefield and political intelligence, and applying expert validation to ensure AI-generated insights align with Ukraine’s security needs and long-term stability. The key isn’t just using AI—it’s using it wisely, critically, and in service of strategic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
