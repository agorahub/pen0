&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周五（23日）在高等法院踏入第79天審訊，法官張慧玲第6天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官總結本案多名專家的供詞，當中針對警方於香港華仁書院附近搜獲的一大一細土製炸彈，專家指內含鐵釘增加威力，若有人在繁忙街道放置炸彈，可造成400米範圍內嚴重人命傷亡。至於在「屠龍」貨倉中被檢取的伸縮棍，法官重申伸縮棍與本案的控罪無關，即使認為「屠龍」成員曾在示威中使用，均屬「不被控告的行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官專家指兩土製炸彈可致嚴重傷亡&quot;&gt;官：專家指兩土製炸彈可致嚴重傷亡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周四總結指，案中唯一作供被告李家田，供稱被警方上門拘捕時，遭拳打腳踢及多次用水刑，又被威嚇會對其母親不利，稱自己在警方的引導下作出招認。而拘捕警員則於庭上否認李遭受警暴。法官另覆述被告賴振邦的案情，提到辯方曾指警員嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，而警員於庭上否認。法官指，由於賴選擇不作供，故本案沒有相關證供，陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周五續引述本案各專家證人的證供，當中涉案於香港華仁書院附近被搜獲的一大一細炸彈，分別有8及2公斤炸藥，由改裝手提電話遙距控制引爆。經專家檢驗後發現，炸彈內有鐵釘以增加威力，而引爆威力達半徑400米。若有人在繁忙街道放置炸彈，可造成400米範圍內嚴重人命傷亡。而炸彈中亦被發現有具爆炸性化學物品「HMTD」及炸藥「ANFO」等。專家指「ANFO」屬高性能爆炸品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官伸縮棍與本案控罪無關&quot;&gt;官：伸縮棍與本案控罪無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「屠龍」於荃灣貨倉被檢取的11支伸縮棍，政府化驗所化驗師吳嘉豪曾檢驗。法官提醒陪審團，伸縮棍與本案的控罪無關，即使認為「屠龍」成員曾於示威活動中使用，進行暴動或非法集結，均屬「不被控告的行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案涉及大量 Telegram 訊息，而警方又以程式 Cellebrite 擷取涉案手提電話的資料。法官亦分別引述 Telegram 及 Cellebrite 專家的證供，提到 Cellebrite 可復原部分被刪除的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官另引述財務專家的意見，此專家曾分析涉案戶口交易紀錄及金額等，包括黃振強及劉佩凝的戶口。專家報告沒有總結指有眾籌情況出現，但指戶口的匯款模式類似眾籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由法官張慧玲及3男6女陪審團審理。7名被告依次為張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦、許湛榮及劉佩凝，起訴時年齡介乎20至29歲不等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周四（22日）在高等法院踏入第78天審訊，法官張慧玲第5天總結供詞及引導陪審團。就案中唯一作供被告李家田的證供，法官總結指，李供稱被警方上門拘捕時，遭拳打腳踢及多次用水刑，又被威嚇會對其母親不利，稱自己在警方的引導下作出招認。而拘捕警員則於庭上否認李遭受警暴。法官另覆述被告賴振邦的案情，提到辯方曾指警員嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，而警員於庭上否認。法官指，但由於賴選擇不作供，故本案沒有相關證供，陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李家田供稱受襲用刑警否認&quot;&gt;官：李家田供稱受襲、用刑　警否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周三指，陪審團若不信納被告李家田的證供，認為他不只在旁觀察，更有份參與「屠龍」行動，涉暴動、縱火等罪行，但此為本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。官強調，有關行動僅可作背景參考，須考慮控方能否令陪審團肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及曾管有手槍和彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周四續總結李的證供，覆述李供稱在警員上門時遭襲擊及施行水刑，指警員將配槍子彈取出，放在李的手心磨擦，自己在威逼利誘下作出招認。而有份拘捕李的警員作供時，則否認曾暴力對待李，又稱自見到李直至帶他到警署，一直與他在一起，沒有看到有人不當對待李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李稱選擇作供因信法庭畀到公義&quot;&gt;官：李稱選擇作供因信法庭「畀到公義」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官總結指，據李的說法，當警員入屋後，曾帶李家田入廁所，而警署警長馮保羅稱：「我宜家畀機會你，黃振強已經篤到你應一應，你肯講嘅話，我就淨係告你支槍，如果唔係你就好大鑊」；李回應「冇」，隨後被警方施行水刑，又一度被打腹部。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警員又威嚇「同樣嘅情況都可以發生喺你阿媽身上」，李遂表示「支槍唔喺我度，喺鴻仔度。」李又指母親為菲律賓人，不諳粵語，而且自警方入屋後已再沒有見到同住的母親，他亦相當擔心母親的狀況，所以作出招認。隨後警方向他展示一些涉案人物的相片及向他介紹名字，著他記住，但他在錄影會面中則沒有完整覆述這些名字，只提到「強」及「乸乸地」的人等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而李在作供時亦仔細講述了他在錄影會面中，甚麼內容屬實，又有哪一部分是虛構，應警方所需而作出的招認。例如李在會面中供稱曾把手槍保管在綠色袋中，李稱屬虛構。而李在非自願的情況下提供手機密碼。此外，李亦供稱一直相當害怕，但仍選擇出庭作供，因為「法庭係會畀到一個公義我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官賴振邦沒作供沒逼飲滴露等證供&quot;&gt;官：賴振邦沒作供　沒逼「飲滴露」等證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對第五被告賴振邦的案情，辯方曾經指出當警員到「3C 工作室」上門拘捕賴時，警員曾嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，並不斷罵他為「曱甴」，而作供警員則一概不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，賴行使權利沒有作供，故本案中沒有他被逼「飲滴露」等證供，而陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。而賴被捕後亦行使其權利保持緘默，陪審團不可因而對他有不利想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官應考慮賴是否涉案-tg-用戶再考慮串謀否&quot;&gt;官：應考慮賴是否涉案 TG 用戶　再考慮串謀否&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指 Telegram 用戶「接完紙鶴未？」是賴振邦，而賴又曾在訊息介紹自己是 Bobby，而認罪被告彭軍壕口中的 Bobby 是賴。辯方則否認賴是用戶「接完紙鶴未？」及 Bobby。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方曾指，賴振邦的姐夫張堅順曾稱呼賴為「阿邦」，而非 Bobby。而法官引導時則指，家人以中文名字稱呼賴，是否等於他不是 Bobby，陪審團應以常理作判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪被告彭軍壕曾與 TG 用戶「接完紙鶴未？」聯絡，而辯方指「接完紙鶴未？」是另有其人，指彭為了減刑，而剪裁證供、生安白造。法官指，陪審團應考慮賴是否用戶「接完紙鶴未？」，警方檢獲的電話是否屬於賴，再考慮他是否串謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又曾向警員指出，警署警長馮保羅曾帶隊，連同其他警員，在警署內見賴振邦，期間要求賴脫去衣物，只剩下內褲，著其在牆角踎低，有警員不斷喝罵他為「曱甴」等。而有份參與行動的警員則否認曾發生上述事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官重申，由於賴沒有出庭作供，故庭上沒有賴被施襲的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

This report outlines key policy recommendations aimed at strengthening this alliance, enhancing coordination, and ensuring a robust and unified approach to countering threats and preserving peace in the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s intensifying military activities in and around the Taiwan Strait, economic coercion tactics against Taiwan, and aggressive rhetoric about compelling reunification have increased anxiety in Taiwan, across the region, and around the world. These actions increase the prospect of a conflict over Taiwan, either a full-scale Chinese invasion or aggression that falls in the “gray zone” below the threshold of military force. Additionally, an annual report by the U.S. intelligence community suggests that Beijing is aiming to have its military prepared for decisive action to absorb Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, countries are concerned by increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait, but worries are particularly acute in the Indo-Pacific region. That concern does not always translate into concrete action, however, and countries across the region have different calculations on how best to promote stability in the Taiwan Strait and the degree to which direct engagement on the issue serves their national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the United States, Japan, and Australia stand as the anchors of regional stability. And yet, despite the combined power that the three countries bring to the table and the common interests they share in cross-strait stability, the discussion among Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra about preventing and responding to a crisis remains underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As concern about Beijing’s military modernization has intensified in recent years — along with China’s maritime pressure in the East China Sea — the United States and Japan have deepened dialogue on issues related to China. The reality of Japan’s close geographic proximity to Taiwan — a fact brought home by China’s military exercises around the island in August 2022, which included ballistic missile launches that landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone — has prompted the two governments to expand bilateral planning related to a Taiwan contingency. Although still politically sensitive, the openness with which Japanese officials discuss responses to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait today stands in sharp contrast with a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions of Taiwan issues in official channels with Australia are more limited. Concern about the threat posed by China to Australia’s interests closer to home has driven significant change in Australia’s defense posture, to include its commitment to the AUKUS initiatives and a new national defense strategy intended to address the “most challenging strategic environment since the Second World War.” Nevertheless, focus in Australia on cross-strait stability, and Australia’s potential role in a crisis, remains more limited than in Japan. Given the critical role that both Japan and Australia would play in a crisis — economically, diplomatically, and even militarily — improving trilateral coordination related to Taiwan should be a strategic priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help drive a focused discussion among these three critical allies on preserving cross-strait stability, the CSIS Australia Chair, in partnership with the CSIS Japan Chair, brought together 22 leading American, Japanese, and Australian strategic thinkers for two days of Track 2 discussions in Canberra in March 2024. The result was a rich dialogue on current dynamics in cross-strait affairs; the strategic interests at stake in cross-strait stability for the three allies; and opportunities to deepen cooperation on the economic, diplomatic, and military fronts, with the goal of promoting cross-strait stability. The group engaged in a vigorous debate on how to best respond to increased Chinese gray zone coercion and to reinforce deterrence against a potential Chinese use of force to compel unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several key concepts emerged from the two-day conference. Participants in the three countries broadly agreed that they should deepen direct links with Taiwan, both in government and in civil society, deliberately expanding beyond long-standing constraints on official ties; this engagement should include support for Taiwan’s efforts to expand its role in international organizations. Participants also broadly agreed on the need to develop an economic resilience agenda for Taiwan, to limit its vulnerability to Chinese economic coercion by diversifying trade and supply chain links outside of the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On questions of military deterrence, views were more mixed. Some participants advocated for a focused trilateral discussion on sustaining deterrence in the Taiwan Strait, including a division of labor that maximizes the effectiveness of capabilities each country brings to the table. Some Australian participants noted that the national conversation in this area lagged behind that of others; while certain types of trilateral initiatives might provide a useful mechanism to do more, in some areas individual governments need a more proactive list of ways to engage Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the dialogue, CSIS asked each participant to draft a short response to the following question: Given the enormous stakes involved, what more can be done by individual countries and by groupings of like-minded nations to preserve stability in the Taiwan Strait? An expansive question, it was hoped, would generate thoughtful, creative, and novel ideas. This report is the product of those discussions, organized as a compilation of policy recommendations put forward by the individual contributors in the following essays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;us-perspectives&quot;&gt;U.S. Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-potential-for-further-chinese-economic-coercion-against-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Potential for Further Chinese Economic Coercion against Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By James Carouso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun Tzu famously said, “In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. . . . Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.” Chinese president Xi Jinping might be expected to follow this doctrine to realize his goal of bringing Taiwan under China’s control for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s practice of using gray zone tactics to achieve its territorial objectives has been largely successful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Killing fellow ethnic Han, who compose more than 90 percent of both China’s and Taiwan’s populations, in a Taiwan conflict would tarnish the achievement of a reunified China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most Chinese soldiers are only children, meaning their parents have no other offspring. Their deaths could have a severe social backlash, especially if the fighting is drawn out and does not go to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebuilding a destroyed country, especially while fighting an insurgency, would be an expensive and morally draining enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If China does not use military force, other powers would be reluctant to fire the first shot or intervene militarily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A likely strategy for Xi to achieve Taiwan’s surrender of its sovereignty would be through economic strangulation. Xi could announce that any nation that trades with Taiwan would have its exports to China subject to high tariffs, if not outright bans. Moreover, bilateral China-Taiwan trade could end (China accounts for about 25 percent of Taiwan’s total trade and takes 22.6 percent of Taiwan’s exports). In 2010, China cut off exports of rare-earth metals to Japan after a boating collision. Chinese exports of critical minerals could once again be used as a means to coerce third nations into inaction. Harassment of shipping and air traffic could cause associated insurance premiums to reach unsupportable levels, or insurance could become unobtainable if China boycotts shippers and insurance carriers that continue to do business with Taiwan. Chinese air and naval incursions across the Taiwan Strait median line and naval activity to the east of Taiwan seem designed to remind the world that China could quickly end global transport links with the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One indicator of China’s willingness to apply economic coercion to Taiwan without using kinetic acts or a formal blockade occurred in December 2023, a month before Taiwan’s elections, when China suddenly announced that Taiwan had put up trade barriers in contravention of both World Trade Organization rules and its 2010 trade deal. China’s Ministry of Commerce added that these barriers have had a “negative impact” on Chinese companies, implying that China was considering retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan government and key private sector companies have recognized Taiwan’s economic vulnerability and have taken some actions to mitigate the risks. Tsai Ing-wen, following her election as president in 2016, instituted the New Southbound Policy to promote trade and investment with Indo-Pacific nations, besides China. The value of trade with all of these countries increased from $96 billion in 2016 to $180 billion in 2022, and investment flows rose from $2.4 billion in 2016 to $5.3 billion in 2022. In 2022, Taiwan’s investment in these countries combined made up about 35 percent of its total investment abroad, outstripping investment in China for the first time. Nevertheless, China remains Taiwan’s largest single trade partner and stock of outward foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has no intention to economically decouple from China, seeking stability in its bilateral relations. But further diversification of trade and investment would be welcome. Like-minded countries could accelerate this process by agreeing to multilateral trade agreements that include Taiwan. The multilateral approach would reduce China’s ability to retaliate as well as tie Taiwan more broadly into the ex-China global supply chain. The terms of any such agreement would have to include lowering trade barriers and therefore would go beyond the May 2023 trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, just after U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit, China suspended imports of more than 2,000 Taiwanese food products. It banned Taiwanese pineapples, beer, grouper, pomelos, and other goods heavily dependent on the Chinese market. While these goods made up less than 2 percent of Taiwan’s total trade with China, the political intent was clear, especially as it coincided with increased incursions by People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft into Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Taiwan’s government launched campaigns such as #FreedomPineapple asking friendly countries like Japan to import more Taiwanese farm products whenever China imposes a new ban. To prevent similar acts of coercion in the future, like-minded countries should go further and agree on a standby arrangement to lift any trade barriers to Taiwanese goods targeted by China. In addition, they could agree to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to a percentage equivalent to the impact on Taiwan’s exports. A trip wire of this sort would put the onus on China not to weaponize trade with Taiwan unless it is willing to also suffer economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, like-minded nations should continue efforts to insulate themselves from dependence on China for goods critical to national economic security and defense. Efforts to establish more semiconductor foundries outside of Taiwan are useful in worst-case scenarios, but these new foundries still depend on some inputs from China. For example, China began restricting exports of gallium and germanium in July 2023 (it produces 80 percent of the world’s gallium and 60 percent of germanium). Both minerals are essential for production of high-end semiconductors, solar panels, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, China has historically restricted rare-earth exports, though it accounts for more than 90 percent of global production of rare-earth elements. These necessary components are used in more than 200 products across a wide range of applications, especially high-tech consumer products such as cell phones, hard drives, electric and hybrid vehicles, and flat-screen monitors and televisions. Significant defense applications include electronic displays, guidance systems, lasers, and radar and sonar systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various programs are underway to produce these elements outside of China and stockpile them in the interim, China’s manipulation of market prices severely hampers these programs. Like-minded nations need to work together to achieve economies of scale, long-term take-or-pay arrangements with non-Chinese sources, and joint stockpiling agreements to increase security of supply and reduce overall carrying costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that China can use economic means to achieve its ends in Taiwan even if it means a hit to China’s economy. Taiwan and its friends must work together to identify their economic vulnerabilities to China and coordinate to limit the impact of potential Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-states-japan-and-australia-should-bolster-taiwans-economic-resilience&quot;&gt;The United States, Japan, and Australia Should Bolster Taiwan’s Economic Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Bonnie S. Glaser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increasing military threat to Taiwan has prompted the United States and some U.S. allies to sharpen their focus on strengthening deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. Efforts to bolster deterrence include transforming U.S. force posture in the Indo-Pacific to make it more resilient, mobile, distributed, and lethal, as well as helping Taiwan’s military acquire and train with weapons to support a porcupine strategy to deter China from blockading or invading the island. The United States and Japan are enhancing Taiwan Strait deterrence through various actions, such as a plan to enable small detachments of marines to deploy to the Nansei island chain and a decision to equip a U.S. Marine Corps regiment in Okinawa with antiship missiles that can target People’s Liberation Army Navy ships. Numerous U.S. allies have contributed to deterrence by stating publicly that their countries have a stake in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intensified attention by the United States and its allies to shore up military capabilities to defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is necessary and welcome, but an effective strategy to maintain cross-strait peace and stability must also include stronger economic support for Taiwan. Although Taiwan’s economic development has been relatively stable over the last decade, with growth rates averaging 3.2 percent between 2012 and 2022, the island faces growing risks due to overreliance on the Chinese market and relatively weak connections with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Taiwan’s dependence on China has declined in the past few years. Its peak reliance was in 2020, when almost 44 percent of Taiwan’s exports went to mainland China and Hong Kong, while the United States had a 15 percent share. As a result of China’s economic slowdown and an increase in U.S. and European demand for semiconductor chips and other information and communications technology (ICT) products, Taiwan’s exports to China dropped to 35 percent of the total in 2023, the lowest share in 21 years. Meanwhile, the combined shares of exports to the United States, Europe, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries increased by 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad news, however, is that Taiwan is still highly vulnerable. China remains the island’s largest export market and most important trading partner while at the same time posing an immense and growing threat to Taiwan’s security. Beijing is already beginning to ramp up economic coercion as part of its strategy of using gray zone tactics to strangle Taiwan. If Chinese leader Xi Jinping concludes that “possibilities for a peaceful reunification have been completely exhausted,” justifying the use of “non-peaceful means” (the language of Article 8 of the PRC’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law), it could shut down a substantial portion of Taiwan’s trade flows and paralyze key sectors of its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, intensifying strategic tensions between China and the West, as well as China’s stagnating economy, make Taiwan’s reliance on China for economic growth no longer viable. Economic diversification is essential to secure sustainable, modest economic growth in the future. Robust economic support for Taiwan’s economy must therefore be part of a strategy the United States and its allies pursue to enhance Taiwan’s resilience. Concrete steps should be taken to support Taipei’s efforts to foster secure supply chains and negotiate agreements that encourage trade diversification. In 2023, Taiwan was the fourth-, seventh-, and ninth-largest trading partner of Japan, Australia, and the United States, respectively. All three countries should prioritize negotiations with Taiwan on economic and trade issues, with the goal of eventually signing bilateral free-trade agreements (BFTAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration of U.S. president Joe Biden should do its utmost to complete the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on Twenty-First Century Trade this year. Whoever wins the U.S. presidential election should build on that achievement by launching negotiations to sign a BFTA, which has bipartisan congressional support. Canberra should resume talks with Taiwan aimed at a BFTA, which it suspended in 2017 due to pressure from Beijing and fear of retribution. Japan signed an investment accord with Taiwan in 2011, but its close economic relationship with China as well as Taiwan’s ban on food imports from five Japanese prefectures affected by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident have inhibited discussion of a BFTA with Taipei. The latter obstacle was removed in February 2022 when Taipei lifted the import restrictions. As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the name Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, Taiwan has the right to conclude trade agreements with other WTO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to bolster Taiwan’s economic security should also include efforts to expand Taipei’s regional economic interactions. Both Taiwan and the PRC have applied for membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Although the trade pact’s consensus-based accession process poses hurdles to Taiwan’s membership, Tokyo and Canberra should encourage other members to base their positions on approving new members on their readiness and willingness to meet CPTPP criteria. Taiwan’s inclusion would enhance economic security and supply chain resilience in the Indo-Pacific and enable Taiwan to boost exports to CPTPP member countries. Japan has already expressed strong support for Taiwan’s application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra could also join forces to respond directly to China’s intensifying use of economic coercion against Taiwan. For example, they could offer preferential access to their markets for products targeted by Chinese sanctions and support Taiwanese businesses targeted by Chinese pressure through purchase commitments and export credits. In addition, Japan and Australia could strengthen dialogue with Taiwan, either bilaterally or multilaterally alongside the United States, on digital trade, supply chains, international standards setting, critical infrastructure, and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan would still be consistent with the One China policies of the United States, Japan, and Australia. Nevertheless, to reduce PRC concerns, all three allies should explain their intentions to Beijing and reiterate that they will adhere to their respective One China policies and their commitments not to support Taiwan’s independence. Increased economic engagement is essential if like-minded democracies hope to strengthen Taiwan’s resilience and preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-the-economy-of-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Securing the Economy of the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Erin Murphy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s economic security is as important as any military component in a potential Taiwan Strait crisis. Such a conflict would result in mutually assured economic destruction for both China and Taiwan and devastating consequences for the global economy. Economic security in the strait could be strengthened by further engaging Taiwan economically — both through expansion of its semiconductor and high-value electronics industries and involvement in regional trading blocs — and demonstrating to regional partners and key countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) the impact of a strait crisis on their markets. These steps provide more outlets for Taiwan to weather China’s coercive tactics, build more resilient supply chains, and offer more leverage for outside actors to convince both China and Taiwan to pursue peaceful measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan occupies an important place in the global economy, especially for economies in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, accounting for 22.6 percent of total trade in 2022, followed by the United States at 13.3 percent, Japan at 9.7 percent, Hong Kong at 7.3 percent, and South Korea at 6.2 percent. In 2016, Taiwan launched its New Southbound Policy to enhance cooperation in the region, which partially contributed to Taiwan’s business investments in ASEAN exceeding its investments in China for the first time in 2021. Between January and October 2021, Taiwan invested $5.3 billion in ASEAN, most of it funneled to Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, the highest proportion of overall investment in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese companies manufacture close to 70 percent of the world’s semiconductors and approximately 90 percent of the most advanced chips. For example, semiconductors account for a sizable portion of Taiwan’s cumulative $8.9 billion investment in Singapore, led by companies such as United Microelectronics Corporation. In addition, Taiwan plays an outsized role in electronics manufacturing, with its most notable companies, TSMC and Foxconn, providing manufacturing services for leading electronics manufacturers such as, but not limited to, Apple, Dell, Nvidia, and HP. In 2020, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics firm, invested $270 million in Vietnam to produce tablets and laptops, expanding its investment by another $80 million in 2021. The company also invested $350 million in its Indian subsidiary for iPhone production. Moreover, Taiwan is the fifth-largest exporter of machine tools, the primary manufacturer for bicycle brands such as Giant, Merida, and Peloton, and a significant textile and apparel manufacturer, producing products and garments for brands such as Adidas, Lululemon, Nike, and Under Armour. Taiwan is also home to hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of Taiwan’s economy to the global supply chain makes the prospect of a conflict in the strait more daunting. A Rhodium Group assessment concluded that a blockade in the strait without international responses or second-order effects could result in a loss of $2 trillion to the global economy. Trade and investments globally would be affected. A full-on military conflict would be even more devastating, ensuring a collapse of the chips industry and disruption of critical supply chains from China and Taiwan. Countries would be forced to choose to side with China or risk coercive measures from it if in noncompliance with China’s demands. In addition to the real economic consequences, the lives of 23 million Taiwanese and foreign workers would be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stability in the strait may be strengthened by expanding participation in regional trade agreements and frameworks. Economic ties between the United States and Taiwan have strengthened with the advent of bilateral dialogues, development finance collaboration, the 2021 launching of the U.S.-Taiwan Technology Trade and Investment Collaboration supporting cooperation on critical supply chains, and most recently the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade, which was signed into law in August 2023. The initiative is the first major trade agreement approved by Congress and the administration under President Joe Biden that includes specific trade facilitation parameters to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States and Taiwan. This agreement could serve as an example of how governments could navigate tricky political waters and find ways to engage Taiwan economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This engagement on trade and deeper economic integration could be extended to other multilateral agreements as well, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Both Taiwan and China have applied for membership to the CPTPP to join countries from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Although there are serious political considerations regarding Taiwan’s membership, CPTPP members should also weigh the consequences of letting in China without Taiwan and the impact on stability in the strait. CPTPP members could also consider a loose affiliation in terms of economic engagement with the Taiwanese economy, particularly on issues such as digital trade and critical supply chains, in which Taiwan has demonstrated experience as a trusted partner and willing participant. Engagement in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, of which Taiwan is a member, is one model for members to work together to address critical economic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also behooves regional allies and like-minded partners to work together when it comes to Chinese economic coercion. The risk of coercive measures from China will certainly rise along with tensions in the strait. While Taiwan has borne the brunt of China’s threats and coercive tactics, China’s measures, including import bans, critical minerals export bans, and other economic threats, have also affected Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. Countries can work together to identify potential targets for coercion and strategies to address punitive measures. Further economic engagement among regional partners could help mitigate the harmful effects of coercion, leading to new markets for products banned by China — such as fruit, wine, and seafood — or finding substitute products should China cease exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, must consider how a conflict could affect them. It is not necessarily a question of choosing sides but how their economies and overseas workers would be directly affected. A conflict in the strait would have a direct impact on their economies, especially as China is one of their largest trading partners and engagement would be severely disrupted. ASEAN should consider urging a peaceful resolution or maintaining the status quo to maintain its members’ stability and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic interdependence has not prevented wars in the past, as evidenced more than once in Europe. But it can cause actors to think twice. A conflict between Taiwan and China would not be limited to their borders and would immediately affect the globe. The United States, its partners and allies, and countries in the Indo-Pacific should find ways to ensure economic stability in the strait, which will contribute toward maintaining the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;underscoring-the-costs-of-aggression-and-benefits-of-restraint-in-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Underscoring the Costs of Aggression and Benefits of Restraint in the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By David Shullman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait is widely understood. A Taiwan crisis could lead to catastrophic conflict and a global economic meltdown. With Chinese leader Xi Jinping seemingly more impatient than his predecessors to unify with Taiwan and rapidly developing People’s Liberation Army (PLA) capabilities to compel unification by force if necessary, the United States and its allies must enhance deterrence and prevent China from taking more aggressive actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the deterrence debate remains confined to a limited set of options primarily revolving around the use of military force. Given the circumstances, more creativity is needed to devise an extended menu of means to enhance deterrence on both sides of the cost-benefit ledger to affect Xi’s decision to use force regarding Taiwan. This means considering actions that may offend both advocates of hard-line positions on China and those who abjure exploiting the insecurities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, more must be done to expand the benefits China expects from restraint. CCP leaders define China’s claim over Taiwan as central to the legitimacy of regime rule. U.S. diplomatic statements and stepped-up engagement with Taiwan in recent years have eroded Beijing’s sense that eventual unification is possible absent the use of force. Washington and its allies must reassure Beijing that, should China refrain from using force, the United States will remain committed to the One China policy, will oppose Taiwan declaring independence, will support resumed cross-strait dialogue, and will not establish a formal defense alliance with Taiwan. If Chinese leaders are convinced that inaction forecloses the possibility of unification, they will not remain invested in restraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genuine commitment to these long-held U.S. positions, frequently communicated privately and publicly to Beijing and U.S. allies in the region, helps expand options for U.S. and allied messaging on the other side of the ledger — the potential costs for Beijing of aggressive moves such as invasion or a military blockade. Options for deterring aggressive Chinese action against Taiwan fall into two broad categories: deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. Deterrence-by-denial strategies are designed to deter action by making China’s objectives toward Taiwan militarily infeasible. Deterrence-by-punishment strategies involve threats to raise the cost of aggression, even if that aggression is successful. Included in this category is the promise of intolerable military and economic retaliation in response to China’s use of force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punishment strategies, however, are inherently less reliable than denial strategies, which offer the stark promise of blocking China from achieving its objectives through overwhelming military capabilities. For punishment strategies to work, they must convince China of allied willingness and resolve to impose punishments and follow through on threats after China has initiated aggression and possibly made significant gains. This fact is particularly important at a time when China’s risk tolerance is growing and deterrence is eroding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenge for the United States and its allies, therefore, is cobbling together enough convincing potential punitive actions across domains — primarily the military domain but also the diplomatic and economic domains — to alter the cost-benefit analysis for Xi such that he would reconsider using force against Taiwan. This is particularly challenging given that Xi is already aware of many of the risks and would use force only if it is worth the expected costs of preventing an intolerable outcome — for example, Taiwan declaring independence or a gradual shift in the military balance that renders China unable to compel unification in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shifting balance of military power in China’s favor suggests that additional types of costs are required to enhance deterrence. Some argue that China already understands the potential costs of a Taiwan conflict and therefore nothing can increase the collective deterrent value of potential punishment. But this is incorrect: more can be done to exploit the CCP’s deepest insecurities regarding its internal stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence is ultimately a “political proposition,” as Stephen Kotkin puts it. Any combination of punitive measures that deters China from aggression against Taiwan succeeds primarily because they prompt fear of economic instability and thus political costs for Xi and the CCP. If deterrence by punishment requires signaling to Xi credible political costs greater than the benefits of an action, then there is value in capitalizing on Xi’s worst fears regarding internal threats to the regime’s legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi needs little convincing about the general risks of internal dissatisfaction and regime insecurity — a subject that consumes much of his attention — or the idea that failure to achieve victory in a military invasion of Taiwan could produce these results. Nor does Xi doubt that his enemies would exploit these vulnerabilities. But he has probably given less attention to the massive economic challenges that would result from Chinese aggression against Taiwan and could compound instability. While Xi probably judges that other countries’ economic interdependence with China may deter them from intervening in a Taiwan crisis, it is not clear he views the economic costs to China itself as an additional reason not to initiate conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. or allied messages of concern that Chinese use of force against Taiwan would prompt economic instability in China could heighten Xi’s unease along these lines, potentially enhancing deterrence. The goal would not be to threaten Chinese leaders but to convey legitimate concerns about the impact of potential Chinese aggression on both regional and Chinese stability. Beijing would naturally reject any such U.S. message as wrongheaded and unwelcome interference in domestic affairs, but that is beside the point. Consistent messaging could enhance deterrence by indirectly amplifying Xi and other leaders’ already potent concerns that the CCP’s enemies will exploit internal instability in the event of anything less than total victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges and risks of incorporating messaging about internal instability resulting from aggression into a deterrent approach would be significant. First, the United States would need to be clear it has no interest in exacerbating China’s instability, which, if extreme, could produce catastrophic results for the Chinese people, the global economy, and U.S.-China relations. This being true in peacetime and during potential conflict, Washington would need to be clear that it would never view Chinese regime destabilization as a war aim. Instead, U.S. messaging would have to underscore concerns that economic crisis and political instability would be a natural consequence of China’s initiation of conflict. Washington would also need to clarify these aims with key Indo-Pacific allies, whose partnership is critical to maintaining stability in the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, the United States and others would have to carefully consider how to raise the salience of domestic instability with Chinese interlocutors. A combination of private conversations with Chinese officials and increased nonofficial public messaging on the subject would be a good start. In addition to conversations allied officials should have with their Chinese counterparts about the potential for conflict over Taiwan to spiral and ultimately lead to a broader war, Washington, and possibly allied governments, could also privately communicate growing concern about the impact of a war on China’s internal situation. Nongovernment researchers could dedicate more attention to the costs of conflict to China’s economy and governance capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added emphasis on the potential internal costs for destabilizing actions in the strait would, of course, be effective only as part of the array of other measures the United States and its allies must take to enhance deterrence. Further buildup of military capabilities to dissuade China from believing it might achieve a swift and painless victory will remain central. The United States and allies must continue to support Taiwan’s defensive “porcupine strategy” and ensure the island can hold out, potentially until U.S. arrival, and China must understand that threats of nuclear use will not dissuade Washington from intervening in a Taiwan crisis. Greater allied coherence on punitive economic and military responses to potential Chinese aggression is also essential. Beijing must be convinced it will face not just U.S. military power but also Japanese and Australian power — an impression that should regularly be underscored through joint military exercises and force posture decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Beijing’s calculus shifting and U.S. regional military dominance no longer tenable, a more robust punitive arsenal of consequences flowing from China’s use of force against Taiwan is required. Washington should be willing both to tolerate the bilateral tension of raising with Chinese interlocutors the internal costs of using force in the Taiwan Strait and to reaffirm long-standing U.S. positions that reassure Beijing that military aggression is unnecessary. Deterrence will be enhanced by guiding Xi toward a course defined by faith in the rewards of restraint and greater concern that aggression may put the CCP’s vital interests at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jennifer Hong Whetsell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During just two weeks in February 2024, 124 aircraft and 74 navy vessels belonging to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were detected around Taiwan. Of those, 47 crossed the median line, entering Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ). Through such actions, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under General Secretary Xi Jinping is attempting to erode the rule of law and threaten Taiwan’s vibrant democracy. To achieve his goal of “reunification,” Xi has intensified gray zone activities in the Taiwan Strait and expanded China’s military, which now rivals that of the United States in terms of capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s increasing coercion across the Taiwan Strait, Russia’s unprovoked war with Ukraine, the potential for the war in Gaza to escalate into a regional conflict, and the deepening relationship between North Korea and Russia, the United States and its allies must explore all avenues to uphold stability in the Indo-Pacific, preventing authoritarian actors from further degrading global peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-deterrence-through-space&quot;&gt;Enhancing Deterrence through Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of scientific, economic, and technological opportunities in the space domain has sparked fierce global competition to launch more spacecraft, proliferate more orbits, have more lunar landings, and generally outperform others in this increasingly promising field. Unfortunately, these endeavors are not all peaceful. Space has become increasingly militarized due to the absence of international safeguards and worsening global tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 15, the White House confirmed that Russia developed a counter-offensive satellite weapon that can disrupt military and civilian communications and harm other space assets if detonated, leading to severe disruptions in space and on Earth. China is also planning a record 100 orbital launches for 2024. Seventy of these launches will collectively send more than 290 spacecraft into orbit, each potentially carrying payloads of advanced satellites with surveillance and other military and intelligence capabilities. In addition to its continued proliferation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, China launched a classified military satellite into geostationary orbit on February 23, raising alarm among U.S. officials. With recent launches and more on the horizon, China will have persistent visual and radar surveillance over strategically important areas throughout the Indo-Pacific. In this aggressive space race, ensuring national security and resiliency requires the ability to monitor activities on the ground from space; augmented Earth-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and uninterrupted access to communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies recognize the importance of the space domain for national security and global stability, as exemplified in recent joint statements. Nonetheless, space cooperation remains nascent. Through collaboration in space, the United States, Japan, and Australia can inhibit the expansionist ambitions of Xi, Russian president Vladimir Putin, and, to an extent, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while establishing rules and norms for space operations and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to strengthen cooperation in this critical domain, Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra need to ensure the three capitals are aligned in their goals and objectives for the space domain, and through the strengthened cooperation, enhance deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FULLY LEVERAGE EACH NATION’S STRENGTHS BY SYNERGIZING THEIR SPACE ASSETS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long been at the forefront of space technology, boasting robust national and commercial infrastructure, extensive experience, and a storied history of successes. It has launched numerous satellites into orbit for both military and civilian purposes. Today, the U.S. government is focused on establishing “mega constellations” for resilient and redundant communications and improving its command and control capabilities by leveraging space assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also a formidable player in the space domain. Recent milestones include its launch of the H3 space rocket and its successful landing of a lunar mission, making it the fifth nation to accomplish this feat. These achievements are particularly noteworthy given Japan’s relatively small budget compared to that of other space-faring nations. Furthermore, Japan’s involvement in space war games, including the Schriever Wargame and other space-based military exercises, sets it apart as one of the few Asian nations to have engaged in such activities. Japan has been training alongside the United States and other allied partners for more than a decade to achieve interoperability for conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Australia does not possess robust military or commercial space assets, compared to the United States and other space-faring nations, its geographic location and vast real estate represent unique strategic assets within the space ecosystem. Australia holds tremendous potential for becoming an instrumental Southern Hemisphere launch site for its missions and those of its allies. Located near the equator, Australia’s northern regions offer a distinct advantage for launching larger payloads into LEO at a more affordable cost. This is due to the Earth’s rotation, which allows rockets to harness additional energy, achieve greater launch velocity, and carry larger payloads more efficiently. Additionally, unlike the United States, Japan, and many other space-faring nations, Australia’s vast uninhabited land provides an opportunity for establishing inland launch facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ technical know-how and experience, Japan’s advanced technological assets and well-trained personnel, and Australia’s valuable real estate and increased access to orbital belts can be collectively leveraged to enhance the effectiveness of each nation’s respective space assets. Through such synergistic collaboration, the three partners can more effectively counter the ambitions of Beijing and Moscow for space dominance, thereby improving stability both in space and on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESTABLISH RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND PROMOTE SPACE SUSTAINABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instability in space is exacerbated by congested orbital belts, overcrowded with debris and satellites, as well as a lack of rules and regulations governing the space domain. The United States has promoted norms for responsible operation in space through multilateral and international platforms, both new (e.g., Artemis Accords, antisatellite test bans) and existing (e.g., UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space). It has been successful in aligning with like-minded nations, such as Japan and Australia. However, Beijing and Moscow have sought to counter such efforts by forming their own regional blocs and advancing destabilizing norms in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with other like-minded nations, the United States, Japan, and Australia can advance more clearly defined rules of engagement for space, establish enforcement mechanisms, and promote space sustainability. The current dearth of norms and rules of engagement implicitly sanctions Beijing and Moscow to continue engaging in dangerous and irresponsible behaviors in space. However, by collaborating to preserve space for responsible use and operations, the United States, Japan, Australia, and other like-minded nations can deter Beijing and Moscow from employing space assets and technologies that threaten peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps-strengthening-deterrence-from-space&quot;&gt;Next Steps: Strengthening Deterrence from Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, Japan, and Australia should expand cooperation in the space domain to strengthen deterrence and uphold stability in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific by considering the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue to elevate the topic of space and norm setting within bilateral and multilateral dialogues and exercises, shaping the space environment to be operated with peace and sustainability in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursue specific cooperative efforts in such areas as sharing data, improving space domain awareness, and cross-training military and intelligence personnel. Continue to elevate space domain exercises with each other and invite other like-minded partners to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest more in domestic space infrastructure, including constructing ISR-capable satellites, developing capabilities that facilitate interoperability, and promoting technological advancements in the commercial space sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decrease barriers to cooperation between the three nations by reviewing and amending technology transfer regulations and classification levels in the areas that would benefit from enhanced cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation in the space domain is complex because alignment of key factors, such as technical capability and capacity, trust in intent and practice, and sharing of common threat pictures, is crucial to continuity and success. Today, due to differing priorities, the United States, Japan, and Australia share many, but not all, of these factors. However, given the current threats in the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific, as well as the advancing capabilities of actors whose motivations are not always clear or good, the three countries cannot afford to delay proactive cooperation in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;japanese-perspectives&quot;&gt;Japanese Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countering-xi-jinpings-expanding-domestic-governance&quot;&gt;Countering Xi Jinping’s Expanding Domestic Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Masuo Chisako&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, China has been engaged in a massive, unprecedented military buildup. When discussing the risks surrounding Taiwan, China’s neighbors and Western countries tend to focus on China’s military threat. Unlike under the presidency of Hu Jintao, however, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has shown little sign of involvement in Beijing’s foreign policy in recent years. Although Chinese president Xi Jinping has consolidated political control over the PLA, he does not trust it and purged many of its high commanders in 2023. Since the PLA has turned into a “difficult” organ for Xi to use, he is unlikely to invade Taiwan by force in the immediate future. Instead, he might seek “unification” of Taiwan through other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s centralization of power has considerably changed the nature of Chinese policymaking. Simply put, the regime is increasingly inclined to deal with international problems in the same manner as it does domestic ones. Xi’s decisionmaking team has relied heavily on the staffs that belong to the chain-of-command structure under the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission in the Chinese Communist Party, such as police and national security agents, to consolidate his supreme power domestically. Now the same team is calling for “centralized and unified leadership” in foreign policy. Xi has emphasized the importance of security, as he believes domestic and foreign threats are working in tandem to overthrow the Chinese communist regime. To prevent such a possibility, the administration tries to “plan for external and domestic security in an integrated manner.” Because the Xi administration does not clearly distinguish between the issues inside and outside of China’s borders, it has increasingly applied domestic governance methods to deal with external issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these conditions, two actions — (1) analyzing China’s maritime national program and (2) expanding Taiwan’s international role — should be pursued to upgrade cooperation among democracies to deter China from taking aggressive measures against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analyzing-chinas-maritime-national-program&quot;&gt;Analyzing China’s Maritime National Program&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the maritime contents of China’s territorial and spatial program, launched in 2021, allows for deeper investigation of China’s preparations to expand its effective control over the sea and air surrounding Taiwan. At the same time, it is important to study China’s new infrastructure construction and collect data on Chinese maritime behaviors. The latter effort includes the development of new technologies to intercept Chinese satellite systems such as BeiDou and monitor the behaviors of Chinese official and private vessels using signals other than the Automatic Identification System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the starting year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, China launched a national territorial and spatial program that stipulates the usage, development, and conservation of the 3 million square kilometers of water jurisdiction (管轄海域) it claims, making use of its own satellite and digital technology. Since about a half of the water is disputed with neighboring states, this serves as an action plan for China to expand its effective control substantially in the name of domestic governance. The East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and South China Sea are equally under pressure from Chinese state planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, China attempted to expand its effective control of Taiwan’s Kinmen Island by using a fishing boat incident as an excuse. This follows a similar pattern to a Chinese fishing vessel incident that occurred in Japanese waters near the Senkaku Islands in 2010. The China Coast Guard (CCG), headed by the Central Military Commission since 2018, is responsible for establishing domestic control over claimed territory, whereas the PLA prepares against external threats. As a result, the CCG has been taking new measures to increase pressure on Taiwan in the name of domestic administration, seeking to fulfill established targets related to the national territorial and spatial program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for Taiwan and its liberally minded global counterparts to track those developments and deter China from taking further actions. However, it will be more and more difficult in near future as China is creating new types of infrastructure that can lay a foundation to implement its military-civil fusion strategy. Various satellite constellations centered on BeiDou, including the ones that enable space-based broadband communications, have been combined with the underwater surveillance system in preparation for contingencies when the PLA needs to mobilize private vessels and air/sea drones. Countries need to work together to study China’s new program and to increase maritime defense awareness against Beijing by monitoring and countering its new technology. This effort can also improve preparedness against it in the East and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-taiwans-international-role&quot;&gt;Expanding Taiwan’s International Role&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been engaged in a competition for diplomatic recognition with Taiwan in an attempt to extinguish the island’s identity and influence from international fora. Chinese pressure has intensified since Taiwanese president-elect Lai Ching-te’s victory in January 2024. Taiwan maintains its international presence in advanced semiconductor production, but this presence should be secured and upgraded amid the hardening international competition between the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated above, the organizations directed by the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission have gained political power in China as they have contributed to Xi’s growing domestic supremacy in recent years. They include the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of National Security, and Ministry of Justice. All of those bodies are now directed by Xi Jinping’s old and close allies. As China’s security pact with the Solomon Islands and its police cooperation with other South Pacific island countries illustrate, such forces have also extended their influence over foreign relations. In simple terms, China’s version of the KGB, that performs domestic surveillance and has helped to centralize power in Xi’s hands, is transforming China’s international approach. It naturally prefers secretive infiltration operations, in both domestic affairs and external relations, such as controlling the internet, diffusing fake news, bribing with money and benefits, and exerting influence through religious, cultural, and academic exchanges. Its activities are conducted using the latest information technology and are likely to consolidate pro-China authoritarian regimes in developing countries. China’s recent efforts to form a global partnership network seek to make these governance models and technologies available to developing countries as international public goods. This can accelerate international competition between democracies and autocracies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this picture, Taiwan has the best-developed measures to tackle Chinese infiltration efforts due to its abundant experience. Other like-minded countries need to learn from it. If the preventive measures developed in Taiwan can be systematically shared and improved upon among global democracies and offered to developing countries, the spread of Chinese autocracy can be mitigated or prevented. Perhaps establishing a private center in Taiwan that studies anti-infiltration methods and trains relevant personnel from all over the world is a good idea for advancing Taiwan’s international presence. To this end, it is also necessary for Western countries to position Taiwan as a bridgehead for securing democracy in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;articulating-a-regional-deterrence-architecture&quot;&gt;Articulating a Regional Deterrence Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main strategic objective of China’s campaign to use force to unify Taiwan would be to force Taiwan to give up the indefinite continuation of the status quo and agree to eventual unification with a timeline. China’s growing nuclear arsenal will generate strong concern over the so-called stability-instability paradox and illuminate the significance of establishing conventional deterrence. The central question regarding conventional deterrence of Chinese armed aggression against Taiwan is whether Taiwan and other parties can credibly demonstrate the necessary will and ability to convince China it has no prospect of succeeding in forced unification with Taiwan. Australia, Japan, and the United States (hereafter “the coalition”), together with Taiwan and other willing and able states, need to send at least three messages to China in credible ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China cannot win a short, sharp war to unify Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China cannot prevail in a protracted war over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s arms buildup will be met with multinational balancing and will not deliver military dominance in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) likely has multiple war plans based on various assumptions. If China assumes unification is possible only by full-scale invasion of Taiwan, achieving the main goal of deterrence and response requires at least three lines of effort: (1) dislodge the invading forces that must cross the Taiwan Strait (deterrence by denial), (2) fend off PLA attacks to destroy coalition forces capable of targeting the invading forces and sustain the war-fighting effort (deterrence by resilience), and (3) continuously gain advantage in the competition with the opponent (deterrence by cost imposition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these lines of effort requires various missions and capabilities. Table 1 illustrates missions and capabilities that potentially contribute to these three types of deterrence; some have been extracted from the 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy. Different countries have different capabilities and are capable of different missions. Ultimately, their decision to use those capabilities and carry out certain missions will be political. However, for the purposes of deterrence, it makes sense to notionally identify typologies of states that will need to implement the missions and employ those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9dVoh8D.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Missions and Capabilities for Deterrence Roles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Table 1, frontline states will need to implement more expansive missions and capabilities (Tier 1), whereas supporting states will focus more on resilience- and denial-related efforts to support frontline states (Tier 2). Backup states will provide functional cooperation (Tier 3) to the frontline and supporting states. These are ideal types of roles for response and deterrence, but the framework permits identifying areas that allow for capability aggregation and require mission coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of Taiwan’s security, the Tier 1 role would need to be played primarily by Taiwan and the United States, while the Tier 2 and 3 roles would likely be played by Australia, Japan, and the United States. Japan assuming a larger share of the Tier 2 and 3 roles would have strategic implications for coalitional deterrence, and certain efforts could be facilitated by trilateral cooperation among Australia, Japan, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections (1) examine how Japan can contribute to credible deterrence messaging and (2) propose ways the coalition can cooperate to reinforce those messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-a-short-sharp-war-strengthening-the-coalitions-ability-to-dislodge-the-pla-invasion-force&quot;&gt;Deterring a Short, Sharp War: Strengthening the Coalition’s Ability to Dislodge the PLA Invasion Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Japanese government decided to fundamentally bolster Japan’s defense capabilities. The effort will enable it to carry out limited offensive operations and consequently allow the United States to focus more on the defense of Taiwan and the role of defeating PLA invasion forces. Japan’s decision to fundamentally bolster its defense consists of strengthening seven kinds of capabilities: (1) standoff capabilities, (2) integrated air and missile defense, (3) uncrewed systems, (4) cross-domain operation (mainly space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic) capabilities, (5) command and control and intelligence, (6) logistics and civil defense, and (7) sustainment and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Japan’s defense strategy has involved offensive operations by U.S. forces and defensive operations by Japan (the “American spear” and the “Japanese shield”). However, Japan’s new capabilities, such as counterstrike and active cyber defense, go beyond traditional defensive operations. If realized, these capabilities will enable Japan to assume certain offensive operations, as Japan eventually needs to assume defensive and offensive military operations to defend its territory. This, in turn, will free up U.S. forces previously devoted to the defense of Japan and allow them to concentrate more on the defense of Taiwan. In essence, the division of labor between Japan and the United States will evolve from function based (using the spear and shield to defend Japan) to theater based (Japan defending itself and the United States defending Taiwan). In other words, Japan’s defense capability buildup will allow Japan to assume a larger portion of the Tier 2 role and thereby enable the United States to focus more on the Tier 1 role and enhance overall deterrence vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should accelerate acquisition of the following capabilities required to fulfill the Tier 2 role: (1) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in various domains, (2) missiles and platforms capable of long-range precision strikes against PLA Navy ships and PLA Air Force aircraft, (3) missiles and platforms capable of neutralizing the PLA’s ability to wage missile salvo attacks against Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) bases, and (4) a close command and control architecture that will enable effective counterstrike operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s weapons systems and munitions should be interoperable with the United States, Australia, and preferably Taiwan to facilitate wartime sustainment and replenishment. Joint capability development of certain weapons systems such as hypersonic and counter-hypersonic weapons and uncrewed undersea vehicles (UUVs) should be pursued based on common standards to maximize interoperability. Technocratic arguments against Japan joining the second pillar of AUKUS, the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, deserve attention, but Japan’s participation in certain pillar two programs to maximize interoperability makes sense from a strategic point of view. Japan’s information security issues should be cleared as soon as possible to facilitate multipronged efforts to advance joint capability development with the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enduring-in-a-protracted-war-enhancing-resilience-and-sustainment-capacity&quot;&gt;Enduring in a Protracted War: Enhancing Resilience and Sustainment Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s strategic goal in any effort to defend Taiwan is to maintain the capability and the resolve to keep up the fight if deterrence fails. In other words, Japan must have the resilience and endurance required for a protracted conflict. Japan must push forward full steam ahead on national efforts to harden JSDF bases and facilities and rapidly build up gaps in civil defense architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building resilient networks for the JSDF and the Japanese government’s digital systems and critical infrastructure will prove decisive in enduring any conflict involving China. In the event of a crisis or contingency over Taiwan, sophisticated Chinese cyberattacks taking various forms will likely overwhelm Japan’s cyber defense capacity — a major vulnerability in the coalition. Japan needs to rapidly build up its capability for cyber defense both through a robust cyber unit development program and enhanced joint exercises and training with the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During crises, China would very likely conduct information operations to dissuade the Japanese public from supporting U.S. operations to defend Taiwan. China would likely generate a war scare among the Japanese public to break Japanese public resolve; it would also attempt to deepen divisions in Japanese public opinion over the issue of whether and how Japan should get involved in a Taiwan contingency. Australia, Japan, and the United States should advance information sharing about the pattern of Chinese and foreign disinformation, and cooperation in the counter-disinformation realm should also be pursued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area for cooperation is reinforcement of munition production capacity. There should be a major international effort among the United States and its allies — including Australia and Japan — to expand munitions production capacity. To create an environment that encourages further investment by defense companies in production capacity, the governments of Australia, Japan, and the United States should consult on possible demands over the next 5 to 10 years to communicate prospects for munitions procurement to the defense industries of the three countries. Coproduction of certain missiles should move forward without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persistent-and-sustainable-balancing-demonstrating-unity-of-effort&quot;&gt;Persistent and Sustainable Balancing: Demonstrating Unity of Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, Japan, and the United States should send a signal to China that its arms buildup will be met with multinational balancing. The three countries should coordinate various lines of effort to increase deterrence through joint capability development and mutual reinforcement of resilience and sustainment. Unity of effort among Australia, Japan, and the United States should be demonstrated through joint declarations in appropriate forms. One possible format would be a biannual trilateral foreign and defense ministers’ meeting, or a “2+2+2” meeting. The Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) and Japan-U.S. 2+2 meeting could be held back to back, and the trilateral could be held in between. The process of issuing a joint declaration would compel defense and foreign ministries to coordinate various programs and explore new initiatives aimed at strengthening deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing to build credible conventional deterrence in the Indo-Pacific will compel Australia, Japan, and the United States to depend more on U.S. theater nuclear forces. Consequently, if deterrence fails, the coalition will likely face a stark choice between submission and U.S. nuclear escalation. To maintain strategic options and avoid such an eventuality, conventional deterrence and response must be strengthened and made more credible in a short period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restoring-balance-in-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Restoring Balance in the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Teraoka Ayumi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;actions-short-of-violating-one-china-policies&quot;&gt;Actions Short of Violating One China Policies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “status quo” in the Taiwan Strait — broadly defined as Taiwan’s continued de facto independence from mainland China — is increasingly under challenge. Although Beijing likely prefers a peaceful resolution to a costly war in achieving the “reunification” of Taiwan, it is engaging in nonpeaceful measures short of war to coerce the people in Taiwan to accept Beijing’s political demands. Despite Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen’s signals that her government would not seek de jure independence, Beijing closed off dialogues with Taipei by imposing the politically untenable precondition of endorsing the 1992 consensus and working to isolate her government. Now, with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te in May, whom Beijing regards as an even more pro-independent and worse counterpart than Tsai, pathways for the two sides to resume constructive dialogue remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because facts on the ground composing the status quo are far from static, Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington should strengthen ties with Taipei through all measures short of violating or changing their respective One China policies. One primary objective of such efforts is to prevent Beijing from challenging the status quo even further, including through a full-scale military invasion of Taiwan. Another is to restore Taiwan to a state where the government can engage in positive dialogue with Beijing without feeling pressured to concede excessively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recognizing-the-value-of-high-level-visits&quot;&gt;Recognizing the Value of High-Level Visits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Taiwan has become an increasingly popular destination for bipartisan delegations of lawmakers from Australia, Japan, and the United States, among others. Japanese parliamentary delegations to Taipei, often led by the Japan–Republic of China Diet Members’ Consultative Council, have been expanding in size; one comprised the first foreign visitors to congratulate Lai on his victory in the presidential election. In May, more than thirty Japanese lawmakers attended his inauguration ceremony. Since the summer of 2021, the consultative council has held strategic dialogues with legislative representatives from Taiwan and the United States under an initiative led by former Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo and U.S. senator Bill Hagerty. Twice in 2023, the ruling parties in Japan and Taiwan — the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Progressive Party — convened 2+2 meetings involving senior parliamentarians well versed in security and diplomatic issues. High-ranking members of the LDP, such as vice president, Taro Aso, and the then chair of the LDP Policy Research Council, Koichi Hagiuda, visited Taiwan last year. These activities will likely continue regardless of the current domestic political instability in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s subnational actors are also following this trend. Tokyo Metropolitan governor Yuriko Koike visited Taipei in early February to meet with President Tsai, Vice President and President-Elect Lai, and Taipei mayor Chiang Wan-an, who all agreed to enhance cooperation between the two cities. During a meeting with Taiwan’s minister of digital affairs, Audrey Tang, Koike also expressed interest in bolstering cooperation with Taiwan for Tokyo’s digital transformation. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has the tradition of including Taipei in its para-diplomatic outreach, such as the Asian Network of Major Cities 21. As Japan aims to strengthen its informational resilience against cyberattacks and mis-and disinformation operations, including in times of contingencies, its local governments might offer avenues for further cooperation with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of forging and maintaining durable and broad public support for Taiwan in these democratic societies cannot be overstated. In its absence, no costly action in support of Taiwan, whether in peacetime or during contingencies, would be possible for these governments. High-level visits, serving as signs of expanding bipartisan political support for Taiwan, are important in this context and provide moral support for the Taiwanese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tangible-steps-to-enhance-taiwans-resilience&quot;&gt;Tangible Steps to Enhance Taiwan’s Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these visits remain at the level of cheap talk, failing to produce measures to help Taiwan materially or credibly signal to Beijing the resolve of the United States and its partners to defend the status quo around Taiwan. Australia, Japan, and the United States should work to translate their ever-expanding yet relatively low-cost domestic political support for Taiwan into tangible steps toward enhancing Taiwan’s resilience in all dimensions of statecraft, including diplomacy, information, the military, and the economy. Examples include supporting Taiwan’s entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and conducting joint training and intelligence sharing with parts of the Taiwanese government in both traditional and nontraditional areas of security, including space, cyberspace, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, then, is how to realize this shift, since these steps are considered “costly” precisely because they may incite Beijing’s backlash. Two considerations are critical. The first is coordinated strategic communication among Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington to frame any enhanced ties with Taipei as efforts to offset Beijing’s increasingly aggressive postures in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing must receive consistent messages that draw a clear linkage between its behavior and signals of international support for Taiwan. Accordingly, if Beijing credibly softens its position, then these activities must be either curtailed or compensated through other accommodating measures offered to Beijing. Questions about reversibility or offset options must also be considered for various measures of cooperation with Taiwan in case of Beijing’s acquiescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Australia and Japan, as former victims of China’s economic sanctions, should lead efforts — with support from the United States — to build multilateral economic resilience. In anticipation of China’s responses to these countries’ closer ties with Taiwan, they should craft joint countermeasures, such as diversification strategies away from the Chinese market. Taking these steps and publicizing them widely will reduce the psychological impact of possible Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated strategic messaging among Australia, Japan, and the United States must show (1) that enhanced measures with Taiwan are tied to China’s changing grounds in the Taiwan Strait and (2) that these governments have already thought through countermeasures for China’s economic coercion with great care and coordination. Such messaging will help policymakers navigate domestic politics and garner broader support from other like-minded major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is necessary for pushing forward more sensitive areas of security cooperation with Taiwan but will also be important in the areas of boosting Taiwan’s diplomatic and economic resilience through multilateral forums, especially where the United States is absent. For instance, the CPTPP — which was saved by Japan’s leadership after U.S. withdrawal from its original form, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — remains one of the most strategic and advanced multilateral trade agreements to enhance the rules-based economic order in the Asia Pacific. To preserve the legitimacy of this new economic institution, Japan, with the help of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, should seriously review China’s and Taiwan’s bids for entry. CPTPP membership does not require statehood, and CPTPP members should act collectively to support Taiwan’s entry based on their fair review of candidate’s readiness and willingness to play by the rules. In this process, CPTPP members open to Taiwan’s entry should also consider establishing a new, smaller multilateral trade framework among themselves as an interim step. Continuous encouragement of U.S. reentry to the CPTPP should also not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating growing political support for Taiwan into tangible measures despite risk of Chinese retaliations is a signal of regional stakeholders’ resolve to preserve the status quo, the peace and stability in the region, and the rules-based international order. These signals of support should also help the new Lai government navigate its contested domestic political environment and any new opportunities for dialogues with Beijing. Of course, Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington should also coordinate closely with Taipei to maintain shared strategic aims toward Beijing throughout this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-build-a-bridge-over-a-troubled-strait&quot;&gt;To Build a Bridge over a Troubled Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Tokuchi Hideshi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Asia, positioned at the forefront of the great power rivalry, is a tinderbox with three nuclear authoritarian states and several flash points, including the Taiwan Strait. Because the region lacks an overarching security framework, a cluster of U.S. bilateral alliances works as the stabilizer. The hub-and-spokes alliance system is becoming more networked than ever but is still not fully integrated. For example, the Japan–South Korea relationship is rapidly improving but remains fragile. The Philippines seems to have made a strategic choice to be tougher on China, but it is uncertain how long this will hold due to the unwillingness of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to make a binary choice between the great powers. Finally, Taiwan, one of the leading regional partners of the United States, is not officially included in the U.S. bilateral alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-in-east-asian-international-relations&quot;&gt;Recent Developments in East Asian International Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GROWING PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several new security initiatives in the region include the Quad, a strategic dialogue and cooperation between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, and AUKUS, a strategic security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quad is evolving to engage with other partners, such as France, while AUKUS also has potential to evolve, as AUKUS partners are “considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Japan renewed their Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation in October 2022, which states, “We will consult each other on contingencies that may affect our sovereignty and regional security interests, and consider measures in response.” In May 2023, Japan and the United Kingdom committed themselves “to consult each other on important regional and global security issues and consider measures in response” by issuing the Hiroshima Accord. The partnership between Japan, South Korea, and the United States has new momentum, according to “The Spirit of Camp David” joint statement of August 2023, which announced the three countries’ “commitment to consult with each other in an expeditious manner to coordinate our responses to regional challenges, provocations, and threats that affect our collective interests and security.” This commitment does not necessarily mean joint contingency planning or military action, but their operational cooperation to address common challenges, presumably including Taiwan contingencies, likely will be enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partners are cooperating more closely than ever, sharing a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP). Moreover, the vision is evolving, as with Japan’s New Plan for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” launched by Prime Minister Kishida Fumio in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GROWING ATTENTION TO THE TAIWAN STRAIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan will remain a focal point of East Asian security because China has the ultimate goal of unification of Taiwan. For China, the Taiwan issue is at the core of its interests. In November 2023, Chinese president Xi Jinping told U.S. president Joe Biden that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. He also reiterated that China will realize unification and that it is unstoppable. Moreover, China has never denied the prospect of forceful unification. A People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officer said that unification is more precious than peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is increasingly important for industrial democracies in the region and the world, though their national interests related to Taiwan may differ. As far as Japan is concerned, Taiwan’s importance is obvious due to its geographical proximity, shared threat perception on China, trade and economic partnerships, and shared fundamental political principles and values. Since the Japan-U.S. joint statement of April 2021, several diplomatic statements have reiterated “the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” including the Australia-Japan Leaders’ Meeting Joint Statement of October 2022, the Japan-NATO joint statement of January 2023, the G7 Hiroshima Leaders’ Communiqué of May 2023, and “The Spirit of Camp David” in August 2023. The Japanese prime minister’s expression that the “Ukraine of today may be [the] East Asia of tomorrow” may allude to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan’s 2024 presidential election, citizens chose the diplomatic path to strengthen their defense, maintain autonomy, and enhance partnerships with other democracies, including Japan and the United States. Taiwan has proved once again to be a mature democracy. As Rory Medcalf argues, “Taiwan is a democratic model in the Chinese-speaking world. It disproves the nonsense that only Western people cherish a free society.” This fact — as well as Taiwan’s continuous pursuit of autonomy, stronger defense posture, and international partnerships to be more resistant to China’s pressure — will make China tougher on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-proposals&quot;&gt;Policy Proposals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. ENGAGEMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous U.S. engagement in the region, buttressed by robust U.S. military presence, is a must to prevent China’s miscalculation. As an alliance requires mutual cooperation, allies must take the lead and help the United States remain engaged in the region. It is particularly important today as the United States remains divided and seems more inward looking. Regional allies, particularly Japan, must provide a more dependable stationing environment for U.S. forces to operate effectively and promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONNECTING SMALL NETWORKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-centered alliance network, the Quad, AUKUS, and Japan-Europe partnerships should align with each other to generate synergy for deterrence, remaining vigilant over the Taiwan Strait. The Quad leaders’ joint statements lack reference to the Taiwan issue. It is important to work with India to ensure that all four Quad partners share recognition of Taiwan as India’s voice grows in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSFORMING SHARED RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN INTO COOPERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. commitment to Taiwan remains ambiguous. Most countries’ cooperation with Taiwan is limited to a nongovernmental or unofficial basis. Provocation of China will not be in their interests. However, it is in their interests to send a clear message to deter China. Western democracies should not be complacent in their shared recognition of the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is more important to transform this recognition into actual cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL BREATHING SPACE FOR TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Taiwan’s international breathing space narrows, the United States and other democracies, including Japan and Australia, should cooperate to prevent Taiwan from being suffocated. First, Taiwan should not be excluded from international organizations tackling global issues such as the World Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan’s contribution to those issues is indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF) should be utilized more for security purposes. The GCTF is a platform for Taiwan to share its expertise with partners around the world but should be used to help Taiwan enhance its capabilities as well. Several security-related issues, such as network security, media literacy, and humanitarian rescue, are already on the agenda. Nevertheless, the GCTF’s scope should be expanded, and more officials and experts should participate in security cooperation with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the nongovernmental basis for Japan’s relationship with Taiwan should be more flexible. Japan should learn from the practices of unofficial U.S. and Australian engagement with Taiwan and explore the possibility of expanding security partnerships — for example, in the category of people-to-people contacts. As part of this approach, intelligence cooperation using the PAVE Phased Array Warning System (PAWS) should be explored to address the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the region. Also, taking the opportunity to establish a permanent joint headquarters under the defense minister, Japan should craft a mechanism for effective policy and operational coordination with international partners, including Taiwan, as Taiwan contingencies will directly affect Japan’s national security. Japan should expand security-related intellectual exchange by inviting Taiwanese private researchers as visiting scholars in its in-house security think tanks to closely exchange expertise with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBLIC EDUCATION ON TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Taiwan Strait becomes more unstable and the risk grows, efforts for deterrence are urgently needed. The sense of urgency for deterrence must be shared with the general public so that international partnerships work most effectively. For this purpose, public education on Taiwan — including its geography, history, politics, and economy, as well as the delicate international relations involving Taiwan — must be promoted in the domestic societies of the United States and other democracies, including Japan and Australia. The intellectual communities of those democracies should cooperate in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Tsuruoka Michito&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important questions regarding a possible military contingency over Taiwan are whether, to what extent, and in what way the United States would be directly involved in military terms. Put simply, will Washington send its troops to Taiwan? With some exceptions, successive U.S. governments have maintained what is called “strategic ambiguity” regarding the U.S. response to a Taiwan contingency. The case of the war in Ukraine, including Washington’s response, provides a good starting point in exploring the question of U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden, from the beginning, ruled out the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Despite an unprecedented level of weapons and intelligence assistance to Kyiv, the Biden administration has kept that promise. There are three possible explanations as to why Washington does not send troops to Ukraine: (1) Ukraine is not a NATO member, and the United States does not have an obligation to defend Kyiv; (2) Ukraine is not important enough to U.S. strategic interests; and (3) Russia has nuclear weapons, and the United States does not want to risk a nuclear exchange with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first point, if the United States is not sending troops to Ukraine because Ukraine is not part of NATO and the United States has no obligation to help Kyiv, then Taiwan could be seen as in a slightly better position, in legal terms, than Ukraine. Although the United States does not have a treaty obligation to defend Ukraine, Ukraine has the Budapest Memorandum, which it concluded in 1994 with the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom when Kyiv agreed to give up all of the nuclear weapons left on Ukrainian soil after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The document gives Ukraine “security assurances,” as the three countries committed to respecting Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity and reaffirmed their “obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force” against Ukraine. However, though the memorandum is an international agreement registered with the United Nations, it failed to be of any use during Russia’s invasion in 2014 when it illegally and unilaterally annexed Crimea and intervened in the Donbas region — or during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States has domestic legislation, not a security treaty, regarding its relationship with Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act calls “any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a “grave concern” to the United States. The act also states it is U.S. policy to maintain the capacity to “resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan.” In terms of legal power, it is not easy to compare the Budapest Memorandum and the Taiwan Relations Act due to their different statuses. Yet, arguably, domestic U.S. legislation has more power to be implemented, as it has an enforcement mechanism, whereas the international community lacks such a mechanism, as has been amply demonstrated. Taiwan, therefore, seems to be in a slightly more advantageous position than Ukraine when it comes to the legal dimension of U.S. commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, assuming Ukraine is not important enough for the United States to send troops, can Taiwan make a case that it is more important and worthy of troops? It must be noted that neither the United States nor any other country requires prior treaty commitment to exercise the right of collective self-defense, as it is enshrined in the United Nations Charter as an “inherent right” of all states. Therefore, if the United States were to determine that sending troops to Ukraine is imperative to its own interests, it could do so as a right rather than as an obligation. The United States has exercised the right of collective self-defense without treaty obligations on such occasions as the liberation of Kuwait or the counter–Islamic State global coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria. It is therefore inaccurate to say that the United States is not able to defend Ukraine because it does not have a security treaty with the country. Washington, if unbeknownst to many Americans, made its decision not to send troops there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Taiwan, its significant semiconductor industry is often mentioned as a reason why defending the island democracy is a strategic imperative for the United States. Yet it cannot be the deciding factor for sending troops there; it would be inconceivable for a U.S. president to send troops to Taiwan to protect semiconductor factories. Arguments related to U.S.-China strategic competition and the international order, by contrast, are more persuasive. The fall of Taiwan would be a huge blow to the U.S.-led international order in the Indo-Pacific region and strategic competition between the United States and China. Given how the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy describes China as the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it,” addressing China is, arguably, more strategically important than countering Russia. Taiwan is on the front line of U.S.-China strategic competition, and the stakes seem higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if the real reason that the United States does not send troops to Ukraine is Russia’s nuclear weapons and the risk of nuclear escalation, can Taiwan and others in the region, including Japan, be certain that the United States is prepared and willing to address China’s nuclear weapons? This is an inconvenient and unsettling proposition. On one hand, it may be argued that a line must be drawn between treaty allies such as Japan and partners such as Taiwan. President Biden has repeatedly emphasized U.S. commitment to defend “every inch” of NATO territory. Similarly, the United States has reiterated its nuclear commitment to Japan on numerous occasions. On the other hand, the need to avoid a third world war or nuclear Armageddon, something Biden has often referred to, has caused concerns among U.S. allies. While they agree that a nuclear exchange between nuclear powers must be avoided, for nuclear deterrence to work, nations must be prepared to escalate the situation by demonstrating their resolve to employ nuclear weapons when necessary. Avoiding nuclear escalation at any cost is not a position consistent with the logic of nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the three plausible explanations as to why the United States does not send troops to Ukraine, Taiwan could well make the case that it is in a better position than Ukraine. Nonetheless, the proposition that Russia has nuclear weapons and therefore that Washington needs to be extremely cautious is worrisome. It is in the United States’ interest to dispel such concerns among allies in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. The challenge of countering nuclear-armed adversaries intending to change the status quo by force is hardly new. Yet there is added urgency in tackling this challenge in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and in view of a possible Taiwan contingency vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Yamamoto Katsuya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s elections have ended peacefully, proving once again to the international community that mature democracy has taken root in Taiwan’s civil society. However, China has trumpeted the failure of Taiwan president-elect William Lai to win a majority of votes and the failure of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to retain its majority status in the legislature as evidence to the Chinese people that Taiwanese citizens do not widely support the DPP. This is because an authoritarian regime such as the People’s Republic of China would never allow a robust democracy that could elect a head of state and a majority in the legislature from different parties. However, the fact that the Taiwanese president did not win a majority and the fact that the ruling party did not win the majority in the legislature are not strange situations in a democratic society with the separation of powers. It is also evidence that Taiwan’s civil society has a good sense of balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election also makes it clear once again that none of the forces in Taiwan want unification with mainland China. The DPP, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), and the Kuomintang (KMT) all campaigned to maintain the status quo. Of course, many Taiwanese citizens, including DPP supporters, have made it clear that they oppose unification as well as independence. When former president Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT said in an interview with German media just before the election that Xi Jinping should be trusted, even the KMT immediately denied it. The majority of the international community also expects Taiwan to maintain the status quo, and President Xi Jinping’s China is the only country in the international community today that strongly advocates for the unification of Taiwan and China. In recent years, Xi Jinping considers even those who support the status quo group to be one of the anti-unification section. As he enters his third term in power, President Xi Jinping will become increasingly active in maneuvering for Taiwanese unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, Japan, which is adjacent to Taiwan, is the country most affected by developments in the Taiwan Strait and the country most in need of maintaining the status quo. Thus, Japan has two roles to play. The first is to make efforts to maintain the status quo, and the second is to be prepared in case these efforts are not successful and deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-efforts-to-maintain-the-status-quo-and-deter-in-the-taiwan-strait-and-western-pacific&quot;&gt;Japan’s Efforts to Maintain the Status Quo and Deter in the Taiwan Strait and Western Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Japan must strengthen its defense capabilities, which will give more latitude to the activities of U.S. military forces in the Indo-Pacific. It will also give more leeway to U.S. military forces assigned to the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait. In light of recent China-Russia coordination, a conflict in the Taiwan Strait could naturally induce Russia’s activities in Europe. Japan’s strengthening of its defense capabilities will help alleviate European concerns about the Indo-Pacific region. The ability of Europe and Japan to adequately defend themselves in their respective war zones is an important factor in ensuring the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions maintain peace and stability in the international community. Unlike warfare in Europe, all warfare in the Indo-Pacific — whether fighting, evacuation of noncombatants, or trade involving neutral parties — takes place at sea. Thus, the maritime scene in a contingency will be complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, one of the most feasible scenarios for China’s invasion of Taiwan is an economic blockade. The international community, including Japan, should recognize China’s blockade of Taiwan as an act of war. The region where China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are located occupies a pivotal position in the world economy. An economic blockade of Taiwan and the sinking of even one merchant vessel would send shipping insurance rates in the Western Pacific skyrocketing and paralyze maritime trade. The Japanese yen and Chinese yuan would plummet; the Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong stock markets would halt trading; and the international economy would quickly suffer. Vessels engaged in maritime trade are operated by various interests of different nationalities, including ship registries, ship owners, operators, and shipping companies. The Taiwan-related vessels subject to the blockade are also Japan- and Australia-related vessels. Japan needs to make sure President Xi understands that an economic blockade is an act of war against the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is to enhance information sharing among the first island chain. From Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines to Australia, the like-minded partners comprising the archipelago should share a common operational picture (COP) of the region. China’s gray zone and hybrid operations and activities are spread throughout all domains, not just the oceans and cannot be addressed in any one instance alone. In response to China’s activities to attempt to change the status quo, the countries of the first island chain need to share and visualize their COPs and repeatedly appeal to the international community. Japan must emphasize the urgency of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brainstorming-preparing-for-deterrence-failure&quot;&gt;Brainstorming: Preparing for Deterrence Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current international order must be firmly prepared for a new world order after deterrence fails. Even if the Russian invasion of Ukraine ends in Putin’s defeat, a Russia that has regained its strength is bound to turn on Ukraine and the Baltic states again. Thus, after the war in Ukraine, NATO will have to become an even stronger defense alliance against Russia. Similarly, even if China’s invasion of Taiwan fails at least once, China could turn on Taiwan again. Xi Jinping has repeatedly included Taiwan in his concept of national rejuvenation and the “China dream.” In the meantime, the democratic societies of the first island chain must work together to frustrate China’s intention to invade again. The U.S.-Japan alliance and Japan’s role in this new partnership must grow. Brainstorming for this purpose will also be a strong deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering China’s attempts to change the status quo means countering a big nuclear weapons state. It is said that Xi wants to be the Mao Zedong of the twenty-first century, and it would be a nightmare for all if Xi were to follow Mao’s perception regarding the use of nuclear weapons. It is time for Japanese society to seriously debate the effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Hayley Channer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With China’s rise and stated intention to bring Taiwan back under its control, a major conflict in the Indo-Pacific could break out. Australia has multiple stakes in Taiwan’s future, not least the potential for Australia’s closest partners, the United States and Japan, to be drawn into a conflict with wider destabilizing effects. However, in the context of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s increasing gray zone coercion of Taiwan using methods short of war, the policy question of how Australia pursues its relationship with Taiwan and cooperates with the United States and Japan in building Taiwan’s resilience is complicated. There is scope for Australia and Taiwan to elevate their bilateral trade and diversify renewable energy supply chains, thereby increasing Taipei’s resilience and signaling some resolve to withstand CCP pressure. But there are also strategic risks that must be considered and balanced against the opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-dominant-trade-position-with-australia-dissuades-canberra-from-deepening-economic-ties-with-taipei&quot;&gt;China’s Dominant Trade Position with Australia Dissuades Canberra from Deepening Economic Ties with Taipei&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is by no means an inconsequential trade partner for Australia, but it pales in comparison to Australia’s relationship with China. China is Australia’s largest export market, accounting for 35 percent of exports in 2020. In contrast, Taiwan represents Australia’s sixth-largest export market. There is also a large gap between China and all of Australia’s other trade partners. In 2023, China accounted for 26.8 percent of Australia’s two-way trade, and the next-largest partner was Japan with 9.9 percent. Taiwan accounted for only 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the large gap between China and Taiwan in Australia’s trade relations, it is common for Australia to have a free trade agreement (FTA) with its major trading partners, which would typically include Taiwan. Australia has FTAs or economic cooperation agreements with China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and India. Taiwan has been lobbying Australia for a more formal economic partnership partly because such agreements provide Taipei with greater international legitimacy and reinforce its independence from China. However, Australia is unlikely to agree to an FTA given the limited practical benefit, as Taiwan currently applies low tariffs on Australia’s main exports of minerals and energy. Further, such an agreement would almost certainly cause relationship damage with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China exerts pressure across all domains — political, military, technological, and social — to dissuade Australia and other countries from entering into FTAs with Taiwan. For this reason, Taiwan has FTAs with only a handful of economies, the largest being New Zealand and the smallest being the Marshall Islands. In response to Canberra taking security and political positions that angered Beijing, Australia has faced punitive trade measures from China since 2018, costing its economy an estimated $31 billion in lost commodity exports. To stabilize relations with China as much as possible, Australia is unlikely to negotiate an FTA with Taiwan that would deliver little trade benefit. However, apart from an FTA, there are other areas where Australia can help Taiwan increase its resilience, such as energy security and the clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy-and-supply-chains-are-a-primary-area-to-enhance-australia-taiwan-cooperation&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy and Supply Chains Are a Primary Area to Enhance Australia-Taiwan Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Taiwan have a strong relationship when it comes to traditional energy security. Taiwan relies heavily on energy imports, and Australia is its largest provider, supplying approximately two-thirds of its coal and one-third of its natural gas. However, beyond Australia exporting more coal and gas to Taiwan, Canberra has an opportunity to strengthen Taipei’s energy security and further Australia’s national priorities by cooperating on renewable energy sources and their supply chains. Plus, further integrating Taiwan into global energy supply chains will increase its value to the international community and complicate China’s calculations in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two areas where deeper Australia-Taiwan cooperation on renewable energy and supply chains would be particularly valuable are hydrogen and lithium-ion batteries. Australian and Taiwanese senior officials have been discussing hydrogen cooperation since at least 2021, when trade ministers from both countries participated in a hydrogen trade and investment dialogue. In 2022, the Australian government also hosted a Taiwanese business delegation to explore hydrogen opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia-Taiwan bilateral cooperation in this area could be expanded to trilateral or even quadrilateral cooperation with Japan and the United States. Australia and Japan have a Clean Hydrogen Trade Program, and Australian and Japanese businesses have been partnering on groundbreaking hydrogen projects. The United States is also heavily investing in hydrogen, including as part of the industrial policy measures contained within the Inflation Reduction Act. Combining Australian, Taiwanese, Japanese, and U.S. efforts on the hydrogen supply chain could streamline individual and bilateral efforts. This could be realized through commencing trilateral or quadrilateral dialogue with officials and industry leaders, progressing to a formal agreement and joint development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other opportunity for greater Australia-Taiwan cooperation is in large-capacity renewable batteries. Demand for lithium batteries, used in electric vehicles (EVs), grid storage, and consumer electronics, is greatly increasing. Taiwan has a growing battery industry, and Australia produces 60 percent of the world’s lithium, which is needed for lithium-ion batteries. Both Australia and Taiwan stand to benefit from cooperation on batteries: Australia from value-added mineral resources, access to Taiwanese technical capabilities, and potentially more Taiwanese investors and customers, and Taiwan through diversifying its battery manufacture, better securing its critical supply chains, and supporting its EV sector. Australia and Taiwan have commenced cooperation on batteries, including an agreement between Taiwanese battery company Aleees and Australia-based mining company Avenira to develop a manufacturing plant for lithium battery cathodes in Australia’s Northern Territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia-Taiwan cooperation on batteries, perhaps expanded to Japan and the United States, has the potential to supplement the global battery supply chain. China currently dominates the mid- and downstream stages of battery processing and manufacture, accounting for approximately 73 percent of global manufacturing capacity in 2023. Should Beijing seek to withhold trade in this sector for political or strategic reasons in the future, it is important that other battery supply chains are developed. At best, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States could produce a battery supply chain without a production stage in China, reducing Beijing’s ability to weaponize this commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwans-accession-to-regional-trade-pacts-would-aid-its-cause-but-is-currently-unlikely&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Accession to Regional Trade Pacts Would Aid Its Cause but Is Currently Unlikely&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary way Taiwan asserts its agency in the international system is through its membership of country groupings as an “economy.” Taiwan is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) initiative and has applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Other CPTPP members include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, with the United Kingdom expected to be admitted in 2024. Considering Taiwan’s high trade and labor standards, it would be an ideal CPTPP member and accession would hold considerable symbolic importance to Taipei, similar to FTAs but on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China has also applied for membership. Considering that Beijing is unlikely to reform its economic practices sufficiently to achieve membership, some CPTPP members — concerned about repercussions from China should Taipei be accepted and Beijing rejected — hesitate to accept Taiwan. As the CPTPP is a consensus-based agreement requiring endorsement by all, some members could perpetually delay Taiwan’s application. Although Japan welcomed Taiwan’s bid publicly and Australia would likely support it privately, current circumstances reduce the likelihood of CPTPP membership being an avenue to support Taipei’s resilience. Nevertheless, Australia and Japan should continue lobbying for Taiwan’s accession within the grouping, with the hope of gaining wider support from other CPTPP members in the future. One way to do so would be through an internal CPTPP working group, as Taiwanese diplomats have suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait will be extremely challenging given that China is attempting to change the status quo incrementally through coercion of Taiwan and its partner nations. Beyond Australia’s bilateral relations with Taiwan or coordinating efforts with Japan and the United States, Canberra’s primary interest in Taiwan is stability. However, it may be possible for Australia to work more closely with Taiwan on renewable energy and supply chains in a way that is less escalatory and still supports Taipei’s resilience. While careful calculation is imperative, without some resolve, Australia risks continual backsliding in its relations with Taiwan, to Australia’s detriment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maximizing-australias-subnational-government-and-civil-society-engagement-with-taiwan&quot;&gt;Maximizing Australia’s Subnational Government and Civil Society Engagement with Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By John Fitzgerald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-and-community-resolve&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Community Resolve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective diplomatic, economic, and military deterrence requires liberal democracies to show and communicate the willingness of free citizens to bear the costs of deterrence and conflict and associated disruptions to their way of life. An otherwise well-designed deterrence strategy is unlikely to deter if a liberal democracy fails to communicate the resolve of its citizens and the likely choices of its decisionmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a liberal democracy, Australia and its citizens have proved willing to bear the costs of the significant trade penalties China has imposed on them in retaliation for Canberra’s decisions around foreign interference, cyber threats, critical infrastructure, and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Such forceful demonstration of public resolve signals that the people of Australia, no less than their government, are willing to bear the costs of preserving institutional integrity and national sovereignty in the face of foreign coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Australia were to impose economic penalties on the PRC over a Taiwan contingency or to support U.S.-led efforts to assist Taiwan, a similar demonstration of public resolve could not be taken for granted. Such a demonstration would require broader public agreement than exists at present about what is at stake in the Taiwan Strait, why this matters to Australia, what the people of Taiwan want for their future, and why that too matters for Australians. Although Taiwan’s place in the growing geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States receives ample public attention, Australians are seeing and hearing too little about Taiwan itself. Greater public awareness of why Taiwan matters to Australia in the long term, on its own merits, needs to be generated through more extensive and intimate subnational and community ties between the people of Taiwan and Australia. Civil society has a part to play in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-civil-society-and-subnational-government-ties-matter&quot;&gt;Why Civil Society and Subnational Government Ties Matter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan confronts challenges and risks as grave as any country — including pandemics, floods and earthquakes, cybersecurity risks, gray zone disinformation and foreign interference, and possible maritime blockades and invasion — but it faces them without the benefit of international cooperation that risks on this scale normally entail. In view of Taiwan’s exclusion from major international organizations and its difficulties sustaining government-to-government cooperation with countries that recognize the PRC, Taiwan does not enjoy the degree of international cooperation merited by the challenges and risks it faces from one day to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government, irrespective of which party is in office, limits its engagement with the government of Taiwan. Under its One China policy, Canberra publicly opposes unilateral actions on either side of the Taiwan Strait that could undermine peace and stability in the region. It is reluctant to cooperate directly with the government of Taiwan to secure peace and stability through the normal avenues of interagency cooperation, military-to-military liaison, and department-to-department and ministerial-level collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just Taiwan that loses out under this arrangement. Taiwan has much to offer in return for international assistance and support through sharing skills and experience in managing gray zone tactics, cybersecurity, natural disasters, energy transition, and preparation for conflict scenarios. Australia’s subnational governments and civil society do not operate under the same constraints as the federal government and so are in a position to pick up where national government relations leave off, particularly in sharing skills and experience across areas of common concern. They could draw on Taiwan’s experience and expertise to assist Australia in meeting its own challenges around natural disasters and pandemics, cybersecurity, gray zone disinformation, foreign interference activities, and other areas of common concern, at the same time building familiarity through people-to-people ties that would stand both sides in good stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-taken-and-missed&quot;&gt;Opportunities Taken and Missed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing stands in the way of creating more extensive subnational and nongovernment ties between Taiwan and Australia. According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Australian government “strongly supports the development, on an unofficial basis, of economic and cultural relations with Taiwan, including a range of two-way visits, state, territory and local government contacts, trade and investment opportunities and people-to-people links.” Public opinion polling suggests that Australians of all backgrounds and all walks of life want to assist Taiwan in the event of conflict. Australians share similar democratic values with people in Taiwan, and Australian society is comparable to Taiwan in scale and complementary in its level of social and economic development. The underlying conditions are in place for closer people-to-people and local government engagement between the two societies. What is missing is encouragement, familiarity, and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Taiwan side, foundations, think tanks, and social entrepreneurs show growing interest in engaging with their Australian counterparts. But few comparable efforts are initiated from the Australian side, leading to missed opportunities. Where opportunities are taken, experience shows that expanded community engagement correlates closely with levels of state and local government engagement with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-diaspora-and-beyond&quot;&gt;The Diaspora and Beyond&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The democratic government of Taiwan cannot afford to be naïve about diaspora community engagement given the historical role of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Kuomintang (KMT) party agents in penetrating and mobilizing overseas Chinese (huaqiao) community organizations during the Cold War. Today, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) maintains a diaspora affairs (qiaowu) program in its Bureau of Consular Affairs and under each of the ministry’s five regional departments. These qiaowu bureaus date from the KMT government’s martial law administration during the Cold War, when they competed with CCP United Front agencies to win the hearts and minds of ethnic Chinese overseas. In democratic Taiwan, qiaowu offices have been repurposed from broad outreach programs extending to all Chinese overseas to a narrower role serving a limited range of community and consular functions for Taiwanese overseas. The PRC, by contrast, has stepped up its United Front operations among the Chinese diaspora (including the Taiwan diaspora) to mobilize overseas Chinese in support of China’s claims in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither can Australia afford to be naïve. It is home to around 1.4 million people of Chinese descent, of whom around 80,000 were born in Taiwan or are Australians of Taiwanese descent. Care is needed to reduce the likelihood of disagreement or conflict over Taiwan triggering social fractures and community alienation in Australia. Diaspora issues loom large for Taiwan and Australia in any possible sanctions or conflict scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is space for new institutional initiatives to compensate for the increasingly disproportionate investment in diaspora affairs between the PRC and Taiwan. One way forward is for Australian think tanks and universities to collaborate with nonprofits and think tanks in Taiwan with unrivaled expertise in exposing and analyzing Chinese-language disinformation and interference operations among diaspora communities. Another is for Taiwan and Australia to look beyond the Taiwanese or ethnic Chinese diaspora in search of broader community support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Public interest in Taiwan and the PRC reaches well beyond diaspora communities to include Australians of all backgrounds. Again, such an approach would require wider community familiarity with Taiwan than exists at present and a disproportionate investment in local government and community ties by Australians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwan-outreach-australian-response&quot;&gt;Taiwan Outreach, Australian Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, public diplomacy programs aimed outside the diaspora are largely confined to development assistance programs in a small cohort of countries with official ties. To the author’s knowledge, no agency or program is responsible for supporting people-to-people ties with countries lacking formal diplomatic relations but wishing to expand and intensify their social, cultural, and community links with Taiwan. Rather than engage directly with broader community or civil society organizations in countries such as Australia, the Taiwanese government prefers to outsource this work to nongovernment brokers such as think tanks and other civil society organizations through outreach to leaders and elites from friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Taiwan’s think tanks have been quick to take advantage of their government’s New Southbound Policy to reach out to Australia. The Prospect Foundation and the Taiwan Asia Education Foundation (TAEF) routinely invite Australian political leaders and experts to participate in their high-profile annual forums. Former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, and Scott Morrison have each taken the opportunity to deliver keynote addresses at major think tank forums in Taipei. Turnbull accepted an invitation to chair the International Advisory Council of the Center for Asia-Pacific Resilience and Innovation (CAPRI), a recently established independent think tank. And Doublethink Lab, arguably the region’s most capable nongovernment body focusing on Chinese government interference and cyber operations globally, has closely covered the Australian experience in countering foreign interference. Taiwanese think tank publishing arms also provide ample coverage of Australia, including the first major study of Australian relations with Taiwan to appear in print in many years, Taiwan and Australia: Advancing the Partnership of Four Decades, published in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiatives taken by Taiwan actors are highly significant, and the willingness of Australian invitees to accept their invitations is reassuring. Yet few comparable brokers or initiatives have emerged from the Australian side to create closer engagement with counterparts in Taiwan. A proportionate Australian response would match new initiatives coming out of Taiwan one for one. A disproportionate response would make maximum use of the space allowed to local government and civil society under Australia’s One China policy to fill gaps in national government engagement with Taiwan created by adherence to that policy. Australia’s independent civil society organizations and state and local governments could do more and are well placed to do more, but they need a dedicated platform to provide brokerage in Australia comparable to that exercised by think tanks in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government approves of people-to-people ties with Taiwan, as well as trading relations and local government relations. In some cases, it offers direct support — for example, by providing opportunities and funding for Australian graduates to work and study in Taiwan under the New Columbo Plan. Australia also participates directly in the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF), a government-to-government platform for sharing expertise and experience with Taiwan and selected partners on matters of common concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth has few programs advocating for stronger ties at the subnational level or promoting civil society engagement with Taiwan, though plenty of resources are available. DFAT houses a public diplomacy initiative with annual grant programs supporting cultural diplomacy and Indigenous diplomacy, both highly relevant to Taiwan. DFAT also provides generous funding for people-to-people initiatives with Greater China, including Taiwan, through its National Foundation for Australia-China Relations. But in practice, few government grants support Taiwan-related initiatives. The Commonwealth could usefully channel more of these resources toward subnational and nongovernment initiatives relating to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some state and local governments are building closer community ties and investment pathways with Taiwan. Queensland’s trade and investment office in Taipei is the sole Australian state office based in Taiwan and is reputed to be the largest subnational government office on the island. In recent years, the Queensland office claims to have attracted several hundred million dollars of talent investment in support of science, technology, and industry development in Queensland, particularly in biomedical research and development. Six of Australia’s seven active sister-city links with Taiwan are based in Queensland. Cities in Taiwan also cooperate with the state through clusters of local city links organized through networks supporting smart city and Asia-Pacific city linkages. The state’s Taipei office assists with civil society partnerships as well, some of which go back decades. It also facilitates relations with state cultural institutions, including Brisbane’s QAGOMA Asia Pacific Triennial, which hosts major exhibitions of Taiwan art and culture. Other Australian states and territories are missing out. The state government of Victoria has few links with Taiwan and no personnel in Taiwan, and in consequence the state hosts no sister-city links or relations with major cultural institutions in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is growing interest among universities to collaborate in research and teaching and in support of Indigenous diplomacy. There is further scope for university collaborations on diaspora affairs, including cooperation with specialist nonprofit research organizations such as Taiwan’s Doublethink Lab, a world leader in research and communication around foreign interference and cyber operations among sinophone communities in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charities customarily link communities and countries by providing routine assistance within communities (including diaspora communities) and by reaching out internationally to provide relief as needed. Taiwan is a special case. As a rule, charities and foundations that work in the PRC do not operate in Taiwan, and those that operate in Taiwan have no presence in the PRC, with few exceptions. Absent recognition from international charities based elsewhere, people in Taiwan have found additional incentives to establish independent charities to conduct charitable work comparable to that of large international charities at home and abroad, such as the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families and the Tzu Chi Foundation. The latter operates in Australia and the PRC. In the 1950s and 1960s, some Australian charities assisted the families of war orphans in Taiwan, but to the author’s knowledge, none has taken the opportunity to launch new initiatives in cooperation with Taiwan in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan offers unique opportunities for Australian chapters of international service clubs. As a rule, international service clubs have a negligible presence in the PRC and hence face few risks to assets or personnel arising from engagement with counterparts in Taiwan. Rotary International, for example, runs a large chapter network in Taiwan that is active in supporting local charities and providing international development assistance. Rotary is also very active in Australia. In 2023, several hundred delegates from Taiwan attended the annual Rotary International convention in Melbourne. Local chapters of Australian service clubs, such as Lions, Rotary, Apex, and Probus, could expand contacts and exchanges more systematically — for example, by providing local support in rural and regional Australia, where thousands of young Taiwanese labor in farms, abattoirs, and warehouses on working holiday visas with little connection to local residents. Local chapters of service clubs could offer similar assistance to visiting Australian students in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability matters in every deterrence domain. Military deterrence requires interoperability among national armed forces. Cybersecurity demands interoperability of data and security systems. Interoperability of financial systems is essential for cross-border cooperation in tackling financial crime and international terrorism. And interoperability among police forces, coast guard services, and development agencies is a high priority in planning for coordinated emergency responses in the Indo-Pacific. Timely attention should be paid to interoperability among civic institutions wishing to cooperate with Taiwan across national borders, including possible cultural, legal, and regulatory hurdles limiting cross-border cooperation among charities, foundations, service clubs, and other civic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil society is well placed to play expanded roles in Taiwan’s relations with countries in the region after basic questions are resolved about who can do what, where, and how. Answering these questions calls for basic research into: (1) the compatibility of legal and regulatory frameworks for Australian charities, foundations, and nonprofits wishing to work in Taiwan; (2) which Australian charities, clubs, societies, and other civil society institutions can work in Taiwan, which cannot, and why; and (3) which Australian charities, clubs, societies, and civil society institutions would be willing to cooperate with counterparts in Taiwan and what it would take to get them started. Parallel research could be usefully undertaken in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-a-disproportionate-effort&quot;&gt;Conclusion: A Disproportionate Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government takes no position on the issue of Taiwan’s sovereignty, but it opposes the use of violence to resolve the issue. It works with allies and partners to deter conflict by building capability, establishing credibility, and communicating resolve to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For effective deterrence, democratic countries need to communicate to all concerned that their people, not just their government and policy specialists, have the understanding and resolve to bear the costs of deterrence. To this end, communities need to understand what is at stake in Taiwan, why it matters, and what Taiwan’s forceful incorporation into the PRC could mean for their well-being and prosperity. Liberal democracies need to bolster communication around deterrence by building community resilience and communicating national resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia, local governments and civil society have key roles to play in this effort. The Australian government is constrained by its One China policy commitments. Subnational governments and civil society are less constrained, but through misunderstanding and want of encouragement, they often refrain from engaging with their counterparts in Taiwan as deeply and often as they could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building public knowledge and understanding about Taiwan requires disproportionate effort by Australia’s subnational governments and nongovernment organizations, consistent with their missions and resources, to engage with counterparts in Taiwan, develop mutual support networks, counter gray zone tactics used to undermine public resolve, and find practical ways to assist each other in any crisis. Ahead of any crisis, this requires building connections and ensuring interoperability among subnational and nongovernment players in the region to facilitate more extensive communications and intensive people-to-people ties. These players include states, provinces, and cities; charities, philanthropies, and nonprofits; universities and schools; clubs and associations; faith-based groups; sporting leagues; educational and cultural institutions; and think tanks, among others. Building routine connections between people and organizations in Australia and Taiwan promises immediate benefits to both while building and communicating resolve to assist one another in a time of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-information-battle-and-taiwan-strait-security&quot;&gt;The Information Battle and Taiwan Strait Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Benjamin Herscovitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is using a vast array of tools of statecraft to shift the cross–Taiwan Strait status quo in its favor. Among other policy levers, Beijing is regularizing the presence of the People’s Liberation Army around Taiwan, stepping up its efforts to exclude Taipei from international organizations, and both punishing and rewarding the Taiwanese people with a mixture of economic coercion and inducements. As well as calibrated U.S. and allied responses to these and other examples of China’s statecraft, preserving stability in the Taiwan Strait demands action in the information domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s global information campaign against Taiwan has two major components: (1) the spread of disinformation about the international status of Taiwan and the One China policies of various countries, and (2) the reshaping of various countries’ positions on Taiwan to bring them in line with Beijing’s One China principle. According to this principle, Taiwan is, inter alia, “an inalienable part of China.” By propagating the idea that Taiwan is by right, and so should be in practice, part of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Beijing’s information campaign is incrementally creating an international environment more conducive to China’s eventual annexation of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-disinformation-about-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s Disinformation about Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China spreads disinformation by regularly making erroneous claims about history, international politics, and other countries’ policies. Although the PRC has never ruled Taiwan and imperial Chinese dynasties had either incomplete or, in most cases, little to no political control or influence on the island, Beijing nevertheless incorrectly claims that the island “has been an integral part of China’s territory since ancient times.” Beijing also frequently misrepresents the 1943 Cairo Communiqué by claiming that it declared Formosa/Taiwan should be returned to China, when it actually stipulated that the island should be returned to the Republic of China, or China as ruled by the nationalist Kuomintang, not the PRC as ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China deceptively claims that UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 affirms “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory.” But this UN resolution makes no mention of Taiwan’s status; it is solely concerned with transferring China’s representation in the United Nations from Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang government to the PRC. As with China’s false claims about Chinese and Taiwanese history and the Cairo Communiqué, the disinformation regarding this UN resolution seeks to internationalize and legitimize Beijing’s One China principle and the PRC’s claim to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also spreads disinformation by misrepresenting various countries’ One China policies as versions of Beijing’s One China principle. Numerous states subscribe to different configurations of One China policies that recognize the PRC as the sole legal government of China without also endorsing Beijing’s view that Taiwan is a province of the PRC. Despite this, the Chinese government routinely asserts that its One China principle is “a universal consensus of the international community.” China also regularly seeks to deceive the public about the One China policies of other governments. For example, Chinese diplomats in Australia have published a series of op-eds in major Australian newspapers and local Chinese-language media in 2022–24 falsely claiming that Canberra is committed to Beijing’s view that Taiwan is a province of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;propagating-beijings-one-china-principle&quot;&gt;Propagating Beijing’s One China Principle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also successfully persuading countries to willingly sign on to its One China principle via less deceptive methods. As countries shift their state-to-state relations from Taiwan to the PRC or upgrade already established ties with Beijing, the Chinese government is persuading them to endorse its One China principle via communiqués and joint statements. Countries that recently switched recognition to China, including Kiribati and Solomon Islands in 2019, Nicaragua in 2021, Honduras in 2023, and Nauru in 2024, have agreed to joint communiqués that formally and fulsomely support Beijing’s view that Taiwan is an inalienable part of PRC territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Chinese government is persuading countries to endorse Beijing’s One China principle when they expand or upgrade ties. For example, the 2023 joint statement between Timor-Leste and China establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership included a clause stipulating “firm adherence to the one-China principle.” This was a dramatic shift toward Beijing’s position, considering that previous bilateral messaging had referred to a One China policy without specifying that Timor-Leste would regard Taiwan as an “inalienable part of the Chinese territory” and oppose “any form of ‘Taiwan independence.’” Timor-Leste is just one of many countries that have been persuaded in recent years to embrace China’s position on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing stepped up its efforts to internationalize its One China principle after Taiwan’s 2016 election of a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) president, and the Chinese government is unlikely to wind back this push following the reelection of a DPP candidate in January 2024. With Beijing signing more capitals up to its One China principle as they either sever state-to-state ties with Taipei or upgrade existing relations with the Chinese government, the number of nations that formally subscribe to the One China principle is likely to increase further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-should-be-done&quot;&gt;What Should Be Done?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China probably cannot annex Taiwan simply by shifting international official and public opinion and the particulars of the One China policies of a range of countries. But Beijing likely understands that its efforts to isolate and eventually take control of Taiwan will be aided if more countries and publics can be won over to the Chinese government’s view that the island is a province of the PRC. To preserve stability in the Taiwan Strait, Australia, Japan, the United States, and other like-minded states should counteract China’s efforts to spread Taiwan disinformation and propagate its One China principle by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jointly and individually rebut the Chinese government’s disinformation about Chinese and Taiwanese history, the Cairo Communiqué, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and international support for Beijing’s One China principle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide private support and advice to other states regarding the options available to them as they consider how to articulate their positions on Taiwan and emphasize that they need not adopt Beijing’s One China principle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use ministerial speeches and official statements to more regularly reassert the latitude that states enjoy to engage with Taiwan under their respective One China policies and, where necessary, rebut examples of Chinese government disinformation about these policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforce via official government messaging to their publics, subnational governments, and private sectors that extensive and deep engagement with Taiwan in the trade, investment, political, cultural, people-to-people, and other arenas is entirely consistent with maintaining One China policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calibrated military responses from the United States and its allies are essential for preserving stability in the Taiwan Strait. But hard power is not enough. The fight to maintain the status quo of a de facto independent liberal democracy in Taiwan will be jeopardized if like-minded countries cede the information domain to China. Just as it would be better from China’s point of view to take Taiwan without having to fight, other countries can foreclose the possibility of such an easy victory by ensuring that Beijing does not win the world over to its view that Taiwan is simply a province of the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-the-united-states-and-japan-can-support-taiwans-resilience&quot;&gt;How Australia, the United States, and Japan Can Support Taiwan’s Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Huong Le Thu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how to enhance Taiwan’s resilience, it is essential to know what resilience is. Resilience is defined as “the will and ability to withstand external pressure and influences and/or recover from the effects of those pressures or influences.” NATO considers resilience its first line of deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan faces pressure on all fronts: an increasing threat of military invasion, relentless intimidation and gray zone provocations, challenges to its domestic affairs through campaigns of mis- and disinformation, and attempts to take advantage of its open democratic system. Furthermore, like any other country, Taiwan faces frequent natural disaster risks characteristic of its geographical position, such as earthquakes, cyclones, and floods. As such, the country has long taken steps to prepare its citizens to play responsible roles in the face of frequent crises. Resilience is key to national comprehensive defense. Taiwan’s primary concept of resilience — preparing the population’s response to any disaster — also hardens it to the external pressures of a stronger adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an International Crisis Group analysis, China’s preferred scenario in the event of an armed invasion would be a lightning war that quickly subdues the population before any outside power can come to the island’s aid. U.S. intervention cannot be presumed, particularly as uncertainty mounts around the results of the November 2024 U.S. presidential election. In a contingency of an armed invitation, Taiwan needs to have the capacity to hold out until military support from the United States can be mobilized. Today, Taiwan is not optimally postured to do that. While the cross-strait military balance of power overwhelmingly favors China in quantitative and qualitative terms, Taiwan can still take steps to improve its position, such as investing in its asymmetric capabilities. Hence, Australia, Japan, and the United States need to support Taiwan’s efforts to make these investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s primary goal is to win without fighting, then the primary battlefield is not necessarily military but psychological: China must subdue the spirit of the Taiwanese people and their desire to resist Beijing. Victory is achieved through consistent long-term operations enabled by information technology, making China’s strongest weapon its mis- information and disinformation campaigns. Hence, protection of Taiwan’s cyber infrastructure becomes a primary priority. For a democratic society, managing the challenges of misinformation must be balanced with liberal values that safeguard the open flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-resilience-through-early-preparation&quot;&gt;Increasing Resilience through Early Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an invasion, China would almost certainly conduct cyber and electromagnetic attacks to disrupt Taiwan’s ability to communicate. The island will need to strengthen its infrastructure to ensure it can remain connected to the outside world after the first waves of attack. Reducing energy dependency by stocking more fuel reserves will also be important. Given the potential power crunch the island faces in 2025 with the planned closure of its last two nuclear reactors, Taipei should consider postponing the shutdowns as well as expanding its liquified natural gas (LNG) storage capacity. The same logic applies to other critical supplies such as food and medicine. Taiwan has achieved only 31.3 percent self-sufficiency in food, and it imports about 50 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients from China. It should quickly find ways to replenish its stores. A greater investment in civil defense preparedness, building on past civil society initiatives, would also be wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital resilience should include reinforcing the access of officials and public figures to communications networks, securing essential databases, developing alternative communications pathways to international audiences, and improving the physical security and cybersecurity of terrestrial infrastructure. A 2023 RAND Corporation report showed that China had gathered intelligence on nearly 300,000 points of interest (POIs) in Taiwan, including 550 POIs containing the locations of such network infrastructure as cable landing stations, internet service provider facilities, and mobile telephone facilities. Another 2,397 POIs detail the location of local, provincial, and government offices. These facilities could be targeted in advance and destroyed by rocket artillery or captured by special operators emerging on the first day of the attack. The case of Ukraine has shown the value of using satellites to link disconnected local networks, particularly when hard infrastructure is likely to be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar alternative could be arranged in Taiwan by linking very small aperture terminals (VSATs) to 5G base stations in a variety of locations. As the terrestrial connections to core networks are severed, groups of 5G base stations could form edge networks and use VSATs to interconnect them. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would almost certainly hit electrical generation early in a conflict. Taiwan will need to prepare backup power sources for its edge and core networks and construct duplicate cable landing stations at alternative locations, at least for the highest-priority government agencies and military units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-the-robustness-of-taiwans-satellites&quot;&gt;Increasing the Robustness of Taiwan’s Satellites&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an island nation such as Taiwan, satellites are the most feasible — albeit much less capable — substitute for submarine cables. Satellites cannot replace the enormous capacity of submarine cables, but they can connect high-priority fixed and mobile users, including government leaders, private citizens, and military units and the organizations and industries that support them. However, this option is complicated and deserves closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both government-owned and commercial communications satellites cover Taiwan and the air and sea lanes surrounding the island. Communications satellites owned by the United States and other governments are mostly in geostationary orbit (GEO), while commercial communications constellations operate in low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and GEO. The RAND report showed that a total of 182 communications satellites lie in the portion of the GEO arc visible from Taiwan. Of these, 63 are operated by commercial constellations based in countries likely to be sympathetic with Taiwan if China attacks it. The U.S. government and the governments of allied nations also operate 32 communications satellites that could provide coverage to users in Taiwan, including four wideband global system (WGS) satellites. Each WGS satellite can provide 500 megahertz of X-band capacity and 1,000 megahertz of military Ka-band capacity, which is at a higher frequency than commercial Ka band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons capable of destroying LEO satellites. It also has maneuverable satellites that could act as space mines by exploding near a GEO satellite and showering it with debris. The U.S. Department of Defense judges that China might also be improving its ground-based lasers to cause structural damage to LEO satellites and might be developing a new ASAT weapon to strike GEO satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government could help by providing some capacity from the four WGS satellites operating within view of Taiwan. Partners should consider supporting Taiwan by using commercial and military satellites for priority Taiwanese government, military, and civilian communications in the presence of heavy jamming attacks. Australia, Japan, and the United States can work closely with commercial providers to regularly practice shifting communications among satellites. Partners could support developing protocols to grant access to lower-priority public offices, businesses, and individuals on an as-needed or as-available basis. They could assist with providing a diversity of options to deploy mobile generators to maintain electrical power for critical satellite terminals. Moreover, a long-term approach to capacity building should be considered — including, for example, student training programs and research and development collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trilateral support in information capacity resilience is not without challenges when it comes to the restrictive and sensitive nature of information protection. Support for capacity building should be long term; it requires commitment from three governments and must be binding enough to sustain the changes in electoral cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-resilience&quot;&gt;Energy Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy security is national security. Energy dependence, laid bare after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, limited many European and NATO members in their security decisions. Energy resilience is of critical importance in preventing the swift takeover of Taiwan by Beijing. Right now, Taiwan is not optimally prepared: it imports 97.3 percent of its energy. Building the energy system’s resilience will depend on expanding storage capacity for the stockpiling of oil, coal, and natural gas as well as effective planning for the rationing and efficient redirection of energy to critical sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure not only increases Taiwan’s ability to withstand coercion but also helps deter a blockade. Coal is particularly suited to enhancing resilience during a blockade due to its high energy density, ability to be stored either on- or off-site, and capacity to be dispatched as needed. Data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) maintains that Taiwanese oil stockpiles surpass 100 days. Taipower, the state-owned electricity company, is investigating potential sites to store enough coal to generate up to 50 days of electricity, and MOEA has reported that coal inventories will increase in the coming years. CPC Corporation, Taiwan’s state-owned petroleum and natural gas company, has plans to install additional storage tanks at each of Taiwan’s three LNG terminals to achieve a 24-day storage capacity by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;democratic-resilience&quot;&gt;Democratic Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of Taiwan’s ability to sustain a potential blockade and other war scenarios is the spirit of the nation. Taiwan is at the center of Chinese interference operations and attempts, and infiltration by Chinese intelligence and subversion actors is at an all-time high, as demonstrated during the January 2024 election. Yet the robustness of Taiwan’s election procedures and results has affirmed confidence in the island’s societal and democratic resilience. This is not pure luck but a result of a crafted system designed to recognize and respond to disinformation. Success is based on a decentralized network that relies equally on civic responsibility as well as media and information organizations, think tanks, fact-checking platforms, and general education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience against subversion is the most critical element, albeit the hardest to grasp, in the island’s long-term future. Hardly any other country has such acute awareness of China’s sharp power as Taiwan. Partners in the region can often learn more from Taiwan than Taiwan can learn from them in this regard. But continuous support in defending democratic resilience needs to become a staple going forward as the sophistication of influence operations and frequency of disinformation campaigns only increase. The acute awareness among the Taiwanese people of the critical role of civic responsibility to their nation’s resilience may also hold lessons of value for the United States, Japan, Australia, and other like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-could-do-much-more-to-deter-beijing-and-support-taiwan&quot;&gt;How Australia Could Do Much More to Deter Beijing and Support Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Lavina Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2024 ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne in March, Australian foreign minister Penny Wong stated that the region is facing its “most confronting circumstances in decades,” including the expansion of military power without “measures to constrain military conflict,” “unsafe actions at sea” and in the air, and militarization of “disputed features,” noting that a major conflict in the region would be devastating. Her solutions were threefold: (1) leader-level and military-to-military dialogue between the United States and China; (2) a commitment to build “preventive infrastructure to reduce the risk of crisis, conflict and war by accident”; and (3) investments in military capability to deter a conflict. Diplomatic dialogue and building institutional frameworks to manage inadvertent escalation can be useful tools of statecraft if an adversary is content with the status quo and open to both. In other circumstances, military deterrence is essential to preventing conflict in the Taiwan Strait and other regional flash points in the South and East China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wong’s strategic appraisal of the increasing risk of conflict reflects the assessments made in Australia’s 2024 National Defence Strategy, 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR) and 2020 Defence Strategic Update. In all three documents, Canberra assessed that Australia would no longer have warning time for a major attack on its territory or military assets and that there was an urgent need to develop enhanced deterrence-by-denial capabilities to prevent this from occurring. The DSR recommends changes to defense force structure and force posture to enhance Australia’s capabilities as well as support U.S. and allied force projection, also for the purposes of deterrence. This approach continues under the just released 2024 National Defence Strategy, which explicitly acknowledges that the “risk of a crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait is increasing.” The U.S.-Australia alliance and the AUKUS partnership are key to Australia’s development of deterrence-by-denial capabilities in the short and long terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s intent to advance its deterrence-by-denial capabilities — alone and with the United States and partners such as Japan — is the most effective response to increasing Chinese belligerence and coercion toward Taiwan. Stability in the Taiwan Strait can come only from deterrence, and deterrence is possible only with a favorable military balance of power and demonstration of capability, readiness, and willingness to act. Over its history, China has likely learned that long wars are disastrous, and the uncertain end to Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine may encourage China to have greater patience in its ambition of “reunification” with Taiwan. This gives Australia, Japan, the United States, and other like-minded partners a narrowing window of time to organize and develop capabilities for credible deterrence. However, any failure to do so urgently undercuts the credibility of strategic pronouncements about the growing risk of regional conflict and will increase instability in the Taiwan Strait. In short, China will be watching progress on this front and making assessments of both capability and resolve as it continues to expand and modernize its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, already a growing gap between the dire strategic assessments made in recent Australian defense policy reviews and Canberra’s willingness to commit to the necessary increases in defense expenditure or to make speedy and effective decisions on defense capability, posture, planning, and readiness. While U.S. intelligence reports that Chinese president Xi Jinping has asked the People’s Liberation Army to be ready to annex Taiwan by 2027, none of the Australian government’s current procurement decisions will significantly contribute to the deterrence of China before the end of the decade. At the earliest, Australia will receive its first Virginia-class submarine after 2032 and the first of six new Hunter-class frigates in 2034. Given the history of cost blowouts and delays in Australian defense procurement programs, the surface fleet is unlikely to grow in size until the mid-2030s. Further, Australia’s plans to acquire long-range strike capabilities depend on an expansion in U.S. defense industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Australian government works to stabilize its relationship with China, it also avoids speaking plainly to the public about the real risks of conflict, Australia’s interests in contributing to deterrence, supporting the U.S.-Australia alliance, and the economic and strategic consequences for Australia should war occur. In these circumstances, it becomes difficult to politically justify major procurement decisions such as AUKUS and the much-needed expansion in the defense budget. Indicative of the current government’s real commitment to deterrence, defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is predicted to increase from 2.0 percent in 2023–24 to 2.4 percent by 2033–34. Only an extra AUD 5.7 billion $3.8 billion) will be added to the defence budget over the next four years. Australia will only be able to make a meaningful military contribution to strategic stability in the Taiwan Strait after around 2033 — apart from having a useful strategic geography and making contributions to allied signals intelligence through joint defense facilities such as Pine Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting these worrying shortcomings aside, nonmilitary forms of deterrence can also make an important contribution to deterrence and strategic stability in the Taiwan Strait. Like other regimes, the Chinese Communist Party will base its decision to use force not only on military calculations but also on nonmilitary factors such as the impact on regime security and the personal interests and calculations of President Xi. Existing research identifies a range of nonmilitary costs that could be imposed on China should it choose the path of war, such as economic, diplomatic, institutional, and reputational consequences. A great lesson from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is the failure of the United States and European countries to signal their firm resolve to impose broad-based sanctions on Russia to influence and deter Moscow’s cost-benefit calculations. In the case of deterring Beijing, the choice between “national rejuvenation” and taking Taiwan by intimidation or force must be made clearer (i.e., that both are not possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More could also be done to increase and support Taiwan’s international relevance and counter China’s efforts to restrict Taiwan’s interactions with the international community. The greater Taiwan’s economic role and presence in the world are, the more prosperous it becomes and the more resources it will have to defend itself, contributing to strategic stability. More comprehensive engagement with Taiwan by more countries means that the risks and costs for China of military action increase. This should include support for Taiwan’s membership of international organizations where statehood is not a requirement for accession, renewed efforts to form bilateral trade agreements, and Taiwan’s accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which directly counters China’s ability to use economic levers of coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Australia’s approach of stabilizing diplomatic relations with China is preventing it from contributing to the nonmilitary aspects of deterrence. The government under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was prepared to pay a high price to clear a path for his November 2023 meeting with President Xi, dropping or suspending cases against China in the World Trade Organization (WTO) for imposing coercive trade sanctions from 2020 on a range of Australian goods — cases Australia likely would have won. Moreover, Canberra was slow to protest China’s use of sonar near an Australian frigate upholding the UN sanctions regime against North Korea in international waters, which injured four navy divers; it did so only after domestic political pressure. Renewed dialogue did not spare Yang Hengjun, an Australian human rights and democracy activist, from receiving a suspended death sentence by a Chinese court in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canberra has shown no interest in pushing Taiwan’s membership of the CPTPP and has given mixed messages about its eligibility to join. Neither has it sought to expand bilateral trade or intergovernmental engagement with Taipei. It may be some time before Australian leaders realize that stabilizing relations with China — a country that relies on escalation, intimidation, and tactical surprise — is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Rather, the more one concedes to Beijing, the more it demands. In the meantime, Australia is avoiding confrontation with Beijing and has little appetite to lead on widening Taiwan’s international space. In doing so and avoiding strong pushback against coercive behavior by Beijing, it fails to contribute to deterrence or stability in the Taiwan Strait through important nonmilitary tools of statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-dangerous-balancing-act&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Dangerous Balancing Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Richard McGregor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any ordinary democracy, the results of Taiwan’s January 2024 election would have heralded an era of continuity in politics, with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate winning a third consecutive term in the presidential palace. But continuity in Taiwan’s domestic politics conveys neither certainty, nor stability, nor peace, as Beijing will not accept the current status quo on an island it regards as its own sovereign territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPP’s roots in the island’s independence movement and its refusal over the last eight years to sign on to Beijing’s required One China formulations make the ruling party an avowed foe of China’s ruling communists. Beijing’s dark view of the DDP and its president-elect, Lai Ching-te (William Lai), will ensure that Beijing retains pressure on the ruling party through various means until it gets its way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of such ongoing pressure, Taiwan needs the same support from like-minded members of the international community as it did before the election. The essential elements of its survival are the same as well: a combination of internal resilience and external options, both necessary to ensure it retains a say in its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners are indispensable in this respect, but it goes without saying that outsiders can only do so much. The Taiwanese political system has to commit to using its own powerful economic and technological qualities to build the strength it needs for its own defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting Beijing’s actions in the immediate aftermath of the election requires context, most notably an attempt to understand how Chinese president Xi Jinping and the Politburo view the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPP did not enter the election with wind in its sails. After two four-year terms, the party’s standing suffered from the wear and tear of many long-standing governments. The party was also hurting due to domestic factors such as inflation, high housing prices, and shortfalls in staple foods such as eggs. However, the DPP’s greatest asset in the campaign was the disarray among the opposition candidates. If the DPP is the anti-China party, the opposition groupings collectively represented the “anti-anti-China parties.” Although both the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) oppose the DPP’s China policies, they cannot back policies that embrace Beijing in any real fashion because doing so is electoral poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the months prior to the election, Beijing’s interlocutors were fatalistic in private about the likelihood of a DPP victory and straightforward in saying such a result would almost certainly provoke a military response. That bellicose messaging moderated slightly in the weeks leading up to polling day, when the parties and candidates opposed to the DPP tried, and then spectacularly failed, to form a winning coalition for the presidency. Although a military response might still come, the expectation of large-scale exercises effectively blockading the island, as happened after the visit to Taiwan by then U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi in August 2022, has not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a large display of force, Beijing has settled on calculated small-scale incursions near the island, seemingly designed to keep the incoming Lai administration on the back foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Chinese coast guard officials off the small island of Kinmen, near Fujian Province, boarded a Taiwan tourist boat, the first time such an interdiction has happened. People’s Liberation Army Navy research ships increased their patrols off Taiwan’s east coast, heralding a sharp uptick in such incursions. Beijing mounted another calculated psychological incursion in the diplomatic arena as well, announcing in the days after the election that the tiny Pacific island of Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Beijing has attempted to keep the incoming president off balance and under pressure ahead of his inauguration while retaining room for escalation both before and after the ceremony in May. Beijing may have taken some solace and thus may have acted with a modicum of restraint because the DPP did not win a majority in the parliament, the Legislative Yuan, in the January election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KMT and TPP, if they join forces, can now block DPP legislation. In such a scenario, there will be ample opportunities for Beijing to sow instability in Taiwanese politics, long one of its core aims. Still, the underlying reality of Taiwanese domestic politics is that the population overwhelmingly supports the island’s current governing arrangements of de facto independence from China, and they vote accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many scholars in Beijing are realistic enough to recognize the reality of Taiwanese public opinion, but communist party leaders in Beijing do not accept it. The long-standing cross-strait standoff — in which Beijing puts political, economic, and military pressure on Taiwan while the government in Taipei tries to fend it off and cultivate support from the United States and its allies — is often broadly referred to as the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the term “status quo” has been enshrined in core U.S. policy pronouncements and those of U.S. allies and partners in the region, promoted as something that should be defended and protected. Increasingly, however, the term is becoming dangerously misleading in describing the situation in and around the island. Far from static, as the term implies, the cross-strait status quo is dynamic and changing inexorably in Beijing’s favor. The status quo today is very different from the status quo of even a decade ago. China’s military now dwarfs that of Taiwan and can blockade the island in the space of a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Taiwan’s election, Beijing wants to shift the status quo even further in its favor. Xi wants concrete, visible progress of the kind Taiwan will not give unless it is coerced into doing so. China does not have the means to easily invade and occupy the island, nor does it appear to have a set timetable to do so. But the PLA does have a large and growing military advantage across the strait and the means to move quickly on the island, and Xi has tasked it to be ready to do so by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also made it clear that Xi’s “one country, two systems” model for unification, enshrined in a speech in late 2019, has not shifted, despite many reports to the contrary. Xi’s use of the phrase “one country, two systems” in 2019 was widely seen to have been a disaster for Beijing’s aims in the wake of Hong Kong. But while Taiwanese voters and outside commentators may have seen Xi’s use of the term as a self-harming mistake, Beijing has shown no sign of doing away with the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Huning, a member of the party’s top body, the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, has been in charge of forging new policies for unification since the 20th National Congress in October 2022. Wang, who has been a leading ideologue at the top of Chinese politics for more than a decade, has stuck with the formula while rolling out initiatives — largely economic ones — to add ballast to Beijing’s plans for the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s democracy has been essential to developing an identity independent of China. It also has been beneficial to its people, who lived under authoritarian rule until the late 1980s. But the United States and its partners, including Japan, Australia, and Europe, while supportive and admiring of the island’s democratic system, should not overly focus on this quality in marshaling support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the key to building support for Taiwan beyond the United States and its closest allies and into the rest of Asia and Europe is a focus on stability and, by extension, the global economic devastation that would flow from any armed conflict — the worst-case scenario of an invasion. The same messages might gain traction in Beijing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese scholars do not countenance at any length the idea that the threat of economic catastrophe from a cross-strait war could deter Chinese military action, other than to suggest that Taipei and its friends are playing with fire in resisting unification. Privately, the message is acknowledged, if not taken on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it makes sense that the threat of economic devastation could work to restrain Beijing. Economic growth over the past five decades is the foundation stone of the party’s standing among the Chinese people. It is not something that Beijing wishes to damage, especially now that the economy is slowing. For countries such as Australia, Japan, and the United States to reinforce that point in dialogue with China thus makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-can-reduce-timidity-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;How Australia Can Reduce Timidity on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Rory Medcalf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Australian foreign policy accentuates stabilizing relations with China, it would be easy and tempting for Canberra to entrench timidity in its policy regarding Taiwan. Instead, now is the time to invest in understanding and explaining why Taiwan matters to Australia’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the moment to creatively explore the boundaries of what Australia can do to engage and support Taiwan as a vital part of the regional and global economy and a dynamic and progressive democratic society. This effort should extend to using the middle-power agency Australian statecraft extols. More can be done to operationalize the sophisticated position Australian governments have defined: a One China policy that acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s One China principle, which insists that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Australia is emerging from years of confrontation, friction, and freeze in relations with China, its largest trade partner. The Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, elected in May 2022, prides itself on ending this painful phase, with disciplined diplomacy captured in the mantra of “cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in the national interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has gradually eased most of the coercive economic sanctions it imposed in 2020 when a conservative Australian government called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although Chinese president Xi Jinping presumably came to realize the coercion was not working in the face of Australia’s hardened public attitudes and political resolve, he needed a face-saving way out, and a change of government in Canberra provided that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is long-standing bipartisanship in Australia on foreign and security policy. Both the conservative Liberal-National Coalition and Labor support the U.S. alliance, partnership with other Indo-Pacific powers such as Japan, engagement with Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, and a relationship with China that combines massive trade (especially in Australian iron ore exports) with U.S.-led strategic balancing. The fact that the current government remains committed to AUKUS, an arrangement through which the United States and United Kingdom will help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines, confirms that Labor is conscious of China as a source of grave geopolitical risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are political differences in Australia on China policy. Labor’s emphasis on engagement with Asia is sometimes miscast as being soft on China. It has been in China’s interests to play up — and make real — the perception that some Australian governments are more accommodating of its priorities than others. This strategy aligns with the fact that Canberra is treading with great care when it comes to Taiwan. Long has this been so. After all, it was conservative foreign minister Alexander Downer who in 2004 questioned the applicability of the U.S. alliance in a Taiwan context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in recent years has something of a divide emerged in Australian politics on Taiwan, with current opposition leader Peter Dutton saying on the record, contra Downer, that Australia would support the United States in a Taiwan conflict — or more precisely, that not doing so would be “inconceivable.” While Dutton may rightly be criticized for seeking to exploit the China challenge for partisan advantage, it should be uncontroversial to express the judgment that the U.S.-Australia alliance would be broken if Australia stood aloof while the United States went to war with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Albanese Labor government has studiously avoided explaining Australia’s defense modernization and the intensification of the U.S. alliance in terms of a hypothetical Taiwan conflict, even though this is a plausible contingency that would profoundly engage Australian interests. Instead, for example, Canberra’s April 2024 National Defence Strategy presents a general case for power projection, deterrent capability, the U.S. alliance, and various Indo-Pacific partnerships — all in terms of preventing future coercion and threats to the connected regional economy on which Australia’s prosperity and survival depend. Some critics of the AUKUS arrangement distort it as a precooked deal to lock an Australian submarine force into a Taiwan war under U.S. command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artificially narrow debate, plus Beijing’s insinuation that closer Australia-Taiwan contact would put stabilization at risk, unhelpfully reduces Taiwan in the minds of many Australians to a source of trouble or a proxy for a U.S. primacy imperative, with no political character, rights, or agency of its own. Instead, Australian governments should not be afraid to remind their people (including the business community) of the truth: Taiwan is a self-ruled and democratic polity with its own complex cultural and political history. It is a vital part of the Indo-Pacific and global economic order, particularly given the critical place of its advanced semiconductor industry in global technology supply chains. Bilaterally, Taiwan is hardly insignificant: it is Australia’s sixth-largest export market for goods and services and its seventh-largest partner in two-way trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Taiwan also have in common the fact that they are liberal democratic islands, with similar population sizes of more than 20 million people, which seek to navigate a complex and contested region where many of the other political systems are much less friendly to individual rights. Taiwan upholds the values a democratic and progressive Australia cares for — inclusion, diversity, self-determination, free expression, transparency, accountability, civil liberties, and respect for First Nations peoples — more than anywhere else in Asia. Australians who care about their democracy would also do well to note that Taiwan is a laboratory for identifying and countering electoral manipulation; it functions as an early-warning system for their own and others’ democratic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australias-options&quot;&gt;Australia’s Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current economic relations between Australia and Taiwan are strong and could be bolstered through appropriate ministerial contact. Domestic prosperity and international stability intersect in many portfolios other than the obviously sensitive areas of foreign affairs and defense. Australia could follow New Zealand’s example and negotiate a free trade agreement, plus support Taiwan’s membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a quality trade arrangement where Taiwan eminently belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialogue, parliamentary engagement, and education are three obvious areas where Australia and Taiwan could do more together to build each other’s awareness and resilience in an era when middle-sized democracies benefit from sharing best practices. Dialogue could occur in the purely informal space of the think tank, or academic “second track,” or in a grayer zone where government observers and even occasionally government-affiliated voices could share their expertise. There is no fundamental reason why private sector experts and representatives of subnational governments could not also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides would benefit enormously from sharing knowledge and policy innovations in such fields as critical infrastructure, supply chains, cybersecurity, and social cohesion. They could thus collaborate in providing security to their economies and societies in ways that do not touch on sensitive questions of diplomatic recognition or military cooperation. Likewise, in preparedness and emergency response — whether against natural disasters and climate impact or more state-directed strategic threats — Australia and Taiwan would find it mutually beneficial to swap notes on their hard-earned experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, parliamentary engagement is a promising avenue. The April 2024 visit to Taiwan by a cross-party group of some of Australia’s most forthright and active parliamentarians is a significant example. It may also be worth considering minilateral variants of parliamentary dialogue that bring together parliamentarians from two or more democracies, such as Japan, the United States, and European nations. Such dialogue would reinforce messages of democratic solidarity while providing cover for any one country should Beijing translate displeasure into punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education provides another channel of connection while also building Taiwan’s capacity. The minilateral Global Cooperation and Training Framework set up in 2015 brings together Australia, Japan, the United States, and Taiwan as education powers and is a logical pathway for Australian education providers to contribute to Taiwan’s resilience while benefiting from its human capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia should seek to maximize its use of this channel while encouraging wider participation. The framework provides a potential vehicle for other democratic education powers, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, India, and South Korea, to deepen their connections with Taiwan as part of the global research, teaching, and training ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Australia, a stable geopolitical and geoeconomic environment involves much more than a permanently fragile stabilization with China. Australian statecraft has the wit to balance stabilization with the diversified interests and values that define Australia’s democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving-new-era-operational-challenges-to-execute-the-overall-defense-concept&quot;&gt;Resolving New-Era Operational Challenges to Execute the Overall Defense Concept&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Mick Ryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the current debate about deterrence and potential war over Taiwan centers on the physical and moral elements of national fighting power. In the physical realm, a stalemate over military assistance in the U.S. Congress, the inability of the West to mobilize the defense industry quickly enough, and the kinds of weapons to be procured for Taiwan’s defense are dominant themes. In the moral arena, debate includes the extension of military service models and the will of the Taiwanese youth to defend their nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a third element must be considered. Generating strategic advantage for Taiwan also demands mobilization of intellectual capacity. The need for this third leg of a twenty-first-century mobilization trinity of industry, people, and ideas is most compellingly demonstrated in the Russo-Ukraine war. After two years of destructive mass warfare in Ukraine and beyond, both sides remain waging a twenty-first-century war with twentieth-century ideas. Any change in the trajectory of that war will require improved and synchronized mobilization of people, industry, and new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same challenges and opportunities exist with the defense of Taiwan and deterring Chinese aggression. Until recently, Taiwan has persisted with older ideas about defending itself based on conventional capacity and outdated assumptions about the Chinese military. Having watched events in Ukraine in the past two years, Taiwan has been shocked into reassessing its defense. The Russo-Ukraine war has demonstrated that a smaller yet technologically sophisticated nation can forestall the territorial aspirations of larger authoritarian nations if it has the will to do so. It has breathed new life into an older Taiwanese strategy, the Overall Defense Concept, which anticipated the approach Ukraine adopted after the Russian invasion of February 2022. But this is just a starting point for thinking about the defense of Taiwan. More development is needed, and Taiwan’s partners — particularly think tanks and professional military education institutions — could work collaboratively with Taiwan in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unpopular-term-good-concept-the-overall-defense-concept&quot;&gt;Unpopular Term, Good Concept: The Overall Defense Concept&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Taiwanese admiral Lee Hsi-min proposed the Overall Defense Concept, which redefined how the Taiwanese government views “winning the war” should China seek to absorb Taiwan by force. The core of this revised theory of victory is that winning the war is defined as “fail[ing] the enemy’s mission to occupy Taiwan.” This was a shift in traditional thinking about defense and national security in Taiwan. However, many in the military resisted its implementation. As one article on this topic describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Overall Defense Concept was more popular with American analysts and officials than it was with currently serving Taiwanese generals and admirals. Driven by personal animosity and the fact that true asymmetry undercuts the rationale for pursuing high-profile, high-prestige, and high-cost weapons, these military leaders and civilian enablers purged the Overall Defense Concept as soon as Lee retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unpopularity of the concept in some circles, it remains a more suitable military strategy for a country in Taiwan’s circumstances given the magnitude of changes in China’s conventional military capabilities over the past three decades. Seven key ideas underpin Lee’s theory of victory to ensure that the mission of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to occupy Taiwan fails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abandon the traditional war of attrition and adopt concepts of asymmetric warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop and adopt the concept of denial instead of control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shape battle space conditions and engage PLA forces where and when they are at their weakest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on preventing PLA mission successes and attacking their center of gravity rather than on the total destruction of PLA forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent PLA forces from establishing beachheads on Taiwanese soil.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better utilize Taiwan’s geography and civilian infrastructure in a holistic plan of defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare for and conduct insurgency and other resistance operations to ensure that the PLA — if it can land — cannot effectively control Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phases&quot;&gt;Phases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Overall Defense Concept divides the defense of Taiwan into three key phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The initial phase is a force protection phase. It would include physical hardening, deception, electronic warfare, continuous redeployment of military units, stockpiling, and air and missile defense activities to ensure that Taiwan’s military and civilian infrastructure (and its leadership) can absorb and survive initial PLA air and missile strikes. As Lee writes, “Without proper force protection measures, most of Taiwan’s military power could be destroyed or neutralized in the initial phase of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The second phase is the pursuit of a decisive battle in the littoral. Extending 100 kilometers from the Taiwanese shore, this would integrate shore-based antiship missiles, sea mines, naval warships, and air force aircraft to attack high-value PLA air and maritime targets. Key targets would include large Chinese amphibious ships, command and control nodes (on ships and in the air), and other PLA platforms considered mission critical for a successful amphibious landing. Along with more conventional weapons, an important capability in this phase would be Hsiung Feng missiles mounted on trucks. The missiles would be dispersed in Taiwan’s urban and mountain regions to survive initial PLA strikes and then would be launched at PLA ships during an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3:&lt;/strong&gt; This phase aims to destroy PLA forces landing on beaches in Taiwan. At most, 14 beaches on the Taiwanese mainland are suitable for amphibious landings. Taiwan’s navy would lay sea mines in the waters off these potential landing beaches. A fleet of mine-laying ships is being constructed and launched for this purpose. Concurrently, swarms of small fast-attack boats (crewed and uncrewed), similar to those developed by Ukraine for its Black Sea operations, and truck-launched antiship missiles will engage high-value targets in the PLA invasion force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defense strategy is appropriate for a nation of Taiwan’s geography, location, technological capacity, and human resources, many operational challenges remain to execute this strategy. As the war in Ukraine has demonstrated, new technologies introduced to the modern battlefield have resulted in new war-fighting challenges that are as relevant to Taiwan as they are to Ukraine. The following five key operational challenges provide focus for a mobilization of intellectual capacity in Taiwan, supported by key security partners such as Australia, Japan, and the United States to enhance the implementation of a future version of an Overall Defense Concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrating old and new technology. The first challenge is effectively and rapidly integrating new technology (e.g., meshed civil-military sensor networks, drones, and democratized access to digital command systems) with old technology (e.g., tanks, helicopters, and artillery). No military can afford to get rid of all old equipment and recapitalize with new technology; it is a gradual process. But this process can often be unevenly distributed throughout an institution. In particular, the security of data and communications links between different systems is a major challenge. The integration of old and new technologies has tactical, operational, strategic, and institutional elements and relies on growing links between the military and industry as well as faster sharing of battlefield lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The massing versus dispersion predicament. A new-era meshed civil-military sensor framework has resulted in an environment where all the signatures of military equipment, personnel, and collective forces can be detected more accurately and rapidly. When linked to digitized command and control systems and precision munitions, it significantly reduces detection-to-destruction time in military operations. Massing military forces for ground combat operations, large-scale aerial attacks, or naval operations, therefore, becomes a high tactical and operational risk. Even if an array of hard- and soft-kill measures can protect massed forces, they are almost assured of detection, which makes achieving surprise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is equally a challenge in the maritime environment, whether in the Taiwan Strait or in the sea lanes connecting Taiwan and its military partners. Modern military forces must be able to operate in both dispersed and massed forms across domains, and they must minimize their detection signatures when they mass in a way that ensures an improved chance of surprising the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Lowering the cost of defending against missiles and drones. While enormous investments have been made over the past couple of decades in the development of remotely controlled autonomous and semiautonomous uncrewed systems, the capabilities to counter these systems have lagged in investment. This has changed since the beginning of the Russo-Ukraine war, particularly with Ukraine’s introduction of long-range aerial and maritime strike drones and shorter-range battlefield first-person view (FPV) drones. But there remains a massive gap between the capabilities of uncrewed systems and those that counter them. The Chinese missile, rocket, and drone capability deployed within striking distance of Taiwan is even more significant than that deployed by Russia against Ukraine. There remains a large disparity in the cost of missiles and lethal drones and the systems that defend against them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As such, the aim must be not only to reduce the cost of hard- and soft-kill systems but to entirely flip the cost equation. As such, a key operating challenge for Taiwan is to develop a variety of low-cost hard- and soft-kill systems for use against PLA uncrewed vehicles and missiles, which also imposes costs on China, not on those who defend against them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The right balance of long-range strike and close combat. The Overall Defense Concept includes a mix of different short- and long-range combat capabilities. Both are required. But getting the balance of investment in aerial and maritime strike weapons, on one hand, and close combat capacity, on the other, is crucial. As such, a key operational problem for Taiwan and its partners to address is the appropriate balance in the deep battle and the close fight (with appropriate support mechanisms for both). Not only must the balance of investment be mostly right, but there should be an effective operational synchronicity within the Overall Defense Concept between these two military endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Closing with the enemy. Modern combat forces require new-era techniques that are quicker, lower signature, and more survivable at crossing the operational and tactical spaces between them and their objectives. Ukraine’s struggle to penetrate Russian minefields and defensive belts in southern Ukraine exemplifies the failings of current Western military doctrine. Although this might largely be seen as a tactical challenge for ground, air, and naval forces, it is also an operational and strategic problem. How might U.S., Japanese, and other allied forces approach an operational area around Taiwan in a contingency in a way that minimizes detection and targeting by the PLA?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solving-operational-problems&quot;&gt;Solving Operational Problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature on previous military innovations and adaptation provides insights from historically successful military transformations relevant to Taiwan. Some of the most important characteristics of leading successful military transformations in the modern era are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPECIFICITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military organizations need clear ideas of the operational problems to be addressed. As Williamson R. Murray and Allan R. Millett wrote in Military Innovation in the Interwar Period, “A number of factors contributed to successful innovation. The one that occurred in virtually every case was the presence of specific military problems, the solutions of which offered significant advantages to national strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COLLABORATION WITH SECURITY PARTNERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, NATO countries provided support to each other in developing strategic and operational concepts and shared relevant doctrines and technologies. They also developed NATO standards for equipment, training, and logistics. A similar approach will be necessary in the Western Pacific, less the NATO alliance architecture. Support may include input on technological and conceptual lessons from Ukraine and co-development of new technologies and tactics. It should also include joint testing and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TESTING AND EXPERIMENTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an operational problem has been recognized, the nature of the challenge clarified, and the idea to solve it identified, the new ideas for operating concepts must be tested. This is important for several reasons. First, it ensures expensive, time-consuming organizational changes are not launched without some notion of whether they will work. Second, it provides transparency into new ideas, allowing for more robust examination and critique. Finally, experimentation is an important part of building institutional buy-in for change. As Don Starry wrote in “To Change an Army,” “Changes proposed must be subjected to trials. Their relevance must be convincingly demonstrated to a wide audience by experiment and experience, and necessary modifications must be made as a result of such trial outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DIFFERENT MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of successful adaptation is an institutional view of what makes an organization effective in the operational environment. In Winning the Next War, Stephen Peter Rosen found, “Wartime innovation has been most effective when associated with a redefinition of measures of strategic effectiveness by the military organization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBEDDING NEW IDEAS IN DOCTRINE AND INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE TRAINING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When operational problems have been specified and solutions have been tested and approved, these must be embedded in military doctrine. New doctrine is crucial because this is the foundation for all individual and collective training within military institutions. This is the way true institutional change occurs. It ensures that new ideas are standardized across the entire military organization and with security partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINKING TACTICAL INNOVATION TO INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New ideas — and the new organizations that accompany them — guide the adaptation of existing materiel and development of new equipment. New operational concepts developed for Taiwan will also require changes in how current equipment is used. It is also likely that new kinds of equipment and munitions will be required. The process that links new ideas and new defense production must be sped up and potentially distributed among Taiwan’s security partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-taiwan-deter-aggression-by-providing-war-fighting-solutions&quot;&gt;Helping Taiwan Deter Aggression by Providing War-Fighting Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan should not have to address these operational problems alone. Nations such as Australia, Japan, and the United States can assist Taiwan with evolving its operational concepts, solving difficult military challenges, and implementing a 2020s version of the Overall Defense Concept. Doing so will necessitate rigorous simulation, testing, and experimentation. It will also demand a collaborative Taiwanese security partner approach to developing new methods of effectiveness for war fighting in modern conditions, as well as improved links between military adaptation and rapid industry production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, good political and military leadership is essential to ensuring that the solutions to these issues are embedded into Taiwanese strategic and operational doctrine, individual and collective training methodologies, and promotion systems for senior officers. Given the pace of military development in the PLA, this transformation must be led and executed with one eye on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團　若不信納李家田證供　仍須考慮能否肯定為本案串謀者&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MySStQ1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周三（21日）在高等法院踏入第77天審訊，法官張慧玲第4天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官指，陪審團若不信納被告李家田的證供，認為他不只在旁觀察，更有份參與「屠龍」行動，涉暴動、縱火等罪行，但此為本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。官強調，有關行動僅可作背景參考，須考慮控方能否令陪審團肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及曾管有手槍和彈藥。官另總結黃振強、彭軍壕轉任從犯證人的經過。其中黃振強稱良心發現希望交代事件，改為認罪，否認為最多50%減刑而作供；黃一度投訴被捕時遭警施襲，但在庭上稱無法界定是否被打。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周二指，自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強事前著隊友毋須帶裝備，但另與其他小隊談及用汽油彈，著陪審團考慮黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」，隊友是否在知情下參與「殺警計劃」。官又指，一被告選擇出庭作供，若陪審團認為其說法真實、可能真實，或未能肯定控方說法，就應裁定罪名不成立；官另指，擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為，亦交由陪審團決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官即使不信納李家田證供-仍須考慮能否肯定他為本案串謀者&quot;&gt;官：即使不信納李家田證供 仍須考慮能否肯定他為本案串謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲周三續總結證供，就案中唯一選擇作供的被告李家田，控方盤問時詳細問及李在「屠龍」群組內的訊息，李遂一解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指，控方盤問以顯示李的證供不可信，例如李供稱於示威現場只在旁觀察。官強調，陪審團即使不信納李的證供，認為他有份參與「屠龍」行動，非只在旁觀察，而是衝擊警方及擲汽油彈等，但此屬本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官表示，陪審團應先考慮是否信納李的證供，若能肯定控方的說法，認為李不可信，才須考慮其沒被控訴行為，用作背景考慮李是否本案串謀者。官重申，陪審團應考慮控方能否令其肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及他是否曾管有手槍和彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官另提及被告張銘裕和嚴文謙的被捕經過，其中嚴一方稱警方沒宣布拘捕、襲擊嚴等；警員否認。法官強調，由陪審團決定是否相信警員證供，但嚴行使其權利沒出庭作供，故庭上沒證供顯示他曾被打。至於張銘裕則表示「咩都唔知」，警員亦沒搜出與案有關物品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官總結黃振強轉任控方證人經過&quot;&gt;官總結黃振強轉任控方證人經過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就從犯證人、自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強，法官總括黃由被捕後，至轉任控方證人的經過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指，黃投訴被捕時遭警員施襲，但在庭上作供時稱無法界定是否被打，指應交由專家判斷。參與拘捕行動的警員分別作供，指拘捕時黃激烈反抗，故須以武力將其制服，但否認曾「打、嚇、氹」黃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黃的錄影會面，黃承認部分說法與其庭上證供有分歧，例如錄影會面稱不願試槍，故欺騙同謀者吳智鴻指自己受傷；但黃庭上則指，他在中大事件受傷而無法出席試槍。官覆述黃的解釋，指被捕時記憶混亂、狀態差，但否認錄影會面時欺騙警員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續指，黃振強原否認串謀謀殺等罪，至2023年5月時，黃要求會見警員，指希望改認罪和交代事件。官引述，黃供稱良心發現而交代事件，並非為求獲得最多50%減刑而出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官另指，黃在盤問下同意，他所承認的認罪案情部分不正確，例如案情指9月的台灣軍訓屬本案串謀一部分，但黃在庭上供稱，於11月才與吳智鴻達成協議，「屠龍」一方加入殺警計劃的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官須考慮彭軍壕早與警達協議抑或搞錯咗&quot;&gt;官：須考慮彭軍壕早與警達協議抑或「搞錯咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就另一從犯證人彭軍壕，官覆述其證供，彭指得悉吳智鴻等人被捕後，已預料自己亦將被捕，屆時將會認罪。官引述，彭被捕後拒絕提供手機密碼，又指沒特別留意轉任控方證人最高可獲50%減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官提及，辯方盤問時特別關注，彭曾去信律政司，指據雙方早前同意（as agreed），將撤銷《反恐條例》下爆炸罪和串謀謀殺的控罪。彭解釋，信件由囚友撰寫，寄出後才發現內容出錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官表示，陪審團須考慮，彭是一早與警方達成協議，或是如彭所言「搞錯咗」。官另指，彭父為警署警長，彭供稱沒要求父親與律政司「講數」；而處理本案的警員亦稱，沒因彭父為同袍而對彭「輕手啲」，強調會公平處理各個被告。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團　指須考慮被告是否知情下參與、擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周二（20日）在高等法院踏入第76天審訊，法官張慧玲第3天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官指，自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強事前著隊友毋須帶裝備，但另與其他小隊談及用汽油彈，著陪審團考慮黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」，隊友是否在知情下參與「殺警計劃」。官又指，一被告選擇出庭作供，若陪審團認為其說法真實、可能真實，或未能肯定控方說法，就應裁定罪名不成立；官另指，擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為，亦交由陪審團決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周一簡述，控方指控關於「屠龍」的串謀，於2019年11月18日開始，因為當時自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強才確認共謀者吳智鴻有槍及炸彈；辯方則爭議「屠龍」有份的串謀，最早於12月3日才開始，因為當時才落實行動的日期及時間。被告張銘裕的辯方代表則認為，涉案協議於12月8日凌晨，當黃與吳確認行動實際地點後才開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官須考慮黃講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽-屠龍隊友是否知情下參與&quot;&gt;官：須考慮黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」 「屠龍」隊友是否知情下參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲周二續總結供詞，指控方相當依賴「屠龍」成員於「殺警計劃」前夕、12月6日至7日期間的對話，如被告嚴文謙問「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避」、同謀者林銘晧稱「喺嗰個位我哋引戰，引班狗一嚟開槍或者放煙，佢就嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，據從犯證人、自稱「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供，當時「屠龍」正商討如何配合共謀者吳智鴻一方的計劃，將警員引出；而過往「屠龍」亦不會使用「引戰」，故上述所指「引戰」必與「殺警計劃」有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，黃振強在行動前夕稱「我哋呢啲冇第二次機會，一次足以玩完」，故控方指稱可從中得知行動涉及槍和炸彈，與「屠龍」過往行動非常不同。法官強調，陪審團須先肯定各被告是否知情，「要同意成為一分子先得。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，黃振強在另一群組內，與勇武小隊「閃燈」、「蜘蛛」的代表提及，行動時將在油站附近擲汽油彈，以及每人放置閃燈在身。法官表示，「屠龍」早有共識不會親自用槍和炸彈，黃在事前又著隊友毋須帶武器和工具，惟黃卻與其他小隊談及用汽油彈，法官稱，陪審團須思量黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」，隊友是否在知情下參與殺警計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一從犯證人彭軍壕，官指彭供稱擔心遭吳智鴻報復，故沒退出計劃。法官強調，彭父為警員，陪審團應考慮彭沒退出的真正原因。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪受審，僅女被告劉佩凝獲准保釋。（繪圖：Kensahung）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官由陪審團決定擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為&quot;&gt;官：由陪審團決定擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就被告劉佩凝被控的串謀眾籌以作恐怖行為罪，法官總結證供指，黃振強、劉佩凝認識後，劉曾過款予黃，並稱「for 魔法仔女」；控方指稱魔法為汽油彈，而劉知悉「屠龍」行動涉及汽油彈。據控方早前指稱，擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官表示，擲汽油彈是否恐怖行為交由陪審團決定，及後亦會向陪審團解釋恐怖行為的定義。官續指，黃振強表示曾在電話中，向劉講述「殺警計劃」，著她加大籌款力度；官指兩人通話內容沒保存紀錄，僅屬黃的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;一被告選擇作供-官認為說法可能是真應裁無罪&quot;&gt;一被告選擇作供 官：認為說法可能是真應裁無罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;涉案7名被告中，唯一李家田選擇出庭作供。李否認全部控罪，即否認為「殺警計劃」的串謀者，亦否認曾管有手槍。官指，陪審團若認為其證供是真實，或可能是真實，就要裁定他罪名不成立。而假若不信納李的證供，但同時未能肯定控方說法，亦應裁罪名不成立，因舉證責任在於控方，被告沒責任自證清白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官覆述李的證供，指李希望就反修例運動製作紀錄片，故在示威現場蒐證資料，但從沒使用暴力或參與暴動。李表示，為「貪小便宜」、獲黃振強資助而留在「屠龍」，亦希望了解「屠龍」背後故事以啟發靈感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李共獲得約1萬元，為免失去資助而對黃言聽計從，例如剪接「屠龍小隊精華片」，但李在「屠龍」行動期間只在旁觀察，沒參與行動。官指，陪審團應思量，黃振強是否明知李沒參與行動，仍會資助他。&lt;/p&gt;

Enabling a solution for the global debt crisis may require the United States to incorporate loans into its international development strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global indebtedness has soared to unsustainable levels and requires a long-term solution, not an endless series of bailouts. The process for helping indebted countries is inefficient and does not serve U.S. interests. To be part of the solution for countries facing a debt crisis, the United States must refresh its lending practices and learn from the mistakes and successes that China has made in its lending to the Global South. It is time to seriously reconsider how the United States may be a part of the solution. Is there a role for concessional loans in the U.S. development portfolio? Is the current U.S. strategy of funding foreign assistance exclusively through grants always the right one? Tethering development finance to U.S. foreign policy objectives while producing fiscally sustainable outcomes is a component of great power competition with China that has yet to be satisfactorily assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and 2022, government borrowing increased by almost 4 times in Asia and the Pacific, 3 times in Africa, 2.5 times in Europe and Central Asia, and 1.6 times in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rapid rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have worsened the fiscal outlook for many deeply indebted low- and middle-income economies, particularly commodity-exporting countries vulnerable to market volatility. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global public debt hit a record $97 trillion in 2023, with developing countries shouldering a disproportionate amount relative to their share of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As emerging markets default on their loans in record numbers, the institutions of the current multilateral debt architecture — including the IMF, Group of 20 (G20), and Paris Club — have struggled to provide comprehensive or timely debt service relief, concessional financing, and debt restructuring. At least 53 economies — including Argentina, Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka — either have defaulted on some of their debts or have debt levels that the IMF considers unsustainable. Despite representing only 5 percent of the global economy, these countries are home to approximately 20 percent of the world’s population and face the highest borrowing costs. This underlying “debt tsunami” poses a major threat to global financial stability and undermines efforts to finance lagging UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt service payments now account for critical percentages of national budgets in the developing world, preventing government spending on essential public services and other investments needed to attract business. According to a June 2024 UN Trade and Development report, approximately 48 countries encompassing a population of 3.3 billion people spend more on interest payments than on education or health. In 2022, low-income nations disbursed $49 billion more to their external creditors than they received in foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-development-financing-from-loans-to-grants&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Development Financing: From Loans to Grants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt has long been recognized as a powerful tool for economic growth and innovation when used judiciously. The U.S. foray into development loans can be traced back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy in the late 1930s, at which time the United States began extending development loans to Latin American countries through the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM). Over the decades, institutions such as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), EXIM Bank, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and the World Bank Group have played significant roles in providing extensive lending programs aimed at fostering global development. For instance, in 2023 alone, the World Bank Group disbursed nearly $73 billion for various projects in sectors such as infrastructure, health, and education. Similarly, the recently constituted DFC has been instrumental in supporting economic development in emerging markets, authorizing $1.6 billion in loans and $1.2 billion in equity investments in 2022 across diverse sectors, including renewable energy, healthcare, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential benefits of debt, its use in development circles has often been contentious, with many policymakers favoring grants over loans due to concerns about overindebtedness and financial stability. This shift in perspective was significantly influenced by the 2000 Meltzer Commission’s recommendations, which advocated replacing up to 50 percent of World Bank and other development agency loans with grants. The commission argued that grant funding, particularly for critical needs such as sanitation and potable water, would prevent poor countries from falling into unsustainable debt. According to then U.S. secretary of the treasury Paul O’Neill, the philosophy of “more grants, less loans” was justified by the belief that the World Bank, by lending instead of donating funds to fight poverty, had driven poor countries “into a ditch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Meltzer testimony recommended that international finance institutions use grants to improve the quality of life in low-income countries through humanitarian assistance efforts. The commission proposed that the grants be paid directly to service providers on evidence of completion from independent auditors. Grants would bypass corrupt governments, and auditing results would improve performance. The administration under President George W. Bush went on to start one of the largest aid programs in half a century, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program, which remains grant funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Meltzer Commission report came just a few years after the IMF and World Bank launched the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996. The initiative aimed to ensure that no poor country faces an unmanageable debt burden and offered significant debt relief to qualifying countries. Debt forgiveness was seen as one of the reasons many African countries began to move along a positive economic trajectory. During this time, influential actors such as the Catholic Church and U2 lead singer Bono advocated for debt relief. They supported and contributed to the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which urged the elimination of debt for many low-income nations. This activism swayed the opinions of several politicians and resulted in the approval of funds for international debt forgiveness by the Republican-led 106th Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the HIPC Initiative was supplemented by the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), providing 100 percent relief on eligible debts from institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, IADB, and African Development Fund. There was hope that this forgiveness would resolve the issue entirely. However, many debtor countries continued irresponsibly borrowing after the HIPC Initiative. Despite the significant debt relief provided by the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives, countries such as Bolivia, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua continued to face fiscal challenges. Honduras and Nicaragua saw their debt levels rise again due to continued borrowing and economic mismanagement, while Bolivia and Haiti struggled with persistent poverty and political instability, which undermined the benefits of debt relief. The initiatives brought about a moral hazard as the massive wave of forgiveness offered only temporary relief without addressing the underlying issues of fiscal discipline and economic sustainability within debtor nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roots of the transition to a grants-based development strategy were planted before the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives or the Meltzer Commission. The “New Directions” strategy, embodied in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973, marked a shift in thinking from large capital projects such as infrastructure and policy reform to technical assistance and meeting basic human needs. As a result, infrastructure investments as a percentage of total investment by multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank declined for decades before seeing a resurgence in the early 2000s. Projects in higher-income developing countries such as Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela were phased out as the new bottom-up approach was implemented and projects were allocated solely to nations with the lowest incomes. Loans represented about a third of total military and economic assistance until a decline in this figure began in the 1980s. By 2001, loans represented a mere 1 percent of aid. The decline was, in part, due to a response to the debt issues occurring at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the U.S. development portfolio is almost entirely grant based, with foreign aid in fiscal year (FY) 2022 totaling an estimated $70.4 billion, or about 1 percent of total spending. Of this aid, 25 percent was for humanitarian activities, 21 percent was for health programs, 18 percent was for peace and security assistance, 18 percent was for economic development assistance, and the remaining 18 percent was for program support, human rights, and multisector assistance, among other purposes. Most of this aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments, emphasizing a model that prioritizes grants over loans to minimize the risk of debt crises in developing countries. The United States remains the largest foreign aid donor globally, accounting for around 29 percent of total official development assistance from donor governments in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-emergence-as-a-major-lender-and-its-use-of-predatory-loans&quot;&gt;China’s Emergence as a Major Lender and Its Use of Predatory Loans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loan-based financing of the Global South did not stop when the United States transitioned away from lending. Instead, countries sought loans from alternative sources, including China and commercial creditors. With immense borrowing needs and limited access to development finance, emerging markets have increasingly resorted to more expensive private sector and Chinese lenders operating outside of the official Paris Club regime, creating a more diffuse credit landscape with a far riskier profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loan-based financing of the Global South did not stop when the United States transitioned away from lending. Instead, countries sought loans from alternative sources, including China and commercial creditors.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paris Club, an informal group of official creditors from major economies, aims to find sustainable solutions to payment difficulties that debtor countries experience. It provides a platform for restructuring sovereign debt and operates based on consensus and shared principles of fairness, ensuring that all participating creditors agree to similar terms and that the debtor nation is treated equitably. This coordinated approach helps prevent disorderly defaults and maintains stability in the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s disregard for the Paris Club’s principles and practices poses significant challenges. China’s lending is often opaque, more expensive, and stringent, with undisclosed terms and conditions. This lack of transparency and coordination can lead to debt traps, in which borrowing countries find themselves unable to service their debts, potentially leading to a loss of sovereignty over key assets. This approach undermines the cooperative framework the Paris Club established and creates a riskier credit environment for emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s emergence as the largest official lender to developing countries has proved the main stumbling block in the escalating sovereign debt crisis, with estimates of Chinese debt exposure ranging up to $1.5 trillion. Beijing’s unusual lack of transparency and reluctance to forgive debt have paralyzed the IMF’s ability to provide technical assistance and implement financial stabilization programs that hinge on financial assurances from existing creditors. Emergency programs such as the G20’s Common Framework — developed in late 2020 as a channel for low-income countries in need of rapid debt relief — have been plagued by delays, coordination issues, and enforcement challenges. These issues are in large part due to China’s reluctance to provide significant debt relief concessions, as well as concerns that some creditors, especially China, are pursuing more favorable side deals than others. Additionally, there are concerns that IMF bailouts or hard currency inflows from aid or remittances would flow directly into Chinese pockets. As multilateral debt talks stall, borrowers in distress have waited years for a restructuring deal without receiving a cent from the IMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s emergence as the largest official lender to developing countries has proved the main stumbling block in the escalating sovereign debt crisis, with estimates of Chinese debt exposure ranging up to $1.5 trillion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s emergence as a major lender has been transformative for global development finance. As of 2017, China had become the world’s largest official lender, surpassing the World Bank, IMF, and Paris Club combined. The China Overseas Development Finance Database details 1,099 Chinese development finance commitments abroad, amounting to $498 billion between 2008 and 2021. This volume of lending equaled 83 percent of the World Bank’s sovereign lending during that time frame, making China’s direct foreign investments some of the most active worldwide. In China’s $80 billion annual development portfolio, the vast majority of loans are targeted toward low-income countries, with significant concentrations in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. Today, more than 5 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) consists of China’s outstanding claims. However, many of China’s loans are not categorized as development loans or are classified as concessional loans. From 2013 to 2018, 49 percent of Chinese foreign assistance, which totaled an average of $7 billion annually, took the form of concessional loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese loans, almost all of which come from official government or state-controlled channels, have drawn significant criticism for being opaque and predatory. Even though China’s lending is under state control, it is decentralized and managed by various institutions that are hesitant to accept losses on their loans. Since 2000, there have been 150 documented cases of default, debt restructuring, or other credit events involving Chinese loans to developing nations. The proportion of countries defaulting on these loans has more than doubled, exceeding 10 percent of all nations since 2016. For some nations, up to 50 percent of their foreign loans originate from China, with the majority spending over a third of their government revenue on servicing this foreign debt. Notably, Sri Lanka and Zambia have already defaulted, unable to meet even the interest payments on loans used for constructing ports, mines, and power plants. This rapid increase in defaults demonstrates the risks developing countries take due to China’s lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lending strategy often involves high interest rates and stringent terms. Many of these loans are not reported in the most widely used official debt statistics, creating a hidden debt problem. This means debtor countries and international institutions alike have an incomplete picture of how much countries around the world owe China and under what conditions. For instance, an analysis discovered that Zambia owed $6.6 billion to Chinese state-owned banks, roughly double the amount previously thought. This systematic underreporting complicates global efforts to manage and restructure debt effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese lending is also widely considered transactional, driven by a desire to secure access to critical resources such as oil, minerals, and other commodities. Some experts believe Beijing’s willingness to finance infrastructure projects, even in high-risk environments, reflects this strategy. The approach has led to increased debt burdens for borrowing countries and has been criticized as a form of “debt trap diplomacy.” Countries such as Ghana, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Zambia have faced severe economic consequences, including defaults and significant reductions in essential services, due to their inability to manage high debt repayments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ascent as a major creditor leveraging state-owned enterprises for its lending activities has introduced a significant challenge into the global economic order and the existing debt crisis. Its lending terms often include nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality clauses, making it difficult for other creditors to gauge the full extent of a country’s indebtedness to China. This development has major consequences for global debt restructuring initiatives. China’s parallel system of development finance challenges the traditional Western approach to providing assistance and negotiating debt relief, which has dominated since the end of World War II. As China’s influence continues to grow, its lending practices and the resultant debt burdens on developing countries remain critical issues for the international community, especially the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;debt-damages-foreign-assistance&quot;&gt;Debt Damages Foreign Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the severity of the debt crisis, there are now a dozen key strategic developing countries — including Kenya, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Zambia — devoting more resources to paying interest on their debt to China than to public goods and services key for development, such as education and healthcare. Development assistance does not exist in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of foreign aid grants during periods of crisis and capital outflows is highly detrimental to aid effectiveness. Grants, which are non-debt-creating flows, are counted as reserves at central banks once they are converted to local currency and spent on staff or supplies inside the recipient country. Foreign assistance flows are deposited in developing country commercial banks so that they may be spent on aid projects. These deposits are created by the developing country’s central bank, a state-owned enterprise that accepts foreign grant dollars as central bank reserves and creates domestic currency deposits for the local commercial bank. Hence, the counterpart to this grant-funded local currency spending is central bank reserves used to stabilize the currency when domestic bondholders, Eurobond holders, foreign direct investment (FDI) investors, China, and commercial lenders seek to liquidate their investments in a crisis-stricken country. IMF programs attempt to stabilize the currency with whatever dollars are available in order to buy time to make fiscal adjustments. This practice invariably leads to currency devaluation, usually some form of capital controls, and budget cuts. Hence, the current institutional framework necessarily involves using U.S. government grants and remittances to meet central bank reserve requirements instead of using the international purchasing power of the aid grants to fund development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy tools such as budget cuts, devaluation, inflation, and multiple exchange rate mechanisms enable governments to convert foreign aid into reserves, thereby reducing the aid’s international purchasing power and impact. This weakens the impact of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) grants, which are meant to be spent on goods and services to stimulate development but are instead leveraged for outflows funding debt repayments as countries undertake structural adjustment programs. IMF research suggests an increase in overall aid (comprising both loans and grants) tends to reduce domestic revenues, though loans and grants have differing effects. While the borrowing country’s capacity to repay external creditors and rebuild reserves is closely monitored, insufficient effort is made to mitigate the risk that fiscal adjustments will simply allow redirection of central bank reserves to repaying Chinese lenders, commercial creditors, and local bondholders before devaluations and reserve depletion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since U.S. taxpayers fund reserves from aid flows, ignoring the use of foreign assistance to repay China could jeopardize critical foreign assistance budgets. As a result, the purchasing power and impact of aid grants diminish. More needs to be done to build the financial and institutional capacity of recipient countries to strengthen their ability to manage aid funds transparently. Providing technical assistance to improve their fiscal policies and debt management practices can reduce reliance on foreign aid for debt repayment. Negotiating debt-for-development swaps, for instance, can ensure that aid funds are used for their intended purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money and resources granted to a low-income country can alter how it chooses to spend government revenue. Regardless of whether the assistance is from government to government, any time dollars are deposited in the central bank of a country in debt distress, those dollars are at a higher risk of being allocated to service the debt. Grants introduce budget volatility and dependency; they may be canceled from one year to the next. When a government receives increased aid, it has several options: it can lower revenues, raise expenditures, cut domestic borrowing, or adopt a mix of these strategies. This dynamic holds true whether the aid supports the budget directly or funds specific projects. When aid finances programs that otherwise would be funded domestically, the government must adjust its budget accordingly. Over a given period, increased aid can result in lower, higher, or unchanged revenues. Foreign assistance should not be used to pay debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upgrading-the-development-toolbox&quot;&gt;Upgrading the Development Toolbox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ choice to shift away from loans was intended to mitigate the risk of overindebtedness and maintain financial stability in developing countries. This change aimed to provide more sustainable and predictable aid without burdening recipient nations with debt; however, the developing world today is not the same as it was 30, 20, or even 10 years ago. There is now a pressing need for a refined approach to development. Grants may not be as attractive as they once were. The pervasiveness of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) demonstrates the Global South’s willingness to take on debt in exchange for infrastructure. These nations aim to graduate from relying on foreign aid to becoming self-sufficient, with robust economic growth driven by private enterprise. Additionally, many developing countries now have more financial resources from taxes and access to capital markets, allowing them to finance much of their own development. Various U.S.-led infrastructure initiatives are underway, but much work must be done to “enable a better offer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of development finance, concessional loans emerge as an instrument for facilitating sustainable growth and institutional reform in developing countries and markets. Concessional loans can provide a structured approach to development finance, ensuring that recipient countries have both the incentive and the means to enhance their economic and governance frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;earning-a-seat-at-the-table&quot;&gt;Earning a Seat at the Table&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the merits of issuing loans through a geopolitical lens, how can the United States best counter China’s BRI? Insofar as the United States uses grants, it has no voice at the debt restructuring negotiation table (or creditor committees). Providing countries with aid through loans not only finances development projects but also offers crucial flexibility and crisis mitigation options through mechanisms such as debt restructuring and forgiveness. In the event of economic or financial turmoil, a country facing difficulties repaying its debts can negotiate with its creditors for restructuring or even partial forgiveness of its obligations. This ability to negotiate can help stabilize the economy by freeing up resources for essential public spending and investment, thereby preserving the nation’s development trajectory. One key element facilitating this process is creditor committees, which bring together representatives from different lenders, including multilateral institutions, governments, and private creditors, to negotiate unified responses. By acting collectively, these committees can enforce debt restructuring decisions across all creditors, ensuring that the burdens of economic crises are shared equitably. The United States should seek to have a seat at the table given the size of its investments in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unified response is enabled by instruments such as collective action clauses (CACs). CACs are provisions included in sovereign debt contracts that allow a supermajority of bondholders to agree to a restructuring plan that binds all bondholders, even those who did not vote for the plan. These provisions are crucial for preventing holdout creditors from derailing a restructuring deal or seeking preferential treatment, which could exacerbate a country’s financial distress. Including CACs and creditor committees also helps integrate a diverse range of creditors, such as China, commercial lenders, and Eurobond holders, into coordinated relief efforts. Their participation is significant, as these creditors may not adhere to established norms such as those of the Paris Club, which has a long-standing history of helping developing countries manage their debts in times of crisis. By acting as a majority creditor, institutions such as the World Bank and IMF can wield significant influence within creditor committees, steering decisions toward sustainable outcomes. This practice ensures that all parties contribute to an equitable resolution, allowing developing nations to recover from crises more swiftly, avoid default, and maintain their path toward sustainable growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing multilateral coordination is vital to support sustainable development. Multilateral institutions should strengthen frameworks to include collective action clauses and improve transparency, especially regarding Chinese debt. U.S. institutions and international financial institutions (IFIs) should leverage their influence as lenders within creditor committees to steer debt restructuring efforts toward sustainable outcomes. This approach ensures that restructuring is not only effective but also fair and transparent, helping to stabilize the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improving-institutions&quot;&gt;Improving Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loans tend to improve the institutions of recipient countries. There is evidence that an increase in the degree of concessionality of assistance is good for growth in countries with poor policy and institutional environments and low GDP per capita. By contrast, countries that have better policy environments or are richer seem to absorb less concessional (but larger) aid flows more effectively. However, it is inconclusive whether concessionality helps growth in highly indebted countries. A high degree of loan concessionality improves aid effectiveness in poor countries and in countries with a poor policy environment. These results hold true in different specifications of the econometric model and are robust to different estimation techniques. However, the results of empirical analysis provide only weak evidence that more concessionality leads to higher growth in countries with high levels of debt. These results hold for concessional loans as well as grants, with the level of concessionality varying across loans (the highest level of concessional lending is a grant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing foreign aid to developing countries in the form of loans rather than grants can offer substantial benefits extending beyond immediate financial assistance. One key advantage is that loans can drive long-term institutional improvements, as in the argument for the nontraditional gains from trade related to free trade agreements (FTAs). This theory posits that FTAs compel signatory nations to enhance their economic and regulatory institutions, fostering better governance and stronger economic foundations. Similarly, development loans can instigate institutional reforms, particularly in areas such as corruption control, fiscal discipline, and governance transparency. For instance, loans from institutions such as the World Bank and IMF often come with conditions that require recipient nations to implement specific reforms. These conditions may include measures to improve fiscal management and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Providing foreign aid to developing countries in the form of loans rather than grants can offer substantial benefits extending beyond immediate financial assistance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By imposing these reforms, development loans can catalyze broader institutional change, fostering a more stable and accountable governance structure. For example, the World Bank’s support for Rwanda through loans includes conditionality and support for reforms aimed at enhancing governance, transparency, and anticorruption measures. Beyond direct conditionality, loan-based financial support can drive governments to reform financial systems, deepen domestic markets, improve institutional oversight, and address systemic issues such as corruption, fiscal mismanagement, and governance inefficiencies. Grants provide financial relief but may not foster the same level of sustainable development as loans tied to institutional improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;addressing-counterarguments&quot;&gt;Addressing Counterarguments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of counterarguments to concessional loans that need to be addressed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issuing loans would exacerbate the current debt crisis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is a serious concern that the United States, by becoming a lender, would add to the problem. The worst policy prescription the United States could pursue would be to replicate what China has done elsewhere in the world or issue loans to nations already overindebted to China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As previously discussed, funds intended for development may be appropriated for debt relief. Development agencies have already become a player in the debt crisis, but they do not have a voice at the table. Such agencies need a seat at the table if they are going to be a part of the solution. China is not interested in nursing indebted countries back to health but, rather, in maximizing its payoff. If development agencies do not want countries to depend on China, but rather to graduate to self-sufficiency and have access to U.S. creditors, then they must help these countries by offering an alternative source for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If development agencies do not want countries to depend on China, but rather to graduate to self-sufficiency and have access to U.S. creditors, then they must help these countries by offering an alternative source for loans.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A forgiven loan is the same as a grant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taking out a loan provides a sense of ownership and accountability for the country incurring sovereign debt. Borrowing responsibly, unlike receiving grants, builds a credit history that eventually leads to greater market access. One of the issues that hinders emerging economies is the absence of robust financial institutions. Domestic lending channels can eventually develop sophisticated finance institutions in those nations. The examples of Singapore and South Korea demonstrate how loans from the United States can help develop a finance sector capable of surpassing this point of friction and achieving greater capacity. It is difficult to imagine a country that is a long-term development success story that did not develop robust financial sector capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Loans can accelerate needed institutional change and develop financial institutions that can then serve other purposes in alignment with development goals. Unlike grants, loans can incorporate conditions for debt forgiveness, aligning with strategic goals even if circumstances change. Denominating foreign assistance as a loan provides options to resolve thorny issues. If desired, debt forgiveness may be tethered to milestones regarding democracy, human rights, transparency, good governance, and other pertinent metrics. The IMF, for example, tethers its lending to strict conditionality that aligns with its mission and its institutional risk management goals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More research and case studies are needed regarding the efficacy of loans versus grants and concessional versus nonconcessional financing. Although it would be useful to know which mode of foreign assistance is least wasteful and most effective at institutional development and what conditions affect efficacy, the geopolitical angle makes a clear distinction between the two instruments. China issues debt to expand its influence in the Global South, but the United States lacks a formidable alternative. Although allocating more resources to infrastructure projects, regardless of financial instrument, might be an important component of responding to the BRI, there is also a clear demand for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and its allies already issue loans through MDBs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. contribution to MDBs is not a sufficient substitute for the United States offering its own lending instruments. The United States is not as influential in such multilateral institutions as it once was. These institutions are, in fact, multilateral by design; executing U.S. policy is not their mandate. Hence, the United States has found itself constrained in its ability to use multilateral institutions to advance policy preferences in a competitive environment, which reflects the multilateral nature of these institutions. Reassessing how to manage influence in such institutions is undoubtedly an important piece of a larger conversation on U.S. diplomacy, but lending agencies where the United States must compete for influence, such as the IMF, are not reliable tools for U.S.-specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewing the debt crisis through a U.S.-China prism is inappropriate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The foremost priority of the Global South is its own prosperity, not the U.S.-China rivalry, which explains the Global South’s willingness to accept Chinese-owned debt. While U.S. strategy should not be overly reactionary to China, U.S. motives are, in part, driven by the great power competition with China. Beyond the immediate debt crisis undermining U.S. foreign aid and indirectly funding Chinese interests, there are few alternatives to Chinese loans. This arena is yet another soft power void China has filled because the United States has failed to lead. China’s approach has shown imperial tendencies, as evidenced by its seizing of ports for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the geostrategic implications of inaction, there are opportunity costs. By reentering the loan business, the United States can establish a foundation in emerging markets, fostering future diplomatic relations and economic growth by playing a more prominent role in resolving the debt crisis. The United States is spending tens of billions annually, and more countries and higher-income developing partners can be reached through loans. Hence, adding this tool to the U.S. foreign assistance toolbox expands the envelope of aid and the geographic reach of U.S. assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-nuanced-approach-to-loans&quot;&gt;A Nuanced Approach to Loans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the insufficiency of MDBs, the Global South’s demand for infrastructure investments, geopolitical competition, and the ineffectiveness of foreign aid amid persistent debt crises, it is time to strategize how, when, and where to reintroduce loans, alongside grants, as a tool for international development. Whereas grants are indispensable for humanitarian aid and for sectors where revenue generation is not feasible, such as health and education, loans may well have a role in the U.S. development policy arsenal to help accomplish particular foreign policy objectives. The critical question is how to introduce loans effectively, ensuring benefits for developing countries, U.S. taxpayers, and diplomatic partnerships while countering China’s influence in the global arena. To achieve these goals, several considerations should be weighed to ensure the appropriate use of loans in development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy loans on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A systematic overhaul would take far too long, unnecessarily forfeit the practical and procedural expertise acquired in the current grant-based system, and severely weaken foreign aid in the short to medium term. Critically, loans should not be a one-size-fits-all solution; instead, they should be deployed on a highly customized case-by-case basis to ensure that the specific economic conditions and developmental needs of each country are adequately addressed. An effective loan-based strategy in an emerging market may not be appropriate for a low-income country.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, in a scenario where donating to a middle-to-high-income country may come at the expense of programs needed in lower-income countries, perhaps a loan to the middle- or high-income country would help resources go further. Foreign assistance to higher-income countries should not detract from resources available to poorer nations. A more balanced approach might look like the immediate humanitarian needs that grants address, with long-term growth potential facilitated by loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize significant sectors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Loans should be considered for projects that are economically viable and have potential to generate revenue, thereby enabling the recipient country to service the debt without compromising its financial stability. A win would be a project delivering on the developmental goals of the recipient country and the strategic interests of the United States, as well as creating a return on investment. Such projects could include the infrastructure, renewable energy, and technology sectors, which support workforce development, job creation, FDI, and other contributors to economic growth and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate country characteristics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Assessing the recipient country’s institutional capacity to manage and use loans effectively is crucial. This assessment includes evaluating governance structures, financial management systems, and transparency measures. Grants and loans perform better in countries with strong institutions. The United States does not want to make the same mistake China did with some of its BRI loans by overissuing loans to high-risk nations. A nation that has quality institutions or demonstrates a strong positive trajectory may be a good target recipient for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider political feasibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Loans may be reserved for instances where grants might have political costs. Loans could be a useful tool in moments where the size and timeline of an endeavor may seem too large of an undertaking with grants. For example, aid to Ukraine is detracting from aid allocated elsewhere while donor fatigue compounds. A lend-lease model, similar to the Lend-Lease Act for the United Kingdom during World War II, could be employed. This model provides substantial long-term support to a trusted ally through loans rather than grants, emphasizing strategic partnership and future repayment. Framing aid to Ukraine in this way, with the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, has helped sustain its defense while aligning long-term repayment with broader geopolitical stability. In instances where a large-scale aid effort is required, loans can be used to sustain support without overwhelming immediate budgets or political capital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not abandon grants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An approach to development that includes loans should not spiral into something unintended. Issuing loans must not be mistaken for a prelude to a new iteration of the HIPC Initiative. The U.S. development apparatus has spent decades acquiring valuable technical expertise regarding grants. It would be unwise for development agencies to abandon or heavily reduce grant-based projects, but there are adjustments that, if pursued, would foster some of the benefits of loans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Again, a major concern with grant-based development projects is that the central banks of indebted nations will convert the funds to local currency and use this to pay off loans owed to China. To help counteract this, the United States should disburse money as projects are completed, not up front, monitoring disbursements pursuant to project completion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should consider issuing loans in order to complement existing grant mechanisms, help nations navigate the Beijing-bolstered debt crisis, and act in the most strategic sense. Loans should be designed with concessional terms, including extended durations, low interest rates, and grace periods, to ensure that they remain manageable for recipient countries. Loans and grants can supplement each other: grants can address immediate humanitarian needs and critical infrastructure, while loans can fund revenue-generating projects that build long-term economic growth. This combined approach ensures that urgent issues are addressed without exacerbating debt burdens while also promoting sustainable development and financial independence in recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. government should consider issuing loans in order to complement existing grant mechanisms, help nations navigate the Beijing-bolstered debt crisis, and act in the most strategic sense.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is exploiting nations by swapping debt for equity. This new era of mercantilism must be stopped. Reintroducing loans as a development tool, when done thoughtfully and strategically, can enhance the effectiveness of U.S. foreign assistance, foster sustainable development, create strong diplomatic ties, and effectively counter China’s growing influence in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union have each recently enacted legislation providing for an unprecedented volume of public investments in semiconductors, with the largest portion allocated to the establishment of new onshore chip production facilities. Substantial funds are also allocated to semiconductor research and development, supply chain security, and workforce expansion and training. These parallel initiatives have been prompted by an awareness in both regions of threats to economic and strategic security arising out of their dependency on foreign-made chips. The question posed by the enactment of the two Chips Acts is how such joint activities can be deepened, broadened, and leveraged by direct engagement between the United States, the European Union, and national authorities to address the vulnerabilities faced by both ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shared-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Shared Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and EU economies were disrupted by shortages of semiconductors during the Covid-19 pandemic. These emerged from unexpected surges in demand for chips (e.g., for electronic devices), which led to curtailed auto production in both regions. Reportedly, the U.S. automotive industry lost production of some four million vehicles due to chip shortages in and after 2020, while in Europe, a senior German official observed in 2023 that “we lost 1-1.5 percent of our GDP in 2021 because of a lack of semiconductors — or about €40bn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genuine post-pandemic vulnerabilities remain. Both the United States and the European Union are heavily dependent on chips fabricated in Taiwan and could experience catastrophic economic disruption if conflict between China and Taiwan shuts off the island’s semiconductor exports. Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in January 2024 that “all of the leading-edge chips that are critical to our infrastructure, to AI, to our national security ambitions, automotive manufacturing even, are being built in one part — a fragile part of the world [Taiwan].” Bloomberg Economics estimates that a war over Taiwan would cost the global economy $10 trillion in the first year. While this may overstate the risk, even a fraction of that loss would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union share the reality that neither party has the capability to manufacture at scale the most advanced semiconductors, which are at the 2 and 3 nanometer (nm) nodes. That capability resides in part in South Korea but mainly in Taiwan. These chips are essential to produce new generations of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) as well as for 5G and 6G telecommunications, applications increasingly vital to national security and economic competitiveness. Efforts to catch up with the leaders in the production of the most advanced logic chips and to establish secure chip supply chains will require very large and sustained investments and significant technological effort. With the United States and the European Union facing the same strategic dilemma and seeking to avoid costly duplicative investments, it is not surprising that both Chips Acts call for international collaboration with allies and partners. (The U.S. CHIPS Act is an acronym: Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors. The EU Chips Act is not. When referring to them together, the authors have opted for Chips Acts. When referred to separately, they are referred to as U.S. CHIPS and EU Chips.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, U.S.- and EU-based chip companies have decades of experience collaborating on chip research and production at universities and research organizations such as France’s CEA-Leti, Belgium’s Imec, and the Albany NanoTech Complex. Companies based in the United States and Europe have operated chipmaking facilities and participated in collaborative research centers for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With the United States and the European Union facing the same strategic dilemma and seeking to avoid costly duplicative investments, it is not surprising that both Chips Acts call for international collaboration with allies and partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparing-the-us-and-eu-chips-acts&quot;&gt;Comparing the U.S. and EU Chips Acts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad outlines of the U.S. and EU Chips Acts are similar, reflecting shared concerns. It is clear that, as the two acts were in their formative stages, each party took note of the measures being contemplated by the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both pieces of legislation envision industry-government partnerships with similar strategic goals: reducing dependency on offshore chip manufacturing, ensuring greater supply chain security and resiliency, encouraging production at the leading edge, and growing a workforce to support the achievement of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount of direct public funding provided pursuant to both acts is roughly comparable. Each party allocates the bulk of the planned expenditure to investments in onshore chipmaking facilities. Most of the remainder will be directed toward applied R&amp;amp;D by public-private research organizations to enable “lab-to-fab” transfers of innovations from the research base to industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both acts emerged as policy responses to the geostrategic risks and eventual technological challenge of a rising China, compounded by the concentration of the world’s most advanced semiconductor production being in Taiwan, with its geostrategic and geological risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the United States and the European Union acknowledge that existing interdependencies between them make collaboration imperative. Reflecting that awareness, EU-based semiconductor firms are eligible for U.S. CHIPS Act funding and U.S.-based firms can receive EU Chips Act support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both parties are in accord that Japan must be involved in Chips Act–related initiatives, reflecting its “like-minded” democracy status and its dominance in many key semiconductor equipment and materials sectors. Importantly, Japan has recently launched a major initiative: Rapidus, a government-funded start-up foundry that is working in close cooperation with New York CREATES at the Albany Nanotech Complex and Belgium’s Imec with ambitions to regain Japan’s place at the forefront of global advanced chip production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they have similar objectives, the U.S. and EU Chips Acts are distinguishable in a number of respects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Aid Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; European Union competition law provides that “state aids” (subsidies) are prohibited unless approved by EU competition authorities pursuant to one of the exceptions to the general prohibition, such as aids for regional development, environmental and climate purposes, or research and innovation. The EU Chips Act’s public outlays by member states are subject to this approval requirement. In order to fit within one of the exceptions to the state aids prohibition, EU Chips Act funds must be directed to “first-of-kind” manufacturing facilities that fall under the exception for promotion of innovation (or other exceptions, such as regional development). The United States has no comparable rule or law limiting “state aids” or subjecting subsidies by U.S. states to prior federal approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal and State-Based Support:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. federal CHIPS Act subsidies are augmenting state government incentives for chip facilities, some of which are substantial — New York State, for example, is providing Micron Technologies $5.5 billion to support its investment in two new memory chip fabs near Syracuse. In contrast to the European Union, which must approve all state aid initiatives, the federal government lacks the authority to regulate such state outlays, leading some observers to warn of a subsidy race among U.S. states. It is worth noting, though, that in reality such subsidy races have existed among U.S. states and foreign governments for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New vs. Existing Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; A major difference is that “the EU Chips Act does not create new financial resources.” The U.S. CHIPS Act funding is “new money” — federal outlays appropriated by Congress for the first time. EU Chips Act expenditures consist primarily of funds being redirected from existing EU-funded programs, although within individual member states new funds seem to be available. Still, the European Commission is allocating €4.2 billion from its budget to implement the research elements of the Chips Act; of this, €2.7 billion is being redirected from Horizon Europe, the European Union’s umbrella research and innovation program, and €1.4 billion from the Digital Europe Program, which seeks to encourage the use of digital technologies by European businesses and public institutions. This “shuffling of funds” between EU programs is proving controversial. According to one member of the European Parliament, the result is “a shame for Europe because we are investing in chips, but we take it away from other priorities like cybersecurity. We trade our future against our security.” A European academic recently fumed that “Horizon Europe is not a lemon, so stop squeezing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax Incentives:&lt;/strong&gt; In a major difference, the U.S. CHIPS Act provides substantial new federal tax incentives for investments in chipmaking facilities, while the EU Chips Act does not. The U.S. tax incentives are generous, providing up to 25 percent tax credits for investments initiated (not completed) by the end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Frameworks:&lt;/strong&gt; The institutional framework for most U.S. CHIPS Act funding is relatively simple: a bilateral grant agreement between the Department of Commerce and individual industry recipients. The EU Chips Act has more layers and more players. Companies seeking public funding must first secure commitments from one or more individual member state governments, but those outlays must be approved by the European Commission pursuant to the EU competition rules. The EU Chips Act provisions for applied research emphasize public-private consortia involving multiple industrial and public actors and multiple member states. The U.S. programs are more straightforward, but some critics have suggested that they include a multiplicity of requirements that add complications in process and execution. The U.S. CHIPS Act also has “upside sharing” provisions which require firms receiving $150 million or more in federal funding which subsequently enjoy windfall profits to share a portion of their future returns above an established threshold. The government will use moneys received to support the purposes of the CHIPS Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU Chips Act contains a provision to expedite the permitting process for first-of-kind chip facilities, even to the extent of allowing derogation from environmental requirements. The U.S. CHIPS Act has no comparable provision (although it is likely to need one). U.S. chipmaking facilities could be delayed for several years if the National Environmental Policy Act is allowed to apply to planned greenfield chipmaking facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;synopsis-of-the-us-chips-act&quot;&gt;Synopsis of the U.S. CHIPS Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 was enacted in August 2022, though the “CHIPS Act” incentives and research programs were initially established (unfunded) in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act authorized and appropriated $39 billion in grants, loans, and loan guarantees for chip manufacturing on U.S. soil.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act provided a 25 percent tax credit, initially valued by the Congressional Budget Office at $46 billion, for investments in chip manufacturing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act appropriated $2 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) Microelectronics Commons, along with $11 billion for Department of Commerce research and development programs. This included the establishment of a National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), a Manufacturing USA Institute, and funding for related National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) microelectronics research.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another $2 billion was initially set aside for legacy chips used in automotive and many other applications, though NIST sees the $2 billion figure as “a floor, not a ceiling.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies awarded subsidies under the CHIPS Act are subject to a 10-year ban prohibiting them from producing chips at nodes under 28 nanometers in China, Russia, and other “countries of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act also authorized, but did not appropriate, $174 billion for various federal science and research programs not directly focused on semiconductors and telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;governance-structure&quot;&gt;Governance Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden and the Department of Commerce have taken a number of institutional steps to ensure the implementation of the CHIPS Act:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The White House, pursuant to the CHIPS Act, has established a Subcommittee for Microelectronics Leadership within the President’s National Science and Technology Council. The subcommittee is tasked with developing a national strategy for microelectronics research, development, manufacturing, and supply chain security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The White House has established the CHIPS Innovation Steering Council to “coordinate and develop the policies needed to effectively implement the [CHIPS] Act within the executive branch.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department has established two offices within NIST:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Program Office (CPO) is tasked with awarding CHIPS Act funding, engaging stakeholders, and coordinating semiconductor-related activities of the federal agencies. At the end of November 2023, Adrienne Elrod, director of external and government affairs at CPO, reported that CPO had hired over 150 staffers; as of July 2024, it had received over 670 expressions of interest from semiconductor firms proposing investments in chips research, production, and construction of facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS R&amp;amp;D Office is to oversee the NSTC, the NAPMP, the CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute, and CHIPS metrology research, receiving advisory support from an Industrial Advisory Committee staffed with industry and academic experts in microelectronics fields.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the two offices are to jointly engage with comparable organizations in allied and partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation-to-date&quot;&gt;Implementation to Date&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers have criticized the slow pace at which the CHIPS Act has been implemented without regard for the novelty and scale of the program, but in late 2023 and throughout 2024 the Commerce Department made a flurry of major awards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On December 11, 2023, the Commerce Department announced its first CHIPS Act award, a grant of $35 million to the UK-based BAE Systems to quadruple its capacity for making specialized devices for use in F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, satellites, and other defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January 2024, the Commerce Department announced a CHIPS Act award of $162 million to Microchip Technology, intended to significantly increase its production of microcontrollers and mature-node semiconductors with applications in automobiles, cellphones, and the defense and aerospace sectors. The funds will be used to triple the capacity of the company’s fabrication sites in Colorado and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January 2024, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced the creation of the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (Natcast), a nonprofit tasked with operating the NSTC, which will be the “focal point for research and engineering throughout the semiconductor ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted, in November 2023, the Commerce Department outlined a plan to invest $3 billion in CHIPS Act funds to expand U.S. advanced packaging capability. The department noted that at present, “we do not have advanced packaging in the US capable of high-volume manufacturing.” The advanced packaging plan will include a pilot facility that will “provide a place to test the new equipment and processes” and “allow for hands-on workforce development.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, the Commerce Department announced the award of multi-billion-dollar incentive packages to major chip manufacturers for investments in wafer fabrication facilities in the United States:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In February, CHIPS awarded GlobalFoundries up to $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in loans, respectively, to expand its campus in Malta, New York, and to revitalize its fabrication plant in Burlington, Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In March, the Commerce Department announced the award of $8.5 billion in grants to Intel Corporation, making available up to $11 billion in federal loans. Intel indicated it would use the support for investments in Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In April, the Commerce Department announced the award of $6.14 billion in grants to Micron Technology for investments in two semiconductor memory facilities in Syracuse, New York, as well a third fab colocated with its existing facility in Boise, Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That same month, the Commerce Department announced the award of $6.6 billion in grants and up to $5 billion in loans to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to build a third chip fabrication facility in addition to its two facilities under construction in Arizona. The newest fab will reportedly manufacture chips at process technologies of 2 nm or below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department also awarded $6.4 billion to Samsung Electronics to support its investments in a new chipmaking campus in Taylor, Texas, as well as an expansion of its Austin, Texas facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In May, the Commerce Department awarded $120 million to Polar Semiconductor, a maker of power and sensor chips, to double its U.S. production capacity in Minnesota. The deal will allow Polar to draw in another $450 million in U.S. private capital and $75 million from the state of Minnesota, helping to transform Polar to a majority U.S.-owned foundry.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May, the Commerce Department announced its first investment in the upstream semiconductor supply chain, granting up to $75 million to Absolics for a facility manufacturing next-generation glass substrates in Covington, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although unconfirmed, according to Politico, $3.5 billion from the CHIPS fund has been reportedly diverted toward a “secure enclave” project to manufacture state-of-the-art and secure chips for defense purposes. Draft appropriations legislation passed by the House Committee on Appropriations shows $1.5 billion allocated for the secure enclave in FY 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A May 2024 study by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group forecast that with the CHIPS Act support, U.S.-based semiconductor capacity will increase by 203 percent by 2032, and that the U.S. share of global chipmaking capacity will increase for the first time in decades during the same time frame, from 10 percent to 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2024, Mike Schmidt, director of the CHIPS Program Office, said that “because of the CHIPS Act, every company capable of producing leading edge semiconductors at scale is now expanding in the United States . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2024, the administration announced that it was launching a “workforce partner alliance,” allocating some of the funds appropriated for the NSTC to award grants to as many as 10 workforce development projects with budgets ranging from $500,000 to $2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That same month, the CHIPS Office announced it would make several awards of roughly $150 million each, up to $1.6 billion total, for research activities to “establish and accelerate domestic capacity for semiconductor advanced packaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, the Commerce Department reached a $450 million grant agreement with South Korean advanced memory chip firm SK Hynix to support their planned $4 billion high-bandwidth memory production, packaging, and R&amp;amp;D hub colocated with Purdue University in West Lafayette. With this award, all five of the world’s leading-edge memory, logic, and packaging companies have now agreed to build in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;darpas-initiative&quot;&gt;DARPA’s Initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal support for the semiconductor industry pursuant to the CHIPS Act will be augmented by activities at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), funded through the DOD’s budget rather than the CHIPS Act. DARPA plans to launch a domestic hub for prototyping advanced semiconductor fabrication techniques. Given DARPA’s extraordinary track record of breakthrough innovations, this development is significant, but its impact is likely to be felt only over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research center envisioned by DARPA will focus on 3D heterogeneous integrated (3DHI) microsystems, which feature the integration of diverse chip types into a single package for dramatically improved performance. DARPA regards this effort as potentially transformational for the U.S. economy and hopes to stand up the center by 2029. DARPA is establishing teams via a contract to pursue the initiative in two phases, each with a projected budget of $420 million. The goal is to create “a self-sustaining 3DHI center at an existing facility that is owned and operated by a non-federal entity, and accessible to users in academia, government, and industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3D projects bolster DARPA’s Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) — launched in 2017, with a follow-on ERI 2.0 announced in 2022 — which is focusing on advanced manufacturing opportunities and enabling electronic systems to function in extreme environments. DARPA plans to spend $3 billion on this effort over the next five years. DARPA’s Beyond Scaling Initiative, launched in 2017, develops software to automate and optimize chip design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what is most significant about the DARPA initiatives is that they underscore that the CHIPS Act, while remarkable, will not be sufficient on its own to reinvigorate and grow this key industry in the United States. The U.S. effort needs to be sustained and at scale if it is to have the desired impact, particularly in light of other countries’ sizeable investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;synopsis-of-the-eu-chips-act&quot;&gt;Synopsis of the EU Chips Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably one major impact of the U.S. CHIPS Act was to stimulate a similar effort in Europe. The European Commission and European Parliament approved the European Chips Act in July 2023, with the act becoming effective on September 21, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the EU Chips Act involves at least €43 billion in identified public funding, with the expectation that this will spur a roughly equal amount of private investment. Most of the public funding will be provided by the governments of the member states, not through the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the European Union, the €43 billion in public funds will include some private money and only €3.3 billion from the European Union’s budget, making the composition of the Chips Act funding less distinct. A 2023 analysis of the Chips Act conducted under the auspices of the Austrian government laments that “it is difficult to understand who is funding what, and how much fresh money is available for the Chips Act . . . the Chips Act is to be supported with an estimated overall level of policy-driven investment in excess of EUR 43 billion up to 2030. However, it remains unclear how much will come from the EU level, Member States and companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU Chips Act is designed to ensure Europe’s “strategic autonomy” and sovereignty by enabling a secure supply of critical chips. To do this, the European Union is creating three “pillars”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Joint Undertaking:&lt;/strong&gt; The first pillar is a public-private collaboration designated as the EU Chips Joint Undertaking (JU). It focuses on developing advanced chip technology (2 nm and below, quantum chips, and new production methods for such technologies). Themes include semiconductor research, pilot lines, standards, certification for energy efficiency and security of chips, skills, and networking of semiconductor research centers. Pillar one will reportedly be publicly funded with €11 billion. This effort roughly corresponds to the U.S. plan for the NSTC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Advanced Chip Production in Europe:&lt;/strong&gt; The second pillar, which is to absorb the bulk of EU public funding, will seek to establish vertically integrated manufacturing centers and “open EU foundries,” which will produce chips designed by others for third parties. To qualify, projects must be “first-of-kind” in the European Union, involving novel technology nodes, substrate materials, or other innovations that enhance chip performance, such as reduced power requirements and durability. Participating second-pillar companies will receive priority access to the pilot lines established pursuant to the first pillar. Companies participating in the second pillar are eligible for financial support from the European Union and member states, with funding reportedly totaling some $30 billion. Companies like Infineon and STMicro as well as Intel are seeking a portion of these funds to support new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Supply:&lt;/strong&gt; The third pillar will seek to ensure continuity of supply in the event of a chip shortage. It will involve monitoring to provide early warning of looming shortages, coordinated procurement, and a mandatory shift in production toward scarce chip types, with favorable investment terms offered to companies as a quid pro quo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance of the EU Chips Act will be divided between the European Semiconductor Board and the Chips Joint Undertaking. The board will comprise representatives of the member states and be chaired by the European Commission. The Governing Board of the Chips Joint Undertaking consists of representatives from participating member states, corporate representatives, and the European Commission. Within the commission, the Chips Act is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content, and Technology (DG-CNET).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation-to-date-1&quot;&gt;Implementation to Date&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is making impressive progress with multiple major announcements. As in the United States, the prospect of public funding is having a major catalytic impact. It is also evident from investment announcements and approvals granted by the European Union and member states that implementation of the EU Chips Act will entail major collaborations with foreign partners, notably U.S. firms but also Taiwan’s TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A leading example is U.S.-based Intel, which has outlined its plan to invest $88 billion in expanding its chip research and manufacturing facilities in Europe. In 2023, Intel secured a commitment from the government of Germany for nearly $11 billion in subsidies, which will be used to fund a chipmaking facility in Magdeburg. For its part, Intel will invest €30 billion in this project. Intel will invest €12 billion in Leixlip, Ireland, to double its manufacturing space for Intel 4 process technology. In addition, Intel is investing $4.6 billion in an assembly and test facility in Poland, which will test Intel chips fabricated in Germany and Ireland. The Polish government is expected to cover about one-third of this investment. Intel is also investing in other chip projects in France, Italy, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a cooperative effort, U.S.-based GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics have secured approval from the European Union to receive French government subsidies to build a chip fabrication plant in Crolles, France. The French will provide $8.13 billion to this project. GlobalFoundries is also investing in the expansion of its existing facilities in Dresden, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S.-based chipmaker Wolfspeed has announced plans to invest $3 billion in a new silicon carbide chip plant in Germany and expects the German government to provide 20 percent of this amount in subsidies to support the project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August 2023, Infineon (Germany), Bosch (Germany), TSMC (Taiwan), and NXP Semiconductors (the Netherlands) announced plans to establish the European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to build a chip fabrication plant in Dresden that will be majority-owned and operated by TSMC. Total investments are expected to be €10 billion and receive “strong support” from the European Union and the German government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Germany’s Infineon announced plans to build a €5 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Dresden to make power semiconductors and analog and mixed signals components. It is seeking €1 billion in public funding to support the project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union has approved grants of €292.5 million from the government of Italy to STMicroelectronics to build a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate manufacturing plant in Catania. In July 2024, the Chips JU announced the availability of €325 million in calling for proposals for chips research, including the creation of “competence centers” to provide technical expertise and research support, particularly for small and medium enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-to-government-bilateral-engagement&quot;&gt;Government-to-Government Bilateral Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and the EU Chips Acts mandate international collaboration, a recognition that neither region can achieve self-sufficiency in microelectronics. While the precise form such collaboration will take is not clear, certain broad themes have begun to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment of Export Controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the European Union are taking concrete steps to align their chip technology export controls with respect to “countries of concern,” principally China. The U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed strict controls on the export of U.S. chips and chipmaking technology to China. In September 2023, the government of the Netherlands established new export licensing rules which will prevent the Dutch maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment from exporting its most advanced chipmaking tools and technology to China. The European Union has released a white paper that proposes to establish a system of export controls at the EU level, as opposed to the current patchwork regime in which member states unilaterally implement their own controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Multilateral Efforts:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. CHIPS Act creates a $500 million International Technology Security and Innovation Fund administered by the State Department to support the coordination of chip export controls between the United States and its allies and partners. Participation in the fund is contingent on countries “having export controls on semiconductor trade with China that are ‘substantially equivalent’ to those imposed by the U.S.” As previous CSIS analysis has argued, new arrangements for aligning export controls are critical for the success of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment of Outbound Investment Screening:&lt;/strong&gt; In August 2023, President Biden signed an executive order restricting outbound U.S. investment into China’s semiconductor, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence industries. A senior administration official said that some U.S. allies, including the European Commission and Germany, were contemplating the imposition of “their own similar programs.” Some analysts have suggested that the multilateral approach that has emerged with respect to chip technology exports to China could serve as a model for multilateral controls on outbound investments in AI and other sensitive technologies to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Effective TTC Bilateral Working Group:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the European Union have established a standing bilateral working group under the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC), which, among many other issues, is addressing semiconductor-related matters of concern to both parties. The TTC was established in 2021 to serve as a forum “to coordinate approaches to key global trade, economic and technology issues and to deepen transatlantic trade and economic relations based on shared democratic values.” The TTC comprises a number of working groups, including one focusing on “secure supply chains, including semiconductors” and another addressing “export controls.” Other working groups address themes such as climate and green tech, technology standards cooperation, and data governance. The TTC meets regularly, with recent meetings in May 2023, January 2024, and April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Early Warning System:&lt;/strong&gt; According to Adrienne Elrod of the CHIPS Office, the European Union and the United States, working within the TTC framework, have completed an early warning system to alert the two parties to potential disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Transparency Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The parties have completed work on a transparency mechanism for sharing information about public support for the semiconductor producers of both regions, part of a bilateral effort to avoid a subsidies “race to the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has expressed the hope that the United States and the European Union will bilaterally address the European Union’s pending “Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive,” which proposes the phaseout of perfluorinated and polyperfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), which “are a critical component of the semiconductor industry, specifically, in the manufacturing of microchips. Currently, there are no viable replacements for this application on the market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precompetitive R&amp;amp;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Major research and development resources will be necessary to enable the U.S. and EU chip industries to remain internationally competitive. Both Chips Acts commit substantial funds to precompetitive R&amp;amp;D — in the European Union, this effort is led by the EU Chips Joint Undertaking and in the United States it will be led by the NSTC. The parties recognize that collaboration in the precompetitive space is essential given the sheer scale of the technological challenge — and, in some cases, the need to avoid duplication — although multiple paths toward similar research objectives can often be fruitful in unexpected ways. U.S. and EU companies, universities, and public research organizations are already engaged in a wide range of precompetitive R&amp;amp;D collaborations bringing together U.S. and EU researchers. The question is whether the new research initiatives envisioned by the dual Chips Acts can augment, inform, and perhaps coordinate these efforts or serve to reinforce them through a major injection of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need for Roadmaps?&lt;/strong&gt; An obvious role for the U.S. NSTC and its national and EU counterparts would be to serve as research hubs at the center of broader chip research networks to identify potential technological stumbling blocks in any aspect of the semiconductor ecosystem, from materials and tools through chip fabrication, assembly, test, and packaging. These challenges can then be addressed directly at the U.S. and EU hubs themselves or by delegation to other proven research entities in the network. The U.S. Sematech consortium, formed in 1988, served this function, overseeing the creation of a chip industry “roadmap” to spot looming technological hurdles and ensure that adequate research efforts were directed to surmount those hurdles, whether by Sematech itself or by other public or private actors. This role would require informed cooperative leadership and ongoing roadmap efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities for Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; On November 30, 2023, the European Union’s Joint Undertaking issued a €1.67 billion call for proposals to develop pilot lines for various chip technologies, thus giving an indication of the chip research themes most of interest to Europe. The pilot line awards were announced in April 2024. Some of the themes are coextensive with a number of U.S. industry and government chip technology concerns, and the areas of overlap could form the basis for bilateral collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Heterogeneous System Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Heterogenous systems integration and assembly involve the use of advanced packaging technologies to combine semiconductor materials, circuits, and components into a single compact system. This effort parallels the U.S. DARPA chip effort noted above as well as the packaging initiative under the auspices of the Commerce Department.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading-Edge Nodes:&lt;/strong&gt; The project of manufacturing nodes at or below 2 nm envisions closing or at least reducing the technological gap with Taiwan and South Korea in leading-edge chips — a major U.S. goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (FD-SOI) toward 7 nm:&lt;/strong&gt; FD-SOI is a manufacturing process that improves chip performance and reduces power consumption. These devices have applications in the automotive sector, the Internet of Things, and telecommunications, among other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wide Bandgap Semiconductors:&lt;/strong&gt; Wide bandgap semiconductors employ materials that enable a chip to operate at higher voltage, frequency, and temperature than standard silicon chips. These devices have applications in power generation, electric vehicles, telecommunications, and aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of observers have noted that a collaboration between the NSTC and imec, the European Union’s foremost microelectronics research center, is an obvious way to launch a strategic effort by the United States and the European Union to coordinate their chip R&amp;amp;D agendas. Belgium-based imec has an unparalleled record of international collaborations in semiconductors and has been characterized by The Economist as “one of the most essential industrial research-and-development research and development (R&amp;amp;D) centres on the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imec has suggested a collaboration in which it concentrates on early-stage technology development closer to basic research with a 7–10 year time horizon (device architectures and process modules), while the NSTC focuses on development stages closer to the market, such as prototyping, scaling, and transfer to manufacturing, with a 4–6 year time horizon. Some cooperation reflecting this approach appears to be underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable a rapid and effective ramp-up, this effort should leverage existing chip research infrastructure — notably New York CREATES Nanotech Complex in Albany, imec in Flanders, CEA-Leti in Grenoble, and the German Fraunhofer centers focused on semiconductor technologies. These facilities have enormous advantages in terms of existing infrastructure and the ability to add on new capabilities at lower cost and with less regulatory overhang. They also benefit from the presence of established partners and protocols, long-standing state or regional support, and well-developed networks of related firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that proposals to construct “greenfield” facilities will encounter daunting hurdles in terms of the cost and regulatory delays associated with new construction, the time required for construction, and the need to recruit and staff a new facility. Indeed, the capital costs for a major new facility are beyond the resources of the CHIPS Act and certainly not envisaged in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult to identify any historical precedent for the current U.S.-EU effort to coordinate their industrial policies to achieve common objectives in a vital sector. Bilateral relations have long been marred by acrimonious disputes over agriculture, steel, and commercial aircraft. Nonetheless, the Atlantic community has experienced a common economic trauma — the Covid-19-driven chip shortage — and it now confronts a shared strategic and commercial challenge from China. Consequently, the drive for a more cooperative approach is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the foundations for productive collaboration already exist in the form of the multiple transatlantic partnerships that have grown organically between the companies, universities, and research organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. Early developments of the TTC are arguably auspicious — the parties’ joint actions on export controls and the deliberations and cooperation in the TTC are both positive indicators of a will to cooperate at the political level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation, however, is harder in practice than in declarations, especially when competing perspectives and needs, differing capabilities, and the competing policies and practices of national and supernational bureaucracies come into play. Even so, the alignments in place suggest that current plans for cooperation among the regional cooperative research institutes are well suited — indeed best suited — to lead concrete, mutually advantageous cooperation in close consultation with the companies themselves and leading research universities. Providing the policy space for this organic cooperation based on the identification of productive opportunities may be in fact the best path forward, one that benefits from high-level approval but is driven by technological opportunity and commercial needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（19日）踏入第75日審訊，法官張慧玲第二日引導陪審團。張官引述控方立場指，Telegram 群組「行山討論區」是為了於11月16日試槍及炸彈而設，目的是將串謀付諸實行。辯方則指，若說試槍及炸彈是為促進串謀則太過早，因試槍當日尚未知道大行動落實的日期及地點。辯方指，最早於12月3日才知道大行動的落實日期。而代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成更認為，12月8日凌晨吳智鴻與黃振強在餐廳見面時，才正式落實大行動的地點，因此「屠龍」一方最早於上述時間知道串謀協議的全部詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官引述辯方立場-指屠龍123才知道大行動落實日期&quot;&gt;官引述辯方立場 指「屠龍」12.3才知道大行動落實日期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第二日引導陪審團。張官提及，陪審團需要考慮 Telegram 群組「行山討論區」之目的，控方的立場是群組為了測試槍械及炸彈而設，目的是將串謀付諸實行。辯方則指，若說試槍及炸彈是為促進串謀，則太過早，因試槍日期為11月16日，當時尚未知道大行動的落實日期及地點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方的立場是，最早於12月3日才知道大行動的落實日期。而代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成更認為，12月8日凌晨吳智鴻與黃振強在灣仔的薔紅餐廳見面時，才正式落實大行動的地點，因此「屠龍」一方最早於上述時間知道串謀協議的全部詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官若試槍屬將串謀付諸實行亦只針對吳智鴻團隊的被告&quot;&gt;官：若試槍屬將串謀付諸實行、亦只針對吳智鴻團隊的被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官又指，即使陪審團認為去西貢行山試槍是屬於將串謀付諸實行的行為，亦只可以考慮作為針對吳智鴻一方，即被告賴振邦及許湛榮的證據，而不可以考慮針對屬「屠龍」成員的被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官另表示，陪審團需要考慮 Telegram 帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」的使用者是否賴振邦，若認為是他的話，就要決定賴的行為是否顯示他屬串謀的一份子。至於許湛榮，雖然他在「行山討論區」群組並無發言，但警方在吳智鴻家中找到一張地圖，上面有許的指紋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官串謀有分工各人負責不同部分&quot;&gt;官：串謀有分工、各人負責不同部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於吳智鴻一方在11月25日在賴振邦的「3C 維修工作室」後樓梯，測試引爆裝置的事件，張官表示，若陪審團認為「屠龍」屬串謀的一份子，即使上述試爆事件「屠龍」成員並不在場，但也可以考慮屬串謀的一部分。張官解釋，因串謀當中有不同分工，有些人負責製作炸彈，有些人負責其他部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件明（20日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

Despite appeals made to national security, proposed constraints on open-source AI distribution might put defense supply chains at risk. This brief assesses those implications for the Joint Force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) priority. Software powered by generative AI foundation models — generalist systems that emulate human reasoning — might process reams of raw intelligence, automate Pentagon paperwork, or allow aircraft, trucks, and ships to navigate themselves. Many advancements in this sector originate in commercial and academic research. If generative AI sees wide adoption across the DOD, this base of commercial foundation model developers will become a critical part of the defense industrial base. The Joint Force thus has a stake in the commercial foundation model ecosystem and how it evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DOD AI strategies hinge on continued commercial innovation in AI. To that end, the Pentagon has assigned new funding to acquire AI-powered systems, such as for its Replicator drones and Joint All-Domain Command and Control battle network, and new organizations to manage them, empowering the Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO), Task Force Lima, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this institutional buildup, the Pentagon should appraise proposed commercial foundation model market regulations. As with spectrum auctions or shipbuilding, civil sector policymaking will shape the DOD’s future choices. Policies that create a competitive ecosystem of market players could improve the supply chain for future DOD programs. Conversely, policies that accelerate consolidation — like the Jones Act or the 1993 “Last Supper” — might threaten it. The 2023 Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence has made unprecedented use of the Defense Production Act to regulate the commercial AI market. It is now worth asking where regulation of commercial markets could affect defense production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-open-foundation-model-debate-a-litmus-test&quot;&gt;The Open Foundation Model Debate: A Litmus Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging civil society debates over AI safety — especially over open foundation models — merit particular attention. Unlike with closed models like GPT-4, developers of open foundation models like Llama, Mistral, or Qwen openly publish the models’ underlying parameters (“weights”), allowing them to be inspected, modified, and operated by end users. With the performance of open models approaching their closed counterparts (Figure 2), some have suggested that open model distribution could pose “extreme risks” for misuse. Others, meanwhile, have highlighted open models’ benefits for research, security, and national competitiveness. Though outcomes remain uncertain, proposals to limit the distribution of open models — such as through California Senate Bill (SB) 1047 — have recently gained legislative traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the open foundation model debate is resolved would have direct implications for the defense industrial base. As detailed in later sections, there are preliminary reasons to believe that a diverse open model ecosystem might benefit the DOD. The widespread availability of high-performance, open-source foundation models could improve the DOD’s ability to (1) competitively source and sustain AI systems, (2) deploy AI securely, and (3) address novel use cases. Considering these impacts, the open model debate represents a test case for how civil society evaluates defense priorities in AI policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlining these implications might also clarify, in White House Office of Science and Technology Policy director Arati Prabhakar’s words, an often “garbled conversation about the implications, including safety implications, of AI technology.” Indeed, in its flagship report on the subject, the Biden administration suggested that “the government should not restrict the wide availability of model weights” but that “extrapolation based on current capabilities and limitations is too difficult to conclude whether open foundation models, overall, pose more marginal risks than benefits.” The administration has not endorsed open model restrictions nor foreclosed future regulation. An accounting of defense industrial benefits might therefore contribute to this ongoing conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terms-of-the-debate&quot;&gt;Terms of the Debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source software and standards are already widespread in U.S. national security applications. Army smartphones, Navy warships, and Space Force missile-warning satellites run on Linux-derived operating systems. AI-powered F-16s run on open-source orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes, which is regularly updated, maintained, and tested by industry and the broader public. Open-source software is ubiquitous, permeating over 96 percent of civil and military codebases, and will remain a core piece of defense infrastructure for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What constitutes an “open” foundation model is less well defined. Developers can distribute foundation models at different levels of “openness” — from publishing white papers and basic technical information to releasing models entirely, including their underlying weights, training data, and the code used to run them. By contrast, developers of closed models, including GPT-4 or Claude, release fewer details or data, only allowing user access through proprietary application programming interfaces. In general, this brief defines “open” models as those with widely available weights, consistent with relevant categories in the 2023 AI executive order. Many of the risks and benefits discussed here flow from these definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims of extraordinary risk have motivated several recent proposals surrounding open-source AI. Analysts have expressed concern that malicious users might modify open foundation models to discover cybersecurity vulnerabilities or instruct users in the creation of chemical and biological weapons. Others have argued that public distribution of model weights could aid adversaries in advancing their AI capabilities. Given these apprehensions, some observers have proposed export controls, licensing rules, and liability regimes that would limit the distribution of open foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A competing school of thought has emphasized the societal benefits of open foundation models. Open distribution of weights, some argue, accelerates innovation and adoption: indeed, the key frameworks and innovations underpinning today’s large language models (LLMs), like PyTorch and the transformer architecture itself, were distributed openly. Others contend that the public scrutiny of model weights enables rapid discovery and repair of vulnerabilities, improves public transparency, and reduces the concentration of political and economic power as AI systems increase in importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most clear, however, is that this risk-benefit assessment remains incomplete. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s initial assessment is inconclusive, and AI safety literature has thus far lacked clear frameworks for identifying relative risk and benefit and whether they are unique to open models. Despite concerns over AI models instructing untrained users in biological weapon development, for instance, recent red-teaming exercises concluded that LLM-equipped teams performed similarly to those without. Similar concerns over AI-assisted cyber vulnerability discovery remain unclear, with some arguing that enhanced vulnerability detection may benefit cyber defenders over attackers, or that the balance of advantage would be case-dependent. Malicious use, meanwhile, continues to take place with closed models. In brief, more research remains necessary to unpack where the relative risks and benefits lie. The purportedly catastrophic harms of tomorrow’s foundation models have not yet come into clear view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the pace of technical change has been so uncertain that evaluating future benefits, harms, and policy interventions can be challenging. Whether a licensing regime is effective, for example, depends on how readily foundation model technologies will diffuse. And whether export controls benefit national security hinges on which analogy becomes relevant: Is restricting open models like restricting nuclear weapons exports, or is it akin to Cold War bans (now repealed) on public-key cryptography, a technology which now underpins online banking, e-commerce, and a multi-trillion-dollar digital economy? In the absence of a U.S. market presence, will Chinese open models take their place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, questions remain on how to implement AI policy. Definitional challenges abound; early AI policy approaches, including the EU AI Act, AI executive order, and California SB 1047, apply thresholds for “systemic risk” to models exceeding a certain amount of computing power or cost used in their development. However, such thresholds for triggering government review, such as the 1026 floating-point-operation threshold in the AI executive order, may incompletely capture the capabilities they aim to regulate. How to balance resourcing for AI policy implementation against other cyber and biological threat mitigations, such as for material monitoring or new cyberdefense capabilities, remains another open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XwTS4zj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source-and-the-joint-force&quot;&gt;Open Source and the Joint Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defense industrial assessment could thus contribute a valuable perspective to the AI risk debate. With AI industry trends favoring consolidation, the open foundation model ecosystem may become an increasingly important source of competition in the industrial base. Because end users can modify and run open models directly, they have become increasingly relevant for developing local, secure applications and embedded systems — needed by military users demanding low power usage, security, and reliability. And because open models can be publicly inspected, red teamed, and verified, they may present defense-related cybersecurity advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, however, the DOD has largely focused on AI adoption. In its flagship data, responsible AI, and adoption strategies, the DOD has focused on harnessing private sector innovations for national security end uses. It has embedded chief data officers in combatant commands; tested AI use cases in major experimentation initiatives, like the Global Information Dominance Experiment, Project Convergence, and others; and developed the Responsible AI Framework, emphasizing the use of traceable, transparent AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the DOD established Task Force Lima, an element within the CDAO tasked with “responsibly pursu[ing] the adoption” of generalist models. Alongside the CDAO and Responsible AI Working Council, Lima was chartered to “accelerate” AI initiatives, “federate disparate developmental and research efforts,” and engage across the interagency on the “responsible development and use of generative AI,” with a final strategy due for release in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarifying potential AI use cases within the DOD is a valuable first step in “mak[ing] life easier for program offices who want to do AI or add AI.” A valuable second step would be to identify the broader trajectory of the AI industrial base. The DOD will often rely on industry expertise to develop and identify more generative AI use cases; a broad ecosystem of model and application developers will be critical for this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, an assessment of defense industrial impacts is conspicuously missing from the broader debate on open foundation models. Arguments over model regulation are couched in national security language but should involve a broader swath of national security practitioners, including defense acquisition professionals. Accordingly, DOD elements, including the CDAO, should independently assess the national capacity to develop AI-powered systems and the impact of open foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Arguments over model regulation are couched in national security language but should involve a broader swath of national security practitioners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-adoption-strategies-to-industrial-strategies&quot;&gt;From Adoption Strategies to Industrial Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defense industrial accounting is needed because of preliminary evidence that open foundation models — and their supporting ecosystem — could be useful for the DOD. AI adoption remains a DOD priority, and open release has historically accelerated the rate of technology adoption. Open-source development may have positive competitive implications for defense acquisition. And open-source communities are accelerating developments in on-premises deployment, fine-tuning for specialized applications, model reliability, and other desirable characteristics for defense end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplier diversity.&lt;/strong&gt; In its 2023 National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS), the DOD prioritized the diversification of national component supplier bases. To improve competition for new entrants, for instance, it has developed new funding mechanisms, like Strategic Funding Increase contracts, and innovation organizations, like the Defense Innovation Unit. A robust ecosystem of open foundation model developers might improve defense supplier diversity and prevent market consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are strong incentives for consolidation in the foundation model industry. Unlike other software products, large foundation models are particularly capital-intensive to develop, rivaling the supply chain complexity of major defense hardware. Training a foundation model, open or closed, demands extremely large datasets, costly graphics processing units and accelerator chips, and talent, advantaging larger players. Operating them — a process termed inference — also imposes high energy costs. Due to these factors, industry leaders have spent tens of billions of dollars to develop and deploy so-called frontier foundation models. This high cost of entry increases the risk of industry consolidation and, consequently, capacity pressure on future DOD acquisition programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Would a robust open AI ecosystem relieve these pressures, creating competition for proprietary vendors and accelerating innovation? Open foundation models have begun to show competitive performance with closed, proprietary alternatives. To date, many competitive open foundation models have been developed by well-resourced actors. But community modification and experimentation have sped the development of new architectures and reductions in training and inference costs. Modified open models have also demonstrated high performance in highly specialized tasks; they might be similarly performant for those anticipated for defense applications, like flight control, business automation, or intelligence fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive sustainment.&lt;/strong&gt; More critically, the existence of open foundation models mitigate dependence on single vendors when sustaining AI-powered defense systems. Foundation models used in defense applications may need specialized retuning, including with government data, as the operating environment changes. High-performance closed models have also shown performance drifts over time; access to model weights and other information would help vendors diagnose emergent problems. In short, by building on open foundation models, the DOD could reduce barriers for vendors to compete on model integration, retuning, and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These imperatives resemble those motivating the Pentagon’s Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) for major hardware purchases. Lack of access to technical data has historically challenged the DOD’s ability to reliably and affordably sustain military hardware. Given these barriers, military services have increasingly demanded access to the data needed to service new helicopters, trucks, and ships. For its nearly $70 billion Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program, for example, the U.S. Army rejected a $3.6 billion lower bid over incomplete MOSA requirements, opting for a vendor that provided full access to aircraft technical data packages (TDPs) required for maintenance. Just as it is challenging to competitively source aircraft maintenance without access to TDPs, competitively sustaining AI-powered software may be difficult without access to model weights.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It would be challenging, however, to adopt such a modular approach with closed-model-powered software. Closed model developers are unlikely to relinquish access to model weights for other vendors to modify while performing their sustainment contracts. Moreover, to securely implement model-level changes to a defense application, national security customers would potentially need to certify both the application vendor and closed model vendor separately, adding additional friction to an already difficult acquisition process. Evaluating appropriate data rights for closed models could demand a further institutional lift.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A world with competitive open foundation models would allow the Pentagon to sidestep these sustainment challenges. While vendors would tune and adapt open models for proprietary applications, visibility into their underlying weights and architectures would make it easier for others to maintain and integrate them, potentially reducing the cost of sustainment. The presence of open options, moreover, could improve taxpayer bargaining power in negotiations with closed providers on complex data-rights matters. The DOD has already invested heavily in competitively sustaining military hardware. Those same lessons apply when sustaining AI-powered software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and reliability.&lt;/strong&gt; Concerns over the confidentiality and reliability of foundation models remain key barriers to DOD generative AI adoption. The potential to locally operate open foundation models on DOD infrastructure therefore becomes a key advantage. Open models might present useful options for building AI-powered systems without needing to certify an external foundation model developer for sandboxed deployments. Like with Linux, Kubernetes, or other open software libraries, these models might become a secure baseline for AI that vendors modify with classified or specialized information.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A robust open research community could also drive advancements in AI model reliability and interpretability, reducing the number of hallucinations — nonuniform responses that do not reflect the information a user needs. Access to model weights is often crucial for diagnosing failure and evaluating model reliability in detail. Insofar as hallucinations remain a “showstopper” for defense AI adoption, innovations in the open foundation model ecosystem are worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, much like with open-source software, open access to weights might enable a greater possibility of detecting vulnerabilities. Indeed, the AI executive order places special emphasis on red teaming future foundation models; more open approaches to model publication allow a wider peer review of model performance. As Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency analysts have recently emphasized, there is “significant value in open foundation models to help strengthen cybersecurity, increase competition, and promote innovation.” Accordingly, future assessments might review the advantages and disadvantages open models present for hardened, defense-critical AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Lastly, a robust open foundation model ecosystem might enable AI use cases that receive less attention from closed-source providers. Because open models can be retrained, fine-tuned, and broadly customized, they can serve as a basis for national-security-specific applications. Further, open-source initiatives can drive innovation in national-security-relevant topics, such as for document and data search with semantic retrieval. These search algorithms leverage embedding models — a form of language model — to compare the semantic meaning of stored documents and return relevant results; open models largely dominate performance metrics for embedding generation. Domains overlooked by major commercial players could benefit from the dynamism of open development. Further investigation should assess use cases where open model performance meaningfully exceeds closed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-ai-last-supper&quot;&gt;An AI “Last Supper”?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary evidence suggests that open foundation models might benefit the defense industrial base. What is now needed is a quantitative assessment of the open ecosystem’s fiscal impacts. Beyond assessing pathways to adoption, defense policymakers should review the changing competitive landscape for foundation models and potential implications for the defense industrial base. Three recommendations follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In its forthcoming review of DOD foundation model adoption, Task Force Lima and partners should compare open and closed models in generative AI use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Different foundation model architectures have roles to play in defense applications. For document summarization tasks, for instance, developers might use open- and closed-source models in a variety of architectures, from retrieval-augmented generation to in-context learning. Although technical details on performance are beyond this paper’s scope, a broad comparison of potential open- and closed-model use cases could provide useful context for acquisition professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NDIS implementation should include assessments of the foundation model industrial base, including data, infrastructure, human capital, competitive dynamics, and the impact of open model development.&lt;/strong&gt; The 2022 National Defense Strategy acknowledges that the DOD “will be a fast-follower where market forces are driving commercialization of . . . trusted artificial intelligence,” while the NDIS asserts that it must “diversify [the] supplier base” and “foster competition within the defense market.” An independent assessment of those market forces, including competition in the AI market, would be critical to implementing the NDIS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DOD should collect data on where open foundation models are used in its systems, the number of nontraditional performers who leverage open foundation models, and models’ potential fiscal impacts.&lt;/strong&gt; As the DOD begins to adopt AI-powered systems, it should collect data on where open foundation models are being leveraged. Such data might inform future analyses on the health of the AI industrial base and the ability for new entrants to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a considerable risk in disregarding defense industrial impacts in the debate over open foundation models. Major consolidation in other sectors, such as in shipbuilding and aerospace, has come alongside major declines in defense acquisition speed and capacity. If open foundation models are indeed “dual-use” — and therefore critical to national security — the potential for consolidation deserves national security attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil sector policy decisions have created a shipbuilding base outproduced by China 230 to 1. Other deliberate choices over the nation’s industrial base have meant that demand now outpaces supply for missile defense systems, artillery shells, and AI talent. If production is deterrence, these are the stakes of the open-source AI debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others will not wait for the United States if it falls back. China and other states have made vast investments in stimulating their domestic AI industries, with top models “not far behind” Western counterparts. The United States’ competitors view open foundation models as a means of capturing global market share and advancing scientific and economic development. While the development of AI is not an arms race, it is a broader economic and social competition — one where U.S. priorities on democracy, transparency, and security should define global standards. The technology and value system to do so are already in place. Attention is all it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-selected-model-performance-evaluations&quot;&gt;Appendix: Selected Model Performance Evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table compiles self-reported Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) scores, one of many benchmarks used to evaluate foundation model performance. Typical scores reported are “5-shot,” where five examples are provided before models are prompted with a question. “Open” models listed include those with publicly available model weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While MMLU is an incomplete representation of model performance, this benchmark was selected because it is among the oldest, allowing for consistent comparison over time. Writ large, the foundation model industry increasingly suffers from a benchmarking crisis, facing issues of model overfitting — internalizing existing benchmark results — and obsolescence. Developing trusted benchmarks has thus become a major Department of Commerce priority.&lt;/p&gt;

With expanded security, economic, and people-to-people ties, the partnership between the two states is set to deepen regardless of political changes on either side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, U.S.-Vietnam relations will mark two important anniversaries: 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War and 30 years since the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations. These anniversaries reflect the United States and Vietnam’s long journey toward strong bilateral ties. Ties reached a new high-water mark in September 2023 when President Joe Biden and the late Communist Party of Vietnam general secretary Nguyen Phu Trong elevated the relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership — the highest in Vietnam’s diplomatic canon. This made clear to every official in Vietnam that the country’s collective leadership prioritizes the bilateral relationship. The same is true of Vietnam’s recently concluded comprehensive strategic partnerships with Australia, India, Japan, and South Korea. There is no reason to think that any future leader in Vietnam would seek to slow the momentum in those deepening relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-cooperation-amid-political-transitions&quot;&gt;Strategic Cooperation amid Political Transitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong’s passing on July 19 after more than a decade in power marks a period of political transition that will continue at least until Vietnam’s 14th Party Congress, scheduled for 2026. But the Communist Party of Vietnam, regardless of its leader, will continue to prioritize Vietnam’s independence and agency amid great power competition. This has always been the bedrock of Vietnamese strategy. That means Hanoi will continue to deepen its relationship with the United States while seeking stable and productive relations with Beijing where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Trong became the first general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam to ever visit the United States, meeting with then president Barack Obama in the White House. To Lam, now serving as both president of Vietnam and general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, visited Washington for meetings with U.S. counterparts in 2019, as has nearly every Vietnamese prime minister and president in recent years. U.S. officials have reciprocated that attention, with every president since Bill Clinton visiting Hanoi at least once during their time in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Trump administration, the U.S.-Vietnam relationship took significant steps forward with an increase in direct investment in the country and an emphasis on energy cooperation. In 2019, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a comprehensive energy partnership to boost energy market cooperation. Under the Biden administration, the United States doubled down on its commitment to Vietnam. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made Vietnam part of his first tour of the region in July 2021, alongside U.S. ally the Philippines and strategic partner Singapore. A month later, Kamala Harris became the first U.S. vice president to visit Vietnam. The visit yielded enhanced bilateral security and economic engagements, playing a critical role in the eventual formation of the comprehensive strategic partnership. Harris returned to Vietnam in November 2022 to meet with then president Nguyen Xuan Phuc, reaffirming the bilateral security and economic ties and showcasing greater U.S. commitment to Vietnam. So, whether Donald Trump or Harris occupies the White House in January 2025, the United States will have a president already well-versed in U.S.-Vietnam ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no matter what changes at the political level in Washington and Hanoi, the two states will continue to share similar views of regional security and anxieties about China. That has been and will remain the ballast in their security relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam faces maritime coercion from and shares a land border with China, which officials and the broader public view as a perennial threat. Vietnam repelled a Chinese invasion across that border in 1979 and fought a series of skirmishes with China over the next decade. It faces regular gray zone challenges from China’s navy, coast guard, and militia, which could escalate at any time. It maintains nearly 50 outposts in the Spratly Islands provisioned against a potential Chinese invasion or blockade in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the need to maintain ties with China, no Vietnamese leader will compromise on sovereignty, including in the South China Sea disputes. And as every available survey of public and elite opinion in the country shows, there is nowhere on earth more fearful of Chinese hegemony than Vietnam. That is why Vietnamese leaders value strategic ties with the United States and its allies as a counterweight to their necessary relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No matter what changes at the political level in Washington and Hanoi, the two states will continue to share similar views of regional security and anxieties about China. That has been and will remain the ballast in their security relationship.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, U.S.-based observers forget just how far and fast security ties with Vietnam have evolved. Washington only lifted an embargo on arms sales to Vietnam in 2016. Yet over the last decade, the two have regularly engaged in defense exchanges, including visits to Vietnam by U.S. aircraft carriers. Vietnam has been a major recipient of U.S. maritime security assistance, including the delivery of Metal Shark patrol boats and access to the SeaVision maritime domain awareness platform used by most U.S. allies and partners across the region. In late 2022, Vietnam hosted its first-ever international defense expo, and major U.S. defense manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, were there peddling their wares. This would have been unthinkable even a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooperation should be expected to deepen, but there will remain limits to how much the United States and Vietnam can do together in the short term and how much they will align on strategic issues beyond China. For instance, Vietnam maintains close ties to Russia, and Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Hanoi in June despite objections from Washington. Vietnam has not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has abstained from all UN votes on the issue. This does not mean that Hanoi supports Russia’s war; indeed, it allowed state media to report openly about the war, and there is considerable sympathy for the Ukrainian cause among much of the Vietnamese public. However, Vietnam’s government cannot afford to alienate Russia without compromising its own security. More than 80 percent of Vietnam’s military equipment is Soviet- or Russian-made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine makes it a strategic liability, and Hanoi knows it. As a result, it is accelerating the diversification of its military procurement, including exploring acquisitions from the United States and its allies. However, that will be a very long-term process. In the interim, Washington will need to accept that Hanoi cannot risk its own military preparedness by overtly condemning Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;growing-opportunities-the-us-vietnam-economic-partnership&quot;&gt;Growing Opportunities: The U.S.-Vietnam Economic Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s meteoric economic rise is a remarkable success story. From the launch of its Doi Moi reforms in 1986, fortuitous global trends and adept policymaking have led to rapid development. In the nearly 40 years since, Vietnam’s GDP per capita increased sixfold, from $600 to $3,700. The poverty rate was slashed from 14 percent in 2010 to 4.2 percent in 2022. Its rapidly growing middle class, stable political environment, and willingness to join economic agreements, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (an earlier version of which the United States abandoned) and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (of which the United States is a part), have made Vietnam an attractive investment destination for foreign firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-vietnam-economic-relations&quot;&gt;U.S.-Vietnam Economic Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the normalization of ties in 1995, the United States and Vietnam have become strong economic partners. The two countries concluded a bilateral trade agreement in 2001 that led the United States to grant Vietnam most favored nation status and support its accession to the World Trade Organization. Trade has greatly increased in the two decades since. U.S. goods and services trade with Vietnam amounted to $114.6 billion in 2022, a huge jump from $2.9 billion in 2002. The United States is the largest export destination for Vietnamese goods, ranging from textiles to footwear and electronics. In 2022, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided Vietnam with $142 million in official development assistance, including through projects addressing the legacies of the Vietnam War, such as dioxin remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s growing role in the regional economy of the Indo-Pacific makes it a vital partner for the United States. The Biden administration has made engagement with Vietnam a key priority in the region. Economics, trade, and investment cooperation were key tenets of the comprehensive strategic partnership concluded in September 2023: the two governments reaffirmed their commitments to create favorable economic conditions; facilitate the opening of each country’s market to the other, including by tackling barriers to entry; and support other mutually beneficial trade and economic policies. Vietnam is also partnering with the United States on semiconductor manufacturing under the International Technology Security and Innovation Fund established by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The joint statement from Biden and Trong acknowledged Vietnam’s request for a review of its market economy status. On August 2, 2024, the Department of Commerce determined that Vietnam will continue to be classified as a nonmarket economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vietnam’s growing role in the regional economy of the Indo-Pacific makes it a vital partner for the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of ever-intensifying U.S.-China competition, Vietnam, more than any of its Southeast Asian neighbors, has benefitted from the diversion of new foreign investment away from China. Vietnam is becoming a production destination for high-value electronic goods, from smartphones to semiconductors, with a growing renewable energy market and a nascent critical mineral production and processing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;semiconductors-and-electronics-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Semiconductors and Electronics Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam is often seen as a viable “friendshoring” partner for the United States and its allies as businesses seek to “de-risk” the high-tech sector. Its highly educated workforce and stable political environment have made it an attractive alternative for companies interested in relocating from China. Vietnam participates in 16 free trade agreements, more than its neighbors, and offers tax breaks and exemptions for high-tech projects. It boasts low labor costs and maintains a steady output of skilled students. USAID’s Partnership for Higher Education Reform has provided $14.2 million to boost teaching, research, and innovation in Vietnam’s three largest national universities. Moreover, the United States has committed $2 million to a joint initiative between the two countries to develop the semiconductor workforce. This closely aligns with Vietnam’s goal of expanding its semiconductor workforce tenfold to 50,000 engineers by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s semiconductor market grew 7.1 percent per year between 2016 and 2021 and was valued at $18.2 billion in 2022. Vietnam specializes in the assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP) process. By February 2023, its semiconductor chip exports to the United States reached $562 million, compared to $321.7 million in 2022. Vietnam has become the third-largest Asian semiconductor chip exporter to the United States. In April 2023, it accounted for more than 10 percent of semiconductor chips imported by the United States for seven consecutive months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel, a top global semiconductor manufacturer, began operations in Vietnam in 2006. Its ATP factory in Ho Chi Minh City is the largest in its manufacturing network. Amkor Technology, a packing and testing services provider, invested $1.6 billion in a new factory in Bac Ninh in 2023. U.S. semiconductor companies such as Intel, Marvell, and GlobalFoundries took part in a business delegation alongside Biden’s visit to Vietnam in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has also become a key destination for electronics manufacturers seeking to diversify and secure their supply chains. Apple has steadily been moving production into Vietnam, investing $15.8 billion in the country since 2019. It now operates 28 factories in Vietnam, mostly in the country’s northern provinces. Vietnam assembles a variety of Apple products and is projected to be responsible for a growing percentage of all Apple product production by 2025: 20 percent of all iPads and Apple Watches, 5 percent of MacBooks, and 65 percent of all AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Geographically, it is very well placed to achieve this goal: The country possesses immense potential for renewable energy. Between 2018 and 2022, renewable energy production rose fortyfold. Vietnam must further develop its clean electricity grid to maintain and grow its manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Vietnam signed a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with the United States and other donor nations, which will provide $15.5 billion in public and private finance to support the country’s clean energy transition. Vietnam’s JETP Resource Mobilization Plan aims to create both a regulatory and infrastructural framework for the energy transition while working to reduce emissions and improve upon power transmission and energy storage systems. USAID cooperates with Vietnam on a series of projects aimed at lowering emissions and stimulating investments in infrastructure and energy. With $36.2 million in funding from 2020 to 2025, the USAID Vietnam Low Emission Energy Program aims to support Vietnam’s clean energy transition. Meanwhile, the $13.9 million Vietnam Urban Energy Security program works with the Vietnamese government to identify clean energy solutions to urban energy challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Vietnamese government’s approval in July of Decree 80 on Direct Power Purchase Agreements, direct sale of renewable energy to customers via private transmission lines and the national grid is now possible. Foreign businesses will be able to purchase renewable energy from private producers instead of relying on the state-owned Vietnam Electricity for power. In January, 15 U.S. companies had expressed an interest in investing $8 billion in Vietnam’s clean energy infrastructure contingent on the adoption of such a rule. The approval of Decree 80 and subsequent deregulation of the renewable energy purchasing process could prove to be appealing to more foreign partners seeking to set up shop in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;critical-minerals&quot;&gt;Critical Minerals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s critical mineral reserves could also prove crucial to its rise in high-value global supply chains. Rare earth minerals are vital to the production of modern devices ranging from electric vehicle batteries to smartphone screens. Vietnam has the world’s second-largest known reserves of rare earth minerals after China. Seeking an opportunity in the wake of global supply chain reorientations, Vietnam is increasing its rare earth mining exponentially. In 2022, it produced 4,300 tons of these minerals compared to just 400 tons in 2021. The country aims to process 2 million tons of rare earth ores and 60,000 tons of rare earth oxides by 2030. Under the auspices of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the two countries have signed an agreement to strengthen technical cooperation to help Vietnam improve its rare earths industry and attract investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Vietnam has enjoyed significant international attention and investment, it faces considerable challenges. Infrastructure constraints are giving many interested investors pause, particularly when it comes to the availability of clean water and energy — a shortage of the latter led to unexpected blackouts that affected many foreign manufacturing operations in 2023. The national and local governments are well aware of the need for major infrastructure upgrades but have been slow to grant approval and disperse funds for major projects because of the ongoing dot lo, or blazing furnace, campaign against corruption. Between 2021 and early 2023, the Vietnamese government launched criminal investigations of 7,500 individuals and indicted more than 4,400 for graft. The Communist Party of Vietnam has disciplined tens of thousands of its own, including high-ranking officials and eight members of the Politburo, the country’s top decisionmaking body. From early 2023 to mid-2024, two presidents, the National Assembly chair, and the permanent member of the Secretariat (the fifth-most-senior official) were ousted. The breadth of the anti-corruption campaign has created bureaucratic paralysis, with officials hesitant to make any bold decisions or approve large projects for fear of future prosecutions. As a result, many investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach until they can better assess the future of their investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong’s death might lead to a slow winding down of the anti-corruption campaign, either before or after the 2026 National Party Congress, but that is unclear. High-profile arrests are likely to continue for some time, if only because of cases already under investigation. On July 22, for instance, police arrested five senior officials, including a former deputy environment minister, for violating mining regulations. Wherever the anti-corruption campaign goes, the atmosphere of bureaucratic caution is not going to ease overnight, so the slow disbursement of government funds and infrastructure shortfalls will continue to hamper growth for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the potential for a second Trump administration in the United States could complicate future progress in U.S.-Vietnam economic cooperation. A Trump administration would be likely to complain again about the growing U.S. trade deficit and may seek to address it via punitive measures, as it did the first time around with investigations into alleged currency manipulation and unfair trade practices. Given the huge U.S. commercial interest in Vietnam, a second Trump administration would be unlikely to reverse the trend of growing economic cooperation, but it could certainly slow the momentum of recent years. Despite these challenges, Vietnam will likely continue to enjoy sustained GDP growth over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-the-war-deepening-the-united-states-and-vietnams-friendship&quot;&gt;Beyond the War: Deepening the United States and Vietnam’s Friendship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the anniversaries of the end of the Vietnam War and of diplomatic normalization on the horizon, and a comprehensive strategic partnership in place, the United States and Vietnam have intensified efforts to reinforce people-to-people ties. The U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership should include redoubling efforts to address historical legacies, deepen linkages between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora, and expand educational exchanges. All three categories are critical in strengthening U.S.-Vietnam relations, providing opportunities for people from both countries not only to understand one another but also the complex history of war and reconciliation between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership should include redoubling efforts to address historical legacies, deepen linkages between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora, and expand educational exchanges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-legacies&quot;&gt;Historical Legacies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Vietnam have prioritized addressing the legacies of war. In April 2023, USAID announced a partnership with the War Remnants Museum (WRM) in Ho Chi Minh City. The partnership involves adding an exhibit to the WRM to showcase efforts by both countries to overcome the consequences of the Vietnam War. This historical exhibit marks the first time that the U.S. government has had a direct stake in how the war is memorialized in Vietnam. The WRM has previously faced many criticisms for lacking a balanced perspective, portraying U.S. soldiers as criminals while ignoring atrocities committed by North Vietnamese forces. The new collaborative exhibit showcases the United States and Vietnam’s joint commitment to address war legacies based on mutual understanding and an honest acknowledgment of history. The exhibit is expected to open in 2025, in time for both anniversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its strong commitment, the United States still has work to do to address the legacies of the Vietnam War. As of 2022, the remains of 1,244 U.S. service members killed or missing in action were still not accounted for, with 470 of those declared “non-recoverable.” Progress toward recovering remains has slowed, given the logistical and scientific hurdles involved. In 2023, only four service members’ remains were successfully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Austin, the U.S. defense secretary, and Vietnamese defense minister Phan Van Giang inked a memorandum of understanding in which the United States committed to assist Vietnam in locating, identifying, and recovering the war dead of Vietnamese forces. The Department of Defense intends to home in on relocation efforts by partnering with the United States Institute of Peace, USAID, U.S. academic institutions, and the Office of Defense Attache in Hanoi. While detailed implementation plans have not yet been established, the United States intends to target the following areas to aid in Vietnamese accounting efforts: archival research; digitization of documents; building technological accounting capacity; media outreach; exchanges between veterans, academia, policymakers, and technical and working-level people; and DNA analysis assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the recovery efforts of both U.S. and Vietnamese forces at play, the loss of lives affiliated with the former Republic of Vietnam (RVN or South Vietnam) has still not been officially recognized or addressed. While their war memorialization and recovery efforts thus far are commendable, the United States and Vietnam must include the RVN forces in these efforts to reconcile the Vietnamese-American community, a critical step in strengthening bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also continues to work with Vietnam to remove unexploded ordnance (UXO) and remediate soil contaminated by Agent Orange, an herbicide used during the war containing high levels of the deadly chemical dioxin. USAID completed a multiyear project to remediate soil at Da Nang airport; the project was launched during the Obama administration, and the agency is currently working to clean up Bien Hoa, a former U.S. air base containing high concentrations of Agent Orange. In December 2022, USAID awarded a contract to develop a facility to treat more than 100,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil at the base. The project is expected to cost $450 million and be completed in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the environmental remediation efforts are making considerable progress, more should be done to treat the victims of Agent Orange exposure. The U.S. government provides care and compensation for U.S. veterans exposed during the war, but more should be done in cooperation with Hanoi to treat Vietnamese victims. The U.S. and Vietnamese governments do not agree on who qualifies as being affected by Agent Orange exposure. Reaching such an agreement and increasing support to victims accordingly would mark an important step in reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States continues to support demining efforts in Vietnam, investing over $206 million as of 2022 and removing 5,979 mines and UXO from 1,247,425 square meters (308 acres) of land as of July 2021. In 2022, the Department of State initiated technological support to the Vietnam National Mine Action Center and two provincial mine action centers to develop the ability to carry out demining in Vietnam independently. The Department of State has also supported education on UXO risk in primary and secondary schools in affected Vietnamese provinces, including Da Nang, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue. Removal of all UXO from the war is a difficult feat, with millions of mines remaining undetected. The Vietnamese government speculates that, as of 2022, mines and UXO have caused over 40,000 deaths and 60,000 injuries since the war’s end. A notable nongovernmental organization (NGO) tackling this challenge is Project RENEW, a partnership established in 2001 between the Quang Tri Province government and international NGOs. Over 20 years, RENEW has successfully removed 815,952 explosives from Vietnam, less than half of what is estimated to remain. While it is impossible to remove all UXO, continued efforts are critical in decreasing safety risks throughout Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-vietnamese-diaspora&quot;&gt;The Vietnamese Diaspora&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the Vietnam War triggered a large-scale migration of Vietnamese nationals to the United States. At the end of the war in 1975, the United States evacuated around 125,000 Vietnamese nationals, many of whom had ties to the U.S. military and risked persecution by the victorious Communist government. The evacuation marked the first wave of Vietnamese refugees immigrating to the United States. A second wave began in 1978 and lasted into the 1980s, as many Vietnamese fled by boat to neighboring Southeast Asian states and were eventually resettled in third countries. Today, around 1.3 million Vietnamese immigrants reside in the United States, and the Vietnamese-American population totals more than 2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese Americans play an important role in U.S.-Vietnam relations. Most second-generation Vietnamese Americans have never been to Vietnam and many Vietnamese immigrants and their children remain fervently anti-communist. The community’s role in the deepening U.S.-Vietnam relationship has been conflicted, with many Vietnamese Americans eagerly forging new cultural and commercial ties, but others lobbying the U.S. government to adopt a more critical stance toward Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Vietnamese government refers to Vietnamese Americans as Viet Kieu, or “overseas Vietnamese.” After the war, the term was initially considered derogatory. But Vietnam’s relationship with the diaspora has evolved since the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations. Hanoi has worked to embrace the Vietnamese-American community, identifying it as a source of inspiration for Vietnamese at home. The cultural and political disconnect many Vietnamese Americans feel toward Hanoi will not disappear any time soon, but it is steadily shrinking. To further reconciliation efforts, the U.S. and Vietnamese governments should continue to support programs that allow Vietnamese Americans to return to Vietnam for cultural and educational exchanges. But they must also acknowledge and address the trauma suffered by Vietnamese on both sides of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;educational-exchanges&quot;&gt;Educational Exchanges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 30,000 Vietnamese students currently study in the United States, more than from any other country in Southeast Asia. The U.S. government is encouraging educational institutions to accept more Vietnamese students over the coming years. Vietnam has also welcomed U.S. universities to develop partnerships with Vietnamese institutions and even open campuses in Vietnam. The University of Arizona notably offers a collaborative program with Hanoi Law University (HLU) to earn both a bachelor of laws degree from HLU and a bachelor of arts in law degree from Arizona in only four years. Meanwhile, Troy University is currently partnered with Vietnam National University, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, and Saigon Technology University to offer a variety of undergraduate programs in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF) played an instrumental role in the early normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations via educational exchanges. Established by Congress in 1999, the VEF was a flagship education exchange program created to advance Vietnamese science and technology capacities. The VEF, which operated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2016, allowed Vietnamese scholars of academic merit to study in the United States. Over its run, the VEF brought in 600 Vietnamese nationals to pursue graduate degrees in the United States and over 40 U.S. professors from U.S. universities to teach at Vietnamese universities. The VEF’s foundational first steps toward normalizing educational exchanges inspired emerging programs such as the Fulbright Program to continue encouraging exchanges between the United States and Vietnam, with the two programs developing a strong working relationship until the VEF officially closed its doors in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, through the Fulbright Program, gives U.S. professionals an opportunity to study, teach, or research in Vietnam while learning about Vietnam’s language and culture. The Fulbright Economics Teaching Program emerged out of a 1994 partnership between Harvard University’s Vietnam Program and University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City. The program is now part of Fulbright University Vietnam, Vietnam’s first independent nonprofit university. Fulbright University Vietnam was commended in the announcement of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for its “growing role as a regional hub for public policy training,” as well as for its recognition of the importance of investing in human capital “as a critical resource for future prosperity, security, stability, and development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Peace Corps sent its first delegation of volunteers to Hanoi after 18 years of negotiations between the United States and Vietnam. The Peace Corps has championed “world peace and friendship through community-based development and intercultural understanding” since 1961. Internationally established and a hallmark for strong bilateral relations, the Peace Corps’ establishment in Vietnam marks a historic win for U.S.-Vietnam relations. The United States and Vietnam had been negotiating the bilateral agreement for the Peace Corps since 2004, inking a formal agreement in 2016 during the Obama administration. Implementation agreements were finalized in early 2021, formally recruiting staff later that year. With the Peace Corps’ Vietnam program established, the United States gives its citizens more opportunities to engage in both cultural and educational exchange opportunities, which are critical steps toward deepening mutual understanding between both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-bright-future-for-us-vietnam-relations&quot;&gt;A Bright Future for U.S.-Vietnam Relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral relationship between the United States and Vietnam is only beginning to prosper. Expanded government-to-government ties have created deeper institutional linkages between the two countries. Their bilateral friendship will be able to endure changes in administrations in each country, regardless of their respective domestic political environments. Economic engagement in Vietnam is growing steadily in the wake of Western companies de-risking from China. In the semiconductor production sector, renewable energy sector, and critical mineral sector, among others, there are significant opportunities for a U.S.-Vietnam economic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States and Vietnam continue to earnestly acknowledge their historical war legacies, paving the road toward an eventual mutual understanding between the two nations. Their strengthened bilateral relationship opens educational opportunities for people of both nations, including Vietnamese Americans, to play a role in the United States and Vietnam’s complicated and deepening friendship. And with important anniversaries of both the end of the Vietnam War and diplomatic normalization quickly approaching, the United States and Vietnam will only work to continue the momentum in their growing relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官提醒陪審團 指污點證人有強烈誘因作供、有機會作假冤枉被告&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ib6TDiF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（16日）踏入第74日審訊。控辯雙方已完成結案陳詞，法官張慧玲開始引導陪審團。張官提醒，3名污點證人有強烈誘因協助控方作證，他們希望獲減刑，故有機會剪裁證供，甚至作出虛假證供，冤枉被告牽涉本案，因此陪審團需謹慎處理其證供。張官又指，陪審團毋須考慮是次檢控是否公平，並提醒「唔好畀自己個人嘅同情或者偏見影響，要用持平中肯嘅態度」。張官亦指，串謀者毋須以書面或正式的形式達成協議，可用身體、語言、手勢或動作等達成協議，其中3個情況則不屬參與串謀，包括：對串謀不知情、無意圖加入串謀、「詐諦」加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陪審團需考慮被告是否128計劃的串謀者&quot;&gt;官：陪審團需考慮被告是否12.8計劃的串謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方已完成結案陳詞。法官張慧玲開始引導陪審團。張官指，2019下半年由於政府想修改《逃犯條例》，引發一連串社會事件，包括：遊行、示威、非法集會及暴動，當中亦有堵路及投擲汽油彈等破壞行為出現。而本案是關於12.8事件，有人串謀用炸彈及槍對付警察。控方指稱其中一名主謀是吳智鴻，他為一個無名組織的領導者，該組織負責準備槍械及炸彈。而另一組織「屠龍」，黃振強則自稱為隊長，並指他們會作「勇武」行為如投擲汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據證供所指，在12.8串謀之中，吳及其成員會將一大（12kg）及一小（8kg）炸彈放置軒尼詩道，即民陣遊行路線的一部分。而「屠龍」成員則負責「裝修」以引警察到細炸彈，並將他們推向大炸彈。槍手蘇緯軒會在大廈的高處以步槍射殺警察，然後各人會到場「執槍」。由於事前警方「收到風」，故串謀最終未有實行。警方在串謀當日的清晨6時拘捕部分被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱，本案首4名被告為「屠龍」成員，最後兩名被告則屬無名組織，上述6人均屬串謀者之一。第七被告劉佩凝則被指透過眾籌作恐怖主義活動。辯方的立場則指各被告沒有參與串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官提到，陪審團需考慮各被告是否12.8計劃的其中一個串謀者，而劉是否串謀籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為。張官指，舉證責任在於控方，被告無責任證明自己清白。陪審團負責考慮相信哪些證人的證供，本案共有31名控方證人，以及兩名辯方證人，當中包括選擇作供的李家田。張官指，就每名證人，陪審團可選擇相信部分或全部證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官污點證人有誘因協助控方有機會作假證供冤枉被告&quot;&gt;官：污點證人有誘因協助控方、有機會作假證供冤枉被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官指，本案其中3名串謀者以「污點證人」身份作供，包括黃振強、彭軍壕及蘇緯軒。3人已認罪，承認自己是12.8串謀的一份子。張官提醒陪審團必須緊記，3人有強烈誘因協助控方作證，他們是希望獲得較輕判刑，最高可獲50%折扣。3名證人有可能會剪裁證供，甚至作出虛假證供，冤枉被告牽涉本案。因此，陪審團需要謹慎處理他們的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，由於黃及彭獲律政司的豁免起訴書，若他們誠實作供的話，即使其證供透露自己曾參與暴動及縱火等行為，亦不會遭起訴。張官表示，對兩名證人而言這屬於利益、「有著數」，或驅使他們作虛假證供，以免失去豁免起訴的保障。張官再次提醒陪審團要謹慎處理他們的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陪審團毋須考慮檢控是否公平勿被個人同情影響&quot;&gt;官：陪審團毋須考慮檢控是否公平、勿被個人同情影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官又指，陪審團毋須考慮律政司是次檢控是否公平，「唔好考慮點解告佢哋」，亦毋須考慮其他涉案者的去向。張官又提醒，「唔好畀自己個人嘅同情或者偏見影響，要用持平中肯嘅態度」考慮本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官串謀者毋須書面正式協議詐諦加入並不屬參與&quot;&gt;官：串謀者毋須書面正式協議、「詐諦」加入並不屬參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官解釋控罪的元素，以及控方需要證明甚麼。就首6名被告被控的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，及其交替的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪。張官表示，不能兩罪同時成立；若陪審團認為首罪不成立，就要考慮第二條控罪是否成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，張官指根據條例，本案控罪之「訂明標的」是指「公用場所」，串謀者計劃將炸彈擺放於灣仔軒尼詩道，明顯是公用地方。而本案的炸彈亦屬於控罪所指的「爆炸性裝置」，這點並不受爭議。另外，控罪亦要求控方證明被告是有「非法理由」作出此行為，並有意圖導致他人死亡或身體遭受嚴重傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控罪中的「串謀」，則需要證明有兩個人或以上達成犯罪協議。串謀者必須有意圖達成協議，而自己可促進犯罪目的。串謀者毋須以書面或正式的形式達成協議，可以用身體、語言、手勢或動作等達成協議。一旦協議達成，即使事後退出亦屬犯罪。串謀協議達成之前的商討，則可用作證明協議的存在。張官表示，有3個情況則不屬參與串謀，包括：對串謀不知情、無意圖加入串謀、「詐諦」加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不能以本案其他行為對被告有偏見&quot;&gt;官：不能以本案其他行為對被告有偏見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官總結，就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀謀殺」罪及「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪；控方需要證明4個元素，包括串謀協議肯定存在、協議是與控罪上的其他人達成、被告有意圖達成協議，以及被告或其他人打算將協議付諸實行。張官提到，就「串謀謀殺」罪，控方必須證明被告有意圖殺死他人，而非只是令其身體受嚴重傷害。張官最後指，陪審團需要決定串謀是否存在，以及被告是否屬串謀一方。張官又指，案發時被告沒有犯罪紀錄，其可信性較高，犯罪傾向性較低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官亦指，庭上證供顯示被告曾參與其他示威行為，但這些是「不被控告的行為」，只屬背景，不能作為對被告不利的揣測，亦不能因此對被告產生任何偏見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件下周一（19日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsea fiber-optic cables, a critical information and telecommunications technology (ICT) infrastructure carrying more than 95 percent of international data, are becoming a highly consequential theater of great power competition between the United States, China, and other state actors such as Russia. The roughly 600 cables planned or currently operational worldwide, spanning approximately 1.2 million kilometers, are the world’s information superhighways and provide the high-bandwidth connections necessary to support the rise of cloud computing and integrated 5G networks, transmitting everything from streaming videos and financial transactions to diplomatic communications and essential intelligence. The demand for data center computing and storage resources is also expected to increase in the wake of the artificial intelligence revolution. Training large language models takes enormous, distributed storage to compute, and if those networks are globally oriented, they will require additional subsea capacity to connect them. These geopolitical and technological stakes necessitate a consideration of the vulnerabilities of subsea systems and the steps the United States can take to fortify the digital rails of the future and safeguard this critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;undersea-cables-why-do-they-matter&quot;&gt;Undersea Cables: Why Do They Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsea cables are critical for nearly all aspects of commerce and business connectivity. For example, one major international bank moves an average of $3.9 trillion through these cable systems every workday. Cables are the backbone of global telecommunications and the internet, given that user data (e.g., e-mail, cloud drives, and application data) are often stored in data centers around the world. This infrastructure effectively facilitates daily personal use of the internet and broader societal functions. In addition, sensitive government communications also rely extensively on subsea infrastructure. While these communications are encrypted, they still pass through commercial internet lines as data traverses subsea infrastructure. Subsea cables carry a much larger bandwidth and are more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable than satellites; consequently, they have been credited with increasing access to high-speed internet worldwide, fueling economic growth, boosting employment, enabling innovation, and lowering barriers to trade. These networks are now indispensable links for the modern world and are pivotal to global development and digital inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cable-laying-ownership-and-control&quot;&gt;Cable Laying, Ownership, and Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea cables are built, owned, operated, and maintained primarily by private sector companies. Approximately 98 percent of the world’s undersea cables are manufactured and installed by four private firms: in 2021, the U.S. company SubCom, French firm Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN), and Japanese firm Nippon Electric Company (NEC) collectively held an 87 percent market share, with China’s HMN Technologies, formerly known as Huawei Marine Networks Co., Ltd., holding another 11 percent. Commercial undersea cables can be owned by a single company or a consortium of companies, including telecommunication providers, undersea cable companies, content providers, and cloud computing service providers. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft now own or lease around half of all undersea bandwidth worldwide. The companies that build and own these cables often lease out bandwidth on their cables through indefeasible rights of use (IRUs), which grant long-term access to a portion of the cable’s capacity. IRU holders can also lease this bandwidth to other third parties, creating a layered leasing market that extends the cable’s reach and utility across various sectors and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapid emergence as a leading subsea cable provider and owner has been the centerpiece of Beijing’s ambitious Digital Silk Road initiative launched in 2015, which aims to capture 60 percent of the global fiber-optic cable market by targeting emerging economies in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific. While Chinese companies have been recently blocked from subsea cable projects involving U.S. investment and firms due to U.S. concerns about the national security risks that come with HMN Technologies’ unbridled growth, the company has provided 18 percent of the subsea cables (in terms of the total length of cable) that have been laid worldwide over the past four years. HMN Technologies has also become the world’s fastest-growing subsea cable builder over the past 10 years. A 2020 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) report referenced the fact that HMN Technologies has “built or repaired” almost 25 percent of subsea cables and is due to build only 7 percent of the cables currently under development globally, perhaps indicating a potential trend of the Chinese firm’s slowing control over international cable construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-vulnerability-of-cable-systems-and-the-potential-for-chinese-exploitation&quot;&gt;The Vulnerability of Cable Systems and the Potential for Chinese Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea cables can be highly vulnerable to a variety of factors. Most cable damage is unintentional, mainly stemming from accidental human interaction with the cables. Still, potential hazards to the cables range from anchoring and fishing equipment to extreme weather such as earthquakes and landslides. Damage to submarine cables is relatively common — an estimated 100 to 150 cables are severed each year — mostly from fishing equipment or anchors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The scale and exposure of undersea infrastructure also make it an easy target for saboteurs operating in the gray zone of “deniable attacks short of war.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and exposure of undersea infrastructure also make it an easy target for saboteurs operating in the gray zone of “deniable attacks short of war.” In 2023, Taiwanese authorities accused two Chinese vessels in the area of cutting the only two submarine cables that supply internet to Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, plunging its 14,000 residents into digital isolation for six weeks. Although there was no clear confirmation of a deliberate attack, Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pointed to a remarkable frequency of Chinese vessels causing cable disruptions — 27 times since 2018 — and accused Beijing of harassing Taiwan in a classic case of “gray-zone aggression.” Similarly, in October 2023, a Baltic Sea telecom cable connecting Sweden and Estonia sustained damage at the same time as a Finnish-Estonian gas pipeline and cable. Carl-Oskar Bohlin, Sweden’s minister for civil defense, said the Swedish-Estonian cable was damaged as a result of “external force or tampering” and that Estonian officials had concluded that the three incidents were “related.” An investigation focused on a Russian-flagged ship and a Chinese-owned vessel operating in the area as the likely sources of the alleged sabotage. Private cable firms have also identified the South China Sea and the Red Sea as two notable choke points in the international undersea cable network. In the Red Sea, a spate of Houthi attacks has indirectly damaged cables in this major artery connecting Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OJXSKVX.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This regional snapshot of the web of subsea cables in the Indo-Pacific displays at once both the interdependence and vulnerability of these systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less likely, but still of concern, geopolitical rivals such as China could potentially collect the data flowing through this infrastructure. U.S. officials have sounded the alarm over the involvement of Chinese firms in new global seabed cable projects, suggesting that China could monitor data running through the cables or even sever entire countries from the internet either through software or interfering at coastal landing stations for the cables. As concerns grow over Chinese delays with granting permits, challenges facing cable repair, and even the potential of state tampering with cables, U.S. and allied-country companies have rerouted planned subsea cable systems away from landing in Chinese territories and other vulnerable areas. For example, the U.S. government and the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector, also known as “Team Telecom,” denied issuing a submarine cable license for the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) system that was meant to connect the United States with Hong Kong, citing “national security and foreign ownership concerns” with the direct connection to China-controlled Hong Kong. However, the segments of the PLCN system that were already going to land in Taiwan and the Philippines were still approved. Two other applications for planned cable systems that connected with Hong Kong were withdrawn and redesigned due to similar national security considerations. At the same time, Chinese authorities in recent years have been delaying approval or denying the use of subsea cables altogether that would move through the South China Sea. China’s territorial claim over the South China Sea has prevented the subsea cable industry from accessing the region for north-south connectivity in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The overreliance on Chinese repair ships due to limited alternatives in the marketplace is another vulnerability if, during a time of military conflict, the Chinese government prohibits access to its repair ships and subsea cables are left damaged without timely repair.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another backdoor vulnerability is the challenge of high-risk vendors. While a trusted supplier may install subsea cables, they can be maintained by a repairer from a high-risk vendor, some of whom are Chinese. The overreliance on Chinese repair ships due to limited alternatives in the marketplace is another vulnerability if, during a time of military conflict, the Chinese government prohibits access to its repair ships and subsea cables are left damaged without timely repair. Therefore, U.S. and allied officials have warned that the repair and maintenance process of undersea cables in the Pacific Ocean makes them even more vulnerable to espionage from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or other state actors. State-controlled Chinese company S.B. Submarine Systems (SBSS) repairs international undersea cables, including those owned by U.S. companies such as Google and Meta, and it appears that SBSS has been hiding its vessels’ locations from radio- and satellite-tracking services without plausible explanation while operating off Taiwan, Indonesia, and other coasts in Asia. There are concerns that Chinese cable repair companies such as SBSS could tap undersea data streams, map the ocean floor to conduct reconnaissance on U.S. military communication links, or obtain highly specific location data from the internal documentation of cable systems that would allow belligerent parties to cut cables with speed and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-threats-to-undersea-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Russian Threats to Undersea Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the international focus in this theater has largely been on the competition between the United States and China, Russian threats to subsea infrastructure are their own significant concern. Russia relies significantly less on subsea cables than either the United States or China due to its position as a continental power with internet connectivity to Europe and Central Asia and less of a focus on international trade. This makes Russia less vulnerable to disruptions in subsea cable infrastructure and potentially more willing to exploit these vulnerabilities in other nations. Recent activity by Russian naval and intelligence assets, including the spy ship Yantar and specialized submarines such as the Losharik, has raised alarm among Western defense and security officials. Yantar, for instance, has been observed loitering near undersea cable routes, equipped with submersibles capable of cutting or tapping into these cables, signaling a clear intent to exploit these vulnerabilities in a potential conflict scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic importance of undersea cables has not been lost on Russia, which views this infrastructure as a critical point of leverage against the security of Western nations. This perspective is emphasized in statements from high-ranking Russian officials such as Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, who, following the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2023, indicated that Russia could target undersea communication cables as retaliation for alleged Western involvement in the blasts. This rhetoric, coupled with physical evidence of Russian activities near this vital infrastructure, has brought about concerns within NATO and allied nations about the potential for Russian sabotage aimed at disrupting Western economies and communications in times of heightened tensions or outright conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The strategic importance of undersea cables has not been lost on Russia, which views this infrastructure as a critical point of leverage against the security of Western nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-counter-undersea-great-power-competition&quot;&gt;Recommendations to Counter Undersea Great Power Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is critical that the United States and its allies leverage development finance institutions (DFIs), multilateral development banks (MDBs), export credit agencies (ECAs), government agencies, and the private sector to support host countries and help U.S. and allied firms compete with their Chinese and Russian counterparts and secure allied systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Subsea cable projects are expensive. The cost varies from $30,000 to $50,000 per kilometer for subsea communication cables. Even though HMN Technologies (formerly Huawei Marine Networks Co., Ltd.) is still perceived as offering lower-quality technology than its competitors, it can offer dramatically cheaper contracts than Western firms can afford. HMN Technologies’ bids to work on undersea cables projects are priced 20 to 30 percent lower than its rivals, which could help China secure more deals moving forward. For now, U.S. government campaigns have successfully thwarted Chinese companies from winning contracts where U.S. companies were also bidders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For example, the United States successfully ousted HMN Technologies from the Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 6 (SMW6) subsea fiber-optic cable system, which links Singapore to France. To do so, the United States used both sweeteners and warnings. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency offered training grants valued at a total of $3.8 million to five telecommunications companies involved in the selection process and located in countries on the cable route. This offer was conditional on them choosing the U.S. firm SubCom as the supplier. The U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) also extended support to SubCom. SubCom won the $600 million contract for SMW6 by offering specifically designed training assistance. SubCom landed the contract also thanks to the work of U.S. diplomats, who warned foreign telecommunications carriers about the security risks surrounding HMN Technologies and the crippling sanctions that the United States was planning to impose on the Chinese company, putting their investment at significant risk. This bilateral U.S. diplomatic effort helped SubCom ultimately win the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States is also financing undersea cables in strategic areas such as the Indo-Pacific, one of the primary theaters of geopolitical competition between the United States and China. In that region, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) committed to providing a loan of up to $190 million to Trans-Pacific Networks, who partnered with Telstra International, to support the construction of a 15,200 km submarine fiber-optic cable connecting Singapore, Indonesia, and the United States. The new cable will expand and enhance internet access across the region, including to isolated Pacific islands.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DFIs, such as the DFC, and MDBs, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, also provide essential funding, risk mitigation, and project development capabilities that enable U.S. and allied companies to compete against Chinese state-subsidized firms. The DFC’s ability to operate in middle- and upper-middle-income countries can be improved by increasing its investment cap, which currently stands at $60 billion. These institutions can also offer loans and guarantees, reducing financial risks for large-scale infrastructure projects. ECAs, including EXIM and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, play a crucial role in supporting the development of trusted undersea cable infrastructure by providing insurance and credit facilities that protect against political and commercial risks. This financial backing is vital for developing and maintaining undersea cables, ensuring that this critical infrastructure remains under the control of trusted entities. Greater coordination between these financial bodies will ultimately lead to more effective resource allocation and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should lessen the vulnerabilities of subsea cables by building repair capacity, increasing funding for cable ship repairs, and streamlining the permitting process, improving the security and resilience of cable networks.&lt;/strong&gt; The global fiber-optic network is designed with a certain level of redundancy to handle frequent damage. Most countries are linked by multiple underwater cables, enabling data to be redirected smoothly if one or two lines are affected. However, repairing is complex, costly, and time consuming in the event of more significant damage. According to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) — an organization that promotes the safeguarding of submarine cables, facilitates collaboration among industry and government stakeholders, and whose more than 215 members own 98 percent of the world’s undersea cables — cable repairs average between $1 and $3 million, require “specialized cable ships with highly trained crews that cost tens of thousands of dollars per day,” and can take months to complete. Submarine internet cable provider Seacom reported that repairing the damaged Red Sea cables would take at least eight weeks due to the permitting requirements needed to begin the process. Restoration costs sometimes exceed repair costs due to the need to reroute communications over unimpaired systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To reduce the vulnerability of critical cable systems, the United States should consider increasing current federal funding to augment the industrial base for U.S. cable repair, deployment, and maintenance. The Cable Security Fleet (CSF), implemented in 2021 and modeled after the Maritime Security Program, is a federal infrastructure protection program — partly overseen by the Pentagon — meant to address the lack of rapid response and repair capacity of U.S. ships in case of a national emergency or war. SubCom, one of the world’s largest subsea fiber-optic cable developers for telecommunication and technology firms and the sole cable contractor for the U.S. military, was awarded a $10 million annual contract in 2021 by the U.S. Department of Transportation to operate the CSF. The CSF consists of two U.S.-flagged and crewed cable ships, the CS Dependable and CS Decisive, which are required to be available for laying, maintaining, and repairing critical cables. The CSF funding requires an annual appropriation by Congress, as each ship operator receives a $5 million stipend annually if the ship meets contractual and statutory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing the resilience of submarine communications cable systems would involve increasing redundancies, introducing more cables with greater carrying capacity, and improving capabilities to promptly maintain and repair cable systems. The supply chain for many of the components of cable systems is global. For instance, optical and power components for undersea repeaters are manufactured in China and some Southeast Asian nations. Securing a good supply chain is also essential to ensure that cables from ASN, NEC, and SubCom can be manufactured (and spares can be manufactured for existing cables). Given the costs associated with the installation of more cables with greater carrying capacity, prompt repair capabilities provide a more effective method of introducing resilience in the cable system. This effort is complicated by the shortage of cable repair ships, especially given the rapid increase in subsea cables built over the past five years. The U.S. government and its allies should consider investing in the construction of new repair ships, as many existing vessels are aging and nearing retirement. The cost of a new cable ship can reach over $100 million. But even with prompt repair capacity, there needs to be a “break glass” capability to deploy new cables rapidly. This would include classified cable route planning and surveys ahead of the need date so that there are no delays in initiating new cable deployments should existing routes be compromised. Regional capability to partially re-lay new systems destroyed due to massive intentional cuts would also enhance resiliency. The Tonga volcano cuts in 2022 are a good illustration of how long it takes to find new cables and create a solution, especially when a repeater is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should ensure that domestic and international legal and regulatory frameworks, including permitting and liability regimes, are structured and operated to facilitate efficient and effective subsea cable repairs and installations while minimizing undue delays and costs. However, this efficiency cannot come at the cost of security, so the U.S. government and allies should not turn to untrusted repairers for speedy restoration. Electronic monitoring systems could enhance the physical and data security of subsea cables by detecting any changes or anomalies in the seabed environment and alerting operators. Electronic protection in the form of an end-to-end encryption system also reduces the risk of surveillance, tapping, and spying.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. government must prioritize developing and implementing a cohesive legal and international framework to defend the submarine cable network.&lt;/strong&gt; The current legal and international framework is complex and fragmented, with different international legal regimes determining responsibility and punishment for sabotage depending on where the cables are laid. When cables are sabotaged in international waters, there is no regime to hold the perpetrator accountable. The United States is not even a signatory to the latest international treaties that address subsea cable protection. There also needs to be an increase in naval security from governmental bodies — in the event of war, there needs to be greater capacity to repair undersea fiber-optic cables in order to improve the United States’ wartime resilience. The United States could better leverage the ICPC to prevent damage, establish internationally recognized protections, and provide an apolitical forum for discussions about best practices, regulatory harmonization, data protection standards, and security measures. Participation in the ICPC may further the private-sector-led “businesslike attitude” toward cable building, repair, and maintenance; provide the architecture for international standards and practices and cooperative public-private management of critical communication infrastructure; and generate an environment to develop relationships with trusted vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should update its burdensome domestic permitting processes.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States lacks a comprehensive regulatory environment to streamline the issuance of cable permits. Under the Cable Landing License Act of 1921, all submarine cable operators must acquire a license from the FCC. For cables with significant foreign ownership or that connect the United States with foreign landing points, applications must be reviewed by the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector. Cables must receive a federal permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate their potential impact on the environment and any endangered species, but if the cables are placed in marine sanctuaries, then the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration exercises authority. Yet if cables are dropped on the continental shelf, authority rests with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. These requirements are just at the federal level — excluding necessary state and local permits. Overall, the combined licensing processes can take up to two years. That is bad for business and good for the CCP’s cable suppliers. Rather than this jungle of jurisdictions and lengthy national security reviews, the United States might consider centralizing the monitoring of undersea cables under one agency in a way that coordinates existing actors and has the authority to streamline the approval process for cables as critical infrastructure. After all, according to a Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council report, “federal agencies often fail to coordinate among themselves and with their state and local counterparts on even an ad hoc basis to ensure submarine cable protection.” The United States is also unique in how burdensome its national security review and ongoing obligations are, creating strong disincentives to locate subsea cables in the United States. Greater transparency, speed, and uniformity, as well as the development of due process protections, are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should closely collaborate with its allies in two capacities: engaging in regulatory cooperation and providing technical assistance to developing countries and emerging economies.&lt;/strong&gt; The current state of the international regulatory framework is a major concern among industry leaders, as cable companies have repeatedly expressed frustration over the disparate processes in each country, which significantly extend the time required to obtain permits before construction can begin. Establishing an international body to help countries create uniform regulatory processes across the globe could streamline these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, Japan outlined the Data Free Flow with Trust(DFFT) concept, which promotes the free flow of data and the protection of individual privacy, national security, and intellectual property by connecting undersea cables only with allies and partner nations. At its May 2023 summit in Hiroshima, the G7 endorsed the creation of the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership, which puts the DFFT into action. In the same vein, the Quad — a strategic security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — launched the Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience in 2023 to strengthen submarine cable systems in the Indo-Pacific by leveraging the four countries’ expertise in designing, manufacturing, laying, and maintaining undersea cables. Under this partnership, Australia will establish the Indo-Pacific Cable Connectivity and Resilience Program, which will commission technical and policy research frameworks in addition to providing technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States, through the Quad 2023 partnership and its $5 million CABLES program, will provide technical and capacity-building assistance on the security of undersea cables. Development agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have also emphasized the importance of fostering digital connectivity in developing countries, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, and ensuring that these countries have the capacity to effectively implement and manage the undersea cables once they are landed. For example, USAID has been providing technical assistance to support the development of a $30 million undersea cable spur that will connect Palau to the DFC-financed Singapore-U.S. cable — the longest in the world. The Palau cable spur is part of a larger U.S. government initiative to build greater telecommunications infrastructure throughout the Pacific islands, which, in turn, is meant to promote innovation, connectivity, and development throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In parallel, in April 2024, Google announced an additional $1 billion investment in digital connectivity as part of its Pacific Connect Initiative, which includes multiple cable systems it is building in the Pacific, specifically designed with branching units to connect Pacific island nations with little to no existing connectivity. This multilateral initiative by Google, which includes geopolitical collaboration from multiple governmental bodies, aligns with the U.S. government’s efforts and presents an opportunity for greater public-private partnerships in this space. The Marea cable, connecting Virginia with Spain and developed by Microsoft, Meta, and telecommunications company Telsius, is also part of a network of advanced cables that promotes digital connectivity, upgraded global internet infrastructure, and greater speed and resiliency. By collaborating with private sector leaders, the United States can further enhance its initiatives and make strides in bridging the digital divide around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea cables are critical to global communications infrastructure, supporting everything from financial transactions to national security communications, making them a prime target in the escalating great power competition between the United States, China, and Russia, as well as for other state and non-state actors. As the lifelines of the digital age, these cables support economic activities, military operations, and everyday internet usage. Thus, their security is paramount. The threats posed by state actors — particularly Russia and China — highlight the urgent need for measures to protect this infrastructure. Russia’s strategic use of specialized submarines and espionage vessels to potentially sabotage undersea cables, combined with China’s rapid expansion in subsea cable construction and control, underlines the vulnerability of these critical systems. Without coordinated international efforts to safeguard these cables, the risks of disruption, espionage, and economic instability will continue to grow. As well as threatening Western interests, China’s dominance in the subsea cable industry could undermine numerous countries’ economic and digital sovereignty, particularly in emerging markets. As such, the United States must take proactive measures, including harnessing the power of DFIs and facilitating international cooperation, to safeguard these cable networks and ensure a secure and resilient future for the world’s communications infrastructure under the sea. This involves not only defending against physical threats but also protecting the integrity and reliability of the data transmitted through these cables. By prioritizing the protection of undersea infrastructure, the United States and its allies can mitigate the risks posed by adversaries and secure the digital backbone of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial capacity commands increased attention among like-minded allies and partners around the globe in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war has highlighted the need for defense industrial resilience in the West, given the rapid depletion of matériel and the limits on surge production capacity that have illuminated fragile defense supply chains. Meanwhile, the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region has continued to deteriorate. China’s coercive actions around Taiwan and across the East and South China Seas, combined with North Korea’s repeated provocations, are clear reminders that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” as Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio famously said in a speech in June 2022. The United States and its allies, including Japan, have demonstrated a shared commitment to enhancing defense cooperation and promoting broader networks of security cooperation. Developing a more robust and resilient defense industrial ecosystem is a key element of this common strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this worsening regional security environment, Japan has taken unprecedented steps to strengthen its defense posture, with significant increases in defense spending and plans to acquire advanced capabilities, including long-range counterstrike. It is also taking steps to enhance defense cooperation with the United States and other partners, such as Australia and the Republic of Korea. As part of this broader strategy, Japan has identified strengthening its defense industrial base as “virtually defense capability itself.” Strengthening the defense industrial base dovetails with U.S. defense strategy, which also stresses the importance of building a resilient defense ecosystem and collaborating with allies toward that end. The Department of Defense’s (DoD) first National Defense Industrial Strategy includes supporting “a resilient defense industrial ecosystem among the U.S. and close international allies and partners” as one of its four strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan has taken unprecedented steps to strengthen its defense posture, with significant increases in defense spending and plans to acquire advanced capabilities, including long-range counterstrike.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeper defense industrial cooperation requires deliberate investment and planning, and it can take several forms, including codevelopment and coproduction of complete systems at the high end and supplying subcomponents to a shared system at the low end. The former is the hardest to achieve, given the need to identify common requirements and align technology and manufacturing capacity in a way that benefits both countries. Cooperation in integrating supply chains of subcomponents is often a more practical approach. The challenge in both cases is identifying appropriate opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) are an increasingly important capability where both the United States and Japan are making investments to counter new and existing threats. The U.S. Replicator initiative, which aims to field large numbers of small drones on a rapid timeline, is an innovative approach to counter China’s defense industrial scale and mass. Japan is focused on the critical need for UAS, necessitated in part by a declining population that is impacting manpower in the Self-Defense Forces. Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD) has announced a plan to invest JPY 1 trillion (USD 7.1 billion) over the next five years to develop uncrewed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the subcomponent level, electro-optical sensors have become one of the largest needs for both the consumer and defense markets. They are critical components for weapons and platforms (including for long-range precision targeting, consistent radio communications, automation networks, cryptanalysis, etc.), but capacity shortages have limited their production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from the MOD’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) conducted a study to explore avenues for enhancing U.S.-Japan defense equipment and technology cooperation, with an emphasis on UAS and electro-optical sensors as potential targets of opportunity. The methodology included a literature review of analysis on the two case study topics; reviews of government policy documents; case studies on previous examples of bilateral cooperation, as well as international trade data; and interviews with experts at nine U.S. and Japanese companies with relevant expertise. The team also held two private research workshops to discuss opportunities and challenges with a broader range of industry participants. The interviews and workshops were held under the Chatham House Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report starts with an overview of Japan’s defense industry. It next briefly summarizes the history of U.S.-Japan defense industrial cooperation and then presents the two case studies, examining current challenges in the industrial supply chain and assessing how Japan can best plug in to the U.S. defense ecosystem. The report also addresses structural impediments to U.S.-Japan cooperation and concludes with insights that can assist in overcoming those barriers to support the strategic objectives of both governments and help build a more robust and secure defense supply chain globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-overview-of-japans-defense-industry&quot;&gt;An Overview of Japan’s Defense Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following World War II and the introduction of Japan’s postwar constitution in 1947, the Japanese defense industry essentially collapsed. The war-renouncing clause in the constitution (Article 9) and Japan’s decision at the outset of the Cold War to prioritize economic development over investments in the military limited the development of Japan’s domestic defense industrial base (DIB). Throughout the Cold War, Japan focused on a policy of “exclusive self-defense” (senshu bouei), relying heavily on the United States for its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan introduced strict restrictions on arms exports as part of its postwar policies. The Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, adopted in 1967, limited arms transfers by prohibiting exports to communist countries, countries subject to embargoes under UN Security Council resolutions, or countries engaged in or likely to be engaged in international conflicts. Japan imposed additional restrictions in 1976 that virtually prohibited arms exports, a policy that was sustained with little change for the next 40 years. These limits on exports were combined with policy that limited Japanese defense spending to about 1 percent of GDP. Consequently, Japan’s defense industry relied exclusively on the government for contracts to support the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), a small market that was adequate for meeting Japan’s defense needs but prevented the development of a robust and competitive defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, concerns about the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs and China’s rapidly advancing military capabilities prompted the Japanese government to place a renewed emphasis on defense. The government issued National Defense Program Guidelines in 1995, 2004, and 2010, all of which emphasized enhancing defense cooperation with the United States. Japan released its first National Security Strategy in 2013, adopting a more ambitious strategy aimed at further strengthening Japan’s defense capabilities — albeit still within the framework of strict 1 percent limits on defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan had previously taken modest steps to enable defense industry cooperation with the United States, during this period it began to ease broader restrictions on defense exports for the first time. In 2012, Japan introduced modest measures to allow exports of equipment for peacekeeping operations and participation in international joint development and production of equipment. In 2014, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, Japan revised its policy to allow exports in several categories of non-lethal equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history of limits on exports, combined with relatively small budgets centered on equipment for self-defense, has long limited opportunities for bilateral cooperation. Nevertheless, there have been a handful of high-profile bilateral projects. Most significant was collaboration in jointly developing the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block IIA ballistic missile defense interceptor that began in 2006. Japan also collaborated with the United States on the F-35 stealth fighter through in-country final assembly and maintenance of aircraft, as well as production of some components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of Japan’s second National Security Strategy in December 2022 — and the attendant increases in defense spending and support for the defense industrial base — signaled a new era of opportunity in defense industrial cooperation. In December 2023, Japan further eased export rules to allow exports of complete systems manufactured under license, in addition to the export of parts and components. Restrictions on the categories of equipment approved for export (largely limited to nonlethal systems) remain in place, however — a factor that will constrain opportunities in the near term, absent broader reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-for-japans-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Challenges for Japan’s Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s defense industry has a structure unique among advanced economies. As a result of the history described above, there are no dedicated defense “primes” in Japan. Rather, defense manufacturing is centered on a limited number of large industrial conglomerates for which defense is but a small share of overall business. The four major Japanese defense companies — Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), Fujitsu, and Ishikawajima Heavy Industries (IHI) — have secured positions on the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) list of top 100 defense companies worldwide, but the broader landscape reveals a more mixed story. Until recently, Japan’s defense industry risked entering a spiral of decline. Over 100 smaller enterprises that support the major firms have withdrawn from the defense industry since 2003, according to the MOD, and even some larger enterprises have cut back on defense business. For example, Sumitomo Heavy Industries recently halted machine gun production, while Komatsu discontinued armored vehicle development for the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors have contributed to this trend. As noted, limits on defense exports mean that the JSDF has been the sole customer for most of these companies. Japan has lacked state-run defense facilities and relies solely on the private sector to manufacture defense equipment for the JSDF. Low demand and meager profits mean that returns on investment were too low for Japanese companies to stay in the defense market: other nations’ defense companies enjoy operating profit margins exceeding 10 percent, while Japan’s defense industry remains at only 2–3 percent. Legislation passed in 2023 attempts to directly target these deficiencies and will be addressed further below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline of Japan’s defense industry has been a source of deep concern in the Japanese government, which prompted the focus on strengthening the industrial base captured in the new National Security Strategy. The MOD has publicly recognized that the challenge with incentives “not only interferes with the stable procurement of defense equipment essential for the SDF operations, but also causes the loss of proper competitive environment and innovation in the long term, resulting in losing its ground on Japan’s technological superiority in security.” Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensuring that Japan’s defense industry remains capable of meeting national security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-partnership-experience&quot;&gt;International Partnership Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defense industries of partner nations can contribute to their common defense in multiple ways. One is cooperative development, where common requirements lead partner governments to collaborate on complete systems. A second example is one in which a contractor in one nation serves as the lead integrator of a system and brings in companies from other nations to provide subsystems or components. Two recent examples of U.S.-Japan partnership are summarized as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SM-3 Block IIA, jointly developed by Raytheon and MHI, is an example of cooperative development. Japan agreed to fund roughly half of the project and manufacture critical missile components for use by both countries. The approach of “component compartmentalization” had the benefit of featuring clean dividing lines between each country’s contributions, with each government managing their respective industry partner and managing the budget for their portions. This approach to joint acquisition reflected constraints on policies and practices in place at the time, but kept industry-to-industry engaement at arm’s length. Future joint acquisition programs seem more likely to follow the precedents now being set by Japan’s participation in the Global Combat Aircraft Program (GCAP) and the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is Japan’s participation in the F-35 fighter jet program. Though not one of the founding partners of the F-35 consortium, Japan “is acquiring the most [F-35s] of any international customer.” MHI operates a F-35A Final Assembly and Checkout (FACO) facility, where it conducts maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade (MRO&amp;amp;U) activities for Japanese and U.S. aircraft in Japan. Japanese companies, including MHI, Mitsubishi Electric (MELCO), and IHI Corp., manufacture radar parts, electro-optical distributed aperture system (EODAS) components, and engine parts for Japan’s F-35 fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy restrictions in areas such as export control and information security impacted the implementation of F-35 production and support in Japan, its eventual success now provides important operational as well as industrial base benefits for both countries that could be expanded further in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;revitalizing-japans-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Revitalizing Japan’s Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the SM-3 Block IIA and F-35 programs, Japan has a long history of manufacturing U.S.-origin equipment under license. Some examples include the F-15J (manufactured by MHI), the CH-47J Chinook (manufactured by KHI), and the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) air and missile defense interceptor (manufactured by MHI). Japan has exported components of both earlier PAC-2 systems and the F-15 engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these efforts, however, Japan has a thin record of international cooperation on defense equipment; it has recently introduced a range of new policies and regulations to strengthen its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Buildup Program, released along with the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy in December 2022, set out capability priorities for Japan’s buildup over the five years from 2023 to 2027. One of seven priorities listed in the buildup program is uncrewed systems, including “utility/attack UAVs and miniature attack UAVs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan has a thin record of international cooperation on defense equipment; it has recently introduced a range of new policies and regulations to strengthen its defense industrial base.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan subsequently enacted new legislation in October 2023 to enhance its defense industrial base. The new law aims to achieve three key priorities: ensuring national security independence, bolstering deterrence, and contributing to domestic industries through technology spillover. To achieve this, the legislation emphasizes strengthening the DIB as a top priority while also importing technology and pursuing joint development. The focus extends beyond finished products to maintaining technological superiority and stable manufacturing of parts and components. As the policy states, “both prime contractors and suppliers are equally essential to stably manufacturing defense equipment.” The law provides for the government to take ownership of defense manufacturing facilities; provides subsidies to strengthen supply chains, as well as for investments in areas like enhanced cybersecurity; and provides funding to modify equipment for export. Although Japan’s approach places a heavy emphasis on indigenous development and production, it recognizes the vital role of collaboration with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on these steps, and after lengthy discussions among Japan’s ruling political parties, export policies were revised in December 2023 to allow exports of complete systems manufactured under license to the country of origin and other likeminded states. These modifications expanded the scope of nations eligible for importing defense equipment from Japan and also opened the door for the export of lethal weapons, though exports to nations involved in conflict are still barred. In March 2024, Japan’s ruling parties announced an agreement to allow exports to third countries of a new fighter aircraft to be developed with the United Kingdom and Italy under the GCAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-potential-to-expand-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Future: Potential to Expand Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recent policy reforms are sparking change in Japan’s defense industry and increased interest in international partnerships. According to interviews with industry representatives conducted for this study, some Japanese firms are increasing capital investment in their defense businesses and assigning more personnel to the defense sector. Simultaneously, U.S. companies have noticed increased engagement from their Japanese counterparts. Some U.S. firms primarily involved in commercial manufacturing have shifted their focus toward defense discussions with Japan in the last two years. Other U.S. companies are closely monitoring developments in the Japanese regulatory system and contemplating increased collaboration with Japan across a range of products. These dynamics suggest an evolving landscape that could further advance U.S.-Japan defense industrial cooperation over time. Three current efforts in particular highlight the potential for expanded Japanese defense industry engagement in the international marketplace: GCAP, the GPI cooperative development program, and the Loyal Wingman drone project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL COMBAT AIR PROGRAM (GCAP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy announced a multinational initiative to develop a sixth-generation fighter. With the goal of introducing the aircraft into service by 2035 — an ambitious timeline — it is the first major program undertaken by Japan with a partner other than the United States. The three partners have established a joint program office to oversee the effort, but as of this writing, they have yet to finalize agreement on workshare for the project. The recent revision of Japan’s export policy was instrumental in allowing this project to go forward, as it projected confidence in Japan’s defense market potential. After intense internal negotiations, the ruling coalition in Japan approved GCAP exports to third countries but did not announce broader reforms; steps to allow exports of lethal equipment were set aside for the time being. If successful, GCAP could serve as a driver for broader defense industry reform and revitalization in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLIDE PHASE INTERCEPTOR (GPI) COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida announced plans to pursue joint development of a glide phase interceptor to counter the threat posed by hypersonic missiles. On May 15, 2024, the Missile Defense Agency and MOD finalized the GPI Cooperative Development Agreement. This project will strengthen industrial base capabilities in both countries to develop and produce advanced counter-hypersonic systems. While project management will resemble that used for the earlier SM-3 Block IIA missile, its workshare provisions reportedly allow for more direct industry-industry collaboration in sharing experiences related to all areas of missile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LOYAL WINGMAN DRONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also exploring cooperation with the United States and Australia on developing drones for military operations through the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. In a statement released after Prime Minister Albanese’s visit to Washington in September 2023, the White House announced an “intention to explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on Unmanned Aerial Systems. Our cooperation aims to enhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.” This would be the first time that these three nations worked together on a specific project. In April 2024, the U.S. Air Force selected Anduril and General Atomics to build “production representative” test CCA, the first phase of the project. Future rounds of CCA acquisition are expected to involve “most strategic” U.S. partners. Japan’s role in future CCA projects remains under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-one&quot;&gt;Case Study One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-to-uas&quot;&gt;Introduction to UAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aircraft (UA) is a blanket term for flying vehicles without a human on board. The nomenclature for these systems has evolved over time, with the term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) common in the past and then replaced by the term remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The U.S. Air Force popularized RPA to draw attention to the non-autonomous nature of these aircraft; ultimately, a human is still designing, controlling, and operating these systems. Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) is the latest iteration in terminology; in this report, it is used to encompass UA, UAV, and RPA. (Note that “drones” is another common term.) UAS refers not just to the aircraft itself, but also to the various subsystems and operating networks required for successful flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD categorizes UAS into one of five groups depending on speed, operating altitude, and weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-uas&quot;&gt;The Role of UAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS have been used for decades, initially for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). UAS can collect information in greater detail over longer periods of time than crewed aircraft. Uncrewed aircraft also require fewer personnel and have somewhat lower operating costs per hour. Other defense applications include early detection of enemy aircraft or missiles, as well as delivering weapons to targets, much like a piloted aircraft delivers a missile or bomb. UAS can also be used for suicide missions where they divebomb targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aUI4TEj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: UAS Systems Classification.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/18249&quot;&gt;U.S. Army UAS Center of Excellence, “Eyes of the Army”: U.S. Army Roadmap for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Fort Rucker, AL: U.S. Army UAS Center of Excellence, January 2010)&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-threat-and-proliferation/missile-basics/unmanned-aircraft-systems-uas/&quot;&gt;“Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Basics,” Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, July 17, 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries also use UAS for close air support, cargo and resupply, and communications relay. UAS can replace certain crewed missions, including aerial refueling, air-to-air combat, strategic bombing, battle management and command and control (BMC2), suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, and electronic warfare. Looking ahead, UAS experimental concepts include aircraft system-of-systems (SOS) development, AI-enabled manned-unmanned teaming (MUMT), mission support or “loyal wingmen,” autonomous dogfighting, swarming, and lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS). The Missile Technology Control Regime, of which both the United States and Japan are members, has been a brake on some UAS cooperation for larger systems, but U.S. reinterpretation of the regime in 2020 loosened these restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS also have commercial applications. Examples include capturing video from above (e.g., for data mapping or even filming scenes for movies), but the most common commercial use is in agriculture. Farmers use drones to monitor both livestock and water levels, in addition to producing imagery to analyze details of crop health. Today, Japan uses more than 3,000 drones for agricultural purposes. Other notable applications include disaster recovery and surveying land, and parcel delivery has also been explored as a use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS offer advantages over crewed aircraft. If UAS are shot down, no warfighter is harmed or lost. UAS are effective against certain targets where a mission using crewed aircraft would be more risky and costly. They can be harder to detect and destroy given their minimal signature, and they are generally less expensive to produce. Cost efficiency allows more UAS to be deployed and therefore support a higher volume of fire. This has proven to be very effective in the Russo-Ukrainian war, with Russia using inexpensive Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses before deploying cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS are especially significant for missions that can be characterized as “dull, dirty, or dangerous.” “Dull” refers to lengthy missions that might be repetitive, such as long reconnaissance missions that do not need onboard pilots. “Dirty” refers to potential human exposure to chemical, radiological, or biological contamination. “Dangerous” missions are those that directly put operators in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the figure below, the worldwide demand for UAS has increased, placing a premium on capability to produce UAS at scale. This could create an opportunity for the United States to partner with other countries by leveraging industrial base strengths, which would mitigate U.S. production challenges and supply chain constraints. Japan’s industrial capabilities could be useful in efforts to fill gaps in U.S. industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-uas-demand-collaboration-and-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Japan’s UAS Demand, Collaboration, and Industrial Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has been relatively slow to adapt military drone technology, primarily using UAS for reconnaissance purposes. In years past, Japanese authorities assumed that because low-cost drones were unable to fly across the ocean, they would add little value to Japan’s national security. Attitudes now reflect increased emphasis on the importance of UAS to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) in particular. For example, UAS could prove crucial to improving Japan’s situational awareness around the Senkaku Islands. UAS, in addition to uncrewed maritime vehicles, are arguably critical in providing consistent and cost-efficient surveillance of these islands, which are under near-daily pressure from Chinese Coast Guard vessels. The uptick in Japanese UAS interest also reflects JSDF recruitment and retention challenges. UAS can help ameliorate this shortfall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of Japan’s drone manufacturers produce commercial systems. Japanese companies that develop and produce UAS for military use tend to be bigger players, such as MHI, MELCO, and Subaru Corporation. The Japanese government has steadily begun to increase its investments in domestic UAS technologies. The MOD is seeking to develop combat UAS capable of “breakneck maneuvers,” with Subaru working on remote and flight control systems and MHI and MELCO developing information dissemination capabilities between aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Japanese government has steadily begun to increase its investments in domestic UAS technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of Japan’s UAS manufacturing capabilities varies across application (commercial vs. defense) and class (Groups 1–5 listed in Table 1). Japan has historically invested in its smaller commercial drone market, leading to the emergence of Japanese UAS manufacturers such as Autonomous Control Systems Laboratory. In contrast, the United States mostly relies on imports from other suppliers, particularly China, for smaller consumer and commercial drones. The company DJI China controls more than 70 percent of the global drone market via its manufacturing of consumer and commercial drones. However, even commercial drones have proven to be dual-use technologies, and civilian drones made by DJI can be adapted for battlefield use, as has been seen in the Russo-Ukrainian war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-opportunities-for-us-japan-uas-industrial-collaboration&quot;&gt;Current Opportunities for U.S.-Japan UAS Industrial Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States plans for significant investments in UAS systems, but collaboration with international partners could prove challenging. One issue is specific to existing systems with heritage supply chains. Bringing new suppliers into the network, including international partners, can require significant costs for engineering, testing, and other inputs, and even with those investments the components would start higher on the production cost learning curve. New programs offer fresh opportunities for industry, including from partner nations, to compete to become part of the initial supplier landscape. The United States has initiated two relevant efforts that may yield new opportunities to join the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New programs offer fresh opportunities for industry, including from partner nations, to compete to become part of the initial supplier landscape.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;replicator-initiative&quot;&gt;Replicator Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the DoD launched the Replicator initiative, a program to “quickly scale and field thousands of attritable autonomous systems within the next 18 to 24 months, leveraging AI, robotics, and commercial technology.” This initiative seeks to better integrate emerging private sector technologies into the military’s operational framework; lower costs by deploying smaller uncrewed systems that require less maintenance; and overcome the “valley of death” — the period between developing a new technology and introducing it to market in a viable application where new technologies often run into obstacles and get interest and funding to make the transition to a program of record. Accomplishing these goals could prove challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. government acquisition approaches are often complex and lengthy, with additional delays not uncommon when projects include multiple contractors from the defense and commercial sectors. Once UAS requirements are set, another challenge may be preparing the U.S. industrial base for rapidly scaling UAS production, as the smaller U.S. UAS industry has spent years struggling to compete against lower-cost imports from China. As a military program, Replicator will lead to an increase in domestic production of small UAS, but the United States will need to leverage ally and partner capacity to help meet its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan can make a significant contribution to Replicator via its strength in manufacturing small, commercial UAS. Japanese industry can be leveraged to fill the gap in U.S. production and enhance interoperability, especially considering that Replicator’s initial purchases will be small UAS. U.S. capability gaps in two specific areas offer potential opportunities for Japanese engagement: increased survivability for UAS and high-volume small UAS production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent challenge for allies and partners in industry is understanding the Pentagon’s requirements and knowing where to pitch their capabilities — a challenge often shared by small businesses in the United States. The Pentagon will need to provide more granular detail in its plan for operationalizing Replicator to enable Japanese industry to effectively plug in. In addition to a more detailed directive of what capabilities it wants these UAS to possess, the DoD will need to provide actual contracts with funding. Japan could usefully emphasize the importance of DoD information sharing as a tool to better facilitate cooperative efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;collaborative-combat-aircraft-cca&quot;&gt;Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, CCA is a U.S. Air Force initiative designed for UAS to accompany crewed missions. These UAS are intended to act as a force multiplier to offer ISR support and additional offensive firepower capability to fifth- and sixth-generation fighters. The United States plans to field around 1,000 CCAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Force has stressed that there is no single model for CCA, and that a variety of aircraft can offer different capabilities. This opens the potential for nations to develop UAS that are compatible with the larger CCA program. Japan and the United States could direct collaborative efforts toward a CCA that (a) is useful for Japan’s strategic threat environment and (b) effectively and efficiently utilizes its industrial capacity, with specific emphasis placed on its component production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE POTENTIAL FOR COLLABORATION ON COMPONENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s industrial capacity and skills could prove valuable when considering international collaboration under CCA. Interviews with industry conducted for this project identified several areas of potential strength for Japan, including microelectronics, wiring boards, UNICORN radar system and other radar systems, disaster relief pods, calibration services, avionics boxes, engines, landing gear, and other electronic components. Japan also has advanced capabilities in maintenance, repair, overhaul, and sustainment of batteries, engines, and actuators. U.S. industry additionally highlighted Japanese strengths in software development and data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations-for-uas-cooperation&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations for UAS Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New programs should provide opportunities for allies and partners to engage and invest in UAS programs. However, there are potential roadblocks specific to UAS technology worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States has used operational experience to inform its product development. UAS have made critical contributions across a range of conflicts since the beginning of Operational Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001. This has allowed the United States to capitalize on a feedback loop of combat exposure and innovation. Japan, on the other hand, lacks the combat experience that could shape its design and development plans and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the MOD has directed money into UAS research and development (R&amp;amp;D) but has yet to make UAS a formal procurement requirement. The MOD’s R&amp;amp;D push has allowed Japanese efforts to focus on building out a broad set of Japanese capabilities rather than gearing toward a partner-first approach. This incentivizes Japanese industry to focus on redeveloping and domestically reproducing technologies — from land-based vehicles to undersea vessels — that already exist. This limits Japan’s ability to enter effective partnerships if the partnering nation already has those capabilities. A continuing instinct for indigenous development of new systems thus poses risks for the future competitiveness of Japanese industry in the UAS market. Based on interviews with industry conducted for this study, the Japanese government is not sending a strong demand signal for UAS production. Unless the Japanese government invests in its industry or subsidizes production processes, Japanese industry may remain hesitant to partner with U.S. industry — and U.S. industry will be less likely to pursue partnerships with Japanese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-two&quot;&gt;Case Study Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electro-Optical Sensors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-to-eoir-systems&quot;&gt;Introduction to EO/IR Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) systems consist of visible and infrared sensors that help the user to operate in adversarial environmental conditions. The use of EO/IR systems enables warfighters to achieve higher battlefield awareness through ISR capabilities. Other defense applications for EO/IR systems include night vision devices, visible-light cameras, laser range finders, and more. EO/IR sensors provide real-time situational awareness and surveillance capabilities — detecting, tracking, and identifying potential threats — which supply critical information for military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are generally two types of EO/IR sensors: non-imaging EO/IR systems (point targets) and imaging EO/IR systems (extended targets). Depending on the mission, one sensor may be more appropriate than another. A point target sensor operates by detecting energy emissions rather than imagery. For example, if an adversary launches a missile, a point target sensor will detect the immense energy emitting from the launch and relay that to the operator. Conversely, an extended target sensor will generate detailed imagery rather than a point of heat. Extended target sensors are often fielded on satellites, aircraft, and other optics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-eoir-systems&quot;&gt;The Role of EO/IR Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EO/IR applications are segmented by platform: land-based, air-based, and sea-based. The sea-based segment of the market is experiencing large growth as maritime assets are becoming a priority for operational plans, especially in the Asia-Pacific theater. Unlike the radar technology traditionally used by ships, which relies on emitting active radiation signals and waiting for a return signal, EO/IR sensors are passive and detect signals naturally emitted by objects. This passive operation is a key strategic advantage as it assists Navy ships in avoiding detection and prevents them from becoming targets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is upgrading MSDF vessels by incorporating advanced sensor systems to allow them to identify targets, detect and perform threat assessments, and support weapons engagement for both offensive and defensive engagements. One example is the advanced integrated combat information center developed by MHI for the new stealth frigate commissioned by the MSDF. Mitsubishi Electric supplied the radar and the EO/IR sensor. Another is the Shipboard Panoramic Electro-Optic/Infrared (SPEIR) system developed by L3Harris for the U.S. Navy to enhance fleet protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne platforms are a major user of EO/IR systems. The explosive growth in the use of small UAS for this and other purposes has propelled industry to design smaller EO/IR systems that can be fitted to these platforms and that can dissipate heat so as not to disrupt the function of the UAS. EO/IR systems provide significant improvement over visible light surveillance cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-based EO/IR systems have a multitude of applications such as night vision goggles; drone detection; target recognition, identification, and location; and laser terminal guidance. Systems are continually being upgraded as threats evolve. For instance, the U.S. Army is developing a self-contained Laser Target Locator Module III (LTLM III) that meets updated performance requirements for its next-generation laser target locator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-eoir-sensor-history-collaboration-and-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Japan’s EO/IR Sensor History, Collaboration, and Industrial Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Japan has developed its national sensing architecture to counter Chinese and North Korean threats and has produced EO/IRs under license or indigenously toward this end. The foundations for Japan’s sensor architecture lie in its technical cooperation with the United States. In 1980, the United States and Japan established a joint Systems and Technology Forum between the DoD and the then Japan Defense Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this cooperation, the United States was able to access Japan’s advanced technology base in electro-optics and other electronics. Figure 2 shows the length and depth of U.S.-Japan trade in dual-use EO sensors within the context of global U.S. trade in the same. Long a source of U.S. imports, the rough trade balance parity since 2009 speaks to Japan’s ongoing comparative advantage in this sector. In 1983, the DoD dispatched a team of senior scientists to assess Japan’s electro-optical manufacturing base and identify any technologies that could be incorporated into U.S. defense supply chains. The technologies flagged by the DoD analysts in 1983 eventually found their way into U.S. systems and were credited with supporting the United States’ success in the 1991 Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1980s, the development of advanced sensors has been a priority for Japanese defense. In 1988, Japan awarded contracts for the development of Aegis destroyers as a component of its efforts to develop a robust sensor architecture. In 1989, the JSDF united its disparate sensor and shooter systems under the auspices of the Base Air Defense Ground Environment (BADGE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UED8rc8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: U.S. Dual-Use Trade in Electro-Optical Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataweb.usitc.gov/&quot;&gt;“DataWeb,” USITC, May 2024&lt;/a&gt;; and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan eventually began to procure more foreign-designed sensor systems at the turn of the millennium, generally featuring licensed production arrangements that preserved the Japanese EO/IR industrial base. Among others, these systems included Northrop Grumman’s E-2C Hawkeye and the Lockheed P-3 Orion. Additionally, Japanese military electro-optical production coincides with the development of indigenous systems, such as the OH-1 light helicopter or armored vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s sensor architecture was further strengthened by the procurement of air defense systems and other “shooters.” The United States is Japan’s primary source of missile defense systems, but Japan has long manufactured (under license) Patriot missile defense systems for its own use. The recent announcement of the export of these systems to the United States represents the culmination of U.S.-Japanese strategic cooperation in developing Japan’s sensor-to-shooter architecture over the course of several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-for-industrial-collaboration&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Industrial Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has been cultivating an interconnected regional security architecture with Australian, Japanese, and South Korean engagements and with increased multilateral sensor information sharing. In December 2023, the United States, South Korea, and Japan finalized an agreement to share real time missile-warning data from their various sensor networks to strengthen trilateral monitoring of North Korean missile tests. All three states possess sensor capabilities which are arrayed against North Korea; with the agreement to share data in place, allied cohesion is substantially strengthened. These initiatives are strengthened by other networking and digital lines of effort. During Prime Minister Kishida’s visit to Washington in April 2024, the two governments announced plans for an integrated air and missile defense architecture with Australia in the years ahead. At the industry level, in January 2024, Northrop Grumman and MELCO signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a joint networking solution for Japan’s air and missile defense systems to leverage the sensor-to-shooter architecture to its fullest with efficient fire controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-eoir-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Japan’s EO/IR Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s EO/IR industrial base is concentrated around the capabilities of a small group of enterprises, with Mitsubishi Corporation listed as the prime contractor for the majority of identified EO/IR records in the data. Along with final assembly, Japanese EO/IR production includes subcontractor participation, opening up the market for a broader range of opportunities. For example, MHI’s sensors may include circuitry and optics developed by the Nippon Electric Corporation. This characteristic of the Japanese EO/IR sensor industrial base is important when considering the possibilities and limits of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GRbjdlJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Japanese Manufacturers of EO/IR Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Janes Defense Markets Forecast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leading prime contractor for Japan’s recorded EO/IR sensors is MHI — even factoring in traditional U.S. defense contractors. In fact, most of the identified U.S.-made sensors belong to technologies fielded on the F-35, the Mitsubishi F-2, and select naval vessels. Across the recorded platforms, advanced fire control capabilities consistently recur as U.S. exports to Japan. In CSIS’s interviews with industry representatives, a continuous frustration highlighted by Japanese interviewees was the lack of codevelopment opportunities for higher-end systems. Japanese interviewees asserted that Japan likes to codevelop with the United States and wondered why their workers could not be brought into certain programs that are relevant to their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A continuous frustration highlighted by Japanese interviewees was the lack of codevelopment opportunities for higher-end systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has gradually developed its EO/IR industrial base to match its security needs. These investments are unlikely to decrease, as the threats that prompted the development of Japan’s EO/IR sensor architecture persist. Japanese EO/IR producers have consistently plugged into either U.S.-produced or U.S.-licensed systems. As Japan begins to deepen its security role in the region and as its concepts of counterstrike continue to materialize, this field will remain important for bilateral and multilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-insights&quot;&gt;Key Insights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing defense industrial cooperation is a stated goal of the Japanese and U.S governments, and the two nations are well positioned to work together. The nations have a Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA), which allows them to request priority delivery for defense items. They also have a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreement, which has benefits including some exemptions from “Buy America” provisions. The nations have a track record of working together successfully, including on the SM3 Block IIA missile, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and other programs. Collaborations include both the codevelopment of systems and the integration of Japan into the supply chains of systems designed and produced in the United States, experiences which provide a foundation for future work. In the course of this research, the authors identified both opportunities and challenges for defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for cooperation is the urgency of the security environment. Both countries view China as the core national security challenge, and they share a common view that action is needed to sustain deterrence. That said, the recognition that “production is deterrence” will open up opportunities only if governments create funded requirements and issue contracts for specific items. While collaboration in the form of codevelopment requires the buy-in of both governments, individual governments can encourage — and even fund — domestic industry with the goal of building capabilities and capacities to help them compete for participation in global supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors found a number of sticking points that government action could potentially alleviate or reduce, either directly or by providing incentives to industry. Other challenges are more intractable; the role of government in those can be education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-policy&quot;&gt;Government Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: Increases in equipment orders and the need to increase production may create challenges for firms involved in Japan’s defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. industry recognizes the opportunities in Japan that stem from budget increases and revisions to defense export policy. Many Japanese companies in the defense sector are responding to these changes, and some are making substantial investments in facilities to allow them to increase production of dual-use or defense-specific items. However, these developments also create new challenges, particularly related to industrial capacity. For example, while the defense budget has increased, the overall size of the workforce at most companies has not, although some firms are reallocating personnel into the defense business. Japanese defense manufacturers have nearly exclusively sold to the domestic market based on a near-flat defense budget for over half a century, so the increase in orders from the MOD puts a strain on defense companies as they look to grow across the full scope of capabilities necessary for production. MHI may be an exception, as the company moves personnel from its commercial aircraft or commercial shipbuilding business into its defense business, but other companies are less well positioned to do this. The challenge is that no matter the strength of the present-day demand signal, Japanese companies may be cautious about making significant investments in growing capacity given the uncertainty of demand over the longer term. Investment that grows capacity also increases costs — and without sustained increased demand over time, a higher cost basis could make companies less competitive for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 2: Broader defense equipment export reform in Japan will be essential to advancing international cooperation and building a globally competitive Japanese defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The still-limited reforms to defense export policy, coupled with the increased spending on defense, have resulted in Japanese industry continuing its principal focus on supplying the JSDF. While legislative reform will serve to make this business more profitable in the short term, it will do little to improve the competitiveness of Japanese industry internationally. Japan’s attractiveness to U.S. industry as a partner will hinge on increased confidence that items codeveloped or coproduced can be exported to third countries, not to mention that Japanese regulatory policy will adjust to encourage this possibility — a prospect that remains limited today. The mixed messages sent by the Japanese government about the priority to be placed on defense equipment exports continues to send a chilling signal to both U.S. and Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 3: Japan’s lingering instinct for indigenous, national solutions for high-end capabilities poses obstacles for international cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are promising areas of international collaboration under Japan’s new policies — including GCAP, GPI, and CCA — there are also numerous examples of the MOD seeking to develop indigenous capabilities despite the existence of international options that could be adapted to meet Japan’s requirements. Examples include Japan’s ambitious simultaneous investments in multiple variants of the Type-12 cruise missile; extensive R&amp;amp;D funding for multiple classes of UAS; and the stated intent to develop an autonomous “kill-chain” architecture to support counterstrike capabilities, tied together with an indigenous C2 network. While every industrialized country seeks to preserve some degree of autonomy in defense production, this focus on indigenous development — a long-standing feature of Japan’s defense strategy — over existing international options risks inefficient use of resources, delays in capability delivery, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 4: Increased early engagement between both Japanese and U.S. industry and government would facilitate industrial cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are important opportunities for U.S.-Japan cooperation on the horizon, such as the CCA and the Replicator program as discussed above. Japanese domestic programs could in future iterations tie into a larger U.S. program, but this incorporation could be at risk if early steps are not taken to lay groundwork for future cooperation. The U.S. Air Force has announced its intention to cooperate with partner industries in the future with regard to the CCA and is understandably focused on getting the details of this global approach right. Cooperation would benefit from increased and consistent forward-leaning communication to government and industry leaders in both countries on what steps they should be taking now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic&quot;&gt;Economic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: U.S. industry often views international codevelopment and coproduction of new systems as more expensive than indigenous production and may be hesitant to pursue opportunities absent government incentives and encouragement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International codevelopment and coproduction have clear benefits from an alliance perspective, including interoperability and expanded defense industrial capacity, but the challenges need to be recognized up front so that strategies can be developed to overcome them. International cooperation adds complexity and costs to programs because of the challenges of coordination, including requirements setting, decisionmaking timelines, different resources and acquisition systems, and cultural variance. Interviews conducted for this project revealed that U.S. industry often views international collaboration on new systems as challenging, particularly when partnering with an international company for the first time. A U.S. company may judge codevelopment or coproduction with a Japanese company to be more expensive than what a U.S. company can do either (a) on its own or (b) with another U.S. company — even when collaboration has clear technological and manufacturing benefits. Nevertheless, many U.S. firms express a strong desire to collaborate with Japan to take advantage of strong Japanese industrial capabilities and technological expertise, in recognition of the robust alliance between the two nations. (Project interviews highlighted particular interest in microelectronics and certain subcomponents, such as composite materials and airframe structures.) Government encouragement and policy focus, including through the creation of subsidies designed to support codevelopment by covering some of the costs of collaboration, could be useful and perhaps necessary to facilitate cooperation. Of course, without a requirement or a government contract with funding, cooperation is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial&quot;&gt;Industrial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: Japan has advanced manufacturing capabilities that prove especially important to U.S. commercial companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has advanced capabilities in various technologies — including microelectronics and carbon fiber composites — and is proficient in high-quality and high-volume commercial marketplace production. The United States has very limited capacity in some of these arenas, including wiring boards, which have been offshored to Southeast Asia. Japan’s comparative advantage in these fields underpins its bustling commercial industry, which has allowed it to become a key source of supply for a number of large foreign industrial producers, including Boeing. Bringing these capabilities and capacities to collaborative efforts could give Japanese industry market access while helping U.S. firms overcome their own limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 2: Modular open systems provide a framework for cooperation on codevelopment and coproduction, but current U.S. policy and industrial regimes do not tap into the full potential this architecture offers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modular open systems approaches, which allow for the incorporation of subsystems produced by different companies into standard interfaces, represent a possible means of expanding U.S.-Japan cooperation. Interviews with Japanese industry professionals conducted for this project found limited awareness of open systems approaches, however, which could be related to a lack of incentives for industry. The success of this framework is dependent on U.S. approval for technology developed and produced abroad to be incorporated into U.S. systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，本案為香港首宗就《反恐條例》審訊的案件，控罪涉及恐怖主義活動，此罪並不常見。辯方舉例解釋甚麼是恐怖主義活動，包括2001年的911事件，當時阿爾蓋達組織挾持客機撞向美國的大廈；而1972年慕尼黑奧運，有巴勒斯坦激進份子挾持以色列代表團，導致十多人死亡。辯方續指，1995年奧姆真理教教主麻原彰晃指示成員在東京地鐵施放沙林毒氣；2005年倫敦地鐵爆炸案，目的是想推翻政府。辯方指，上述均為人所公認的恐怖活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方將暴動歸類為恐怖活動但從未聽過政府如此定性&quot;&gt;辯方：控方將暴動歸類為恐怖活動、但從未聽過政府如此定性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據條例，恐怖主義活動有數項要求，包括要針對人的嚴重暴力、導致財產嚴重損害、危害其他人生命，以及對公眾構成嚴重危險。而上述行為目的是為着推展政治、宗教或思想主張，並強迫政府、國際組織或威嚇公眾人士而作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，若本案12.8計劃得以付諸實行，相信沒有人會爭議這是否恐怖主義活動。但控方的立場卻指，毋須證明本案眾籌的款項只是用作12.8計劃，因投擲汽油彈、破壞公共設施亦屬恐怖主義活動，因此只需證明款項用作這些行為。控方又指，本案證據依賴「育龍」頻道的精華片段，內容包括投擲汽油彈。辯方卻認為，控方針對黃的「恐怖活動」指控一直是12.8計劃，從無提及其他活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，控方沒有分析過2019年是否真的發生過恐怖主義活動。辯方反問：「警方發言人、政府、國際媒體有冇話香港好多恐怖份子？每個禮拜都有恐怖活動？大小審訊入面，有冇話邊單係恐怖活動？有冇聽過任何人形容2019年事情係恐怖主義活動？」辯方指，2019年騷亂只是被定性為暴動，他從未聽說過有人將暴動定性為恐怖主義活動，且因此要受審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方若以2019年社會氛圍作考慮是不公道&quot;&gt;辯方：若以2019年社會氛圍作考慮，是不公道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於控方於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀不言而喻。辯方卻認為，這是絕對不可取的態度，「呢個好危險嘅思維」，因等同將法庭以外的訊息帶入案件，做法並不公道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，即使精華片段內容屬實，卻沒有證據顯示暴動屬恐怖活動。另亦沒有證據顯示理大及中大事件屬於恐怖活動。即使「育龍」頻道曾發布關於「五大訴求，缺一不可」的訊息，但辯方反駁合法示威人士亦會叫這個口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強為擔任控方證人將劉佩凝拖落水&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強為擔任控方證人，將劉佩凝「拖落水」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就污點證人黃振強，辯方批評他有很大誘因作供，即為了獲得減刑，而其供詞亦受到質疑。黃在2019年12月8日被捕後，直至2023年2月案件交付上高院，他仍維持不認罪。相隔一個月，黃被加控「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，劉亦被控同一罪名。警方於同年5月開始接見黃，其後黃去信與律政司商討認罪協議，最後選擇認罪。在協商條件下，黃更承認並非事實的事情。辯方認為，黃為了擔任控方證人，故將劉「拖落水」。他直至被捕後的3年7個月，才首次提及劉的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黃獲得律政司的豁免起訴書，但條件之一是要坦誠作供，辯方形容對黃而言「等同佢頭上嘅一把刀」、「睇吓佢乖唔乖」。辯方亦質疑，黃的證供並不可信、「大話連篇」，不應照單全收，「將事實真相舞弄喺手掌之中嘅人，我哋畀幾多信任佢？」辯方強調，不能以黃認罪這個因素，來考慮劉是否有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方沒有證據劉看過屠龍精華片段&quot;&gt;辯方：沒有證據劉看過「屠龍」精華片段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就證供方面，辯方指控方必須證明劉有意圖或知悉黃振強將錢用作恐怖主義活動。控方指，劉得悉「育龍」頻道上的「屠龍」精華片段。但辯方反駁，沒有證據劉有看過上述片段。另外，黃在「育龍」成立後，沒有再參與示威行動，除了中大事件。辯方又指，黃只是將資金用作賭波，其紓壓的解釋亦站不住腳。他亦不肯將錢分給「出生入死嘅朋友」，亦拒提供10萬資金予「國難中醫」。辯方又指，黃與劉相識僅一個小時，黃就向劉表示要錢買槍，劉並不知道黃是否「講真」，而實際上黃沒有買槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方劉只是兼職會計文員妹老細叫佢做咩都做&quot;&gt;辯方：劉只是「兼職會計文員妹」、「老細叫佢做咩都做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再指，當黃向劉表示將會有大行動後，劉傳送掩面的表情符號。辯方指其意思是「冇眼睇」，因黃的說法虛無縹緲，兼「都唔知噏乜」。辯方指，黃聲稱曾與劉通電話，向她交代「屠龍」在大行動中會配合其他隊伍，並著她加緊眾籌力度，以準備「走佬Plan」。辯方認為黃實際是「看圖作故事」。辯方指，劉案發時為年僅20歲的「小女孩」，並對黃言聽計從。辯方總結，劉只是一個「兼職會計文員妹」，「老細叫佢做咩都做，佢冇人工收添㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方一度哽咽感謝陪審團專注聆聽&quot;&gt;辯方一度哽咽感謝陪審團專注聆聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，對劉而言公正、公義及公平的裁決，是被判無罪。辯方一度哽咽對陪審團說：「呢滴眼淚唔係關於劉佩凝嘅，而係見到你哋咁細心、聚焦、專注聽我嘅陳詞，我更加覺得感動，令我嗚咽。」他補充，陪審團制度是很多國家仍然採用的制度，「係一個好好嘅制度」，全靠市民願意犧牲時間，良好的司法程序才得以保存，「如果個個都話唔做，可能第日冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（16日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指控方「有殺錯冇放過」證據不足仍檢控 與彼拉多卸責交民眾審判耶穌相似&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4VxWkV7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（14日）踏入第72日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第六被告許湛榮的大律師陳偉彥指，許在串謀形成前已退出，控方針對許的證供「空洞無物」，不足以證明他有罪；但控方仍然堅持檢控，實屬不公，只是「有殺錯，冇放過」。控方又屢向陪審團表示「交畀你哋諗」，辯方認為實際目的是「拋個波畀你哋」，並引《聖經》故事為例子，指負責審判耶穌的羅馬官員彼拉多，明知耶穌無罪但不將他釋放，反而推卸責任，「任由民眾將耶穌送死」、「美其名交畀民眾決定」，上述例子與本案有「異曲同工」之處。辯方希望陪審團判無罪，並引用馬丁路德金的名言：「Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.」，又指「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義，不過遲到好過冇到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方針對許湛榮的證供空洞無物&quot;&gt;辯方：控方針對許湛榮的證供空洞無物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第六被告許湛榮的大律師陳偉彥進行結案陳詞。辯方指，控方針對許湛榮的證供「空洞無物」、「薄如蟬翼」，遠遠不足以證明許有罪，並強調：「控方舉證失敗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許在串謀成形前已退出&quot;&gt;辯方：許在串謀成形前已退出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，許在本案串謀協議成形之前已經退出，即「Left Before the Plan」，辯方以簡稱「LBP（Low Back Pain）」協助陪審團記憶。因此，許應該是無罪。辯方認為，控方模糊化協議成形的時間及內容。辯方希望陪審團以「3個W」考慮本案的串謀協議，即「What（何事）」、「When（何時）」及「Who（何人）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方解釋，本案的串謀協議是計劃在12月8日的民陣遊行途中放置炸彈。而協議是在計劃前的5天、即12月3日才成形，據證人黃振強的證供，吳當日透露計劃落實於12月8日執行。但當日許並不在場，因此他不知悉計劃。辯方指，控方沒有證據證明許在12月3日之後有參與過串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方不應將許歸為吳智鴻團隊即使好友亦唔係佢條蟲&quot;&gt;辯方：控方不應將許歸為吳智鴻團隊、即使好友亦「唔係佢條蟲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方將許歸納為吳智鴻的團隊，並指吳一方早於7月表示要找鄉黑「覆桌」，於10月已經有殺警察的「思維」，因他們曾討論打算在10.1遊行用真槍及炸彈攻擊警察，但最後煞停。辯方批評，控方的基礎是「荒天下之大謬」，因上述兩事件均與本案串謀無關，而且許當時並不在場，故此不知情。辯方質疑：「咁樣入佢數，公唔公道呀？」，並指控方一直模稜兩可，未能清楚說出串謀協議在何時成形。辯方認為，實際上根本沒有任何串謀協議，「因為佢哋（控方）知道冇任何串謀成形，梗係唔會認啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又批評，控方一直將許歸納為吳智鴻的團隊，「用呢個概念將所有人歸成兩邊」，但辯方希望陪審團獨立考慮針對許的證據，而「唔好好似控方咁鬆散、求其」。辯方強調，雖然許是吳的好友，但「唔係佢心入面條蟲」，因此不代表許知道吳參與「咁激進瘋狂嘅串謀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方做法是有殺錯冇放過&quot;&gt;辯方：控方做法是「有殺錯冇放過」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，吳獨自安排不同事情，故「好多嘢都係得佢知」。而控方卻含糊其詞、魚目混珠，將許及吳歸納成同一隊人，辯方形容其做法是「一竹篙打沉一船人，寧枉勿縱，有殺錯冇放過」。辯方強調，彭軍壕身為吳智鴻的「左右手」，作供時卻沒有提及許在行動中的角色及分工。另根據彭的證供，許在11月17日之後「消失咗」。辯方認為，彭是有動機指證被告的「污點證人」，但他卻不敢表明許是參與串謀者之一，因此這是最直接及最強的證據，證明許並非串謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指根據對話紀錄，有人曾問「群組入面有冇邊個唔可以知道最新訊息，榮係其中一個」。辯方指，這顯示許被排除在外，他根本不是串謀者，因此不能知道最新消息。辯方又指，有證據顯示許對吳的計劃並不知情，因許在吳被捕之後，發訊息指「認真，我個人唔係好信嗰把係真槍，我覺得一係改大咗嘅氣槍，一係一把閹槍」。辯方反問：「當大家一直話真槍，點解大行動佢（許）仲覺得係講笑，唔係真槍？」辯方強調，許根本不相信名校出身的中學同學兼好友，「夠膽死用真槍殺警察」，這再次顯示許並非串謀一份子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許得知吳有真槍後刻意疏離&quot;&gt;辯方：許得知吳有真槍後刻意疏離&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，許湛榮在參與西貢行山試槍後，拒絕與吳智鴻聯絡。辯方認為，可以想像許首次見到真槍及炸彈等危險品後，拒絕參與兼決定不與吳再有交集，因此刻意疏離並消失。控方指，吳於12月7日在香港華仁書院組裝炸彈時，兩度致電許，但許卻拒接電話。辯方認為，許明顯刻意不接聽，進一步顯示在行山之後，他刻意不與吳有交集。辯方提到，既然兩人都是「華仁仔」兼好友，許理應是協助組裝炸彈的「最佳人選」，但吳並沒有這樣做，「點解唔係揀信任嘅好朋友？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦提到，警方即使「地氈式搜證」，亦未能在閉路電視找到許的身影。辯方強調：「如果許湛榮一心想參與串謀，必然會出現喺準備行動之中，唔會完全消失。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方針對許的其他證供，包括許曾參與台灣軍訓，辯方指不能因此推論他有參與大行動。而且許亦沒有加入與其他被告商討迫政府妥協，顯示他並非激進份子。另一證據是警方在吳住所找到有許指紋的地圖，因此可推論許在行山之前曾與吳視察路線。辯方則反駁，沒有證據證明指紋何時出現，因指紋沒有時間指向性；再加上地圖上有其他人的指紋，證明有很多人接觸過。辯方強調，上述證據沒有價值，這正正突顯控方對許方面案情的絕望，陪審團不能由此推論許有份計劃行山路線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項控方提出的證據是，在吳被捕之後數小時，許在「台灣按摩旅行團」群組發訊息表示「清嘢」。辯方反駁，據吳電話的紀錄顯示，許在發訊息前已退出群組，因此許可能是得悉吳被捕後，為免被其他人牽連而重返群組，並作出提醒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許被捕後獲保釋但無離港因相信自己無辜&quot;&gt;辯方：許被捕後獲保釋但無離港、因相信自己無辜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後指，許在吳被捕後沒有離港，事隔一個多月至2020年1月8日，許亦被捕。辯方強調：「殺警察指控咁嚴重，如果佢有份，做乜嘢留喺度博拉？」另外，許在被捕後曾獲保釋，但他一直沒有離港，相隔1年3個月才被起訴，為本案最後一人被起訴。辯方反問：「如果真係有份串謀殺警察，可以走的話，會唔會真係留喺度？」辯方強調，許真的相信自己無辜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方盲目起訴許屬不公檢控&quot;&gt;辯方：控方盲目起訴許、屬不公檢控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提到，控方是「盲目起訴」許湛榮，是次檢控屬不公正。辯方指，由案發至今已達5年，控方在開審前一早閱畢所有文件，心知證據「幾多斤兩」，而許只是「局外人」。但控方仍堅持盲目起訴無辜的許，或有可能是同案其他被告棄保潛逃，因此才選擇起訴許。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方明知證據不足-卻不撤控&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方明知證據不足 卻不撤控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述律政司的《檢控守則》，其中一項為「檢控人員的角色及職務」，提到「檢控人員代表社會，行事不偏不倚，負責秉行公義。為此，檢控人員必須公正客觀地協助法庭找出真相，於社會與被控告之間，依法秉公行義」。至於另一項則關於「覆核和停止檢控」，提及「檢控人員有責任持續覆核已展開的檢控工作。隨著情況有變，假如在任何階段重新應用檢控驗證標準而顯示有關證據不再足以確保有合理機會達至定罪，或繼續進行檢控不會符合社會公義，便應停止檢控」。辯方續指，控方證據顯示許沒有參與本案串謀，「點解唔申請撤回對許湛榮嘅控罪，終止檢控？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方拋個波予陪審團與彼拉多要求民眾審判耶穌相似&quot;&gt;辯方：控方「拋個波」予陪審團、與彼拉多要求民眾審判耶穌相似&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方認為，控方在結案陳詞多次向陪審團表示「交畀你哋諗」，實際目的是「拋個波畀你哋」。辯方又引用《聖經》故事作為例子，指負責審判耶穌的羅馬官員彼拉多（Pontius Pilate），明知道耶穌無罪但不將他釋放，而「任由民眾將耶穌送死」。辯方形容，彼拉多「美其名交畀民眾決定」，實質上只是「wash their hands of」，即推卸責任。辯方補充：「我唔係話許湛榮係耶穌，但係係咪同樣推卸責任、有異曲同工嘅地方？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許坐住監等審訊人生被摧毀&quot;&gt;辯方：許「坐住監等審訊」、人生被摧毀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方重申，刑事案件的舉證標準極為嚴格，必須達至毫無合理疑點，以「保護各位不會被錯誤不公檢控之下，無辜受罪」。辯方指，控方沒有可能在毫無合理疑點下證明許有罪，而許沒有案底、年僅二十多歲，但卻「坐住監等審訊，白白浪費青春，冇人賠畀佢」。辯方強調：「無理控告摧毀佢哋嘅人生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義不過遲到好過冇到&quot;&gt;辯方：「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義，不過遲到好過冇到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後引用馬丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）的名言：「Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.」辯方對陪審團指：「控方唔公正起訴許湛榮，同樣可以起訴各位嘅親人、朋友、摯愛」、「唔好對不公視而不見，聽而不聞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，刑事法的金科玉律提到「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義」，但補充：「不過遲到好過冇到」，「如果你哋還佢公義、自由，我依然衷心感謝你哋。」辯方指，基於疑點利益歸於被告下，許應該被判無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳偉彥完成陳詞，案件明（15日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指賴振邦「踢保」後無離港、證明無辜 又指「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IrNRF4o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（13日）踏入第71日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第五被告賴振邦的大律師是香媛指，賴在「3C 維修工作室」工作，雖然店舖是「黃店」並貼有「文宣」，但辯方強調：「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警。」辯方提醒陪審團考慮案情時，撇開賴的政治理念。辯方又指，涉案電話並非屬於賴，控方依賴電話有其生活照就確立推論，基礎十分牽強。對於「污點證人」彭軍壕指賴振邦別名為「Bobby」，而電話通訊紀錄顯示曾發訊息自稱「Bobby」。辯方反駁這是普通名字：「電視藝人歐陽震華都叫 Bobby，任何人都可以用。」辯方亦指，警員即使迫賴喝「滴露」，亦未能得到其招認，因此找彭協助將行為編派在賴身上。辯方最後指，賴振邦「踢保」後無離港，證明他是無辜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴的電話維修工作室為黃店但思想係黃唔代表會殺警&quot;&gt;辯方：賴的電話維修工作室為「黃店」、但「思想係黃唔代表會殺警」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第五被告賴振邦的大律師是香媛進行結案陳詞。辯方強調，賴振邦並沒有參與本案串謀。據早前證供透露，賴於2020年1月在位於香港工業中心的「3C 維修工作室」被捕。辯方描述警方拍攝的照片指，工作室門外寫明「10分鐘特快維修」、「破解密碼鎖」、「修復資料」，同時亦貼有2019年社會運動的「文宣」，明顯是俗稱的「黃店」。至於店內則有嬰兒圍欄，辯方指這證明不止賴一人出入工作室。辯方指，賴有胞姊，而姊夫為張堅順，他同涉本案曾經被捕。辯方強調，即使有政治理念亦不代表會做涉案行為，「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警。」辯方提醒陪審團考慮案情時，撇開賴的政治理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方電話並非屬於賴警方沒有查問過&quot;&gt;辯方：電話並非屬於賴、警方沒有查問過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方證據指警方在「3C 維修工作室」檢獲的 iPhone 8 Plus 電話，必然屬於賴振邦。電話內經復原的 Telegram 程式顯示，已登入用戶名稱「接完紙鶴未？」，這用戶為「行山討論區」的成員之一。至於「Google Maps」則登入了賴的帳戶。辯方則指，電話並不屬於賴，他並非唯一使用者；而帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」亦不是由賴使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，店舖內擺放多部電話，涉案電話「只不過係工作枱上，芸芸眾多電話嘅其中一部」，該電話是唯一毋須密碼開啟。賴沒有作出招認表示電話屬他。辯方認為，警方得悉本案牽涉 Telegram 訊息，而到場其中一個目標是要檢取電話。不過警方並沒有查問哪一電話屬於賴，辯方質疑，警員「只要搵到一部電話與案有關，就會話屬於賴振邦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方以電話有個人照判斷電話屬賴基礎非常牽強&quot;&gt;辯方：以電話有個人照判斷電話屬賴、基礎非常牽強&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;負責檢取電話的警員供稱，曾打開涉案電話查看相簿，發現部分是賴的生活照。辯方卻指，電話其中一個已登入的 Apple ID 屬賴，因此照片可能是從另一部電話經過 iCloud 同步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，該警員在查看前沒有獲上司批准，事後沒有記錄在記事冊，亦無匯報上級，「係咪可以信呢？」辯方另質疑，警員為了掩飾故虛構有向賴查問。辯方又指，電話內的炸彈相片來自吳智鴻，並非由涉案電話拍攝。辯方強調，控方以個人照片來判斷電話擁有人是賴，此基礎非常牽強。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方bobby屬普通名字電視藝人歐陽震華也用&quot;&gt;辯方：「Bobby」屬普通名字、電視藝人歐陽震華也用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「污點證人」、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕，指賴振邦別名為「Bobby」；而電話內的「Line」程式中，曾發訊息指：「Hi I am Bobby」。但辯方立場指「Bobby」並不是賴，「Bobby 係好普通嘅名，電視藝人歐陽震華都叫 Bobby，任何人都可以用。」辯方總結，控方未能在毫無合理疑點下，證明賴是電話的唯一使用者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員檢取店內4萬資金目的阻黃店運作&quot;&gt;辯方：警員檢取店內4萬資金、目的阻「黃店」運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，警員在店內檢取4萬多元現金，明顯是店舖的營運資金及收入。辯方質疑，沒有證據顯示金錢與案有關，而警方目的是要阻礙「黃店」運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕逢大必縮遇到大事就會撇清關係&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕「逢大必縮」、遇到大事就會撇清關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後批評本案「污點證人」、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕。辯方指，彭為本案年紀最大的被告，案發時33歲及無業，其父親為警署警長。辯方強調，彭在本案中「逢大必縮」，每當遇到「大件事」，就會撇清關係並指與自己無關。另外，彭作供時「選擇性記憶」，他在細節上記得清楚，但被問及重要的事就表示不記得。辯方批評，彭作供期間亦經常背誦關鍵詞、在邏輯上表現混亂，內容亦自相矛盾，「一方面講到自己好叻，但係大件事就話唔關佢事，推落人哋到，自己只係睇，冇參與。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，從彭的證供可見吳智鴻與彭志同道合，吳想為7.21元朗事件復仇時，第一個是找彭。辯方認為彭是吳的左右手。但當彭參與示威活動時，則僅僅旁觀，並無親自行動。另外，彭有些說法並非屬實，例如他說在 Red MR 的會面中有交代台灣軍訓日期，但紀錄顯示當時尚未決定好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，在台灣宿舍期間聽到吳及賴談論要進行破壞「迫政府妥協」，辯方卻質疑屬彭虛構：「呢幾個字係咪好文雅？啲人講嘅時候會唔會用呢啲字眼呢？」，「點解咁啱次次都畀佢聽到呢啲咁嘅內容？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭曾供稱，自己於10月3日與吳、賴及許湛榮到灣仔「卓軒旅舍」打算投擲鏹水彈。辯方質疑沒有任何證供支持彭的說法，「又係得佢把口講。」而對話紀錄亦無顯示吳邀請其他成員參與。彭表示各人打算投擲時，自己則「落街買嘢食」。辯方質疑彭的說法不合邏輯：「去到重要時刻，點解會落街買嘢食？掟完先食又得嘅啫！又要作到無自己份。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭另稱，於11月14日與賴到城大及浸大的實驗室「爆 Lab」，但對話顯示由彭率先問誰人會參與。彭早前指，在被捕後抱「僥倖心理」，因此部分說法並非事實全部。辯方卻反駁，彭既然明知自己「走唔甩」，亦打算認罪，為何仍會抱着這個心理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭想拉人落水減低自己參與性&quot;&gt;辯方：彭想拉人落水、減低自己參與性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭證供透露，他與賴等人有參與11月16日晚的西貢行山試槍。惟彭卻強調自己負責「睇水」，沒有親自「落手落腳」。辯方質疑彭再次塑造出自己無份參與大事，「次次都係負責睇。」辯方亦指出，當日環境昏暗加上各人蒙面，而且沒有太多對話，因此彭未能確定參與者身份，他只是虛構賴有出席，目的「想拉人落水，盡量減低自己嘅參與性」。辯方最後指，若然如控方所言，賴有份參與行山，為何會容許其他參與者用電話拍攝並留下定位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴並非製造炸彈者&quot;&gt;辯方：賴並非製造炸彈者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的證供提及，賴負責製作炸彈及引爆器，但辯方強調根本沒有證據支持，實質彭「佢一個人鍾意講乜就講乜」。辯方補充，吳曾向被指為賴振邦的用戶表示：「我個炸彈佬要用」，這顯示賴並非製造炸彈的人。辯方重申，彭只是將其他人的行為放在賴身上。彭亦稱曾到「3C 維修工作室」的後樓梯進行「試爆」，在場人士包括賴，而自己只是旁觀角色。辯方質疑：「去到重要時刻，如果佢淨係去睇，使乜帶埋佢去？佢嘅作用係咩啫？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警方即使迫喝滴露賴亦拒招認故找彭協助虛構&quot;&gt;辯方：警方即使迫喝「滴露」賴亦拒招認、故找彭協助虛構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，12月3日在荃灣酒吧內各人會面討論大計劃，在場的包括賴。閉路電視拍攝到賴出現。黃振強供稱，賴當時在酒吧內表示有閉路電視，要求各人不要討論計劃。辯方強調，賴沒有說過上述說話，亦無從猜測他有說過。辯方又指，不想揣測黃是否在警方探訪後改變證供。辯方亦強調，黃的證供顯示4名涉計劃的「首腦」已在「松記糖水」傾談好，因此毋須再次討論。辯方反問，既然彭想塑造成賴是小心謹慎的人，為何他會不設置電話密碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的證供提到，賴於12月8日應吳的要求拿電池盒到香港華仁書院協助製作炸彈。但辯方質疑，吳只是開始製作炸彈不久，為何電池盒如此快溶掉。對於控方指閉路電視並非360全角度，因此未能拍攝到賴在場，辯方質疑說法不合理：「冇就係冇，點能夠話有去不過影唔到。」辯方又指，在場的煙頭及擺放炸彈的背包，只驗出彭及吳的 DNA。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，彭在被捕後的供詞完全沒有提及過賴振邦的名字，直至警員向彭表示賴即是「Bobby」，他才知道。辯方認為，警員即使迫賴喝「滴露」，也未能得到賴的招認，因此最後找彭協助，「將 Bobby 做嘅嘢編派喺賴振邦身上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴振邦踢保後無離港證明無辜&quot;&gt;辯方：賴振邦「踢保」後無離港、證明無辜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，控方表明吳一方在9月30日的皇后街會議後，已經對用槍及炸彈襲擊警察有「思維」。惟辯方強調，思維與串謀是「兩碼子嘅事」。而賴並沒有參與上述會議，控方亦無提出賴何時加入串謀。另外，辯方指吳一方沒有在群組交代12.8計劃之目的及執行形式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，賴於2020年1月17日首次被捕，2日後獲保釋外出，同年6月16日獲警方批准毋須再擔保，直至9月他再次被捕。辯方指賴在6月後其實可隨時離港，但由於他是無辜，所以才繼續坦蕩蕩留港工作：「如果賴振邦真係控方所指嘅人，點會唔走佬？點會留喺香港等人拉啫？」辯方又指，警方在首次拘捕後已檢取賴的電話，若他知道電話內容對自己不利，就會選擇離港。辯方希望陪審團裁定賴罪名不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（14日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold War military bases frequently displayed the quote “Our Job in Peace is to Prepare for War”, reminding people that the peacetime role of the armed forces was to be ready for war. Hardly a new idea, variations on the theme appear in Sun Tzu, Clausewitz and in Vegetius’ famous dictum “si vis pacem, para bellum”. The connection between training and war is well established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At RUSI’s Land Warfare Conference 2024, the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) argued for more productive armed forces, and endorsed the new Chief of the General Staff’s ambition to increase the lethality of the Army. The Strategic Defence Review must consider these issues, alongside the size of the Defence budget needed to deliver the stated ambitions. And while many of the headlines will be focused on the physical elements of capability – the people, equipment and stockpiles – capability is more. In Ukraine, Russia’s numerical superiority in people and equipment has not delivered the quick victory it hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence describes capability as a function of many factors, encapsulated in the acronym TEPIDOIL. There is a reason that Training comes ahead of Equipment, People, Information, Doctrine, Organisation, Infrastructure and Logistics: it is the glue that binds the other elements and gives the force its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training (and education) not only coheres the elements of capability, but also connects the three components of fighting power. It ensures that the physical component can be used to the full, enhances the conceptual component, and underpins the moral component by building and sustaining trust and people’s willingness to fight for each other. Collective training forges strong and integrated units, Services and alliances. Just as capability is more than equipment, so too is interoperability – the ability to exchange data and cue each other’s sensors and shooters still requires people to cooperate, and human interoperability is founded on trust, which requires shared experience. Training, therefore, needs to be an integral element of the Defence Review and not the Cinderella function to be ignored in favour of its more glamorous sisters such as air and missile defences, artillery, cyber and digital backbones. Nor can training be confined to a human resources analysis independent of operational requirements, which the Strategic Defence Review’s terms of reference might suggest is how it is seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite renewed focus on training – the Royal Navy’s collaborative synthetic training that connects Portsmouth to the US Navy in Norfolk or San Diego, the Army’s Collective Training Transformation Programme and the RAF’s aggressor training, together with a more dynamic exercise programme in recent years, including through NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force – there are concerns that the current approach to training in the UK is outdated. While many of the issues impacting individual training are well known, collective training does not adequately prepare the forces for state-based conflicts, despite it being almost a decade since the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) which described a resurgence in state-based threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The content of training must change to reflect the threats and experience of recent wars, and this is currently not responsive enough&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commentary highlights a potential tension in the desire for enhanced productivity and preparing the armed forces for war, before considering four issues that impact on collective training’s ability to meet threats: capacity; the scale at which training takes place; the content, including questions about risk; and funding. So, while there is much that is positive about collective training and exercising, there are challenges that the Strategic Defence Review team should address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-productivity-gap&quot;&gt;A Productivity Gap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having productive armed forces is important, but the yardstick against which productivity is measured is crucial. Productivity generally concerns how much input is required to produce a given output; how the output is defined is therefore crucial. If the measure is how much use is made of the armed forces in delivering routine peacetime activity that shows an immediate return against the Defence budget – greater equipment availability from the same fleet with fewer people, or military aid to the civil authorities – these tasks will be prioritised, even if the forces have less time to train to win the wars they may be called on to fight. If the job (output) of the armed forces in peace is to prepare for war, this is a different measure of productivity, one that is hard to gauge in advance, but which may require training for war to be prioritised above the forces’ routine use. However, it would be unrealistic to think that the defence budget should only fund the armed forces as a break-glass emergency capability; they must add value short of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice is not binary: credible, lethal armed forces can deter many adversaries, where they have the right type and volume of equipment that can be used to the full through realistic and demanding training. Where that training is conducted can have deterrent and reassurance effects, so whether the British Army Training Unit in Suffield, Canada (BATUS) is the right location for a European threat is worth consideration. BATUS offers permissive land and air space for large-scale training – including for the use of drones – that is hard to find in Europe, but is a long way from the potential fight, so there is a judgement between training value and deterrent effect. However, if technology can help coordinate live and virtual forces dispersed across multiple European training areas, Defence could step between the horns of that dilemma. And, if the definition of productivity as routine use is adopted, deterring adversaries and reassuring allies through practised interoperability in the likely theatre of operations makes an immediate contribution to outputs which should be just as legitimate as sending small training teams around the world, or providing military aid to the civil authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology, through simulation, also enhances productivity by reducing the use of physical equipment, increasing its life (for example, fewer live flying or sea hours allowing more of a fleet to be operational) and reducing the need for fuel, spare parts and maintenance. However, those who fuel or service the equipment (or people) also need to be trained for wartime conditions, and industry may depend on repeat orders of parts to keep production lines and supply chains open; simulation is therefore not the complete answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capacity-constrained&quot;&gt;Capacity Constrained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of the individual and collective training systems is heavily constrained, both in the number of training places and the estate. The military flying training system’s problems are well-known, but capacity elsewhere has been “optimised” for the force size and requirements described in the 2015 SDSR, as adjusted by the Army cuts in the 2021 Defence Command Paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With training capacity already matched to small armed forces with a commensurately limited throughput, the situation will be worse if the Strategic Defence Review concludes – as it should – that numbers must increase. This will be a particular issue for the Reserves in the event of mobilisation. One deduction may be to give the volunteer reserve a role in training for mobilisation, creating a nucleus of trainers who can prepare the second and subsequent echelons, expanding capacity quickly when required. The way Reserves were involved in training the Ukrainian armed forces under Operation Interflex offers a potential template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another capacity constraint is the ability to release people or units for training. Justin Bronk observes that in several NATO air forces (including the RAF), pilots and engineers are overstretched by concurrent requirements for maintaining basic flying currency, major exercises and operational deployments. Consequently, many non-US NATO air forces cannot conduct the large-scale complex training sorties necessary to regenerate the skills needed for high-intensity missions. Similarly, the Royal Navy’s small fleet is regularly bounced between deployment and rigorous training packages, leaving little time for rest or maintenance, which contributes to retention and serviceability challenges across the fleet. Armed forces busy doing today’s tasks cannot be preparing properly for tomorrow’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;size-matters&quot;&gt;Size Matters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant weakness in UK collective training is its scale. At the Land Warfare Conference, Major General Mark Pullan described NATO’s aspiration for Corps-level training, which significantly exceeds the UK’s current training effort that often takes place below brigade level. Similarly, in the maritime and air domains, collective training and exercises often focus on small formations, not the larger ones that would be needed in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology could expand the ability to generate scale by combining live and virtual assets: the synthetic training system Gladiator – used by the RAF and the Australian, Canadian and US Air Forces – and the Advanced Tactical Augmented Reality Systems are good examples. Expanding the ability to connect all domains to such systems would also help training and exercise scheduling, enabling virtual participation with or from other Services or partners. This could overcome the limitation of platform numbers – for example, as the British Army expands its ground-based air defence capabilities, not having to wait for the RAF to provide a fast jet or drone might allow for more responsive, assured and predictable training. And something in the vein of a simulation Red Flag-like exercise (Sim Flag) could contribute to interoperability and mass without the high cost and lengthy planning involved in physical exercises. However, technology is not a complete replacement for live training – simulating the aggregate friction inherent in large-scale operations is still difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;train-hard-fight-easy&quot;&gt;Train Hard, Fight Easy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content of training must change to reflect the threats and experience of recent wars, and this is currently not responsive enough. Speakers on the multi-domain integration panel at the Land Warfare Conference highlighted how the design of many exercises and collective training remains rather traditional across the maritime, land and air domains. The modern battlefield’s ubiquitous intelligence gathering, swarming drones, unconventional weapons (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) and fast-adapting electromagnetic environment that undermines the ability to integrate forces are absent from too many exercises, and rarely present in combination. Moreover, with a primary focus on the learning benefit to combat forces, the logistics elements are often underplayed, whether supply, medical or engineering – including wet-gap crossings – meaning the vital enablers are not tested as they would be in conflict. Exercises also assume that the force is already at war, rather than testing the transition to war, which would stress different parts of the armed forces and society. Similarly, exercises often pay little, if any, attention to post-attack recovery. Greater integration of industry and partners across government is needed in exercises and collective training events to build the understanding, processes and trust that will be needed in war. And while there are examples of this, notably the Joint Expeditionary Force, it is not as common as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk is another constraint on the conduct of training. Understandably, the safety risk in training is managed closely, but whether or not the balance is right is being challenged. The Defence Safety Authority (DSA) – which “aims to reduce and ideally prevent loss of life, avoidable harm and damage to the environment” – discharges its responsibilities seriously, but this can lead to a preference for risk that is “as low as reasonably practicable”. Whether the DSA and the wider legislative framework that impacts on the armed forces’ training for war are calibrated correctly should form part of the thinking during, or be tasked as subsequent work by, the Strategic Defence Review team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitudes to operational risk also need review. Those playing the adversary need relevant capabilities, whether as organic functions – such as the US Air Force aggressor squadrons – or contracted capabilities such as Draken who support the RAF. This requires not only financial but also intellectual investment to understand how an adversary might fight you – not just how they have fought against others – and how to defeat them. This in turn requires a willingness, even an enthusiasm, to fail. But with few opportunities for collective training, unit commanders are disincentivised to be radical for fear that their only exercise report in command will indicate they did not pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The question of training is fundamentally one of the Defence mindset, and the Strategic Defence Review needs to help Defence reset how it thinks and acts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology can expand access to training, allow for experimentation, and confine the risk of death or injury to avatars in the virtual world. Moreover, the simulated/augmented reality environment may be the only place certain capabilities such as cyber attack, urban operations in cities and F35s can be tested without providing an adversary with intelligence on the extent of one’s capabilities, or for practical reasons. And while the temptation may be to invest in the front-end virtual/augmented reality systems, Defence needs the foundations to allow single Service systems to integrate, nationally and with key allies. Ideally, standards for technical architectures, acquisition and data would operate at the NATO level, but UK Strategic Command’s Integration Design Authority has an important role to play, and it needs to be enabled to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secure-funding&quot;&gt;Secure Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training is expensive, and funding represents a critical challenge. The money comes from in-year running costs – the resource departmental expenditure limit (RDEL) – (which is often overcommitted, frequently resulting in cuts to activity, including training. Moreover, while RDEL savings will impact on the regular component, they pose greater risks to the operational effectiveness of the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predictability of funding over many years is hugely important for effective exercise planning, especially given the need to exercise at greater scale and with allies and partners whose own planning needs to be considered. A financial settlement that moves to the promised 2.5% of GDP, but that ties that growth to capital expenditure or specific RDEL elements, such as pension contributions – as happened under the last government’s 2019 spending review – or the new government’s pay award, which requires some of the 6% pay rise to be found by reprioritisation and savings, could leave training funding vulnerable. An option might be to protect the exercise budget by ringfencing the funding settlement, providing predictability for planners, both UK and allied. While this constrains budget flexibility, which is generally undesirable, it may be essential in protecting the capacity to train meaningfully. And while large-scale exercises are costly in both money and time, in Peter Drucker’s memorable words, “if you think training is expensive, try ignorance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of training is fundamentally one of the Defence mindset, and the Strategic Defence Review needs to help Defence reset how it thinks and acts – an approach to preparing for war that avoids risk, prioritises routine activity over large-scale preparation for conflict and sees training as a cost to be reduced is not one that will deliver lethal, battle-winning forces that could prevent war by deterring those who would do us harm. With many of the constraints impacting on training and exercises, investing in technology in a more systematic and coordinated way could compensate for the limitations the forces are operating under, and raise their readiness to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidly increasing lethality is most likely to be achieved through more effective use of what is currently available; the equipment and people are important, but training is as important for coalescing the components of capability and making them more than the sum of their individual parts. The Strategic Defence Review, therefore, must ensure that when decisions are made about the capabilities the forces need, the requirement for access to realistic, demanding and predictably funded training is secured. If the job of armed forces in peacetime is to prepare for war, this will also deliver CDS’s demand for enhanced productivity, perhaps more so than their use in delivering peacetime services to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：李家田視「屠龍」為「飲飲食食群組」、被警員「打嚇氹」後才招認&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/F9ce4iY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（12日）踏入第70日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第四被告李家田的大律師林芷瑩表示，李加入「屠龍」是希望訪問隊員及「攞錢」，對於當時經濟環境不佳、戶口僅剩個位數的李而言，他因有人資助「飲飲食食」而逗留隊內，李實際上是參與「飲飲食食嘅群組」。辯方指，只有黃振強及吳智鴻等知道大計劃，而被告則蒙在鼓裡，「你有你 plan，我有我打算，黐飲黐食。」辯方另指，李在家中廁所被警員「打嚇氹」之下，才作出招認，而控方未能解釋其中一個「謎團」，就是為何重點搜查隊沒有搜查廁所。雖然涉事警員否認，但辯方強調：「冇人會認自己打過人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田加入屠龍為有錢攞認為自己參與飲飲食食群組&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田加入「屠龍」為「有錢攞」、認為自己參與「飲飲食食群組」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第四被告李家田的大律師林芷瑩進行結案陳詞。證供顯示，李家田是「屠龍」成員，他曾加入 Telegram 群組「滅龍」並參與對話；至於「皇馬龍利號」群組，李則已經退出。辯方指，不能以被告等人經常去暴動現場，而推論他們必然會參與本案的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何李家田會加入「屠龍」，辯方指他並非真的想加入本案的串謀，只是他對社會事件有興趣，並因在浸大修讀電影高級文憑課程，於是到暴動現場搜集資料及拍攝片段，同時希望訪問「屠龍」。辯方指，李加入「屠龍」的另一原因是「有錢攞」，對於當時經濟環境不佳、戶口僅剩個位數、「唔夠錢洗」的李而言，有人資助他「飲飲食食」而令他留在隊內，絕對是可以理解，「如果咁嘅經濟狀況之下，有人畀錢你飲飲食食，你會唔會留喺呢個 group？」辯方強調，李實際上是參與「飲飲食食嘅群組」。辯方指，只有黃振強、吳智鴻及林銘皓知道槍械炸彈計劃，而被告則蒙在鼓裡，「你有你 plan，我有我打算，黐飲黐食。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田並非核心人物&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田並非核心人物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方屢質疑李為何不詢問群組訊息的意思，辯方則反駁：「用生活邏輯去諗，係咪每一樣嘢都會問到篤？」辯方強調，李家田並非核心人物，「佢喺群組係咪咁重要？」，加上李並不在「行山討論區」群組。辯方補充，李並沒有與隊員前往泰國旅行，「如果李家田係咁重要，點解成隊人唔等埋佢？」他對於隊員去了泰國亦不知情。辯方亦指，李並非在警方的監察名單當中，閉路電視亦拍攝不到李的出現。辯方質疑：「證供咪好似好弱雞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強證供不可信屬一派胡言&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強證供不可信、屬「一派胡言」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方依賴的背景證供包括，李曾參與11月16日凌晨至17日早上的西貢行山試槍，並接收吳智鴻提供的手槍，其後他參與11月17日晚的大鴻輝會議，並匯報過程。「屠龍」於11月18日開始加入本案串謀，因此控方依賴這日之後的證供，作為串謀的證據。據污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供，李有出席11月25日的荃灣三陂坊會議，以及12月5日何文田訪問後的會議，會上黃交代吳團隊會使用槍械炸彈，而「屠龍」將負責引警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方批評，黃振強的證供不可信亦不可靠，屬「一派胡言」，實際上李沒有出席上述3個會議，並多次缺席「屠龍」的會議。根據李供稱，他於11月17日晚上被困理大，根本沒有出席會議，而且當時理大遭圍封，李沒有可能離開後再進入，「警方重重包圍之下，點樣入返去呢？幾鍾意參與社會事件嘅人，都唔會想咁嘅情況被警方拘捕。」辯方又提到，證供透露吳是一個小心謹慎的人，他不會將手槍交給不認識的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強有作供動機為減刑及罪行一筆勾銷&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強有作供動機、為減刑及「罪行一筆勾銷」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方解釋，黃振強有作供動機。黃原被控5罪，成為控方證人只需承認兩罪，其餘3罪則可獲存檔法庭，當中包括最高判囚終身的「串謀謀殺」罪。另外，黃獲得豁免起訴書，內容涵蓋暴動及非法集結，可以「將佢以前干犯嘅罪行一筆勾銷」。辯方續指，如黃的口供被接納，他最高可獲50%減刑。辯方質疑：「佢會唔會作假口供指證其他人呢？一定會！」辯方又指，黃在錄影會面、無損權益口供及庭上的證供，均有眾多出入之處，部分亦不合邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕拒提供電話密碼可在法庭天花龍鳳咁講&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕拒提供電話密碼、可在法庭「天花龍鳳咁講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一污點證人、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕，辯方亦指他在作供後獲撤回「串謀謀殺」罪，因此他亦有作供動機。辯方批評，彭供稱被捕後一心打算認罪，並交代事情始末，但他在錄影會面期間卻行使緘默權，並拒絕提供電話密碼予警方。辯方質疑，沒有獨立證供支持彭的說法，因此他可以「齋噏」、「喺法庭天花龍鳳咁講」，而且令人懷疑彭所說的是謊話，加上其證供有多處前後矛盾，「可唔可以相信一個唔肯開電話嘅人嘅片面之詞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，由於警方知道針對李的證供薄弱，因此才要求彭在口供表示吳智鴻將槍交李，而彭起初並無提及此事。辯方指，這個版本是警方重組而成，務求令彭及李的說法一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田證供可信他被警員打嚇氹下才作招認&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田證供可信、他被警員「打嚇氹」下才作招認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，李家田的證供則是可信，他本人亦在庭上表示，作供目的是希望法庭能夠找出真相及還他公義。即使陪審團不信任李的證供，亦不代表控方能證明他犯罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦依賴李的招認口供，李分別作出口頭招認、記事冊上的招認，以及進行錄影會面。辯方指，李家田在家中廁所被警員「打嚇氹」之下，才作出招認。辯方指出，控方未能解釋其中一個「謎團」，就是為何重點搜查隊沒有搜查廁所。辯方指，顯而易見的是警員在廁所對李「打嚇氹」。雖然涉事警員否認，但辯方強調：「冇人會認自己打過人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方進一步指，拘捕李的警員早前亦曾拘捕黃振強，而證供顯示黃當時也受到毆打。辯方遂指：「點解同一批警員唔會做同樣嘅嘢？」辯方指，由於黃身上有傷痕，故警員改為對李使用不留痕跡的「水刑」。控方一度質疑為何李記憶清晰，他當時回應：「冇經歷就會唔明白，係性命攸關嘅狀態」，辯方又指：「佢經歷你哋不能想像、你哋冇人經歷過嘅事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，李被捕期間一直沒有見過同在家中的母親，因此不敢即時作出投訴。辯方另指，李承認對他最有害的招認，即自己曾接收吳給予的手槍。辯方質疑，李若非被打，根本毋須承認。對於控方指「肥警察好難彎腰」，辯方卻反駁：「一個人有肚腩唔代表佢唔可以打人」，並補充：「加上我唔覺得佢肥。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方招認內容並非屬實&quot;&gt;辯方：招認內容並非屬實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，李被捕時，警方已經成功檢獲涉案的3支手槍，分別從吳智鴻、摩星嶺及蘇緯軒檢到。辯方質疑，警方卻沒有就手槍向李查問。辯方另指，李沒有必要「大模廝樣」保留曾裝手槍的綠色袋在家，因這屬對他不利的證據。辯方又表示，控方沒有提出證據證明手槍上找到李的指紋。而李的招認當中，大部分是為了迎合警員而虛構的，否則，「點解李家田咁傻，要作一啲對自己不利嘅版本？」辯方強調招認內容並非屬實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員曾捏造證供不可信&quot;&gt;辯方：警員曾捏造證供、不可信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦批評，警員的證供不可信亦不可靠，有部份是謊言。辯方舉例指出，警員沒有即時向李發出羈留人士通知書，原因是不想李知道自己有找律師的權利。警員亦無應李的要求給他閱讀搜查令。辯方總結，警員對上司的訓示置之不理，沒有讓同僚搜查廁所，因他們當時在廁所毆打李。辯方又指警員曾捏造證供。當被問為何有相片顯示桌上有被指裝過手槍的綠色袋，有些相片卻沒有時；警員回應起初把手槍放在證物袋，經提醒下才記起未拍照，因此再放回桌上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後對陪審團指，希望大家細心考慮證供，「呢個公義係你哋先可以畀到佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師林芷瑩完成陳詞，案件明（13日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黃振強斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備 辯方：諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SoCUnan.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（9日）踏入第69日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第三被告嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷指，為「污點證人」的「屠龍」隊長黃振強，其證供屬「爛牌」，但由於需要證明「屠龍」有參與串謀，因此控方「冇咗呢隻牌唔得」。辯方又指，證據顯示「屠龍」成員沒有打算參與行動，因黃在群組批評隊員在行動前一日推搪表示未能協助搬運裝備。辯方質疑：「如果聽日係6月6號，諾曼第登陸，唔知你哋有冇聽過，第二次世界大戰，會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強口供屬爛牌&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強口供屬「爛牌」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第三被告嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷進行結案陳詞。辯方指，嚴沒有參與軍訓，而警方的監視名單中亦沒有嚴。辯方其後就污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供作出評價。辯方指，控方在結案陳詞階段沒有表示黃是誠實可靠的證人，「係唔記得，定唔方便講？」辯方又形容黃的口供屬於「爛牌」，但由於需要證明「屠龍」有參與串謀，因此控方「冇咗呢隻牌唔得」，否則罪責程度會有分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃有莫大誘因說出對自己有利的事情&quot;&gt;辯方：黃有莫大誘因說出對自己有利的事情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃本人卻持有3張「好牌」，有莫大的誘因說出對自己有利的事情。首先黃因作供指證隊友而獲豁免起訴「串謀謀殺」罪，其次他因獲得豁免起訴書，即使在庭上透露曾參與暴動及縱火的行為，亦不會被起訴。第三，他可因此獲得減刑。辯方形容黃作供有如「意識流」，會在不同時間調整字句。當黃被問及有否被警察打，他卻迴避地回答遭對方使用一定程度武力，辯方表示：「以為係警務處長解釋警察點解打人𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員三顧草廬探訪黃質疑他們稱心理輔導是否屬實&quot;&gt;辯方：警員三顧草廬探訪黃、質疑他們稱心理輔導是否屬實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，警員三顧草廬到羈留所拜訪還柙中的黃，警員在作供時表示，黃希望認罪，而在探訪過程中他們著黃通知律師、向他提供心理輔導，以及閒話家常。辯方指：「3個警員加埋唔知有冇10萬蚊人工，閒話家常3個鐘，有冇話畀審計署長聽？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，串謀協議需要一方提出想法，另一方真心同意及了解。根據黃的證供，他無法肯定其他隊員已經答應。辯方又指，即使有海量的 Telegram 訊息，但未能知道他們所說孰真孰假。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警方以小學畢業邏輯推論避彈衣屬嚴&quot;&gt;辯方：警方以「小學畢業邏輯」推論避彈衣屬嚴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，嚴在12月7日於安全屋被捕，警方否認將嚴按在床上。警方在嚴及張銘裕的房間內發現兩件避彈衣，並以「小學畢業邏輯」推論避彈衣屬他們。惟辯方質疑：「點解要擺兩件避彈衣？準備出擊？咁其他 Gear（裝備）呢？」警方亦搜出嚴藏有數十張餐廳及超市現金券，包括：麥當勞、肯德基、唐記包點蒸飯及百佳。辯方質疑證物與案無關，「證案喎！高等法院！喺全香港審案最高級法院，（控方）畀呢啲你哋？」他又指上述現金券，「證明咗啲咩？證明咗佢成日唔喺屋企食飯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備-辯方諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢&quot;&gt;黃斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備 辯方：諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃在群組批評隊員在行動前一日推搪，表示未能協助搬運裝備。辯方質疑：「如果聽日係6月6號，諾曼第登陸，唔知你哋有冇聽過，第二次世界大戰，會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？」辯方另指，黃供稱嚴當晚應其要求留在安全屋陪他，「咁顯示佢哋準備參加大行動咩？」辯方又指，嚴是「冷淡教友」，經常以「陪女友」為由不參與小隊活動，而且嚴並非最積極的隊員。辯方指，嚴「錯在嗰晚喺安全屋」及平日「口多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方形容黃是商業奇才&quot;&gt;辯方形容黃是「商業奇才」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指：「個個都話黃振強唔好，但係天生我才必有用，每個人都有優點，佢好似幾得到女仔歡心。」辯方形容黃是「商業奇才」，不但「喊苦喊忽叫人捐錢」，又找泰國女友為他開戶口，更有「一班傻仔幫佢跑出跑入」，「如果唔係呢個情況，可能佢喺商界有好大作用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黃在行動前一晚沒有在安全屋向隊員講解計劃，反而不斷與「閃燈隊」的 Kristy 對話。黃問 Kristy「有冇得偷走？」，對方回覆「出面凍冰冰」，黃再指「我好熱，暖吓你」。黃其後稱：「你唔驚俾佢睇到你啲 message 咩？佢喺你隔離喎」、「我真係唔想認，但係真係掛住你」。辯方質疑：「咁點解冇時間同隊友講計劃？好懷疑佢聽日係咪去打。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，黃在不同場合有不同面目，是「度身訂造的語言藝術」。他在錄影會面期間表現淡定，在庭上接受主問及盤問時則有其他態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（12日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：彭軍壕是「Police Baby」 其父親為警察、未知警方有否包庇&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y6FOLAC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（8日）踏入第68日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。辯方指「屠龍」隊長黃振強承認刻意不讓隊員知道炸彈及槍手位置的地圖，「唔講 Location，分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」，這導致隊員未能衡量自身安全，亦未能選擇是否參加。至於另一污點證人彭軍壕，辯方指他亦非誠實可靠。辯方解釋，彭一早認罪，其父親是警察，故「有冇包庇我唔知道、唔想講」。辯方又形容他是「Police baby」，「差人見到佢就閒話家常、安撫情緒。三十幾歲人喇！」辯方亦指，彭一直拒絕交出電話密碼，警方卻未有破解並擷取其電話內容，「點解唔用？我唔知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方隊員不知炸彈接近油站分分鐘自己都畀人炸死&quot;&gt;辯方：隊員不知炸彈接近油站、「分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第二被告張銘裕的大律師姚本成進行結案陳詞。辯方指，吳智鴻一方沒有要求「屠龍」成員協助製作引爆器及遙控。辯方又指，即使張曾向群組發送遙控器的照片，但不代表照片是從吳一方收到，因沒有相關紀錄，而且成員經常會將收到的資訊分享並公諸同好。辯方續指，不能因此推論張參與殺警計劃。辯方又指，「屠龍」隊長黃振強隱瞞事實，在隊員背後自行計劃在12月1日使用炸彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另指，對話顯示直至行動前兩日，有隊員仍然問將會執行哪一計劃，這顯示隊員仍然不知道計劃。辯方提到，隊員不知道行動「好大鑊」，而且後果不堪設想，導致「會死好多人」。另外，辯方引述黃承認刻意不讓隊員知道炸彈及槍手位置的地圖，只有黃、吳及槍手知道。辯方指，地圖顯示炸彈地點接近油站，但黃卻隱瞞地圖，「唔講 Location，容乜易連自己都畀人炸埋，分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」，這導致隊員未能衡量自身安全，亦未能選擇是否參加。黃在盤問下承認交由隊員自行判斷，辯方形容其說法是「你死你事」。辯方又指，黃承認未有向隊員交代行動後要離港。辯方質疑，黃沒有為隊員提供後路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強的證供可靠性是零&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強的證供可靠性是零&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，即使張在行動前一晚身處安全屋及管有避彈衣，亦不等於準備要執行大行動，因黃在行動日的凌晨才知悉行動實際內容。黃在視察路線後更沒有向隊員交代情況。辯方最後指，黃的可靠性及信用是零，其證供亦前言不對後語，不能以其證供定任何人的罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭軍壕父親為警察-辯方質疑是police-baby有冇包庇我唔知&quot;&gt;彭軍壕父親為警察 辯方質疑是「Police baby」、「有冇包庇我唔知」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一污點證人彭軍壕，辯方指他亦非誠實可靠的證人。辯方解釋，彭一早認罪，鑑於其父親是警察，故「有冇包庇我唔知道、唔想講」。辯方又形容他是「Police baby」，因此：「差人見到佢就閒話家常、安撫情緒，三十幾歲人喇！」辯方認為，彭的證供原本是用作針對吳，因彭是其「左右手」，但後來吳選擇認罪，因此其證供變為針對本案被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警察未有破解彭電話&quot;&gt;辯方：警察未有破解彭電話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，彭一直拒絕交出電話密碼，警方卻未有破解並擷取其電話內容，「點解唔用？我唔知道。點解電話內容唔畀人知呀？因為有啲嘢唔可以話畀人聽？」辯方總結，沒有證供證明張自11月18日起，在知情下參與串謀，因此唯一合理的決定就是判張無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（9日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

While it is often treated as a luxury, it builds the baseline of defence and enables a whole host of terrestrial capabilities that are essential to modern-day warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is essential to everyday life – think GPS, for example – but its equally vital role in defence is often forgotten. This is partly because, unlike the other domains, space is not immediately obvious or visible. Space is often the invisible enabler and, because it is usually operating smoothly, it is not just taken for granted, but altogether forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Defence has stated that “the vast majority of operations could not be sustained without space capabilities”. This includes several elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPS for navigation and crucial timing signals, used not only for the tracking of troops, but also for guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satellite Communications (SATCOM) for beyond line-of-sight communications (including ships and aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space-enabled intelligence (such as satellite imagery and radar information) that provides surveillance and reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is not altogether new to space and as such owns the legacy system Skynet, which provides secure SATCOM links. In other areas, however, the UK is still in the process of collating its capabilities. For example, the sovereign constellation ISTARI, intended to supplement ISR, was announced at the same time as the Defence Space Strategy in 2022, but the project launch is not planned until 2026. Often, the UK relies on other states for capabilities. For navigation, for example, the UK is entirely reliant on the US for the availability of GPS (the European version, Galileo, is no longer accessible to the UK as a result of Brexit). The UK also depends on commercial providers – for example, Babcock manages and operates the Skynet constellation. With UK sovereign space assets limited, this spells two necessities for the future: resilience, and commercial tie-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-resilience&quot;&gt;The Importance of Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has highlighted the fact that space is by no means off limits in modern conflict: the satellite-enabled internet provider Viasat experienced a cyber-attack on the morning of the invasion in February 2022. Shortly after, Starlink seemed to have been targeted via electromagnetic and cyber means. Since the Russian troops achieved their originally planned positioning, widespread GPS jamming and spoofing has been taking place, also affecting Western weapons systems such as Excalibur, HIMARS and JDAM. It is evident that disruption in the electromagnetic spectrum is to be expected in any future conflict; this could mean the limited availability, if not complete absence, of certain communications systems and navigational data. This means that resilience is required to ensure the availability of crucial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Space is often the invisible enabler and, because it is usually operating smoothly, it is not just taken for granted, but altogether forgotten&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications systems already have a PACE approach – primary, alternative, contingency and emergency – to ensure there are several layers on which to fall back. It would be useful to apply a similar thinking to space systems, especially for positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), where the UK is entirely reliant on the US GPS system. The MoD’s Space Industrial Plan included a proposal for “MoD Time” as a “system of last resort” to ensure that timing signals are available continuously. A further way to increase the resilience of space systems is the use of the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-with-the-commercial-sector&quot;&gt;Working with the Commercial Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial space sector has seen exponential growth over the past decade, in some cases outpacing the developments of sovereign space actors with its innovations. Making use of the commercial sector – by buying into already existing services, rather than procuring a sovereign asset – makes sense. This is happening to some extent already; however, the commercial sector often laments the lack of clarity for requirements and the overbearing bureaucracy of procurement processes, which are often unfit for smaller space companies. Meanwhile, the lack of communication around long-term planning and asset procurement makes it difficult for industry to plan ahead and provide services accordingly. This is despite the promise stated in the Defence Space Strategy that “defence investment through a blend of assured commercial and military grade solutions will continue to increase flexibility, adaptability, tempo, resilience and overall agility of the Armed Forces”. One solution might be found in the communication of a clear strategy that guarantees open channels of communications – similar to the US Space Force Commercial Space Strategy, which further sets out questions of increased risk for commercial companies – for instance, what happens when a commercial asset is attacked while in the service of a government actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Space Strategy outlined the concept of “own, collaborate or access” (OCA): the ways in which space services can be procured. The realisation has already set in at Space Command that perhaps the order of priority of OCA is misguided, and tie-ins with the commercial sector and allies should be prioritised more, similar to the US Space Force approach of “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must”. Clear priorities must be set in accordance with the diversity of space services and assets required – there is no “one size fits all” approach when it comes to the complex and multi-layered system of space defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-detection-of-and-response-to-space-threats&quot;&gt;The Detection of and Response to Space Threats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final consideration is the detection of and response to space threats. While we have observed non-kinetic attacks on satellites through electromagnetic and cyber countermeasures in Ukraine the UK’s competitors and adversaries are capable of further threats – not only kinetic anti-satellite weapons, but also in-orbit surveillance and potential intercepts. Russia demonstrated its capability to kinetically destroy a satellite in 2021, using a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon – a system that China tested back in 2007. Further, Russian satellites have been seen moving close to US military satellites and a joint French-Italian constellation. Whether these missions served the purpose of photographing the sensitive assets, or potentially intercepting their signals, or if they were simply activity intended to cause concern is difficult to tell. However, not all threats to satellites are of a nefarious nature: space debris does not choose its victims and neither do solar flares that can expose satellites to increased radiation and atmospheric drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lack of communication around long-term planning and asset procurement makes it difficult for industry to plan ahead and provide services accordingly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether environmental or nefarious space threats, the UK must be able to keep an eye on its own assets and their surroundings, and be able to respond to potential threats in a timely manner. With the radar facility at RAF Fylingdales, the UK receives access to the space data provided by the US, which host the most comprehensive space data collection available. It is important, however, that the UK continues to invest in its own Space Domain Awareness capabilities to improve its threat assessment processes, enabling fast and apt reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the new UK government sets its sights on a new defence review, it is evident that space can and should not be forgotten – to do so would be to undermine the very foundation on which UK defence capabilities are built. Not investing now in the ability to detect and respond to threats, as well as the resilience of space assets, risks limiting the UK’s ability to act and react in potential conflict scenarios in the future. It is important to invest now in the resilience of systems and guarantee access to systems through tie-ins with allies and commercial partners. NATO, as it builds up its space capabilities through its member states, will continue to be a crucial conduit for Western space collaboration. This, however, should not prevent the UK from looking for further like-minded allies with whom to invest in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, both in the Western and Ukrainian media, there has been a discussion about the problems associated with the recruitment of new military personnel into the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This coverage presents the current situation in a distorted form, which often does not correspond to reality and completely misdirects uninitiated and even partially initiated observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, this concerns the very facts of mobilisation in Ukraine. From the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024, changes to the Law “On Mobilisation Preparation and Mobilisation” were adopted in Ukraine, which were supposed to simplify its procedures, and were accompanied by sharp political debates regarding some of its controversial proposals. In connection with this, much speculation began to appear to the effect that Ukraine allegedly has not mobilised, and therefore is not able to provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the necessary manpower. Such assessments are incorrect and do not reflect the real problems that Ukraine is trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the protection of its sovereignty and territorial integrity – although entrusted to the Armed Forces of Ukraine – is the duty of every citizen. From the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian government decided to impose martial law and declared general mobilisation, along with a ban on men aged 18 to 60 leaving the country. Although general mobilisation was announced, this did not mean that all men were to be drafted into the Armed Forces at the same time. In accordance with procedure, general mobilisation is carried out in several waves: first, the mobilisation of the operational reserve – that is, persons who already had combat experience in the course of repelling Russian aggression in Donbas in the period after 2014 – is carried out; in the second wave, there is a mobilisation of former military personnel who did not have such combat experience; in the third wave, persons who underwent military training while studying at civilian universities are mobilised; and only then are all other persons who do not have age or health restrictions called up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The number of volunteers traditionally falls after the first year of a war, as other European countries have repeatedly experienced before – for example, during the First World War&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, the number of people willing to join the army significantly exceeded the Armed Forces’ needs, and at that time there were queues at enlistment offices. In total, as of July 2022, the Defense Forces of Ukraine numbered almost 1 million people, most of whom were mobilised. Throughout 2022 and 2023, constant mobilisation measures were carried out to replenish losses, replacing the dead and seriously wounded. These measures also did not require excessive efforts; usually, the military commanders simply sent out a significant quantity of summonses and the number of people who appeared for them was sufficient to complete the necessary reserves. Difficulties with the recruitment of new military personnel began to arise only at the end of 2023, after the Ukrainian counteroffensive was choked off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the decrease in the number of those willing to mobilise was the general awareness that the war has acquired a protracted nature – that is, it can and will last for years – as well as the lack of demobilisation mechanisms. In other words, mobilisation began to be perceived as a one-way ticket, where the only way to end service is to die or become disabled. Under such conditions, joining the army entailed a practical rejection of hopes for a normal life, destroyed families, and being forced to leave one’s profession forever. After more than two years of war and without any indication of when soldiers could be demobilised, military service began to be perceived as slavery, and not as a temporary, albeit very difficult duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, this did not change Ukrainians’ perception of the war as an existential threat, nor did it significantly reduce the country’s readiness to resist aggression, but it did reduce the number of people who are willing to join the ranks of the Armed Forces without coercion. There is nothing surprising in this, since the number of volunteers traditionally falls after the first year of a war, as other European countries have repeatedly experienced before – for example, during the First World War. With the decrease in the number of volunteers, it became clear that the system of recruiting and even registering conscripts in Ukraine was working extremely unsatisfactorily, and enlistment officers often do not even have a clear idea about where exactly potential recruits live. Mobilisation began to demand certain efforts from the government for which it was not ready, and experiments with the use of coercion in mobilisation were not always successful. The public debate about the problems facing the government has not been very helpful either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has become a pattern for Ukraine, modern technology came to the aid of the government. Understanding the military’s inability to form a single system of accounting for conscripts, the Ministry of Defense launched the mobile application “Reserve+”, in which every man could update data about his location, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as clarify his military accounting specialty, rank and state of health. In the first days of the application’s operation, more than a million reservists were registered; as of the beginning of July 2024, more than 2 million people had been registered in “Reserve+”. Taking into account the fact that before the occupation of the south of Ukraine – where several million Ukrainians live – the total number of people suitable for military service was about 6 million, as well as the fact that Reserve+ is not the only system for joining the reserve and works in parallel with the usual appeal to the enlistment offices, such results are more than satisfactory. It can be hoped that by the end of August 2024, the vast majority of reservists will be registered on the mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It must be recognised that in today’s highly mechanised and hi-tech war environment, manpower without weapons and military equipment has no meaning&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the positive prospects of such an initiative, which has significantly improved the situation with regard to mobilisation by immediately finding several million potential soldiers, it is not able to solve the most fundamental shortcoming. The new Law “On Mobilisation Training and Mobilisation” did not provide an answer to the question of when demobilisation should take place and how many years a mobilised person should serve, which in the conditions of a protracted war creates unnecessary uncertainty and reduces motivation to join the army. Solving this problem is possible by changing approaches to the composition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – namely, increasing the total number of military professionals who must sign three-, five- and seven-year contracts, as well as establishing a maximum limit of service for those who are mobilised, which could be three years. Ukraine had such an experience in 2015–2016, when demobilisation and replacement of mobilised persons by professionals took place while maintaining the total strength of the Armed Forces. At that time, a significant number of those who had been mobilised signed contracts and continued to serve. In Russia, where the government has tried to avoid an unpopular mobilisation, recruitment into the Armed Forces is largely done through individuals signing short-term – even one-year – contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, one must recognise that in today’s highly mechanised and hi-tech war environment, manpower without weapons and military equipment has no meaning. Ukraine definitely needs to increase the manpower of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and replenish losses, and initiatives such as “Reserve+” demonstrate that it is capable of doing this. However, the combat effectiveness of units depends not only on their number, but also on the level of provision of military equipment. There are still more than 30 territorial defence brigades in the Armed Forces, armed only with small arms and mortars, although they could be transformed into full-fledged mechanised brigades if they were to be provided with armoured vehicles, artillery, electronic warfare equipment and so on. The insufficient amount of weapons and military equipment is also a problem for regular brigades. For example, the 14 reserve brigades created by Ukraine cannot be used in combat zones due to the delay in the delivery of equipment that was promised by partners. Thus, success depends in the end not only on the improvement of Ukrainian recruiting, but also on the quality of Western logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security situation in Europe is rapidly worsening, with several concurrent trends making direct conflict with Russia before the end of the 2020s a serious risk. In conjunction with serious financial constraints, this will likely force the new UK government to make major course correction decisions in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most pressing concern is that Ukraine is increasingly struggling to contain slow but steady Russian advances on multiple parts of the frontlines, especially near Pokrovsk. The situation can still be salvaged, but doing so will require increased support over a sustained period from the UK and other allies, as well as changes on the Ukrainian side to reform mobilisation and training. Second, the US is increasingly militarily overstretched and unable to defeat aggression by China and Russia at the same time. Third, a potential second Trump presidency would likely weaken the political credibility of US security guarantees to NATO. Fourth, Russia’s economy is now on a war footing, and is producing large quantities of equipment, ammunition and vehicles, alongside a sustained mobilisation and training rate which has seen its forces in Ukraine grow to over 470,000 by early 2024. By contrast, the UK’s own stockpiles of ammunition, equipment and trained personnel have been left dangerously hollowed out by decades of underinvestment relative to political ambitions. Worse, the situation is similar in many other European countries, despite notable exceptions such as Finland and Poland – so relying on allies to fill the gaps is not a credible strategy in key capability areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine is defeated either in part or in full, and/or if the US is perceived as either unable or unwilling to come to Europe’s defence at scale, then there is a serious risk that Russia might invade part of a NATO member state’s territory within the next 3-5 years. Such aggression would likely be intended to trigger an Article V call from a member state over a limited amount of territory, gambling that European states could be deterred from taking the risk of going to war to eject Russian troops by force. The incentive for Russia to take such a gamble if it thinks it can get away without a coherent military response from Europe is huge, since such an outcome would fatally undermine the credibility of collective defence through NATO on which the whole European security architecture is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, defence may not have been a key vote-winner at the last election, but the scale and potential imminence of the threat to European security from Russia means that this government may be tested on the readiness of the UK’s defences within the term of this Parliament in a way that has not been seen since the Falklands War. Being perceived as having failed such a test in the face of Russian aggression is one of the few foreseeable scenarios that could all-but-guarantee a defeat at the next election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is very significant combat potential that could be rapidly unlocked with the right investments in core aircraft fleets that the RAF and Royal Navy already have&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, investing in regenerating the combat power of the UK’s existing combat aircraft fleets offers a route to rapid increases in meaningful combat capabilities that Russia would have to take significant account of in any decision to risk war with NATO. Russian military strategists and leaders alike rightly fear NATO airpower, because they understand that the Russian Army would be rapidly and decisively destroyed by multirole fighters and attack helicopters if NATO was able to gain air superiority over a contested area. The Russian Army is not some insurgent force that can try to hide from air strikes among the civilian population; to pose a threat it must deploy its tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery, logistics and electronic warfare equipment in the field and keep them there. If air superiority can be gained and exploited, Europe’s relatively large numbers of fourth-generation jets and helicopters could efficiently conduct close air support and interdiction missions to rapidly destroy the Russian Army in any contested territory. While the specialised standoff weapons needed to gain air superiority are very expensive, direct-attack munitions such as Paveway and JDAM series bombs cost only a few tens of thousands of pounds per weapon, and each fighter can use them to destroy multiple Russian vehicles per sortie once air superiority is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat is why Russia has invested so much resource and effort in developing its formidable ground-based air defence (GBAD) network. Currently, only the US has the capacity to conduct a full suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) campaign against that GBAD network, so Europe on its own would struggle to win air superiority against Russian forces. However, these GBAD systems are finite, have suffered some attrition in Ukraine already and have known weaknesses. They also represent a target set that NATO Air Command fundamentally understands how to defeat in technical and operational terms. The problem is not that solutions are not available, but rather that no European member states have yet invested in the necessary combination of suitable aircraft, weapons, specialist training and enablers, although some are making progress in this area. As one of the leading European NATO members, the UK can and should help plug this gap. Doing so would help rapidly reestablish Europe’s ability to fight for, win and exploit air superiority in a way that would mean Russia would be highly unlikely to risk a direct military clash. Achieving the same deterrent effect with UK land forces or maritime assets is almost certainly impossible, at least this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the British Army, which has struggled to effectively design and procure replacement vehicles for its Warfighting Division after configuring for counterinsurgency, the RAF has already been largely recapitalised with a balanced mix of relatively modern platforms across all its core mission sets. In a somewhat ironic twist, the slow nature of defence procurement programmes – especially in the air domain – now makes it easier to adapt the RAF to the new Russian threat paradigm. This is because many RAF aircraft and weapons systems were originally designed for Cold War scenarios against Russia’s currently deployed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Typhoon FGR.4 was designed specifically to overmatch Russian “Flanker” family fighters in air-to-air combat, especially using the very long-range European Meteor air-to-air missile, which was also designed with the same threats in mind. In addition, it is a capable close-air-support and long-range cruise missile launch asset. Its primary weakness is that as a multirole aircraft that forms the bulk of UK combat air capability, the fleet is constantly deployed all over the world for a range of operations, international exercises and standing commitments. Pilots also fly significantly less than they did a decade ago, and much of the flying that they do get is on long transits or patrols as part of overseas deployments that provide little training value for high-intensity mission sets. With so many mission sets to train to, even modernised and well-employed synthetic training in the simulator cannot allow the Typhoon crews to be adequately trained and ready across the board with such a task load. To regain the very high levels of capability in the air-to-air domain that they had in the mid-to-late 2010s, the Typhoon force needs additional financial and maintenance resources to increase core flying training hours; additional stocks of AIM-132 ASRAAM, AIM-120 ARMAAM and Meteor air to air missiles; and above all a reduction in discretionary overseas activity to allow the Force to focus on training for high-intensity mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the F-35B flown by the RAF and Royal Navy was designed specifically to destroy Russian GBAD networks. It features a combination of stealth, onboard electronic attack capabilities and unmatched sensors and software that can rapidly identify, locate and designate hostile radars for attacks. Despite drawbacks including high operating costs, and delays to new deliveries and retrofit schedules for important TR3 hardware and software upgrades within the programme, in the air the aircraft already provides genuinely unmatched combat capability against high-end Russian threats. The author has seen both from the ground and from the cockpit during NATO exercises how even a few F-35s can greatly enhance the survivability and lethality of the fourth-generation fighters around them by providing electronic attack support and real-time situational awareness on threats, as well as using their own limited internal weapons capacity to destroy particularly serious threats. However, the RAF/RN F-35B fleet is very small, with only 34 aircraft at the time of writing, and 48 due to be in service by the end of 2025. Royal Navy Carrier Strike Group deployments also take the bulk of the operational fleet far from the UK for months at a time every few years. Plans were at an advanced stage under the previous government to purchase 27 additional F-35Bs, but with delivery spread out over dates up until 2033. The UK has a high level of dependency on the F-35 not only for the Carrier Strike Group, but also as an essential force multiplier and SEAD/DEAD asset for the RAF against Russia in Europe, and for the British Army to provide targeting data for its planned long-range precision strike assets. Therefore, since the fleet is manifestly too small to meet the many requirements of it, there is a strong argument for the planned additional tranche of aircraft to be acquired as fast as possible, in order to deliver increased capacity in the mid-to-late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest limitation for the UK’s F-35Bs at present, however, is the lack of suitable weapons. For ground attack the fleet only has Paveway IV free-fall bombs, which are totally unsuitable for use against high-end Russian GBAD systems or targets protected by them. No other F-35 operator has such illogically constrained air-to-ground weapons options, and the SDR should prioritise fixing this deficit as fast as possible. The UK has developed the MBDA SPEAR 3 missile, designed specifically to work with the F-35’s sensor suite to reliably destroy Russian air defence targets from safe stand-off ranges even when those targets have ceased emitting and are repositioning. It is an almost ideal weapon to allow UK F-35s to address the core challenge preventing European NATO forces from gaining air superiority over a Russian force by destroying their GBAD network. However, in classic UK fashion a combination of very small order quantities, slow development and disagreements between industry and the Ministry of Defence has led to a very high cost-per-weapon. Large-scale orders in exchange for aggressive investment by MBDA in speeding up deliveries and increasing production capacity should be explored. Multinational production deals with allies should also be explored, since the weapon is not only ideal for the F-35 but could also provide significant SEAD/DEAD capabilities for Typhoon and potentially other fourth-generation jets due to its powered standoff range. In the interim, the UK should procure an urgent stopgap order of the US-made GBU-53/B. This is a relatively affordable glide bomb with an active millimetric radar seeker for terminal guidance against hostile vehicles like SAM systems, and is available quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The E-7A Wedgetail airborne warning and control system is ideally suited for providing early detection and wide-area tracking of incoming Russian cruise missiles fired from bombers in the Arctic. However, too few have been ordered to guarantee one on station for the medium term – a task which requires at least four and ideally five, rather than the three on order. The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is the finest airborne anti-submarine asset available today, and is already operated by the UK’s most important allies in the task of tracking Russian submarines in the North Atlantic and the Arctic – the US and Norway. The RC-135W Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft, meanwhile, has been instrumental in collecting vital signals and electronic intelligence on Russian forces in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is very significant combat potential that could be rapidly unlocked with the right investments in core aircraft fleets that the RAF and Royal Navy already have. The fleets are smaller than they would ideally be, almost across the board, but the more urgent problem is a lack of sufficient weapons stocks to fulfil the RAF’s key potential combat roles within NATO against Russia in a conflict. By investing urgently in procuring significantly increased numbers of key weapon types, increased spares and maintenance capacity to enable more flying hours and focusing training time on core high-intensity mission sets, the combat power of the RAF in a NATO context could be greatly enhanced in just a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The SDR should prioritise investment in weapons, maintenance capacity and high-end training to regenerate the combat power of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm as part of NATO over the coming years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, combat capability is not the only consideration for the government when looking at balance of investment choices. There will be a natural desire to invest in long-term programmes that bring value to the UK defence industry, international partnerships and trade. The most obvious and high-profile of these is the Global Combat Aircraft Programme (GCAP) with Japan and Italy. Perhaps the defining political choice of this SDR will be the degree to which the government invests limited resources in these long-term projects as opposed to plugging the capability gaps in the current force to enable it to play a core role in defending NATO against Russian aggression this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to those for whom long-term ambitions such as GCAP or AUKUS submarines are the top priority, it is worth stressing that those programmes are themselves dependent on avoiding a wider war with Russia in Europe this decade. Unless swiftly and decisively repelled, a Russian attack on NATO territory would see a scramble to desperately shore up national defences with whatever was immediately or rapidly available, coupled with serious economic destabilisation. Such an outcome would almost certainly spell disaster for long-term industrial programmes like GCAP that aim to deliver capability in the mid-to-late 2030s. Furthermore, if the UK’s current fast jet fleets fail to perform as they should against the Russian threat they were designed to fight due to inadequate weapons and core flying training resources, it would undermine the political narratives in the UK and elsewhere about the unique edge that such combat aircraft supposedly bring to defending countries against aggression. That too could be devastating for the long-term prospects of the UK’s combat aircraft industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR should prioritise investment in weapons, maintenance capacity and high-end training to regenerate the combat power of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm as part of NATO over the coming years. The UK will then be able to look to future programmes from a position of much greater strength and security against the enduring belligerence of Russia and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：黃振強未經隊員同意下擅自決定配合行動、其他人「被賣豬仔」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xt91aVU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（7日）踏入第67日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。審訊期間，「屠龍」隊長黃振強供稱答應吳智鴻會配合其用槍及炸彈行動，惟辯方指，黃承認事前沒有問過隊員，而隊員亦不知道行動內容，更無同意過會配合行動。辯方強調，黃未經「屠龍」隊員同意下擅自決定，導致其他隊員「被拉落水」及「被賣豬仔」。辯方亦指，黃振強並非「事事都代表屠龍」，而他個人的串謀，不等於其他隊員亦有參與其中。辯方又強調，不能對「勇武派」有偏見：「勇武唔係等於想殺差人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方屠龍隊長黃振強無向隊員解釋計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：「屠龍」隊長黃振強無向隊員解釋計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第二被告張銘裕的大律師姚本成進行結案陳詞。辯方表示，控方指控3項與張有關的事件，即張參與9月台灣軍訓、於10月1日向吳索槍及11月16日到西貢試槍，均並非串謀一部分。辯方解釋，「屠龍」的隊長黃振強於11月18日才加入吳智鴻的串謀協議，但黃從沒有向張清楚解釋12.8計劃，因此張沒有可能參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強自把自為代表屠龍答應配合計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強自把自為代表「屠龍」答應配合計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，張並不知道吳一方的計劃牽涉槍及炸彈，亦不知道黃振強自把自為代表「屠龍」答應配合。張的立場是不會親手用槍及炸彈。辯方續指，即使黃表示在12月7日在安全屋已向隊員解釋計劃，但說法並不可信。而張曾於11月27日在群組發送引爆器片段，辯方指這是資訊分享，與行動部署無關。辯方又指，3名從犯證人有作供動機，因此處理他們的證供時要小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃承認隊員不知道計劃內容&quot;&gt;辯方：黃承認隊員不知道計劃內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就首名作供的污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強，辯方逐一指出其證供有問題之處。根據黃與「閃燈隊」Kristy 在12月3日的對話中，以及他接受盤問時的說法，黃承認隊員當時不知道計劃內容，亦承認只有自己想殺警察。黃另承認隊員之間沒有共識於12月8日要執行哪一計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方勇武派不代表殺人犯不能有偏見&quot;&gt;辯方：勇武派不代表殺人犯、不能有偏見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黃另承認12月7日前，不肯定有否與隊員談及計劃，亦不肯定他們是否知悉。辯方指出，於行動前一日、即12月8日的凌晨，黃沒有向隊員解釋計劃。辯方強調不能對「勇武派」有偏見：「勇武唔係等於想殺差人」、「勇武唔代表殺人犯」，仇恨警察亦不等於要殺警。辯方又指，不能因為作為主犯的黃振強認罪，而牽連其他「屠龍」成員，「香港沒有連坐法，唔係一個人犯罪，全部都有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃自告奮勇做主導代表其他成員&quot;&gt;辯方：黃自告奮勇做主導、代表其他成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，「屠龍」實際上是很鬆散的組織，雖然黃自認隊長，但李家田卻指無人承認過黃是隊長。辯方指，黃是一個「無認受性、無牙力」的隊長，隊員不一定要跟隨隊長的意見，同時可以選擇不參與示威活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，黃經常「自告奮勇做主導」，在沒有授權之下代表屠龍行事及面對其他人，例如自行管理及使用資金、以「屠龍」名義受訪。黃亦以「屠龍」名義利己，包括賭錢及還債。辯方指，黃在短短3個月內突然獲得過百萬，但他只是21歲的年青人，「畀啲錢浸死，咁多錢包圍住佢，唔壞都變壞。」而隊員並不知道黃手上有大量金錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃甚少向隊員交代部分人被賣豬仔&quot;&gt;辯方：黃甚少向隊員交代、部分人被「賣豬仔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃亦承認通常與「軍師」計劃行動，甚少向隊員交代，只著隊員到時候聽從其指揮。辯方指，這情況同樣適用在12.8計劃，「隊員係唔知佢搞邊科」、「畀人賣豬仔」、「畀佢點到頭都暈」。辯方舉出黃未經授權擅自行事的例子，包括向吳建議12月1日在尖沙咀用槍及炸彈、於12月6日擅自向吳索槍。辯方引述李家田證供，指小隊成員沒有授權黃代表「屠龍」與吳一方商討或交涉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃承認隊員沒有同意過配合用槍炸彈計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：黃承認隊員沒有同意過配合用槍炸彈計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小隊曾經舉行過兩次會議，於11月17日的大鴻輝會議，及11月23日的三陂坊會議，前者有成員表示：「人哋用槍人哋嘅事，用槍殺警察咪搞我」，後者則是成員之間達成共識不會用槍及炸彈殺警。黃亦承認成員沒有同意過配合吳一方的用槍及炸彈計劃。辯方引述黃與「閃燈隊」Kristy 的對話，黃承認其他隊員不想殺警，只有黃自己想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方張銘裕出發點是唔會殺差人&quot;&gt;辯方：張銘裕出發點是「唔會殺差人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方指控張的3項事件，辯方認為不屬串謀協議部分。第一是參與台灣軍訓，辯方指軍訓在9月進行，當時「屠龍」尚未加入串謀協議，而且黃承認當時未知道有12.8計劃，亦無附加條件例如之後要用槍殺警，因此與控罪無關。辯方補充，張並不認識吳智鴻，只是在軍訓前兩人有聯絡，惟吳「好狼」地提出「玩暗殺狗」，張馬上回覆自己未必是適合的人選。辯方指，這顯示張的出發點是「唔會殺差人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方張因一時憤怒提出索槍其後不了了之&quot;&gt;辯方：張因一時憤怒提出索槍，其後不了了之&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二，是控方指張於10月1日向吳索取手槍一事，辯方指關注點是為何要索槍，並指僅屬憤怒下的情緒反應。辯方指，黃振強於作供時承認10月1日有示威者遭警方以真槍射傷後，勇武派包括「屠龍」都很憤怒，稱「個個都話要擸架生」。辯方總結，張因為一時激動而索槍，但其後不了了之，沒有證據顯示他改變立場要殺警。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第三，是張於11月到西貢行山試槍，辯方指張「臨時畀人拉夫入去」參與，黃在事件前早一晚才「臨急臨忙」找他代替。辯方強調，「屠龍」參與行山試槍並非希望參與串謀，目的只是「睇吓佢哋係咪吹水」，以證實吳一方是否管有槍械炸彈。辯方又指，吳之所以在試槍後將手槍交李家田，而非張銘裕，是因吳知道張不想用槍，因此不可信賴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃未經隊員同意下擅自決定&quot;&gt;辯方：黃未經隊員同意下擅自決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃供稱，11月18日，他與吳在觀塘康寧道球場見面，吳表示正預備槍械及炸藥，行動期間「屠龍」會負責引警方，黃回應會配合吳的行動。在盤問下，黃承認答應前沒有問過隊員，而隊員亦無同意過配合行動，但黃相信與隊員的共識一致。辯方強調，黃在未經「屠龍」隊員的同意下，自行作決定，即「behind members’ back」，導致其他隊員「被拉落水」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指黃亦「屠龍」亦沒有共識如何使用「20 kg」炸彈，因此黃稱「我哋 Team 諗好點用」是謊言。辯方最後強調，黃振強並非「事事都代表屠龍」，同時指他個人的串謀，不等於其他隊員亦有參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（8日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指「屠龍」隊長黃振強是「騙子」、為減刑而「作故仔」牽連隊友&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NRS8FEC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（6日）踏入第66日審訊。辯方開始結案陳詞，指作為污點證人的「屠龍」隊長黃振強，其證供不盡不實，而且「呃隊友、係欺騙感情嘅騙子、一個大話冚另一個大話」，而就他私吞資金賭錢方面亦「鐵證如山」。辯方指黃利用隊友以獲得報酬，惟隊友一直被蒙在鼓裡，對計劃內容不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方需肯定被告知道最終目的&quot;&gt;辯方：需肯定被告知道最終目的&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表首被告張俊富的大律師李國輔進行結案陳詞。他指控方需要舉證至毫無合理疑點，才可證明被告犯罪，而「懷疑」、「可能」、「應該係」、「好似」等均不屬完全肯定的舉證標準。辯方強調，就串謀控罪，參與者需要知道最終非法目的；若陪審團未能肯定張俊富知道串謀的最終目的，則要裁定罪名不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方行動不牽涉對無辜公眾造成傷害&quot;&gt;辯方：行動不牽涉對無辜公眾造成傷害&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指控方在開案陳詞階段，曾表示炸彈會導致非警務人員受傷，因此辯方誤會「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的對象只涉公眾，但不牽涉警員，後來他作出澄清。辯方強調，本案不會牽涉對公眾人士造成傷害，他引述污點證人彭軍壕的證供指，吳智鴻表示預計爆炸時不會有其他「唔關事」的人。以另一證人蘇緯軒的理解，行動執行時不會傷及無辜。就「串謀謀殺」罪，辯方強調控方必須有證據證明被告是有意圖殺警員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方並指，不能因張管有彈叉等攻擊性武器，而推論其犯案傾向性較高；即使他有參與「屠龍」的示威，亦不代表他有參與本案的計劃。對於控方指考慮2019年背景後，本案串謀呼之欲出，辯方表示：「我不敢苟同。」他提醒陪審團，絕不能夠考慮案發時的社會氛圍後，就裁定被告必然知道及參與計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強利用隊友-且是感情騙子&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強利用隊友 且是「感情騙子」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就首名作供的污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強，辯方指黃「言行不一、講一套做一套、呃隊友、係欺騙感情嘅騙子」。辯方又指，黃會利用隊友並隱瞞對方，「係一個機會主義者」，而張俊富或被蒙在鼓裡及被利用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃證供不盡不實屢砌詞狡辯&quot;&gt;辯方：黃證供不盡不實、屢砌詞狡辯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦指，黃的證供不盡不實、充滿疑點，他作供時經常砌詞狡辯、閃縮迴避，「一個大話冚另一個大話。」在盤問階段，黃被發現用小隊資金賭錢，控方在結案時一度問：「係咪可以用貪威識食、爛賭嚟形容？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃為獲更多減刑而作故仔牽連其他人&quot;&gt;辯方：黃為獲更多減刑而「作故仔」牽連其他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，認罪被告作為控方證人，會獲得比一般認罪較多的減刑折扣。前者可獲五成折扣，後者則僅三分一，故辯方認為黃作供存在誘因。辯方續指，黃為「攞著數」而「作故仔、加鹽加醋、故弄玄虛」，把不相關的人牽連在內，並剪裁事實令其他被告入罪。辯方建議，陪審團處理黃的證供時要小心。辯方又指，黃獲得豁免起訴書，他毋須承擔犯法行為，因此需考慮他會否作出虛假及誤導的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方私吞資金賭錢鐵證如山&quot;&gt;辯方：私吞資金賭錢「鐵證如山」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黃起初否認有賭錢習慣，後來在辯方展示馬會投注紀錄後，黃才承認有用小隊資金賭錢。辯方強調，黃私吞資金賭錢屬「鐵證如山」。他在社會運動期間的5個月，共賭錢約170次，總共48萬，最大一次的投注金額為5萬元。對於黃多次表示「唔記得」及「無印象」，辯方質疑他是砌詞狡辯，「相唔相信佢會唔記得自己賭錢，呢個唔係咁好嘅行為呢？」辯方補充，如非有馬會紀錄，「相信真相一定石沉大海。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃以誇張失實說法作招徠籌錢&quot;&gt;辯方：黃以誇張失實說法作招徠籌錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述「育龍」頻道的訊息，內容提及「絕非帶有偷呃拐騙目的」，但黃實際上將錢自用，更隱瞞隊友及捐款者，例如到泰國進行「點到即止嘅嫖妓」，以滿足一己私欲。另外，「育龍」頻道曾發訊息表示「公會目標集齊30粒龍心」，黃承認意思指殺害30名警察。辯方指他以誇張失實的說法作招徠，以籌集更多金錢。辯方又指，黃聲稱以10萬元買100支汽油彈，平均每支1,000元。辯方質疑，黃的說法誇張，他利用差價將資金據為己有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃漠視隊員共識私下索取手槍&quot;&gt;辯方：黃漠視隊員共識、私下索取手槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指黃知道屠龍成員反對親手使用炸彈及槍，仍漠視隊員之間的共識，瞞着隊友向吳智鴻索取手槍。辯方指，吳明知隊友反對仍一意孤行，由此可見吳亦會隱瞞12.8計劃，「越少人知，就越少人阻止。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃提出第二次到台灣，只屬軍訓，並非他所指的「走佬 Plan」。辯方解釋，黃只打算獨自離港，若然隊員清楚事態如此嚴重，則「冇可能佢哋唔一齊走」。辯方認為，黃「賣隊友豬仔」，利用完他們後「自己走先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃淡化罪責用謊言保障自己&quot;&gt;辯方：黃淡化罪責、用謊言保障自己&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃在錄影會面表示，訛稱自己受傷而缺席行山試槍，又指自己不想接觸槍械，只是為了獲得吳的百多萬而投其所好。但他卻在庭上解釋，回答警方問題時狀態欠佳、記憶混亂。辯方認為，黃是在淡化自己罪責、混淆視聽。辯方又指，黃可能捏造被警方毆打的說法，不斷用謊言保障自己，這反映其證供不盡不實，若依賴他的證供會很危險。辯方亦提醒，不能單憑訊息字面推論，張必然對串謀有認知及參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方20-kg不一定指炸彈可指煙花炮仗&quot;&gt;辯方：「20 kg」不一定指炸彈，可指煙花炮仗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方曾表明，各被告在群組提及的「20 kg」是指吳一方的炸彈。但辯方認為，「20 kg」可以是指煙花炮仗，因黃曾與隊員分享用煙花炮仗嚇公安的片段。辯方又指，只有黃及「軍師」知道用槍及炸彈的計劃，其他成員並不知道。黃只是誇大其他隊員的參與性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，在11月25日的飯局並非全數成員出席，他質疑黃會否在不齊人的情況下講述計劃。辯方提醒，不能單憑訊息對話而「斷章取義」，例如成員談及要用避彈衣，但不代表在真槍情況下才要使用。辯方指，張沒有參與大部份「滅龍」群組的討論，亦不能肯定他閱畢所有訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方隊員被蒙在鼓裡不知實際計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：隊員被蒙在鼓裡、不知實際計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃曾稱行動前一日、即12月7日，在安全屋向隊員講述行動。惟辯方指，據監視警員所見，當時亦有陌生女子進入大廈，因此質疑黃會否在有外人的情況下，向隊員講解行動。辯方又質疑，黃所說的行動版本沒有彭所稱般詳細，黃沒有提及「屠龍」要掩護吳，並讓他擺放炸彈。因此對於計劃細節，張被蒙在鼓裡，而且他不會在完全不知情，兼不顧自身安全之下參與計劃，「係咪咁兒戲？可以參加咁大咁恐怖嘅活動？」辯方指，黃之所以不將計劃告知其他成員，實際上是知道成員會打斷計劃，並妨礙他在事成後到台灣獲取100萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，黃作供不盡不實、大話連篇，而且充滿疑點，因此懇請陪審團將疑點利益歸於被告，並緊記「寧縱毋枉」，裁定控方未能在毫無合理疑點下證明張參與串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（7日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on 24 July on the heels of reports that Turkey and a handful of European states are reconsidering their engagement with Syria. The EU suspended relations with Damascus in 2011 following the outbreak of the civil war, but in late July eight EU foreign ministers, including those of Italy and Austria, called on the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell to “review and assess” the bloc’s approach to Syria after 13 years of conflict. On 25 July, Italy became the first G7 member to announce it would restore diplomatic relations with Syria. This move signifies a shift that echoes the Arab world’s normalisation of Assad last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 7 July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would extend an invitation to Assad “any time” for possible talks to restore relations. This set off speculation about Assad’s potential response and any preconditions he might insist upon before agreeing to such talks. Previous attempts at diplomacy between the Turkish, Syrian and Russian defence ministers in December 2022 did not result in policy convergence. Syria experts have suggested that low levels of engagement between intelligence and security officials date back to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a major breakthrough in Turkey–Syria ties is unlikely, one explanation for the abrupt interest in restoring ties with Assad is that Turkey is seeking to navigate new rules of engagement ahead of a scenario where the US withdraws its remaining 900 or so troops that are currently stationed in northeastern Syria, a step that is likely to be expedited in the event of a Trump win in the November US presidential election. But rising regional tensions following a series of high-profile assassinations in Lebanon and Iran mean that a US withdrawal is not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria was readmitted to the Arab League in May last year, but despite this regional pivot on Assad, US and European policy on Syria has remained stagnant, with little indication of what a long-term strategy would look like. There are unquestionably economic incentives that seem to justify a reset. War-torn Syria represents an opportunity for reconstruction and investment, and international actors are recognising that humanitarian funding and efforts require engagement with Assad’s government to have sustained impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite external support from Russia and Iran, Damascus still controls only 70% of Syrian territory. Turkey controls a sizeable area including towns such as al-Bab, Azaz, Jarabulus, Rajo, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The Syrian Democratic Forces control most of the northeast, including Hasaka governorate as well as areas in Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-mediation-over-turkey-syria-talks&quot;&gt;Russia’s Mediation over Turkey-Syria Talks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, a steadfast ally of Assad, has been pushing for normalisation as part of its broader strategy to consolidate its influence in the Middle East. Despite overarching agreement on the need to stabilise Syria, there is scepticism on all sides. In 2019, Russia pledged to clear a 30-km strip along the Turkish-Syrian border from the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Syrian Kurdish militia that Turkey considers to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). While Ankara has been irritated by Russia’s ongoing engagement with the YPG since then, it continues to lobby Putin to seek concessions from Assad given its frustration that the US will not abandon its support of the YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces. Moscow is likely weighing up whether Turkey, a NATO member, may succumb to US pressure to prevent Russian companies from evading Western sanctions through Turkey. Unconfirmed reports suggest that in anticipation of talks, Turkey and Russia are considering restarting joint patrols on the M4 highway which runs from eastern Aleppo to western Latakia via Idlib through areas controlled by the Syrian opposition. Patrols had stalled for four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The presence of Syrian refugees in Turkey has become a contentious issue, with many in the opposition and the public as a whole perceiving them as unfair beneficiaries of state aid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 12 July, Iraq’s Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein stated that Baghdad may host the first meeting between Erdogan and Assad in over a decade. Holding the initial talks in Iraq would undoubtedly open them up to meddling and pressure from Iran, but also reflects Iraq’s own interest in stability along the Turkey–Syria border, which has implications for the Kurdistan Region of Iraq due to PKK strongholds there that are targeted by Turkish military strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-interests-driving-turkeysyria-normalisation&quot;&gt;Strategic Interests Driving Turkey–Syria Normalisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erdogan’s governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) performed poorly in the 31 March local elections, losing most larger cities to the secular opposition Republican People’s Party. The AKP attributed the loss mainly to rising public anger about the 3.6 million Syrian refugees residing in Turkey, as well as what was seen by its core constituency as a weak response to Israel’s military action against Palestinian civilians in Gaza following the 7 October Hamas attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of Syrian refugees in Turkey has become a contentious issue, with many in the opposition and the public as a whole perceiving them as unfair beneficiaries of state aid. Concerns are also growing over socioeconomic and demographic changes, with far-right nationalists warning of an “Arabisation” of Turkish society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his brutal crackdown on civilians throughout the civil war and alleged war crimes, the fact that Assad has so far defied calls for a political transition agreement likely gives him an impression of strength vis-à-vis Turkey. The gap between the military, political and strategic objectives pursued by Ankara and Damascus that are driving normalisation is significant, however, and complicates efforts to identify common ground for negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Turkey’s role in the historic US–Russia prisoner swap deal revealed on 1 August is an indication of Ankara’s influential broker role in the region, Erdogan will justify meeting Assad as necessary to address chronic disputes between the neighbouring states. If a meeting is to take place – as early as this month according to some Syria experts – it is likely that Erdogan and Assad will agree on a preliminary but low-stakes framework of principles as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several longstanding public demands voiced by Ankara and Damascus provide clues as to the negotiating positions of each side. Damascus seeks the withdrawal of Turkish Armed Forces outposts and troops in northern Syria, which were installed during successive military operations: Operation Euphrates Shield (2016), Operation Olive Branch (2018), Operation Peace Spring (2019), and Operation Claw-Sword (including targets in northern Iraq, 2022). Damascus favours a return to the status quo that prevailed before 2011 and wants Turkey to lay out a timeline to withdraw militarily from the areas it controls. But regime forces are too weak to unilaterally control northwestern Syria, and lack sufficient sustained territorial control to alter the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara and Damascus agree that the Syrian Kurdish movement is a source of instability, but differ in their threat and opportunity perceptions. Turkey sees the PKK-YPG as an existential threat that justifies its military presence on counterterrorism and stabilisation grounds. Ankara argues that its departure will consolidate PKK-linked groups and their military, administrative and political structures in northern Syria. Damascus appears unwilling to entertain a military option to root out the group and sees the Kurds as valuable leverage against Turkey—as it has done for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other demands likely raised by Damascus include the transfer of border crossings between Syria and Turkey that are under opposition control to regime forces; that Ankara bans Syrian opposition groups from operating inside Turkey and hands over wanted dissidents to the regime; and that Ankara pressures the US to hasten its troop withdrawal from northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more likely is that through a process of step-by-step talks, Turkey may greenlight a phased confidence-building approach that could lead it to scale back its support for certain opposition and jihadi groups in Idlib and opposition-held areas through security agreements with Damascus. Turkey backs the opposition Syrian National Army, an umbrella coalition of armed Syrian opposition groups (previously known as the Free Syrian Army). The possibility of developing a coordination mechanism for joint patrols with Syrian regime forces and opening up crossing points to facilitate trade between regime and Turkish-held areas and allow food and basic supplies to reach the civilian population are also on the table. Seen as steps to open up the north to regime control and exploitation, such measures are opposed by the Syrian opposition, with Turkey accused of betrayal. In a sign of the volatility of local opposition-held areas in the north, anti-Turkey protests broke out in early July in Afrin and Jarablus as some local factions fear the repercussions of any deal Erdogan may make with Assad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How future normalisation may impact Syria’s northern Idlib province is difficult to predict, with few options that Ankara and Damascus find mutually palatable. The area is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a coalition of Islamist Sunni anti-government armed groups affiliated with Al-Qa’ida that has been listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU and the UN. Turkey has a complex relationship with HTS but will try to use its leverage over the group as a bargaining chip with Damascus. At the same time, a Russian-backed regime offensive against Idlib risks instability and a major outflow of Syrian refugees that will put pressure on the Turkish border, a scenario Ankara is desperate to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara’s proposed blueprint for normalisation is rumoured to include provisions for Assad to agree to the repatriation and resettlement of around 2 million Syrians. A strategy to empower the Syrian state’s capacity to absorb the en masse return of Syrians has also been defended by European states that are concerned with limiting migration flows across the Mediterranean. Down the line, Ankara may claim that it received assurances that those returning would not face any criminal prosecution, and that moderate Syrian opposition voices would be granted political representation. In reality, Ankara will have little or no influence over the fate of Syrian returnees, and such proposals ignore the fact that Syrians in regime-controlled pockets continue to flee Syria, while those outside the country cite Assad’s uninterrupted and brutal rule as the reason for not returning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-war-in-gaza-on-turkeysyria-ties&quot;&gt;The Impact of the War in Gaza on Turkey–Syria Ties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria is effectively a proxy state of Iran, serving as a lifeline for the transit of weapons and fighters travelling onward to reach Hizbullah in Lebanon. Since 7 October, Syrian territory has been regularly targeted by Israeli airstrikes against Iranian proxy military infrastructure. The killing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander in charge of Iran’s Syrian and Lebanese operations in the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus in early April led to the barrage of over 300 rockets and missiles that Iran launched at Israel in retaliation on 13 April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;International actors may have no choice but to engage with Assad to address the ongoing threat posed by extremist and terrorist groups such as Islamic State&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapidly deteriorating regional security situation between Israel and Iran-backed armed proxies will alter Turkey and Syria’s baseline demands and the normalisation timeline, as will the results of the November US presidential election. Even before the double killings of Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Ismail Haniyeh, the political chief of Hamas, in Tehran, it was unlikely that the Turkish security establishment saw strategic value in a full-scale withdrawal from northern Syria. Now, a substantial Turkish force withdrawal is less likely given that Ankara would see this as destabilising northern Syria at a time when Iranian proxies there and in Iraq may escalate a multi-front confrontation with Israel and regional allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s vulnerability in the crossfires of the proxy war between Israel and Iran has pushed Assad to remain on the sidelines as much as possible, while trying to balance Russian interests. Should the Israel–Lebanon border heat up further, Assad may prefer the Turkish status quo in the north to the expansion and entrenchment of Iranian-backed forces. At the same time, ties between Turkey and Iran are evolving. While Iranian infiltration inside Syria has historically restrained Turkish objectives there, common solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza has inched Ankara closer to Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Russia, Turkey seeks to assert a role over the post-war Syrian political economy, and will look to balance its interests with and against US and European positions depending on the trajectory of the conflict. Turkey’s renewed leverage strategy in Syria should also be read alongside growing Russian and Chinese claims and interests in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International actors may have no choice but to engage with Assad to address the ongoing threat posed by extremist and terrorist groups such as Islamic State, as evidence suggests that the group is exploiting the current volatility to reconstitute. Moreover, calibrated cooperation with Assad could be viewed as a necessary evil to address the plight of the Syrian civilian population, who face dire prospects under crippling US and European sanctions which have had little impact on the Assad system’s resilience. Turkey’s own calculus aligns with these considerations, but extends beyond them given the complex history of Turkey–Syria relations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指「屠龍」眾籌為作嚴重暴力逼政府就範 意圖宣揚「五大訴求」政治主張&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jA2Oxsc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（5日）踏入第65日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，女被告劉佩凝被控「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。控方指，法例上單純眾籌並非罪行，本案控罪是眾籌意圖作出危害他人的嚴重暴力，對象需為作出行動以外的人，因此自焚或自殺不屬干犯控罪。至於眾籌目的是要意圖強迫政府或國際組織，或恐嚇公眾人士，或推展政治、宗教、思想上的主張。控方指，「屠龍」以嚴重傷害他人為目的而籌錢，並意圖宣揚政治主張如「五大訴求，缺一不可」，逼使特區政府就範。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方賴振邦必然知道行動牽涉槍更曾協助製作炸彈&quot;&gt;控方：賴振邦必然知道行動牽涉槍、更曾協助製作炸彈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第五日結案陳詞。就第五被告賴振邦，控方指警方在3C維修工作室搜到的電話必然屬於賴，而非其姐夫、同涉本案的張堅順，因其電話內有賴的個人照片。另外，控方指賴有參與台灣軍訓，他亦曾透露自己進入浸大的實驗室「爆 Lab」。控方又指，據證人彭軍壕的證供，他表示賴有到台灣軍訓，並且聽到賴與另外兩人討論如何進行破壞迫政府妥協。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，彭指他與賴等人於10月4日到灣仔打算向警方投擲鏹水彈。控方指，這顯示賴知悉他們曾計劃襲擊警察。控方指賴亦有參與西貢行山試槍，他必然知道吳智鴻管有槍械及炸彈，專家報告提及子彈相片是由賴的電話所拍攝。控方強調，吳一方的行動不斷升級，最終演變至12.8用槍及炸彈的計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於吳與賴的對話顯示，吳稱打算製作炸彈，賴回應吳時表示可以協助問人如何購買硫酸。賴亦有與吳討論如何延長發熱線。控方強調，賴必然知道有製作炸彈的環節。控方又指，「滅龍」群組有一張由張銘裕傳送的引爆裝置相片，警方發現該地點為3C維修工作室外的後樓梯。控方指，直至11月27日炸彈及引爆器經已製作完畢。警方在賴電話內發現一條片段，介紹引爆器的結構。其結構及原理與警方在華仁書院找到的炸彈一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，辯方或會認為彭與警方人員根據 Telegram 訊息「夾故仔」，但控方卻指相關對話內容詳細，希望陪審團自行考慮。控方續指，據彭的證供，賴於12月7日晚曾應吳的要求，帶備材料到華仁協助製作炸彈。紀錄顯示兩人曾通話。彭亦指，吳等人於12月8日早上被捕，賴卻不停問炸彈是否還存放在華仁，似乎想繼續執行計劃。專家檢驗後亦發現賴的電話拍攝了兩張華仁書院的炸彈照片。綜合上述原因，控方表示賴必然知道12月8日會進行用槍及炸彈的行動，而他必然是串謀中的同謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方許湛榮曾與吳智鴻在試槍前探路&quot;&gt;控方：許湛榮曾與吳智鴻在試槍前探路&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第六被告許湛榮，控方指他為「台灣按摩旅行團」群組的成員之一。紀錄顯示，許在黃及吳被捕當日的中午，曾表示「清嘢」。控方指，許必然知道自己是群組成員，他亦下令其他人「清嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又引述彭的證供指，許於2014年已經是吳的「左右手」。辯方於盤問階段一度指出，原在外國留學的許，在得悉吳為情試圖自殺後，立即停學回港陪伴他。控方提醒，辯方的問題並非證供，證人的答案即回答「冇聽過」才是證供。控方強調：「各位唔好畀啲問題混淆，證人口供確認咗嘅就係證供。」控方指，彭表示吳提及正式到西貢試槍前，曾與許前往探路。而警方檢獲的地圖上亦發現許的指模。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在吳被捕後，張堅順轉發有關新聞連結予許，提及警方檢獲半自動手槍。許表示「認真，我個人唔係好信嗰把係真槍，我覺得一係改大咗嘅氣槍，一係一把煙槍」。控方指陪審團要考慮如何解讀相關訊息。另外，許亦有參與西貢行山試槍，因此他一定知道有真槍。控方總結指，上述訊息除促進串謀之用外，亦作為背景予陪審團考慮。控方亦指，需要單獨考慮各被告的參與，不能夠說「因為佢哋係一個群組，一個有份就其他都有份」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方控罪眾籌目的是要強迫政府恐嚇公眾或推展政治主張&quot;&gt;控方：控罪眾籌目的是要強迫政府、恐嚇公眾、或推展政治主張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後就第七被告劉佩凝，她被控「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。控方指，法例上單純的眾籌並非罪行，眾籌以供應口罩及黑色衫亦不是罪行。本案的控罪是眾籌並意圖作出針對及危害他人的嚴重暴力，而對象為作出行動以外的人，因此自焚或自殺亦不屬干犯本控罪；最後一個元素是要導致財產受嚴重傷害。至於眾籌目的是要意圖強迫政府或國際組織，或恐嚇公眾人士，或推展政治、宗教、思想上的主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Uwsxv5c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 第七被告 劉佩凝&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，本案控罪不一定需要與12.8的用槍及炸彈計劃有必然關係，投擲汽油彈也可以考慮為針對人的嚴重暴力，或導致財產受嚴重傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方頻道發布屠龍小隊示威精華片段後-吸引大批人課金&quot;&gt;控方：頻道發布「屠龍小隊」示威精華片段後 吸引大批人「課金」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方的立場是，劉作為「育龍」頻道管理員，藉此發起眾籌，尤其是頻道曾發布「屠龍小隊」進行縱火及攻擊警察的精華片段，事後吸引大批人「課金」。劉的戶口獲存款400多次、總存入金額為104萬多。控方又指，紀錄顯示「屠龍」的黃振強曾向劉表示想買槍，又指資金用作補充「魔法」，即汽油彈。控方指，每次「育龍」有新訊息發布後不久，劉都會問黃的意見，顯示劉對「育龍」動向「跟得好貼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方意圖宣揚政治例如五大訴求缺一不可&quot;&gt;控方：意圖宣揚政治例如「五大訴求，缺一不可」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，「育龍」曾有訊息提及「我哋係貫徹呢個精神嘅小隊之一，五大訴求，缺一不可」；另亦提及要取得30粒「龍心」，據黃的證供是要取30名警員的性命。控方指，「屠龍」的確是以嚴重傷害他人為目的而籌錢，並意圖宣揚政治例如「五大訴求，缺一不可」，逼使特區政府就範。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又引述劉與另一人的對話，劉於黃被捕後表示：「我條 Team 俾人拉晒」，並確認該隊伍為「屠龍」及警方搜出槍械。劉其後表示：「Healer 應該唔會爆我住，我肯定無嘢」、「冇人知道我係屠龍，得你」、「Healer 做鬼，屈返龍隊，啲彈頭係警用子彈，根本冇可能龍隊有槍」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方已完成陳詞，案件明（6日）續審，將由辯方進行陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（2日）踏入第64日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，指吳智鴻一方早於2019年9月30日有串謀協議，其後吳「摻咗屠龍入嚟玩」，而「屠龍」於11月18日起加入，因此串謀協議是不斷演變。控方又指，部分 Telegram 訊息有促進協議之用，可證明串謀是存在，以及串謀者的參與程度；另有部份訊息卻並非促進之用，陪審員只可考慮作為背景資料，以及判斷被告是否知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方部份-telegram-對話訊息有促進協議之用&quot;&gt;控方：部份 Telegram 對話訊息有促進協議之用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第四日結案陳詞，她總結指，本案的串謀協議建基於吳智鴻與「屠龍」落實在2019年12月8日，在軒尼詩道放置炸彈及使用槍械的大計劃。控方指，吳一方早於9月30日有串謀協議，其後吳「摻咗屠龍入嚟玩」，「屠龍」於11月18日起加入，因此串謀協議是不斷演變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，在串謀協議中每名參與者各有角色，並不會明確分工，甚至毋須見面或知道其他人的角色。但若能證明各人的共同目的是在公眾地方使用炸彈及槍攻擊警方人員，就已屬參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方解釋，部份 Telegram 對話訊息有促進協議之用，可證明串謀是存在，以及串謀者的參與程度；另有部份訊息卻並非促進之用，陪審員只可考慮作為背景資料，以及判斷被告是否知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方依賴促進串謀的訊息包括，黃於11月19日在「滅龍」群組表示：「聽日去到泰國有新 Plan 講」、「唔使行眼鏡 Plan」、「諗定 20 kg」。嚴文謙問：「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避？」林銘皓則提出「喺嗰個位我哋引戰」。控方亦依賴吳與黃討論行動位置的對話內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方尚未完成陳詞，案件下周一（5日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（1日）踏入第63日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，提及「屠龍」成員嚴文謙知道在12月8日的行動中，他們的崗位是負責「引戰」，即引警察到場。而有參與台灣軍訓的「屠龍」成員張銘裕，則會知道吳智鴻一方打算使用槍械。控方另質疑，另一成員李家田聲稱留在隊內是為取資助並「有飯食」，但他卻不出席小隊的飯局，明顯「一反自己嘅品性」。控方一度強調：「大家唔好用2024年嚟睇2019年嘅事件」，「2019喺香港係好特別嘅時間，用時代背景去睇事情，根本串謀係呼之欲出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方成員對大-plan沒有疑問&quot;&gt;控方：成員對「大 Plan」沒有疑問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第三日結案陳詞。控方指，本案共有兩幫人，但他們一同參與串謀協議，相關協議在「屠龍」的黃振強與吳智鴻於11月18日見面後已形成。據對話顯示，黃振強與張俊富討論如何使用「20 kg」，而黃在庭上供稱「20 kg」指炸彈。控方引述黃的證供，11月25日「屠龍」已達成共識不會親自用槍及炸彈，只會配合吳一方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃於12月3日在群組表示「同大家講個壞消息，今個星期要入港島」，其後黃又指「認真，星期日有大 Plan」。控方指，此時已經落實行動的日期及地點。另外，群組並沒有人問甚麼是「大 Plan」，顯示各人對此沒有疑問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方成員知道行動崗位是引戰&quot;&gt;控方：成員知道行動崗位是「引戰」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黃稱，他與成員於12月4日完成訪問後開會，並在會上交代在12月8日行動中，「屠龍」只需要負責「引戰」。成員的對話中，亦提到「淨係引班狗嚟就掂，走得」。控方指據證人口供提及，「屠龍」引警方人員到某一位置後，小炸彈就會被引爆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指，黃在12.8行動前提醒隊員不要攜帶裝備、工具及武器，顯示當日有別於一般示威行動。嚴文謙問黃：「聽日會唔會打近身？」控方指這顯示成員知道他們在12.8行動的崗位是「引戰」。控方最後指，上述對話在2019年8至10月出現，並不可能是事後捏造。雖然辯方指黃可以為了令自己獲最大減刑，再加上在警方指示下，「深思熟慮作故事」指證被告，但這交由陪審員衡量相信多少證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方張銘裕與吳智鴻有私下聯絡&quot;&gt;控方：張銘裕與吳智鴻有私下聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後簡述每名被告的角色及言行。就首被告張俊富，控方指他為「屠龍」成員，並知道協議的存在。他曾出席11月17日晚的大鴻輝會議，會上有人討論試槍及炸彈的情況。當黃與吳見面後，黃在泰國旅行期間解釋「新 Plan」，張當時亦有去泰國。另外，張有出席11月25日的三陂坊會議，會上黃表示「屠龍」會配合引警察。張俊富自己亦有談及如何使用「20 kg」。控方另指，辯方在盤問階段指出「20 kg」實際指煙花炮仗，但黃不同意。控方亦指，黃、張及林銘皓討論在哪一位置擺放炸彈，亦算是串謀的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃作供時表示，張在小隊中作為「運輸工人」的角色，曾協助收取裝備。但控方卻質疑：「佢係咪只係一個倉務員？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二被告張銘裕，他亦為「屠龍」成員。控方指，張與吳早於8月27日已有私訊，因張於9月隨吳前往台灣軍訓，期間張提及「如果要用槍，可能我唔啱」。據彭軍壕的證供，軍訓內容包括開槍、搶槍、近身搏鬥、製作汽油彈及鋁熱彈。因此，張會知道吳一方將會使用的武器是甚麼。張其後亦有問吳是否可取得 C4 手槍。另外，張有參與西貢行山試槍，他更與吳聯絡，並告知對方自己會攜帶柴油。控方希望陪審員考慮當時張有否親手試槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，張曾於11月27日在「滅龍」群組傳送引爆器的影片，這顯示張與吳一方必然有聯絡。控方補充，證人曾表示吳為人謹慎，因此他不會將影片傳送至一個不信任的人手中。至於群組成員亦沒有詢問影片內容，這顯示他們知道引爆器的存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方用時代背景看串謀呼之欲出&quot;&gt;控方：用時代背景看、串謀呼之欲出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第三被告嚴文謙，他亦為「屠龍」成員。控方指，嚴必然知道12.8計劃牽涉用槍及炸彈攻擊警方。對話紀錄顯示，嚴於11月18日稱：「睇嚟有人早過我哋去台灣，佢哋出咗嘅話，我哋用眼鏡（槍）都唔使走」、「認真，準備好搶槍」。他亦曾談及「20 kg」，又問：「引戰都要避彈呀？」、「係咪直接打近身？」、「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調「大家唔好用2024年嚟睇2019年嘅事件」，「2019喺香港係好特別嘅時間，用時代背景去睇事情，根本串謀係呼之欲出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱貪便宜留隊內無參與示威-控方質疑為何仍獲資金&quot;&gt;李家田稱貪便宜留隊內、無參與示威 控方質疑為何仍獲資金&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第四被告李家田，他亦屬「屠龍」成員，並是本案唯一作供的被告。李供稱加入「屠龍」是為搜集資料，同時發現黃振強會向他提供資金，「錢銀上好疏爽、有求必應」，因此他為了「貪小便宜」而逗留隊內。李強調自己一直無參與投擲汽油彈及堵路等行動，只是在場旁觀。他又解釋在「滅龍」群組所發出的訊息，僅屬藉口、推搪、轉移話題、評論及「搲水吹」。控方指，陪審員需要考慮李作供時的神態舉止，以判斷他是否「吹水」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，既然李一直在隊內行動都是「行行企企」甚麼也不做，為何仍獲隊員關心，「黃振強會唔會咁對佢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李不出席飯局-違反為了有飯食的品性&quot;&gt;控方質疑李不出席飯局 違反為了「有飯食」的品性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另表示，實際上李有出席11月17日晚的大鴻輝會議，並非如他所指被困理大。控方反駁，若李真的被困理大，就不會提議去「M記」開會，「佢仲有冇閒情興致講『M記』，應酬或者敷衍滅龍一方？」控方亦質疑，李聲稱留在隊內是為「有飯食」，但他卻不出席這次飯局，明顯「一反自己嘅品性」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方李部分錄影會面證供屬脫罪說法&quot;&gt;控方：李部分錄影會面證供屬脫罪說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱被捕後遭警員毆打，並強迫說出手槍下落，因此在錄影會面時，他應警方指示捏造部分證供。控方提醒陪審員考慮李是自願說還是被打後受驚而說，「佢講嘅意識形態係點，你哋信唔信？」，「佢似唔似畀人打完之後講？」控方亦指，李被捕時警方已搜獲全部3支槍，因此毋須迫他說出下落。控方又指，李在錄影會面中有部份是脫罪的說法，例如他說沒有打算參與12.8行動。因此，陪審員需要自行判斷哪些證供屬實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提醒並非所有對話訊息皆可視作真實證據&quot;&gt;官提醒並非所有對話訊息皆可視作真實證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方要求下，控方向陪審員解釋他們會依賴哪些訊息作為背景，哪些訊息可考慮作為真實證據。控方指在串謀罪下，某些訊息可視作促進串謀協議。在本案中，黃及吳在11月18日達成協議後的訊息，部分可作為證據。至於11月18日前的訊息，則僅視作背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲指，雖然控方提及很多對話訊息，但她提醒陪審員「唔好以為每一句說話都係真嘅」，因部分屬「傳聞證供」，稍後她及控方會再講解，哪些訊息牽涉促進串謀，而陪審員需要考慮其真實性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（2日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes and will continue to do so in the long term. Procurement networks with tentacles all around the world have been used by the country to obtain technology from willing exporters and naive businesses, and to dupe those trying to comply with export controls over the past decades. These networks will continue to be key to the sustainment of North Korea’s programmes and further technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper analyses North Korea’s procurement networks, particularly in view of North Korea’s programmatic successes and recent geopolitical shifts in Russia’s relationship with North Korea as a result of the war in Ukraine. The paper draws on underexploited source material to offer an overview of North Korea’s procurement networks over the past five years. It finds that North Korea’s networks are active and will remain so, and are likely seeking to make up for the slowdown in procurement during the period of Covid-19-related border closures, and to fulfil recent Russian orders for missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The networks are largely focused in China and Russia, where North Korean operatives – trading company personnel, diplomats, intelligence officers, and scientists and researchers – have been able to operate largely unhindered, allowing them to establish supply chains. However, there are still some needs that see North Korea looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets to fulfil. North Korea’s renewed relationship with Russia is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of the country’s procurement networks. Any formal offer of strategic technologies by Moscow to Pyongyang, or actions that see North Korean operatives openly purchase on a larger scale from Russian providers, would be bountiful for North Korea’s procurement needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s procurement networks into the future, including evolving needs and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies provided by a smaller number of niche suppliers. Overall, the paper concludes that despite North Korea’s successes, seeking to prevent the country’s access to, and procurement of, technology is still valuable. It makes 10 recommendations to those seeking to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes. Long subject to extensive UN sanctions prohibiting exports of many of these technologies to North Korea, Pyongyang has made extensive use of illicit procurement networks to access these technologies. These networks, with tentacles all around the world, obtain the goods from a mix of willing exporters and naive businesses, and by duping those trying to comply with export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These external technologies – from materials and components, to machine tools and other manufacturing equipment, to sensitive design information and expertise – have allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programmes. The goods, manufacturing technologies and expertise, along with extensive domestic investment, have allowed North Korea to build up its indigenous WMD-related expertise and industrial base. This has led to the apparent growth of the country’s nuclear arsenal, which – while public estimates are scant – has been said by US intelligence sources to number up to 60 warheads. North Korea has also successfully developed ICBMs and systems with shorter ranges, seemingly of domestic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reassessment of North Korea’s procurement of foreign technology is timely. In the medium to long term, North Korea will continue to rely on imported technologies and its procurement networks as its nuclear and missile arsenals develop. Recent geopolitical developments have also worked to open up North Korea’s opportunities to benefit from external sources of technology. After North Korea’s renewal of its relationship with Russia, rumours emerged that Moscow will offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang in return for arms transfers for use in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s flagrant violation of the UN arms embargo, as well as China dragging its feet over sanctions, has put the UN sanctions regime on life support. These states, both with extensive strategic industries, have been significant targets for North Korea’s technology procurement efforts. China is also the main transhipment hub for goods en route to North Korea. However, despite the potential impending disintegration of the UN sanctions regime, seeking to implement supply-side controls and continuing to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement is still valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Russia and China, many states with companies that produce technology of value to North Korea’s procurement – particularly the US, Europe and Japan – remain on board with sanctions on North Korea. There are also many other states that have sought and will continue to seek to prevent technology leaking out to North Korea’s programme. States seeking to counter North Korea’s procurement will also continue to make the case for sanctions implementation to a range of states that can and will occasionally act as transhipment or re-export hubs for nuclear- and missile-related technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this continued role for UN sanctions and the need to make the case to partners, an up-to-date examination of North Korea’s WMD-related procurement efforts is a timely and important aid to sanctions implementation. Analysis is also pertinent given the expiry of the mandate of the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718 Committee Panel of Experts (PoE) in April 2024. The dissolution of the PoE represents a blow to sanctions monitoring and implementation. This paper offers a baseline analysis for further outreach on sanctions implementation to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement. It is hoped this is especially useful for governments, their intelligence and customs bodies, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-challenges-and-existing-research&quot;&gt;Data Challenges and Existing Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been some focused research on North Korea’s nuclear and missile procurement activities, no recent works have considered them in detail. The limited work in this area is largely due to the challenges of access to data, with much of North Korea’s programmes completely hidden from view. Studies of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have tended to provide broader overviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically on the nuclear side, lack of access to North Korean facilities – and, indeed, as key elements of North Korea’s uranium enrichment programme are unknown to outsiders – means that little is understood about the scope of North Korea’s programmes and the technologies that are used. There is more information in the public domain on the missile programme, with images and footage of increasingly frequent missile tests, parades and factory visits published by the regime, as well as missile test wreckage fished off the bed of the sea, or more recently from impact sites in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discerning the balance of North Korea’s import of technology from overseas, either by overt assistance or illicit procurement, and its domestic industrial capacity, has been a particular challenge. For the nuclear programme, on top of the lack of insights into North Korean facilities, there have been few cases of seizure of goods destined for the programme, providing little insight into foreign dependencies. There is more, albeit limited, data on the missile programme that can be used to analyse North Korea’s successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While limited in number, there are some more focused works on North Korea’s procurement networks. Some analysis has considered the procurement of specific technologies, while others have focused on the role of certain types of entities in North Korea’s procurement and arms trading activities. Still others have looked at North Korea’s knowledge networks and the procurement of “intangible” technology – the design information, sensitive data and knowledge that accompanies tangible goods, components and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these more focused works are based on information from almost a decade ago, with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes having since progressed significantly. Taking stock of the situation as much as is possible through an up-to-date and more holistic treatment will help frame future efforts to counter the country’s procurement networks. This is particularly necessary in view of the dissolution of the UN PoE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-hypothesis-and-structure&quot;&gt;Methodology, Hypothesis and Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to provide an up-to-date analysis of North Korea’s illicit procurement – the technologies it is seeking, its procurement apparatus and modus operandi – focusing on the period since the last UN North Korea sanctions resolution was passed in 2017. The paper uses a range of newer sources that have so far had limited consideration. The more recent reports of the now defunct PoE have included details on procurement efforts, including several detailed cases since 2017. US designations from as recently as 2023 and detailed guidance on countering North Korea’s illicit procurement for its missile programme from 2020 also offer new insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wreckage of North Korean missiles recovered from the battlefields of Ukraine also offers new perspectives on the contents of North Korean weapons. In addition, the paper fills in some gaps in the history of North Korea’s procurement from recent UK National Archives finds from the 1980s and early 1990s. The data from these under-used sources is combined with insights from several interviews with nuclear and missile proliferation experts, cited anonymously due to the sensitivity of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that in the medium to long term, North Korea will continue to rely on imported technology and its procurement networks as its nuclear and missile arsenals develop. Since 2017, these procurement networks have been active in a range of areas, and particularly in dual-use technologies (those with both military and civilian applications). The paper shows that these networks will continue to be active as they make up for the slowdown in procurement during the period of Covid-19-related border closures, and as they work to procure technology for domestic uses, as well as to compensate for the goods used in producing missiles exported to the new Russian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper contends that North Korea’s procurement networks are largely focused on China and Russia. In these jurisdictions, North Korea’s agents operate with little risk of reprisal, and have been able to establish supply chains for a growing number of requisite technologies. However, North Korea still has needs or interests that result in Pyongyang looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets through intermediaries, as is demonstrated by the electronic components inside North Korean missile wreckage recovered from Ukraine. Desire for certain quality products, or a preference for goods from these countries, could ensure continued interest in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang’s renewed relationship with Moscow is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. North Korea has supplied arms and ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine, and Pyongyang and Moscow signed a mutual defence treaty in June 2024. If Moscow were to formally offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang, or to allow North Korea’s procurement operatives to openly shop on a larger scale from Russian providers, this could be bountiful for North Korea’s needs. Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s networks into the future, including evolving technological developments and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies held by a smaller number of niche suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, which seeks to provide insights to non-governmental analysts, government officials and industry practitioners, has five chapters. Chapter I gives a historical overview of North Korea’s technology procurement, emphasising that it has been a long-term buyer from the international marketplace, and highlighting continuity in approaches. Chapter II considers a loose typology of the equipment and goods that North Korea is pursuing and the UN sanctions that have sought to prevent technology transfer. Chapter III analyses North Korea’s more recent illicit procurement activities to understand current procurement priorities. Chapter IV takes a closer look at the entities involved in North Korea’s WMD-related illicit procurement, while Chapter V considers its future. The paper concludes with 10 recommendations to counter North Korea’s future illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-historical-sources-of-technology&quot;&gt;I. Historical Sources of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has long exploited external sources of technology to develop its nuclear and missile programmes. This chapter provides a brief historical overview for context and asks two pertinent questions: Where has North Korea’s WMD technology come from? And what was the role of illicit procurement? The chapter highlights the continuity in North Korea’s procurement approaches and methods over the past 50 years, showing that Pyongyang has, through necessity, used illicit procurement networks and methods to obtain military and strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply-side controls have been used since at least the 1980s to prevent support to North Korea’s WMD programmes (see Box 1). During the Cold War, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCoM) sought to prevent the transfer of Western technology to communist states, including North Korea. According to declassified CIA assessments, North Korea went on a “buying spree” of Western technology in the mid-1970s and again in the mid-1980s. As one assessment from 1988 notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much of the technology and equipment P’yongyang wants is proscribed from export to North Korea; this makes clandestine acquisition, supplemented by dual-use purchases that can be modified to meet military requirements, a key element of the North’s effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;P’yongyang has focused much of its technology acquisition operations in Japan and Western Europe, where ethnic Korean communities or willing collaborators have helped in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment also noted the importance of Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau as sources of microelectronics and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-the-value-of-supply-side-controls&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: The Value of Supply-Side Controls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Supply-side controls” is a broad term used to denote the range of tools used to prevent the supply of technology to WMD proliferators (as opposed to demand-side measures that might address the reasons that states want WMD). These include export controls and technology-based sanctions, border and customs checks, actions against procurement networks, efforts to protect dual-use training and research from being exploited by proliferators, and counter-proliferation-financing measures.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given that North Korea has achieved a nuclear weapons and ICBM capability, what is the value of continuing to implement supply-side controls to try to prevent North Korea’s procurement of WMD-related technologies? While the true impacts of supply-side controls are difficult to gauge, there are several arguments for their continued application.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Long-Term WMD Dependencies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea will continue to rely, in the short to medium term, on imported technologies and its procurement networks as its arsenal develops. Indeed, more mature nuclear and missile programmes – for example those of Russia, which has been a nuclear weapons state for 75 years – are known to still rely on imported technologies decades after crossing the nuclear threshold.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Battlefield Use and Exports&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recent North Korean sales of missiles to Russia have seen their use against civilian populations in Ukraine. While supply-side controls are unlikely to prevent further transfers across the North Korea–Russia border, preventing the transfer of technologies, particularly of Western-manufactured micro-electronics, to North Korea could help to disrupt the production of missiles in North Korea for Vladimir Putin’s war machine. The ongoing resurgence of North Korea’s arms exports enterprise provides further rationale for continued supply-side controls.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Slowing Production and Increasing Costs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If supply chains are disrupted by supply-side measures, it will be more difficult for North Korea’s procurement agents to obtain the components and materials they need. This could slow production and potentially increase the costs of procurement, as agents pay above market rate to compete with legitimate buyers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Providing Intelligence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Export licence applications completed by exporters can provide governments with valuable intelligence about the needs of North Korea’s WMD programmes and its procurement networks, in particular intermediaries, transhipment points and shipping routes. Exporters are required to provide details of technologies, entities and stated end-uses, which can provide useful insights.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Exploiting Existing Tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The main states capable of supplying technology – members of key multilateral export control regimes such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) – already have export control systems and border controls in place. However, in some of these supplier states, for example China, export control implementation and enforcement are far from perfect. This, and the existence of a wide range of third-country hubs that proliferators can exploit, makes for large and significant loopholes in global supply-side controls. Nevertheless, great effort has been expended on developing these control systems, and the benefits of their continued use to counter North Korean procurement are clear.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-nuclear-programme-procurement&quot;&gt;Historical Nuclear Programme Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its pursuit of nuclear weapons, North Korea developed reactor and reprocessing technologies and also, as recognised later by the international community, uranium enrichment technology. While the plutonium side of the programme benefited from the construction of reactors and reprocessing facilities at Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, less is known about the uranium enrichment side, with one large facility at Yongbyon revealed to foreign visitors in 2010. There are likely other facilities of unclear size and capability in other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides of the fuel cycle have been developed with extensive use of imported technologies. The Yongbyon reactor itself was based on a simple and ageing design, likely requiring little imported technology. But other elements of the plutonium programme required technological support and, at the time, the Soviet Union, China and other communist states were seemingly unwilling to provide it. As a result, North Korea turned to the international marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after US intelligence identified in the early 1980s that North Korea was constructing a reactor, attempts by a North Korean entity to procure a wide range of technologies from West German companies were detected by the US government. The list included: 50 manipulators used to handle radioactive materials; remote control equipment; hot cells; shielding walls; ventilation and filter systems; glove boxes; and facilities for the manufacture, distribution, packaging and transport of radionuclides. As a November 1984 West German government paper noted: “In particular the last few items in the list … give rise to concern, as they seem to indicate North Korean plans to construct a (possibly unsafeguarded) reprocessing plant”. This led the US and the UK to consult with partners on efforts to prevent North Korean procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea also sought other technology from a West German company in the 1980s, including a small furnace in 1987, possibly through East Germany. Technicians and an official from the same company visited North Korea in 1989 and 1990. Further evidence of dual-use material and equipment procurement from West German and Swiss household name companies came to light in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1986, a North Korean diplomat, Yun Ho-Jin, was based at the North Korean mission to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. Building a network of contacts, Yun organised trade delegation visits to Europe, some of which resulted in purchases that ended up in Yongbyon. After North Korea withdrew from the IAEA in 1994, Yun took his networks and expertise “private”, establishing the Beijing-based Namchongang Trading Corporation (NCG), which would be added to the UN North Korea sanctions list in 2009 for its proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yun was far from the only diplomat active in procurement in Europe. Kim Jong Ryul, a procurement agent for the regime with a diplomatic passport, recalls procuring US-manufactured, NSG-controlled mass spectrometers in the 1990s, of use in “identifying uranium and plutonium particles”, using European front companies. North Korea also made use of other overseas connections. During the 1980s, the country turned to Korean residents in Japan through the Chongryon, the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a kind of de facto embassy, to provide scientific support and dual-use goods from the Japanese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s centrifuge efforts became apparent much later, but in hindsight drew heavily on external support. Pakistan and the black-market network, run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A Q Khan, would provide North Korea with centrifuge design information. North Korea and Pakistan initially exchanged technology and knowledge in the 1990s. Later, around 2000, Khan’s network provided North Korea with about two dozen P-1 and P-2 centrifuges and measuring equipment, as well as allowing access to Pakistan’s centrifuge workshops at Khan Research Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1999 and 2003, Japanese authorities sought to prevent the export of frequency converters to North Korea – items of use in controlling centrifuges. In the early 2000s, North Korea attempted to procure extensive quantities of aluminium tubes for centrifuge construction. Yun Ho-Jin, the director of NCG, would be implicated in one unsuccessful – and possibly one successful – effort to import tubes for several thousand centrifuges. In 2002, the CIA noted that in the previous year, North Korea “began seeking centrifuge-related materials in large quantities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN sanctions listing, NCG was also involved in procurement for North Korea’s plutonium-related activities, procuring Japanese-origin vacuum pumps, likely of use in the fuel fabrication facility at Yongbyon. According to reporting, NCG had allegedly been procuring “gas masks, electric timers, steel pipes, vacuum pumps, transformers and aluminum tubes” from European markets in the early 2000s using the Beijing office, and that these procurements, some of which were destined for the Syrian Al-Kibar nuclear reactor project, had alerted the US to North Korea–Syria nuclear collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-missile-programme-procurement&quot;&gt;Historical Missile Programme Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s missile programme has also relied on external sources of technology from both states and the international marketplace, although recent developments in the longer-range programmes have resulted in systems unique to North Korea. The programmes began with short-range Soviet Scud systems obtained from Egypt, which were reverse engineered and scaled up to create the Nodong ballistic missile. North Korea allegedly benefited from human capital leaking from the collapsed Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and Soviet design influences were seen in the failed Musudan IRBM (intermediate range ballistic missile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the external technology that has supported North Korea’s missile programme has come from the international marketplace. As with the nuclear programme, North Korea likely imported a range of missile and dual-use technologies from the early days of its indigenisation efforts. This included speciality steel from the Soviet Union and later Russia, and commercially produced power systems for the transporter erector launchers (TELs) carrying missiles from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong and Macau formed a key node in North Korea’s procurement networks from the 1980s. As a document from the UK National Archives notes, in 1993 the Hong Kong authorities raided the premises of a company with “extensive North Korean links”, which was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the subject of numerous intelligence reports indicating its involvement in procuring strategic items on behalf of North Korea. The items are imported to Hong Kong and then exported to Macau for onward transmission to North Korea … using hand couriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year the company admitted the export of thousands of integrated circuits and components to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also sought trucks on which to carry its missiles, especially larger systems. In the early 1990s North Korea allegedly imported 30 Italian trucks carrying Austrian lifting equipment to produce TELs for its Nodong missiles. Around the same time, North Korea imported truck chassis from Germany for use in TEL production. Dependence on external sources for large truck chassis seems to have persisted into the UN sanctions era, when in 2012 six large eight-axle TELs were exhibited during a Pyongyang parade carrying an early ICBM design. The trucks had been procured from China in 2011, with the end use purported to be the lumber industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also procured machine tools – manufacturing technologies with civil, military, missile and nuclear applications. The public record shows the role of entities in Taiwan in supplying machine tools since the 1990s. The network persisted into the UN sanctions era, when a Taiwanese businessman was indicted by a domestic court for the re-export of three types of US-origin machine tools to North Korea. In 2013, the Taiwanese businessman and his US-based son were arrested by the US authorities, with the son accused of establishing a US-based company to facilitate exports of hundreds of thousands of dollars of machine tools to his father for re-export to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, around the time of North Korea’s first successful ICBM test in 2017, debate raged over the genesis of North Korea’s achievements. Some experts alleged that North Korea likely relied on rocket engines imported from Russia or Ukraine, or even on a Russian design, although no clear evidence was presented to support shipments of goods from either country. Doubts about the domestic origins of North Korea’s more recent ICBM designs have also been largely unfounded. North Korea’s recent success in its missile efforts appears to have been largely achieved with domestic designs and expertise honed over decades and built on external expertise and imported technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iitechnology-and-un-sanctions&quot;&gt;II.Technology and UN Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, North Korea has sought to obtain a wide range of different types of technology for its weapons programmes – complete systems, constituent parts, materials and components, expertise, and sensitive information. This chapter digs deeper into the types of technology and the UN sanctions seeking to prohibit their transfer. It provides a loose typology of the technology; addresses the question of the role of North Korea’s technology imports, as opposed to domestic production and indigenisation; and explores key concepts, including “dual-use” and intangible technologies, in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-loose-typology&quot;&gt;A Loose Typology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in Chapter I, North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have been built on imported technology. This is just part of North Korea’s procurement picture: imports of technology and illicit procurement networks have had a much wider application for North Korea’s strategic, defence and other development (see Box 2). They have allowed a country that long had a limited domestic industrial base to develop relatively advanced capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-chemical-biological-and-conventional-weapons-and-other-commodities&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2: Chemical, Biological and Conventional Weapons and Other Commodities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes may be its most impactful and well-recognised procurement area, but the country’s illicit networks seek a much wider range of prohibited goods that benefit a range of strategic efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chemical Weapons&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has an active chemical weapons programme, as demonstrated by the assassination in 2017 by North Korea of Kim Jong Un’s half-brother, Kim Jong-Nam, with the VX nerve agent. North Korea has relied on imported precursor chemicals (chemicals used to produce chemical weapons) for its programmes in the past.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Biological Weapons&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea is believed to have an active biological weapons programme. Analysis of images from a 2015 visit to a fertiliser factory suggested that the facility could produce bioweapons, and that modern equipment seen in the facility suggested an “active large-scale sanctions busting effort to illicitly procure the equipment” for the programme.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Military Technologies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has sought to illicitly procure military technologies, in breach of the UN arms embargo in place since 2006. Many dual-use materials used in WMD programmes will also have utility in military production. A 2013 interdicted shipment of arms from Cuba to North Korea also demonstrates North Korea’s interest in procuring spare parts for existing weapons systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Other Commodities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea also illicitly procures a range of other goods prohibited by UN sanctions – from oil to run its economy and military, to luxury goods to maintain the regime.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 summarises the broad types of technology that North Korea has sought. These include technologies with direct and specialised applications in the nuclear and missile programmes. They include goods controlled by the NSG and the MTCR in their respective control lists: the NSG’s Part I “trigger list”; and the MTCR’s Annex Category I. Technologies sought include tangible materials, goods and components, as well as related intangibles – design information, sensitive data and knowledge relating to these items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5K0BIqW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Broad Types of Nuclear and Missile Technologies Sought by North Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual-use technologies, those listed in the NSG guidelines’ Part II “dual-use list” and the MTCR Annex’s Category II list, also underpin North Korea’s programmes. In simple terms, dual-use technology describes those materials, goods, components and related intangibles that have both military and civilian applications. This loose category includes a wide range of technologies, everything from advanced materials and components to manufacturing capabilities. For example, alloys used in producing centrifuges could be used in the manufacture of civilian airliners, and carbon fibre used in centrifuges and missiles could have applications in high-end racing cars and yachts or even golf clubs. Machine tools used to machine centrifuge or missile components could be used in a wide range of high-end manufacturing applications. Many of the technologies used in centrifuge and missile plants – for example programmable logic controllers to control industrial processes, pumps, valves, pipes and hoses to facilitate the movement of liquids and operate centrifuges under vacuum – have applications in a wide range of other manufacturing facilities. Not all dual-use technology with applications in a WMD programme will be listed by the NSG and the MTCR, with items falling below the control thresholds still of utility to WMD programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-technological-needs&quot;&gt;Evolving Technological Needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What parts of this broad nuclear and missile technological picture is North Korea currently seeking outside its borders? There is very limited evidence of North Korea’s procurement activity, especially in the nuclear area, which is a challenge for judging continued dependence. Nuclear and missile technology experts interviewed for this paper suggested there is likely a declining range of areas where North Korea is truly dependent on external sources of technology. North Korea is likely capable of producing most of the nuclear-specific goods it needs domestically after more than 40 years of effort, and this is probably also true for missile-specific technologies. Many of these most sensitive technologies are more challenging to obtain from the international marketplace and therefore have likely been priorities for North Korea’s indigenisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, North Korea’s programmes are still far from self-sufficient, with the country looking externally for a range of technologies, including many dual-use goods. With such a wide range of dual-use technologies required for these programmes, North Korea would expend significant effort to try and produce all of them domestically. These dual-use technologies are also readily available from a wider range of international manufacturers than they were a decade ago. The present-day Chinese market is likely able to provide most, if not all, of the dual-use technologies required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interest in certain types of goods from certain manufacturers or other countries for quality or prestige reasons might see procurement operatives target technology from the US, Europe and Japan, for example. Much of the evidence discussed in Chapter III supports this hypothesis. Many of the tangible technologies for which there is evidence of North Korea’s pursuit in recent years have been dual use. In terms of the missile programme, an expert interviewed remarked that Western goods “are not make or break for the programme”. There are, obviously, areas where procurement of very specialised goods or intangibles may be necessary or helpful, particularly in areas of more exotic and “emerging” technologies where North Korea has less experience, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above analysis therefore calls into question the utility of the term “chokepoints”, often used to refer to areas where proliferators are dependent on foreign sources of technology and can be squeezed by export controls. As one expert interviewee noted, the term is “problematic”, especially when used in relation to proliferators that have been seeking technology for decades and, recently, in an era when the global manufacturing base for dual-use technologies has grown. With dual-use technologies more readily available, states such as North Korea are more likely to be able to procure such technologies from states with weak export control implementation and enforcement, as well as from entities that are willing to sell to proliferators, or ignore red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several transfer vectors relating to the intangibles of design information, sensitive data and knowledge. These include espionage, entering into technology transfer agreements, attending technical exchanges, training workshops or conferences, and engaging in research collaboration with entities overseas. More recent procurement of intangibles has likely taken the form of engaging in research collaborations, stealing information and data through hacks, and downloading open source research papers, as well as building domestic expertise through hands-on testing and refinement. Efforts to attract the expertise of external scientists and engineers, as occurred in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, are less prominent in North Korea’s current efforts to access nuclear- and missile-related knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;un-sanctions-and-illicit-procurement&quot;&gt;UN Sanctions and Illicit Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the nuclear, missile and dual-use technologies that North Korea is seeking are covered by the UN North Korea sanctions regime, which prohibits the transfer of goods to, and technical collaboration with, North Korea. The regime, imposed by the UN Security Council through its Chapter VII powers, is legally binding on all UN member states. The first UNSCR in 2006 (UNSCR 1695) required all states to “exercise vigilance and prevent” the transfer of missile and WMD technology to North Korea. A further resolution the same year (UNSCR 1718) was more specific, declaring that all member states “shall prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to the DPRK, through their territories or by their nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, and whether or not originating in their territories” of nuclear and missile technology, and linking to the list of technologies in the 2006 version of the NSG guidelines and the MTCR’s “Equipment, Software and Technology Annex”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lists associated with these technologies have been updated periodically as the NSG and MTCR lists are updated annually. Resolutions in 2013 (UNSCR 2094) and 2016 (UNSCR 2321) provided annexes that included further goods to which the existing prohibitions would apply. The technology lists were last updated by the Sanctions Committee in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2006 (UNSCR 1718) there has also been a “catch-all” provision on the transfer of any technology that could contribute to North Korea’s WMD programmes. The Committee also notes that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All Member States are further required to implement a binding dual-use “catch-all” provision to apply the above measures on any item if the State determines that it could contribute to the DPRK’s nuclear or ballistic missile programmes, other weapons of mass destruction programmes or other activities prohibited by the resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond prohibitions on the transfer of controlled technology that should be implemented through UN members’ national systems for implementing export controls and sanctions, there are also various provisions for inspecting cargoes. Earlier UN Security Council resolutions “called upon” states to inspect cargo to and from North Korea, particularly if they had “information that provides reasonable grounds [for] believ[ing]” that the cargo contained prohibited items, including nuclear or missile technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolutions also include prohibitions on activities that might allow North Korea to obtain intangibles relevant to WMD development. For example, as early as 2006 (UNSCR 1718), the sanctions decided that all UN members “shall prevent any transfers to the DPRK … of technical training, advice, services or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use” of the nuclear, missile or military items prohibited for transfer to North Korea. Three years later, UNSCR 1874 called upon UN members to “exercise vigilance and prevent specialised teaching or training of North Korea nationals within their territories or by their nationals, of disciplines which could contribute to North Korea’s proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolutions in 2016 further tightened restrictions. UNSCR 2270 required that “all Member States shall prevent specialised teaching or training of DPRK nationals within their territories or by their nationals of disciplines which could contribute to the DPRK’s proliferation sensitive nuclear activities”. UNSCR 2321 in 2016 provided more detail on the ban on training, and also decided that all UN members should “suspend scientific and technical cooperation involving persons or groups officially sponsored by or representing the DPRK except for medical exchanges”. UNSCR 2375 in 2017 also decided that states should prohibit joint ventures with North Korea entities, which could potentially involve collaboration on technology with overseas partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions regime was monitored by the UNSCR 1718 Committee PoE, which was set up in 2009 and conducted investigations into various breaches and potential breaches of UN sanctions over the next 15 years. Through more than 20 mid-term and final reports, the PoE put significant information about North Korea’s illicit procurement into the public domain. The PoE was disbanded at the end of April 2024 following Russia’s veto of and China’s abstention on a resolution to extend its mandate to April 2025. The dissolution of the PoE significantly reduces scrutiny of the implementation of the UN sanctions on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, including those relating to technology transfer. Sanctions effectively remain in place, but unmonitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-procurement-evidence-activity-and-needs-since-2017&quot;&gt;III. Procurement Evidence: Activity and Needs Since 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the closure of many international borders between 2020 and 2023 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea has continued to procure controlled technology for its nuclear and missile programmes. As a UN PoE report noted in 2021, “foreign representatives of trading companies … including Korean Mining and Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) and Saengpil Associated Corporation, who have been stuck overseas during the pandemic, have continued to import and export munitions materials to earn foreign currency and to assist with the development of weapons”. Indeed, the US government designated seven North Korean procurement agents, based in China and Russia, during the pandemic years, along with a range of other operatives involved in cybercrime, arms sales and other revenue-raising activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the reopening of North Korea’s borders, and short-range missile transfers to Russia in the latter half of 2023, North Korea’s procurement networks are likely working at full speed to compensate for difficult business environments during the pandemic, and probably also to fulfil increased production for Russia’s orders, on top of meeting domestic needs. This chapter considers North Korea’s current procurement needs, focusing on evidence, largely from the past five years, of North Korean procurement activity and related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-procurement-secretive-but-ongoing&quot;&gt;Nuclear Procurement: Secretive but Ongoing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is publicly known about North Korea’s nuclear procurement efforts, particularly in recent years, due to the secrecy surrounding its nuclear programme and the limited number of seizures of nuclear-related goods. There is some limited evidence on the public record that goods of use in nuclear applications have been procured in recent years, some as recently as 2021. However, these were goods with both nuclear- and missile-related uses and were procured by networks that allegedly benefited entities linked to the ballistic missile programme, discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most recent publicly known example of nuclear procurement involved vacuum equipment, between 2013 and 2016. A North Korean national, Kang Mun Kil, working on behalf of NCG-related entities, was involved in the procurement of pressure transducers – used to regulate pressure in centrifuge-enrichment facilities – from a Chinese company in 2013 and 2016. Kang also likely used a Hong Kong-based company for nuclear-related procurement until it was dissolved in 2017. Besides information about these purchases, little is publicly known about where the technology for North Korea’s centrifuge programme originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that North Korea manufactures the centrifuges domestically, for which it requires imported advanced machine tools. State media visits to factories have shown that North Korea possessed many of the machines required to produce centrifuge parts a decade ago. As R Scott Kemp noted in 2013, “it appears that North Korea is, at a minimum, well on its way to freeing the centrifuge program from dependence on foreign supplies and technology”. These machine tools are mostly imports, with the public record showing North Korea’s efforts to procure tools from the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 list of “chokepoint” items put together by the UN PoE, detailing “items for its nuclear program which North Korea could seek to procure overseas”, included a range of centrifuge-related technologies. Among these were technologies for centrifuge manufacture (autoclaves, computer numerical control machine tools and high-strength materials) from composite materials (basalt fibre, carbon fibre, filament winding machines, glass fibre, para-aramid fibre) and metals (flow-forming machines, maraging steel); centrifuge facility pipework (bellows-sealed valves); vacuum systems (pressure gauges, pressure transducers, vacuum pumps) and control systems (inverters); and tools for isotopic analysis (mass spectrometers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also been seeking goods for its fuel cycle assets used in the production of plutonium. In December 2023, the country first operated its experimental light water reactor, which had been under construction since 2010. Procurement for this project, as well as for the existing 5 MW and IRT-2000 reactors and reprocessing facilities, is likely to be ongoing. An unnamed UN member state expressed concern that at the end of 2018, North Korea had been looking to procure several dual-use nuclear items. These included: lithium hydroxide, “added to reactor coolants and functions to curb metal corrosion of nuclear reactor cooling pipes in military use”; high-purity graphite, used as a reactor moderator; and Austenitic stainless steel, a material used in nuclear reactors (and also with missile-related applications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the UN PoE’s 2020 nuclear chokepoint list included technologies related to the plutonium side of the fuel cycle. These included technologies related to reactors (pressure vessels) and reactor fuel (zirconium for fuel cladding), as well as reactor moderators (deuterium, heavy water), materials for neutron absorption (boron powder, boron-10, graphite), and equipment for handling plutonium and other isotopes (manipulators, radiation shielding windows), as well as neutron detectors that are used in reactors and elsewhere where there are criticality-related safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond procurement for fissile material production, the PoE has suggested that North Korea continues to procure weaponisation-related technologies. Some of these were included in the 2020 nuclear chokepoint list, including those for preparation of fissile material cores (controlled atmosphere furnaces, isostatic presses), components for a nuclear device (beryllium, capacitors, triggered spark gaps) and nuclear testing instruments (flash X-ray equipment, high-speed cameras). While limited cases have been seen in the public domain, analysis by the PoE suggests that North Korea’s nuclear procurement needs remain wide ranging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missile-procurement-persistent-and-more-prominent&quot;&gt;Missile Procurement: Persistent and More Prominent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more publicly available information about North Korea’s recent ballistic missile procurement, likely in part due to the high levels of concern surrounding recent ICBM testing and the efforts of the US and allies to counter related procurement networks. Indeed, the most recent details about North Korea’s reliance on Western components have come from analysis of the wreckage of short-range missiles fired by Russia at targets in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research published by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) in February 2024 showcased 290 imported components including 50 unique component types in the wreckage of a single missile, likely a KN-23 or KN-24, recovered from Ukraine. These components provide insights into North Korea’s procurement needs for electronics. According to CAR, the components were procured from 26 companies based in eight jurisdictions: China; Germany; Japan; the Netherlands; Singapore; Switzerland; Taiwan; and the US. CAR noted that more than 75% of the components originated in the US, and more than 75% that could be dated were produced between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s reliance on imported electronic components for its missiles is well known, seen in analysed wreckage from the Unha-3 rocket launches of 2012 and 2016. That the wreckage from 2024 contained more than 150 components procured in the past two calendar years shows how active North Korea’s procurement networks continue to be. Recent press reports, however, suggest that at least some of the electronic components that appeared to be from European and Japanese sources were counterfeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other procurement efforts, from as recently as 2023, also suggest North Korea’s reliance on imported materials and components. A 2024 PoE report suggests that in 2023, North Korean procurement operative Choe Chol Min (see Box 4) was “among other activities … involved in attempts to buy inertial measurement units”, likely of use in missile guidance systems. Choe’s wife, Choe Un Jong, was also said by US authorities in 2023 to be purchasing dual-use bearings of use in missile production. The report further noted that in 2023, North Korean procurement operatives “sought to import multiple tons of AlMg6, an aluminium-magnesium alloy, as well as stainless steel sheets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showcasing the quantities of materials imported, at least four orders were also placed in early 2021, overseen by North Korean national Kim Jong Dok. These included “1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel, a special alloy used in missile applications”, with orders totalling more than 80,000 kg, as well as “other missile related technologies, including valves, pumps and ball bearings” and a total of 149,000 kg of other types of steel. A leaked US State Department cable detailing a démarche to China in 2008 notes that 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel was previously used “in a variety of structural parts in Scud B and C missiles”, and the material may have similar uses in more modern North Korean systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 and 2020, Rim Ryong Nam, a North Korean procurement operative based in Shenyang, China, allegedly shipped several tons of aluminium powder, a material of use in solid missile fuel production, to North Korea “on multiple occasions”. A 2020 PoE report noted that North Korea likely needs around 10 tons of aluminium powder annually to support its programme. In early 2018, Rim Ryong Nam was also known to be seeking aluminium powder, as well as other commodities of use in solid-propelled rocket manufacture, including: MAPO, a chemical of use in bonding solid propellant; industrial-use argon; electrolytic copper; metallic chrome; acetone and steel plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the evidence relating to specific efforts to procure goods, the PoE, the US and an unnamed UN member state have provided information about the types of missile-related goods and materials that North Korea has been trying to source in recent years. Most recently, a 2024 PoE report included a schematic of 60 types of “critical items needed” by North Korea for its ballistic missile programme, noting that 23 of these constituted an “identified target of North Korea international procurement between 2018 and 2023”. While the report highlighted the extensive procurement efforts, it also noted that North Korea had “increased its self-sufficiency” in the manufacture of equipment and components for missile production. This included areas related to manufacturing casings and other complex metal parts, airframes and TELs. The report, drawing on UN member state information, also suggested that North Korea continued to be dependent on imports of “specialty steels and aluminium” and higher-grade carbon fibre, although lower-grade materials would suffice for many requirements in the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 US government North Korea Ballistic Missile Procurement Advisory, central to recent US outreach on North Korea procurement, listed eight categories and almost 30 different types of technologies, with a special emphasis on alloys. The information in the Advisory appears to have formed the basis of a 2020 briefing delivered to the PoE which provided more details about North Korea’s capabilities, including chokepoints in production. The construction of extra-large TELs appeared to be something that North Korea had struggled with “for reasons of cost and technology”. In terms of metals, North Korea had “had  difficulty” producing the “quantity and quality” of speciality steels and aluminium. With regard to chemicals used in solid propellent motors, the member state noted that “although the DPRK had manufacturing capacity”, its plant “might not be operating well”, with North Korean engineers having difficulty “producing such materials at the right degree of purity and particulate size”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were similar statements about North Korea’s procurement needs in previous years. Information passed to the PoE by a member state, and published in 2019, indicated that North Korea was procuring goods for processing missile-related chemicals. This included digital indicating controllers, lithium carbonate, sodium fluoride, epichlorohydrin and activated charcoal. A member state also noted that at the end of 2018, North Korea was looking to and may have succeeded in procuring MAPO, “Martensitic stainless steel”, of use in rocket engine parts, and “Austenitic stainless steel”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intangible-technologies-by-any-means&quot;&gt;Intangible Technologies: By Any Means&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond tangible goods, North Korea has also widely sought related intangible technologies. As Philip Baxter and others have noted, North Korea has “pursued a multi-prong strategy to acquire nuclear intangible technology”, adapting its scientific collaborations around sanctions and “coalesc[ing] a cluster of individual researchers and research institutions that are interconnected with each other and with foreign researchers and institutions”. Beyond its international collaborations, North Korea has pursued and likely will continue to pursue, in a more constrained environment, educational and training opportunities overseas, and conduct hacks of technology-holding entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2016 UN ban on scientific and technical cooperation, a 2017 investigation noted that China was home to the “bulk” of North Korean scientists abroad, quoting official Chinese education ministry statistics indicating that 1,086 North Koreans were studying at postgraduate level in China in 2015. The same investigation noted one North Korean scientist studying topics at PhD level related to missile development at one of China’s elite aerospace universities (see Box 3). North Korean students at this institution also downloaded 57,000 research papers on a single day in 2017. A further 2018 study identified 100 published journal articles jointly authored by North Korean and external scientists in areas with significance for WMD and dual-use technologies. This included articles on space- and missile-related technologies, precision machine tools, optical tracking and GPS technology, all authored with Chinese colleagues in 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An investigation in 2017 by The Wall Street Journal highlighted the role of North Korea’s scientists studying in China, and particularly the role of one individual, a scientist named Kim Kyong Sol, who was based at China’s elite Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). The institute ranked highly in areas such as aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, automation and control, and metallurgical engineering. Kim’s area of study was “mechatronics—a blend of mechanical engineering, electronics and programming”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kim’s work concerned “MR damping”, a technology used in stabilising spacecraft and absorbing shock in missile-launch systems, including in submarine platforms. He published some results from his research in 2016 with Chinese colleagues, listing his affiliation as “Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kim Chaek University of Technology, Pyongyang, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”. He also published an article in 2017 co-authored with a senior engineer in the Chinese space programme. In 2021 Kim published an article on a similar topic in a North Korean journal.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Footnotes in the 2016 paper Kim co-authored show the research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, a research foundation directly linked to the State Council of the People’s Republic of China. The funding related to hypersonic vehicles. HIT signed an agreement on cooperation with Kim Il Sung University in 2011.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2013, North Korea sent the first group of 12 doctoral and post-doctoral students to enrol at HIT, with 28 working there by 2015. Kim, and at least 11 other North Koreans, left HIT in summer 2017, with others switching to subjects not covered by sanctions, such as management. According to university staff interviewed by The Wall Street Journal, “The North Koreans all had Chinese government scholarships, they said, which provided free housing and tuition and monthly stipends of about 3,000 yuan ($450)”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean operatives have also hacked foreign companies, including the systems of NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a Russian missile and space company that produces ICBMs, hypersonic missiles and satellites. This intrusion began in late 2021 and continued until the company uncovered it in May 2022, allowing the hackers “the ability to read email traffic, jump between networks, and extract data”. Beyond hypersonic technology (the company produces the Russian 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile), North Korea could have been interested in other technologies developed by the company, for example, ampulisation technology, where liquid-fuelled missiles are fuelled and sealed in the factory, allowing higher combat readiness for extended periods. More broadly, Microsoft noted in a 2023 report that the “North Korean government is assigning multiple cyber groups to meet high-priority collection requirements to improve the country’s military capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-procurement-entities-organisations-and-operatives&quot;&gt;IV. Procurement Entities: Organisations and Operatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such wide-ranging procurement needs, North Korea relies on a diverse network of procurement operatives based in a range of countries, but mostly focused on China and Russia. This chapter considers the organisations, the types of actors working on their behalf, the industry targets these networks seek to exploit, and the procurement intermediaries. Case studies are used to provide further details on the types of actors that coordinate and make up these supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organisations-and-front-companies&quot;&gt;Organisations and Front Companies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many entities involved in North Korea’s illicit procurement operations for nuclear- and missile-related goods, as well as for broader military, chemical and biological warfare, luxury goods and other commodities. North Korea’s sanctions-busting networks are near to global in scope, and their procurement aspects represent a narrower sub-section, based in and around economies with advanced technologies. The entities for which there is open source information likely represent the tip of the iceberg, and also may already be inactive. As a member state has noted: “In order to circumvent sanctions, North Korea changes its import/export-related organisation structures every eight months”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these constraints, Figures 1–3 offer an overview of North Korea’s WMD-related procurement apparatus, showing selected parent entities, state trading companies and front companies. There are likely other front companies and operations that are not detailed in open sources and may even be unknown to interested intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s nuclear- and missile-related procurement infrastructure is spread across several government entities that run front companies which both raise revenue and purchase goods. Of these, least is known about nuclear-related procurement, undertaken by entities such as NCG, falling under the control of the General Bureau of Atomic Energy (GBAE), or the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry (MAEI), as it appears to have been named since 2013. The UN describes both the GBAE and the MAEI as having oversight of the operation of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement for the ballistic missile programme is largely undertaken by entities which fall under the Munitions Industries Department (MID), “responsible for overseeing the development of the DPRK’s ballistic missiles”. Under MID is the Academy of National Defense Science (ANDS, previously the Second Academy of Natural Sciences, SANS), which UN sanctions lists note is “involved in the DPRK’s efforts to advance the development of its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs”. Information provided by an anonymous UN member state notes that ANDS has a “procurement office” that oversees the front companies and procurement agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also falling under MID is the Second Economic Committee, which, the UN has noted, is “responsible for overseeing the production of the DPRK’s ballistic missiles, and directs the activities of KOMID”. MID may also oversee some procurement for the nuclear weapons programme, because it includes the Nuclear Weapons Institute. A third entity, the Ministry of Rocket Industry (MORI), was sanctioned by the US in 2022 and noted to be “owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the MID”. The US State Department has noted that MORI “works with DPRK overseas representatives from other DPRK organisations to support Ministry of Rocket Industry procurement goals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement is also undertaken by entities connected to the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces and the Korean People’s Army. The Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), “DPRK’s premiere intelligence organization”, oversees the arms trading company Green Pine Associated, which has been involved in procurement. The RGB also has been connected to cyber actors such as the Lazarus Group, which in a high-profile case in 2023 hacked a Russian missile manufacturer for sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;notes-applying-to-above-figures-13&quot;&gt;Notes applying to above Figures 1–3:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lines suggest subordination and loose control, rather than necessarily being indicative of supplier relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The figures do not include entities for which there is no evidence of a WMD-related procurement role, even if they are known front companies involved in arms trading or other related activities. Information on entities’ role in procurement can be found in RUSI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dprk-reports.org/&quot;&gt;“DPRK Reports Database”&lt;/a&gt;, which uses information from the PoE reports and details involvement in illicit WMD-related procurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following entities are either not listed in the database or are listed without information about procurement: Korea Kumsan Trading Corporation; Tosong Technology Trading Company; New East International Trading; Ryonbong General Corporation; Korea Kwangsong Trading Corporation; Korea Hyoksin Trading Corporation; Korea Ryonhap Trading Corporation; Korea Ryungsong Trading Company; and Green Pine Associated Corporation. Evidence of the procurement role of these entities (rather than of arms sales, some of which pre-dates the first PoE report in 2010, and even UN sanctions in 2006) has been drawn from US designations, leaked US State Department cables and media articles. The US Treasury suggests that at least one of the four trading companies subordinate to MORI has imported “large equipment manufactured by a European company to North Korea”, without specifying which (all four are included in the figure). See &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0695&quot;&gt;US Treasury, “Treasury Targets Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction Organization and Subsidiaries”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opaque nature of these networks means that it is unclear to which parent entity some of the front companies are subordinate. The front companies likely change frequently to avoid scrutiny. Procurement is known to not have been undertaken by some of the entities in Figures 1–3 (at least according to what can be gleaned from open sources) for a decade or longer. Demonstrating North Korea’s flexibility in managing overseas business affairs, there are also cases (including those detailed below) where individuals working for another part of North Korea’s government, for example as diplomats for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also work on behalf of these procurement entities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;network-actors-broker-diplomat-scientist-spy&quot;&gt;Network Actors: Broker, Diplomat, Scientist, Spy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean operatives work for these entities overseas. There may be tens or even more than 100 of these individuals operating at any one time, although, as a UN member state noted in 2019: “The number of DPRK procurement agents overseas is decreasing and those remaining are focusing on the procurement of critical missile related components as well as dual-use and below-threshold items”. These procurement operatives likely remained overseas during the years of Covid-19 border closures, with Pyongyang only starting to rotate senior diplomats for the first time since the 2020 border closures in late 2023. This section takes a closer look at these procurement agents, as well as other diverse actors involved in technology acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Nodes in North Korea’s WMD-Related Procurement Network (Asia, 2018–present)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures 4 and 5 provide a geographical overview of North Korea’s procurement networks, drawing together data from 2018 to the present. Designations over the past few years have highlighted the role of North Korea’s procurement operatives in China and Russia. For example, in 2022, the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated one Russia-based and four China-based North Korean nationals for their roles in procurement representing “SANS-subordinate organisations”. These included one person in Vladivostok who had procured telecoms-related items from Russian firms, two in Dalian who had procured steel, and two in Shenyang who had procured software and chemicals. This followed the designation of 10 China-based representatives of the Korea Ryonbong General Corporation in 2018. As the press release noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of these individuals are located at Ryonbong representative offices in China near the China-North Korean border, where they support the regime in a variety of ways: the Ji’an office handled large quantities of a wide variety of multi-purpose goods such as chemicals, drilling equipment, hoses, metals, and machines; the Dandong office procured multi-purpose items for North Korean arms proliferators; and the Linjiang office often was tasked to fill orders consisting of high quantities of goods worth several millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recent cases have also involved procurement operatives in China and Russia. In 2023, the US sanctioned a Beijing-based husband and wife procurement team (see Box 4). Recent PoE reports have also emphasised the role of North Koreans based in China, including Kim Jong Dok, who placed orders with another Dandong-based North Korean national, and Rim Ryong Nam, based in Shenyang (see Chapter II).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-procurement-operatives-keeping-it-in-the-family&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 4: Procurement Operatives: Keeping it in the Family&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2023, the US Treasury sanctioned two North Korean nationals for their involvement in the procurement of technology for North Korea’s missile programme. These individuals were Choe Chol Min, “a Beijing-based SANS representative who has worked with DPRK weapons trading officials, PRC [Chinese] nationals, and other associates” and his wife, Choe Un Jong, a Beijing-based North Korean diplomat.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Born in 1978, Choe Chol Min appears to have a background in scientific research. An individual with the same name appears to have published a series of academic papers under an affiliation at the Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang. These papers on materials and castings – if written by the same person – suggest he was well placed to understand procurement requirements and assess potential suppliers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The US sanctions notification noted that Choe “received procurement requests from the DPRK for items and coordinated with associates to fulfill those orders”. It also identifies other activities, including collaborating with SANS representatives “to facilitate the dispatch of over a thousand DPRK workers” to China. These appear to be forced labourers, used to generate funds which are made available for the regime’s use, rather than missile technicians or scientists. The listing also notes Choe’s support to North Korea’s “primary weapons trading entity”, likely to be KOMID, in line with similar US language use, and his work with “DPRK weapons trading officials to purchase electronic equipment for Iranian customers”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Choe Un Jong, “officially assigned” to the North Korean embassy in Beijing, allegedly supported her husband’s work, and “helped coordinate an order with one or more SANS associates for dual-use bearings that are used in DPRK ballistic missile production”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the procurement operatives, North Korea’s diplomats have long played a role supporting the country’s nuclear and missile programmes. This was seen from the earliest days of North Korea’s procurement operations, as they sought to breach the CoCoM embargo. Chapter I describes the role of diplomats such as Yun Ho-Jin and Kim Jong Ryul in Western Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. North Korean diplomats have continued to play this procurement role, alongside their role in holding together North Korea’s broader sanctions-busting networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embassies in several locations have emerged as procurement hubs for North Korea’s WMD programmes, particularly those in more developed countries with close access to advanced manufacturing technologies. In Europe, Germany and Switzerland have traditionally been a hunting ground for North Korea’s procurement operatives. In 2018, a senior German intelligence source noted that the North Korean embassy in Berlin was being used for WMD-related procurement. The North Korean embassies in Moscow and Beijing also appear to have played an important role in procurement. The embassy in Moscow has featured in two recent cases, including one involving O Yong Ho (see Box 5). The embassy in Beijing hosted Choe Un Jong, one half of the husband and wife procurement team described in Box 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other types of diplomatic missions and those adjacent to states hosting WMD-related technologies have also been utilised. For example, diplomats connected to a North Korean trade delegation in Belarus were found to be targeting sensitive rocketry-related information in Ukraine around 2011. The 2018 sanctioning of 10 North Korean procurement operatives included an individual noted to be the “Vice Consul of North Korean Consulate General in Nakhodka, Russia”. A representative of North Korea’s state airline Air Koryo, based in Dandong, is also noted in a US sanctions listing to have been “involved in the transportation of electronic parts from China to the DPRK on behalf of the DPRK’s Ministry of Rocket Industry (MORI)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-5-dodgy-diplomats-technology-from-russia-with-love&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 5: Dodgy Diplomats: Technology from Russia with Love&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O Yong Ho, a commercial counsellor in North Korea’s embassy in Moscow, is alleged to have acted as a procurement agent for ANDS in Russia. A UN member state provided information that alleged that he was “in charge of procurement of civilian production-related and consumer goods in the country” and attempted to procure a wide range of strategic commodities between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These strategic goods included aramid fibre (brand name Kevlar – a type of composite material of use in body armour, missiles and potentially centrifuges), aramid fibre production equipment, “a spinning nozzle”, four chemicals, stainless steel used in liquid-fuelled ballistic missiles, and steels used in submarine manufacture and bearings. The largest quantity of any individual product was submarine steel – the diplomat sought to purchase 3,000 tons (worth more than $10 million). This amount of steel is significant, with the Romeo-class submarine on which North Korea’s new missile submarine is based weighing around 2,500 tons. In 2016, O allegedly brought a delegation of North Korean officials to inspect the metal. In 2017, he sought hot and cold isostatic presses, used in manufacturing nose tips for re-entry vehicles, and nozzle inserts for rocket motors.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O also allegedly sought intangibles. He obtained handwritten instructions for using a specific catalyst in solid rocket fuel from a Russian contact. He also received CAD drawings for a TRDD-50 cruise missile, a Soviet nuclear-capable system first deployed in the 1980s, from a now “allegedly deceased” Russian rocket scientist.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond procurement agents and diplomats, North Korea has also relied on other North Korean nationals for procurement of intangibles – notably scientists and hackers. North Korea has long sought to benefit from scientific expertise overseas, including through trying to attract scientists to North Korea, and sending North Koreans overseas to benefit from education and training. China has been a long-time target of North Korea’s sensitive information gathering, especially in recent years, as its scientific capabilities have grown (see Box 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;targeted-industry&quot;&gt;Targeted Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean procurement operatives target a variety of types of companies that produce the technologies described in Chapter II. This ranges from those who are willing to knowingly supply North Korea to those willing to ignore the full background of those they are selling to, to those who are unwittingly targeted and exploited. The use of procurement agents outside North Korea, intermediaries in third countries (those not hosting the supplier or customer), and the use of a range of deceptive practices have historically allowed North Korea’s procurement operatives – and indeed those of other proliferating countries – to dupe industry that is trying to comply with export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s interest in Russia and China stems from the availability of technology and the prevalence of manufacturers for the goods. Recent cases have reflected this, with Kim Jong Dok placing orders through a North Korean-controlled front company with “several Chinese companies”, allegedly including firms in the cities of Zibo and Shandong. Elsewhere it was noted that he regularly placed orders with unspecified “third country based” companies – presumably those outside North Korea and China. In the case of Rim Ryong Nam, aluminium powder and chemicals were procured from another company in Shandong province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these contexts, some cases show that North Korean agents have built relationships with specific local companies over a longer period – indeed, this would probably be their aim, in order to create a steady supply of technologies. One Russian businessman who sold bearings to North Korea and was sanctioned by the US Treasury noted that he maintained a relationship with a North Korean diplomat based at the embassy in Moscow for several years, and was passed on to the diplomat’s successor when he returned to Pyongyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and especially China, with its rapidly expanding manufacturing base, likely can provide many of the dual-use technologies required by North Korea. However, North Korea’s procurement operatives may still look elsewhere for some technologies to sustain its programmes, either because they seek particular items of the highest quality, or because of a bias in favour of items from specific manufacturers or jurisdictions such as the US, EU states or Japan. These goods may include high-end semiconductors similar to those found in the missile wreckage from Ukraine, or high-end machine tools and spare parts. Procuring from third countries such as China, an enormous and important market for normal and benign exports, likely helps to alleviate some concerns of export compliance officers based in these exporting companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political will on the part of many supplier states to implement both sanctions and export control systems, and their willingness to engage industry to counter illicit procurement, mean that WMD-related procurement efforts more frequently rely on deception. To this end, WMD-related procurement operatives, including those working for North Korea, have developed a range of deception methods over time (see Box 6). Many of these are not new, having also been used by other proliferators to procure technologies in breach of embargoes – from the Soviet Union during the Cold War to Iran, Iraq, Israel, Pakistan and Syria – to supply their WMD programmes. These means of deception are also designed to make it more difficult for export control enforcement, intelligence and customs authorities to uncover illicit procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Goods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By carefully selecting the types of goods they are looking to procure, North Korea operatives enhance their chance of successful procurement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sub-control-threshold items being procured, rather than controlled items, can result in less scrutiny. In some cases, sub-threshold items (for example, electronic components) can be used in WMD programmes, but are more likely to fail in these applications.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Second-hand items are less likely to be viewed as sensitive and are more likely to be sold by those who do not understand the risks of illicit procurement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Industry Targets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Certain types of industry targets will be more susceptible to North Korea’s illicit procurement and WMD-related illicit procurement more broadly, particularly those that work in ways that avoid direct contact with sellers or permit procurement without approaching the manufacturers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Second-hand markets are likely to be less regulated and may facilitate North Korea’s procurement operatives’ avoidance of approaching the manufacturers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Business-to-business websites can allow procurement agents to retain more anonymity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Distributors generally have a lesser understanding of the products and what they can be used for and may be less concerned about reputational risk, since their logo is not on the product.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Naive exporters, for example those new to export or with weak domestic compliance programmes, may undertake limited due diligence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Methods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s procurement operatives will commonly use several methods to deceive exporters and export controllers, often to obscure the true end user or end use.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Third-country entities or transhipment hubs – for example, China, Russia and Hong Kong – are used to route goods and obscure the end-user.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Multiple intermediaries are used to help to obscure the true buyer.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Aliases and a range of different letterheads are used to get around being listed or designated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Falsifying end-user undertaking, making it look as if the end-user has a legitimate civil use for the products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Transfer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Once successfully procured, certain methods will be used to reduce the chances that shipments are interdicted on their route to North Korea.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mislabelling goods in documentation – “machinery” or “spare parts” are less likely to gain attention than listing specific products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Falsifying shipping documentation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Concealment of the goods, for example at the back of a shipping container, or underneath similar but uncontrolled items.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intermediaries-chinese-cross-border-networks-and-moving-the-goods&quot;&gt;Intermediaries: Chinese Cross-Border Networks and Moving the Goods&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of intermediaries in China has been extensive in North Korea’s procurement networks. China has long accounted for the bulk of North Korea’s international trade, and has also emerged as a significant producer of dual-use technologies in recent decades. This has made the border between China and North Korea, and specifically the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge across the Yalu River in the town of Dandong, central to North Korea’s procurement operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large mixed Chinese networks illegally selling North Korean coal in China and using the proceeds to purchase general commodities such as sugar and fertiliser as well as dual-use goods – and potentially nuclear- and missile-related items – and moving them across the border have provided a lifeline for North Korea’s economy and its strategic programmes. A 2020 RUSI report noted the close-knit nature of these networks, highlighting that a small set of 150 Chinese companies accounted for around 20–25% of global exports to North Korea in 2015 and 2016. The report also noted that of these 150 companies’ shipments to North Korea, 93.4% were moved by motor vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the activities of these networks has been more challenging since shipment-level trade data for exports from China to North Korea became unavailable in 2017. However, indictment of two of the larger networks by the US in that timeframe, including that of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd and Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material (see Box 7), provides insights into the workings of these mixed procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-7-the-dealers-of-dandong-the-role-of-chinese-intermediaries&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 7: The Dealers of Dandong: The Role of Chinese Intermediaries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Large cross-border trade networks run by Chinese intermediaries have acted as procurement proxies, enabling North Korea’s designated entities to access the global financial system, and selling North Korean commodities to raise funds in China that are then used to buy much-needed commodities and WMD-related goods.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd (DHID), part of a wider network overseen by Chinese national Ma Xiaohong, was indicted in 2017 for efforts to evade sanctions and allowing North Korea to access the US financial system using a dual-ledger system and many front companies. An internal company PowerPoint slide deck from 2010, published by the US Justice Department with the indictment, claimed that the company accounted for 20% of China–North Korea trade at that time. Other analysis from trade data has echoed the importance of this network, including DHID accounting for $93 million of exports to North Korea between 2014 and 2017, and $532 million of China–North Korea business between 2011 and 2015. Some of the commodities procured through the network included dual-use goods such as aluminium ingots, aluminium oxide and a tungsten compound.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material (also known as Dandong Chengtai Trading Co., Ltd), established in 2005, was part of a second network of companies, overseen by Dandong-based Chinese accountant Chi Yupeng. A confidential source quoted in a 2017 US complaint noted that Dandong Zhicheng imported nearly $700 million of North Korean coal between 2013 and 2017. RUSI analysis of trade data suggests that the company accounted for nearly $500 million of North Korean exports between 2014 and 2017, making it the biggest of the 150 Chinese companies analysed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The proceeds of coal sold through Chinese intermediaries were used to purchase a range of products, including “bulk commodities (sugar, rubber, petroleum products, soybean oil), cell phones, luxury items, or dual-use technology”. A RUSI report identified several companies in Shenyang as likely purchasing front companies, which trade data indicated had exported goods such as arc welding machines and electrodes, thermostats, barometers and spherical roller bearings to North Korea between 2011 and 2017.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As noted by a defector who had first-hand knowledge of Office 39, the office generating revenue for the Kim regime’s personal finances, 95% of funds generated through coal sales are put “toward the advancement of North Korea’s military, nuclear missiles and other weapons programs”. Defector testimony summarised in the case also noted a small number of individuals were key nodes in North Korea’s networks, including Chi Yupeng, who had gained a “trusted position with, and maintained close ties to, North Korean government and North Korean military”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The US sought civil asset forfeitures against these two networks, seeking $74 million from DHID and $4.08 million from the network surrounding Dandong Zhicheng.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these Chinese intermediary networks move vast quantities of goods across the border, other means are also used to move more sensitive goods to North Korea. In the case of O Yong Ho (see Box 5), he planned to move goods – a large quantity of steel – by rail from Moscow to the rail terminal at the border with North Korea. The US designated representatives of state airline Air Koryo for “engaging in transportation and procurement activities”, noting that they “help the airline transport goods back to the DPRK on behalf of two UN- and U.S.-designated entities involved in intelligence activities, arms trade, and the DPRK’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs”. One of these individuals, an Air Koryo “logistics manager”, worked in Beijing to transfer goods to the RGB in Pyongyang, likely by air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the diverse nature of the entities involved in these networks, their geographical locus in China and Russia, and their long experience in illicit procurement activities have made these networks challenging to counter. North Korea’s declining dependency on manufacturing bases beyond China and Russia, its successes, and the changing geopolitical situation necessitate consideration of future trends that will shape North Korea’s procurement networks, which is the focus of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-north-koreas-future-procurement-networks&quot;&gt;V. North Korea’s Future Procurement Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments, including those outside the technical developments in North Korea’s programmes, have implications for the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. This chapter considers some of the main factors that will shape the future of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-procurement-needs&quot;&gt;Evolving Procurement Needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s procurement networks and the technologies they are targeting will evolve in line with the country’s technological needs. As the UN PoE noted, North Korea has been successful in indigenising the production of technologies in certain areas, which may reduce the need to import certain goods. The evolution of North Korea’s programmes will also shape needs, with two examples provided in a recent PoE report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the ongoing shift towards solid-fuel systems, including the potential mass production of the new solid-fuelled ICBM for domestic use, and the short-range KN-23 type missiles for sale to Russia, will create greater requirements for the import of solid-fuel precursors, on which North Korea appears to have some dependency. North Korea’s Five-Year Plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems lists “solid fuel propulsion for submarine-launched and ground-based ICBMs” as a priority area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as North Korea seeks to create greater accuracy for its missile systems, also an objective listed in the 2021 Five-Year Plan, there may be greater demand for guidance components, including “foreign-procured high-quality gyroscopes, accelerometers, complete inertial measurement units and electronics”. Other priority areas listed in the Five-Year Plan may create new procurement requirements, including in relation to military reconnaissance satellites, R&amp;amp;D in hypersonic glide vehicles, nuclear-powered submarines and UAVs. This will likely create greater needs for imports in the shorter term, although North Korea’s indigenisation efforts may offset this in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-north-korearussia-axis&quot;&gt;The North Korea–Russia Axis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s recently renewed relationship with Russia may provide it with access to certain technologies for its WMD programmes, undermining the need to source them from the international marketplace. Media reports surrounding Kim Jong Un’s September 2023 visit to Russia, which included stops at a cosmodrome and a fighter jet factory, suggested that North Korea was interested in “advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could potentially supply many of the technologies that North Korea is seeking for the Five-Year Plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems it adopted in 2021. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated in September 2023 that the UN sanctions were “adopted in a completely different geopolitical situation”. Further technological transfers are likely, although these may stop short of direct support to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, which would be highly controversial. Russia may be incentivised to provide technology to North Korea as a further means of challenging the US and partners, although North Korea’s need for other commodities, including food and fertiliser, for example, means that such sensitive technological barter is not a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-specialised-targets&quot;&gt;More Specialised Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is likely to continue to import tangible items for ongoing production at the same time as seeking more niche and advanced tangible and intangible technologies for its development efforts to fulfil its objectives under the Five-Year Plan. The pursuit of technologies related to hypersonics, missile front-end development, satellites and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, for example, means there must be efforts to tap into a smaller pool of highly specialised targets for key technologies, particularly for intangibles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the possibility of some technology being willingly provided by Russia, the expansion of North Korea’s cyber capabilities means that hacks to obtain sensitive information, such as the hack (linked to the Lazarus Group) of a Russian missile manufacturer, are likely to be more common. A 2023 Microsoft report noted that North Korea’s hackers had targeted national defence industries in at least 16 countries, with the five countries most frequently targeted being Russia (14% of attacks recorded), the US (10%), Israel (10%), Germany (9%) and India (7%). Some of the targets that develop very specialist information, such as universities, research organisations and tech startups, for example in the NewSpace industry (developing access to space and spaceflight technologies), may represent softer targets than government facilities and larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;procurement-for-partners&quot;&gt;Procurement for Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement of missile- and potentially nuclear-related technologies may also be undertaken by North Korea for partners, alongside the transfer of technology from North Korea itself. North Korea has a long history of overseas missile sales for profit, as well as previously selling nuclear technologies to partners (see Box 8). The risks posed by a return to North Korean missile and potentially nuclear exports are growing. From under the security of a nuclear deterrent, with a greater range of products to offer, some of which have been visibly battlefield tested in Ukraine, a sanctions regime near to collapse and a strengthening partnership between existing customers such as Russia, Iran and Syria, North Korea could be in a good place to benefit from sales. The country’s procurement networks, therefore, may be more likely to undertake this procurement for partners in the near future, as well as to fulfil domestic needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-8-a-nuclear-and-missile-supermarket-north-korea-as-procurement-contractor&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 8: A Nuclear and Missile Supermarket? North Korea as Procurement Contractor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has long been an exporter of missile, and in a smaller number of cases, nuclear, technologies. A wide range of customers for missile technology in the 1980s and 1990s has been slimmed down to a smaller number of collaborative relationships, with countries such as Iran and Syria at the forefront. The recent transfers of missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine may lead to a broader renaissance for North Korea’s missile-exporting industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The most significant example of nuclear exports was the assistance that North Korea provided to Syria in the construction of a nuclear reactor at Al-Kibar, which was bombed by Israel in 2007. In a 2017 case, North Korea apparently marketed H-bomb isotope Lithium-6 on a Chinese business-to-business website in an open advert that could be linked through a telephone number to North Korea’s embassy in Beijing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s activities in these areas have involved sourcing materials, goods and components for joint projects, whether Iranian missile projects being undertaken jointly with North Korean technicians in Iran, or goods for the Al-Kibar reactor project. In this sense, North Korea provides a contracting service to its partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-collapse-of-un-sanctions&quot;&gt;Potential Collapse of UN Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s violation of UN sanctions through arms and missile purchases from North Korea could lead to a more extensive collapse of the UN sanctions regime. The regime has been on life support for several years, with a failed attempt to secure a further sanctions resolution in May 2022, and no new entities added to the sanctions list since 2017. The 2024 demise of the PoE due to a Russian veto and Chinese abstention from a vote to extend its mandate is a further sign. Besides Russia, China has long dragged its feet on implementation and enforcement of existing sanctions, and could potentially become a more active spoiler, making life easier for North Korea’s procurement networks. If other UN members recognise that Russia is openly violating sanctions with few repercussions, this could cause other states – many in the Global South are already struggling to implement the resolutions – to ignore sanctions evasion activity on a greater scale. Given that these are not technology supplier states, this may have a limited effect on North Korea’s illicit procurement, but some of these states are well suited to act as third-country transhipment or re-export hubs, which could provide new opportunities for North Korea’s procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-networks&quot;&gt;Evolving Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entities and geography of North Korea’s overseas networks will continue to evolve in a broader sense. The recent decision by North Korea to close around a quarter of its overseas diplomatic missions is an example. As noted above, a 2019 PoE report also noted that the number of procurement operatives overseas was declining. Given the core of North Korea’s procurement networks is already focused on Russia and China, these mission closures are more likely to affect broader sanctions-busting efforts, rather than procurement. However, some of the specific missions closing – such as the one in Hong Kong – could have an important impact on procurement operations. The genesis of the closure of so many missions is unclear, but likely reflects the declining benefits of such a network for sanctions busting, the risks posed by defections and foreign intelligence monitoring, and North Korea’s risk aversion. It also may reflect newer remote-work models of sanctions busting, for example earning revenue through IT labourers or cryptocurrency hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these potential developments suggest that North Korea’s procurement networks will continue to shop for a wide range of technologies, and likely in a more permissive environment. If the UN sanctions regime continues to weaken, a more focused effort to prevent procurement will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes. Judging by its own technology trajectory and other proliferation cases, it will continue to do so in the long term. Over the past decades, procurement networks with tentacles all around the world have been used by North Korea to obtain technology from willing exporters and naive businesses, and through duping those trying to comply with export controls. These networks will continue to be key to the sustainment of North Korea’s programmes and further technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has analysed North Korea’s procurement networks, particularly in light of the successes of the country’s nuclear and missile programmes, and recent geopolitical shifts relating to Russia’s relationship with North Korea in terms of the war in Ukraine. It has drawn on underexploited source material to provide an overview of North Korea’s procurement networks, focusing on the past five years. The paper has found that North Korea’s networks have been highly active, and this is likely to continue as they seek to make up for the slowdown in procurement during the Covid-19-related border closures, and to compensate for goods used in recent Russian orders for missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s procurement networks are largely focused on China and Russia. In these jurisdictions, North Korea’s operatives – trading company personnel, diplomats, intelligence officers, and scientists and researchers – have been able to operate with relative impunity and establish supply chains for a growing number of requisite technologies. However, there are still some requirements that see North Korea looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets to fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing dynamic in North Korea’s renewed relationship with Russia is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. If Moscow were to formally offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang, or to allow North Korea’s operatives to openly shop on a larger scale from Russian providers, this could be bountiful for North Korea’s procurement needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s networks into the future, including evolving procurement needs and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies from a smaller number of niche suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the paper concludes that despite North Korea’s successes, there remains value in seeking to prevent access to, and procurement of, technology (see Box 1). Given this, the paper provides 10 recommendations for those seeking to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement, including government officials, staff at international organisations and researchers outside government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Continue to hone export controls in the West and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls clearly have value, even if they do not prevent all transfers. Resurgent interest in export controls to prevent technology transfer to China and Russia could provide opportunities to identify and build on synergies, particularly given that China and Russia are the two most prominent “third countries” where North Korea’s procurement networks operate. North Korea also clearly relies on many of the same sectors to supply its programmes, including potential overlaps in challenging areas such as microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Continue to build supply-side relationships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls are more effective if a wider range of states agree to implement them. Since February 2022, the US and key partners have built a coalition to implement sanctions against Russia. North Korea should also be factored into this coalition-building, especially given Pyongyang’s growing relationship with Russia. Other forums may also be useful in this context. Regarding Iran, an October 2023 joint statement on ballistic missile activities was released by the US and a group of “Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)-endorsing states” the same day that restrictions under UNSC 2231 expired. Forums such as the PSI may provide opportunities for coordination, given that Russia is a member of other forums where illicit procurement is discussed, such as the NSG and the MTCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Replace the dissolved UN PoE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demise of the UN PoE in April 2024 was a blow for the sanctions regime. However, the PoE’s reports were also heavily constrained by the Russian and Chinese panel members. For example, the 2024 report has minimal references to the recent large-scale arms and missile transfers from North Korea to Russia, which were in breach of the arms embargo. A new body needs to replace the PoE and continue its role in investigating breaches of sanctions and putting valuable information into the public domain. A spectrum of options is available, each with pros and cons. Key trade-offs in any solution will need to be balanced between a broad, official – and likely constrained – UN body with greater powers to solicit information and legitimacy, perhaps through a UN General Assembly monitoring arrangement, and an unofficial body outside the UN with greater freedom and less legitimacy. Other non-UN forums could also form the basis of an effort, for example the G7 or the PSI, although each will bring its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Apply open source intelligence to procurement networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of North Korea’s illicit networks have either been uncovered or knowledge of them has been expanded by open source intelligence. This has been used by the PoE, as well as non-governmental organisations, think tanks and academia. Most recently, open sources have shed light on Russian arms purchases from North Korea. Further resources should be devoted to ongoing open source efforts to explore North Korea’s trading networks, particularly those in China and Russia, as well as connections to its remaining diplomatic networks. Business-to-business websites have provided insights into North Korea’s nuclear marketing activities in the past and may also provide insights into procurement. More resources should be dedicated to ongoing efforts and starting new efforts, potentially in conjunction with a body replacing the PoE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Continue UN sanctions outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outreach on UN sanctions by the US and partners should continue, to ensure that third countries see the importance these states continue to place on a North Korea sanctions regime. This should include outreach on broader sanctions issues, as well as illicit procurement and proliferation finance. Funding states should work together to coordinate their outreach efforts to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Employ new tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New tools should be used to complement this outreach. These include those collating the insights of open source investigation and understanding the entities involved in North Korea’s networks and their corporate structures. This would allow governments to better dig into cases, and the private sector to conduct due diligence and understand their risk exposure. RUSI’s DPRK Reports Database, which collates data on entities from the PoE reports in a structured way – previously unavailable outside the near 6,000 pages of the PoE reports – is an example of an innovative solution that can have real-world benefits for governments, the private sector and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Engage “chokepoint” manufacturers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the debatable utility of the “chokepoint” terminology, the evidence suggests that North Korea does still seek certain items from outside China and Russia. This likely includes certain types of machine tools, and extensive microelectronics. There is much to gain from continuing to engage the private sector, from raising awareness, helping to understand procurement methods and identifying suspicious enquiries. This engagement could also be undertaken jointly on issues related to North Korean, Russian, Iranian and even Chinese illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Engage softer targets on cyber security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National governments should make efforts to engage softer targets, such as start-ups, research institutions and universities, that hold sensitive information, particularly about emerging technologies that North Korea is pursuing, on the threat posed by North Korea’s cyber efforts and relevant cyber-security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Challenge the North Korea–Russia relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burgeoning relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang poses a significant proliferation risk, given Russia’s technology capability and need for weapons and materiel. Russia, and previously the Soviet Union, have historically played a role in nonproliferation efforts, so the willingness to provide North Korea with any technology it requests should not be assumed. North Korea also needs other, more benign, commodities, such as food and fertiliser, as well as strategic technology, so technology transfers are not a given. In view of this, there may be opportunities for quid pro quos with Russia to limit the transfer of nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea – although this is unlikely. Furthermore, the issue of Russia–North Korea bilateral strategic trade could be linked, for example, to potential South Korean provision of missile systems to Ukraine for use against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Consider further use of extraterritorial tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, and to a lesser degree its partners, should consider the use of other extraterritorial tools that have been developed and tested on a handful of nodes in WMD-related procurement networks in China and Russia. However, careful consideration should be made regarding possible political and diplomatic blowback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（31日）踏入第62日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，提及「屠龍」隊長黃振強稱，起初以為另一隊的吳智鴻表示有槍械及炸彈是「吹水」，但經過行山試槍及炸彈一事後，他已知道屬實。控方指，兩人其後在觀塘康寧道球場見面，黃供稱吳談及之後的行動會用槍及 20kg 炸彈。控方表示，吳智鴻一方早有用槍計劃，而經過兩人的見面後，「屠龍」一方與吳已達成協議，12.8計劃已有雛形。控方強調：「串謀無需要10個串謀者坐喺度舉手投票，或者簽紙證實。當然有做就最好，但基本上犯法，所以唔會咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方張銘裕與吳智鴻曾對話有密切關係&quot;&gt;控方：張銘裕與吳智鴻曾對話、有密切關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第二日結案陳詞。控方指，屬「屠龍小隊」的被告張銘裕與同謀者吳智鴻在 Telegram 曾通訊，兩人有密切關係，亦明顯知道吳有槍。張曾跟隨吳前往台灣軍訓，其後黃振強聲稱受傷，找張代為出席11月16日晚的西貢行山試槍。黃向張表示「鴻仔未見過其他 Teammates，淨係見過你，咁淨係信你囉」。另外，黃著張在 Telegram 上找吳，因張當日會應要求帶備柴油，而吳亦有照做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指李家田知行山目的是試槍-又指圍封理大非銅牆鐵壁&quot;&gt;控方指李家田知行山目的是試槍 又指圍封理大非銅牆鐵壁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一被告李家田早前供稱，他以為到西貢行山是一般的行夜山。控方卻質疑，李根本知道行山目的是試槍，因黃曾向李表示「你安全度過今晚先」。李又指，他在行山後進入理大但未能離開，並以「吹水」的語氣向成員表示會出席當晚的大鴻輝會議。控方說法是李當時短暫離開理大，並有出席會議。控方表示：「（警方）圍封 Poly 係事實，但圍封並非銅牆鐵壁。」控方引對話紀錄指，黃問「食乜」後，李回應「M記」。控方質疑，若李真的身處理大未能離開，「會唔會跟得咁貼？」李其後表示「好肚餓」、「等我一陣，好快到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在會議後的一至兩小時，李自行退出群組。控方質疑，成員沒有詢問原因，因他們在開會期間已得知李將會前往理大，「無論佢哋幾後生幾勇武，但係已經一齊作為屠龍群組一段時間，冇提及過佢哋完全冷漠到唔理啲隊友，無端白事走，冇人問過一句。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黃振強與吳智鴻在康寧道見面後128計劃有雛形&quot;&gt;控方：黃振強與吳智鴻在康寧道見面後，12.8計劃有雛形&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黃起初以為吳聲稱有槍械及炸彈是「吹水」，但經過行山試槍及炸彈後，他已知道屬實。吳及黃於11月18日在觀塘康寧道球場見面，黃供稱對方談及之後的行動會用槍械及 20kg 炸彈。事隔兩天黃問吳：「你嗰 20kg 幾時到？」、「我哋夾一夾」、「我哋 Team 諗好點用」。控方指，黃與吳見面後，黃就開始提及 20kg 炸彈。控方說法是，吳智鴻一方早有用槍計劃，而兩人在康寧道見面後，12.8計劃已有雛形，「屠龍」一方與吳已達成協議。控方強調：「串謀無需要10個串謀者坐喺度舉手投票，或者簽紙證實。當然有做就最好，但基本上犯法，所以唔會咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，對話顯示黃曾問「有冇人可以 Keep 眼鏡？阿檸出唔到嚟」。控方提醒，需要考慮為何黃會知道李手上有槍。其後黃表示，翌日去泰國將會向隊員談及有「新 Plan」，同時指不用行「眼鏡 Plan」。其後，黃在群組內談及「20 kg」，控方指沒有成員問是甚麼，他們似乎都理解。控方亦指，張銘裕於11月27日將引爆器影片傳送至「滅龍」群組，但沒有成員詢問是甚麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（1日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指只需證被告加入協議但毋須實行、提陪審團勿帶入政治立場&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qIkLGPS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（30日）踏入第61日審訊。控方開始作結案陳詞，提及本案控罪屬「串謀罪行」，即達成「協議」作不合法行為，控方毋須證明協議成功實行。控方續指，一旦達成協議後，可以「有人進、有人出」，後來加入者只需知道協議目的及自己的角色，毋須知道他人崗位。她引用「打劫」的例子：「我只需要知道目的係打劫銀行，知道我係負責揸車；我唔需要知道邊間銀行，唔需要知道邊個踩線。」至於牽涉籌錢作恐怖主義行為的控罪，則毋須證明與用槍及炸彈相關，只需證明款項用作破壞公共設施及投擲汽油彈等。控方亦提醒陪審員，不論對2019年社會運動取向如何，支持還是反對，但考慮本案時「唔好將自己嘅立場放喺入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方可選擇性相信證人證供&quot;&gt;控方：可選擇性相信證人證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈今作結案陳詞。控方指，陪審員為法理機制中重要的一環，他們作為事實的裁斷者，需考慮控方是否能在毫無合理疑點之下，證實本案罪行。控方指陪審員要考慮是否相信證人或專家的證供，但他們可選擇性相信，毋須盡信。控方舉例，陪審員可選擇是否相信李家田的錄影會面內容：「唔可以話覺得佢靚仔，或者講嘢好聽就信，要聽晒其他證供去選擇」，陪審員亦可以其人生經驗或智慧作出判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方需證明在公共場所或政府建築物-擺炸彈意圖致他人死傷&quot;&gt;控方：需證明在公共場所或政府建築物 擺炸彈意圖致他人死傷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，控方引法例表示，「訂明標的」意指「基建設施、公共場所、政府建築物」。而控罪的元素牽涉在上述地點擺放爆炸性裝置，意圖導致他人死亡或遭受身體嚴重傷害。若陪審員未能就首罪達成裁決，就要考慮作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，但此罪的分別在於「相當可能」會導致相關後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「串謀謀殺」罪，控方指謀殺的對象為警方人員。而在本港法例之下，只需要證明被告有意圖令被殺者受到嚴重身體傷害。控方的立場是，上述3罪均聚焦於12.8計劃，被告是有串謀用槍及放炸彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方籌錢罪毋須證明意圖用錢作128計劃&quot;&gt;控方：籌錢罪毋須證明意圖用錢作12.8計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方指就「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，則毋須證明意圖「籌錢」作12.8計劃，亦毋須證明與槍械炸彈有一定關連性，只需要證明「籌錢」作為恐怖主義行為，包括破壞公共設施及投擲汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方毋須證明非法協議成功實行&quot;&gt;控方：毋須證明非法協議成功實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，本案控罪屬「串謀罪行」，即達成「協議」作出不合法行為，毋須證明協議目的最終成功實行。控方舉例指：「大家可以想像我同我團隊決定打劫銀行，我買槍、你買炸藥、再搵人踩線，咁嘅協議冇可能咁蠢，白紙黑字寫低。」她指加上現代科技的發展，現時有 WhatsApp 及 Telegram 等程式，因此未必會清楚寫下協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方加入協議者只需知目的及自己角色毋須知他人崗位&quot;&gt;控方：加入協議者只需知目的及自己角色、毋須知他人崗位&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，一旦達成協議後，可以「有人進、有人出」，而後來加入者只需要知道協議目的及自己的角色，毋須知道其他人的崗位。她續引用「打劫」的例子：「我只需要知道目的係打劫銀行，知道我係負責揸車；我唔需要知道邊間銀行，唔需要知道邊個踩線」。控方指，在本案中吳智鴻團隊一開始已提及要用槍，其後「屠龍」慢慢加入計劃。控方最後指，雖然警方的拘捕行動令計劃未能完成，但關鍵基礎是本案有協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黃突收錢故賭大咗有幾多後生仔二十出頭見過百幾萬&quot;&gt;控方指黃突收錢故「賭大咗」：有幾多後生仔二十出頭見過百幾萬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就案情方面，控方首先簡述作為污點證人的黃振強的證供。控方指由於黃是認罪後作供，因此陪審員在考慮時要特別小心。控方亦強調，不論陪審員對2019年社會運動的取向如何，是支持還是反對，但在考慮本案的時候「唔好將自己嘅立場放喺入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示，黃接受辯方盤問時，遭指出他為人「貪威識食」、「爛賭」、「賭錢幾大手」。控方又稱，辯方指出黃為人不可信，「明顯想攞最高著數」，而且經常在隊員不知情之下「揸主意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟控方亦指，黃當時任職搭棚工人，正值社會運動之時，「突然不停有錢湧入嚟，百幾萬⋯⋯難聽啲講，有幾多後生仔喺二十歲出頭見過百幾萬。」控方指，黃因此「賭大咗」，並借「屠龍」之名獲取資金，繼續縱容自己的賭博習慣。據黃的證供，「屠龍」成名後獲吳主動接觸，吳亦透露可以找到槍，並想「拉攏」黃的成員加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方炸彈威力大&quot;&gt;控方：炸彈威力大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，警方於2019年12月9日在香港華仁書院檢獲的兩個炸彈，經檢驗後發現內藏金屬釘。控方引述軍火專家報告指，炸彈威力可造成直徑400米內的人死亡或嚴重受傷。控方補充：「炸彈好似好細，但專家話威力就係咁大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;證據顯示吳智鴻及彭軍壕於12月7日至8日，三度前往香港華仁書院。其間吳向黃傳訊息表示：「組裝緊炸彈」、「完成咗個細」。其後兩人要求賴振邦將物資送到港華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方要考慮李家田在錄影會面的狀態-是否似被警打&quot;&gt;控方：要考慮李家田在錄影會面的狀態 是否似被警打&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案僅李家田有出庭作供。控方指，陪審員需要考慮哪些證供屬實。李供稱被警方人員毆打及施行「水刑」共30至45分鐘，但控方卻指：「佢喺錄影會面嘅神態，似唔似俾人打咗30至45分鐘？」控方又質疑，李聲稱遭警方要求記住其他涉案者的姓名，但他在錄影會面時一個姓名都說不出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（31日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

However, it is critical to develop and buy the right equipment due to extremely tight defence budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap, widely available equipment, from drones to laptops propagating viruses, present asymmetric opportunities to terrorists. At the same time, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has restored the threat of peer-on-peer warfare. A range of new technologies, from cyber to artificial intelligence to biological weaponry and, soon, quantum computing, threaten a sudden leap forward in conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters, as an example from as far back as 1982 reminds us. In an attack on Syrian surface-to-air missile sites in the Beqaa Valley, the Israeli Air Force destroyed all 19 sites, together with an astonishing 64 Syrian fighters, without a single loss. With aerodynamically comparable aircraft – and highly motivated pilots – on both sides, it was a single Hawkeye airborne early warning and control system and superior avionics which turned a battle into a turkey shoot. Yet today’s attrition rates in Ukraine emphasise the importance of quantity as well as quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquisition reform is critical, but also a well-trodden area of discussion. While improving defence procurement is a classic “wicked problem” with no easy solutions, we believe there are two areas that the new government needs to focus on. The first is how requirements are generated, and what organisational reforms can improve this process. The second is supply chain management, to enable the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to take advantage of the innovation ecosystem that the UK has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-procurement-requirements&quot;&gt;Defining Procurement Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernard Gray’s seminal report of 2009 on defence procurement had a major impact on the operation of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;amp;S), the sharp end of defence procurement, and he was subsequently put in charge of that organisation. But Gray also had some trenchant analysis on the confused arrangements by which elements of the MoD acted as the “customer” for DE&amp;amp;S. He recommended:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a) DCDS(Capability) to be responsible for the creation and control of requirements, and required to control the budget of the agreed EP as a single point of MoD contact with DE&amp;amp;S for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b) Clear ownership of each project/requirement to be allocated to a single individual within DCDS(Capability) team, including business case formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The average timeline and onerousness of MoD procurement rules out a large proportion of companies with which Defence would benefit from engaging&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, when the UK produced world-class equipment across many categories, the operational requirements branch of each service (as capability directorates were then called) had a cross-section of military officers. These branches included the head at each level, scientists, engineers and finance staff and – crucially – controlled their own budgets, up to certain limits. Ironically, the same period when the sharp end of procurement was greatly improved through the Levene Reforms, with the setting up of the Procurement Executive (now DE&amp;amp;S), the highly effective operational requirements branches, which acted as the “supervising customers” for the Procurement Executive and its predecessor organisations were broken up. In the quotation above, Gray effectively recommended the reintroduction of that original structure for operational requirements. This was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complication was that Lord Levene’s second batch of reforms in 2011 involved delegating more powers to the four relevant top-level budget-holders (TLBs) – the Royal Navy, the Army, RAF and StratCom – but each simply took over its share of each central function, capability, technical and financial, replicating the same stove pipe approach with military, technical and financial staff brigaded separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, each capability function continues to be composed almost entirely of uniformed staff, commissioning work from scientists and engineers concentrated in the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), or in a separate part of their individual service branches, while the budget and – crucially – the authority to spend is held by a third body, such as, in the case of the Army, D Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of innovation units has been set up in each of the four TLBs, starting with JHub in StratCom. Early evidence is that these are getting some small projects from conception to fruition with commendable speed. Helping to take forward their work, and innovation more generally, is the Defence and Security Accelerator. These innovation hubs seem to be structured and to operate in a remarkably similar fashion to the old cross-disciplinary operational requirements branches, but they are effectively operating in parallel with the main capability departments; it would seem to make more sense to fix those structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists from DSTL and the individual services, and relevant financial staff, should be reintegrated, and authority returned for smaller projects. This should empower and motivate staffs, and having technical capability in-house and part of each team’s culture should temper any temptation to go for the first shiny offering from an existing contractor. A further point is that all the uniformed officers are regulars, so there is only reserve input when they choose to ask for it. We believe that this has two serious disadvantages. First, reservists may identify opportunities early in the process of designing a capability so as to make it easier to integrate citizen elements – as the Russians did with the simple and robust T34C, and the Germans failed to do with their excellent but over-complex Panzers. Second, civilians often bring knowledge of civilian tech alternatives (from simulation, to communications, to the software lifecycle) more advanced than military equivalents. So reservist officers should be included in the capability function, on the usual part-time basis as on other staffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the MoD has made remarkable progress is breaking down the traditional structures by which personnel train and upskilled. PUBLIC delivered an innovation programme called the Percy Hobart Fellowship, where Royal Navy personnel were exposed to business, digital, and innovation skills, provided a short secondment into a technology startup, and asked to develop an innovation project predicated around a problem that they had experienced. One of these, the development of a mobile onboard operating theatre, has been taken into the formal procurement process, and is projected to save the Royal Navy £8 million per year against the retrofitting of a standard ship’s medical centre. Although a small example in the grand scheme of defence spending, this illustrates that an empowered individual, with the support of a cross-functional team, can develop requirements that help the MoD buy fit-for-purpose equipment that saves money and delivers what is required to the warfighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also shows that, in the upstream identification of requirements, key MoD decision-makers would benefit from secondments and a general exposure to the innovation, science, and technology world outside Defence. The MoD should provide additional structures and opportunities to encourage networking and knowledge-sharing across different units within Defence, leading to a diffusion of ideas and cooperative networks that can help drive better requirement development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;broadening-the-supply-chain&quot;&gt;Broadening the Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent concern that arises from both defence suppliers and investors is the so-called “valley of death”: the gap between the capital available for small-scale pilots and the funding required to develop a production-ready capability. As a result, defence technology is largely seen as an un-investable market for start-ups, given the level of risk capital required to build the competition and supply chain needed to deliver benefits to MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few factors drive this. The first is the disappointing level of market engagement with a diverse set of suppliers. This is partly caused by strict rules around market engagement, many of them rolled over from EU regulations. However, efforts such as Digital Exploitation for Defence (DX4D) aim to increase the touchpoints with digital solution providers. This is important because the best solutions to a problem have often been identified in adjacent markets. Let us not forget that the genesis of Silicon Valley was the defence industry, with Hewlett Packard selling microprocessors to the US Navy. Hewlett Packard selling audio oscillators to the US military To truly take advantage of dual-use technologies and bring a more diverse set of suppliers into the defence market, the MoD must look to expand its market engagement activities beyond the typical avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second factor is the length of procurement timelines for defence. Particularly for specific technology or software applications, as opposed to platforms, the average timeline and onerousness of MoD procurement rules out a large proportion of companies with which Defence would benefit from engaging. The MoD announced in July 2023 that it intends to reduce the maximum timeline for digital acquisition programmes to three years. However, this remains well outside the typical lifespan of a typical early-stage digital start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the procurement length is the typical size and structure of MoD procurements. The fact that requirements all too often focus on platforms rather than the weapons and capabilities they carry often means that the MoD misses out on applications, tooling or software that might impact specific, well understood opportunities. This leads to a disproportionate amount of spend going through prime contractors. 2022/2023 MoD spend with SMEs totalled only 5%, well below central government’s target of 25%, which shows the degree to which primes and large businesses dominate this market. This compares to 25% of prime contracting value for the US Department of Defence going to SMEs in 2022. While primes have SMEs and innovative businesses in their supply chains, UK primes are under no obligation to produce figures around how much spend makes its way to SMEs. That power differential is felt by companies in Defence; many start-ups in this space report a reticence to engage with primes because of their ability to dictate terms around important issues, such as intellectual property ownership and transfer of risk, that are disadvantageous or even threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if we want to bring greater diversity, competition, and therefore quality into defence supply chains, we must incentivise the risk capital required to scale disruptive digital and technology businesses. Equity investing in defence companies in the UK from 2021–2023 was 0.6% of that in the US. Investors note the availability of small funding sources for pilots, as well as later stage private equity, but a lack of venture investment in mid-tier funding to carry promising businesses through that “valley of death” to implementation. Therefore, the current route to market is to sell early to a prime, or hopefully gain enough traction in adjacent markets that the challenges mentioned above can be mitigated. This is not an effective way of stimulating a market that delivers good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By reshaping the formulation of requirements and the cultivation of the defence supply chain, the UK could bring British innovation back into the heart of its armed forces&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches that the MoD can adopt to address these challenges. There should be central guidance to dramatically increase the pace of acquisition for digital programmes. One approach is to use a procurement method known as a Challenge Programme, which allows departments to demonstrate multiple solutions around a particular problem space, allowing them to see what the market has to offer and create a clear pathway to procurement for successful suppliers. The Home Office Accelerated Capability Environment has been a successful example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the clarity and attractiveness of the defence market to start-ups and innovative SMEs, we would like to see greater pre-market engagement, accompanied by a genuine dialogue with the proposed reconstituted integrated capability staffs, to help define requirements and detailed specifications. Primes should be required to make public their spend with SMEs. This will both make the attractiveness of the market clear, and help government hold these suppliers to account for SME spend targets. A greater effort to break down platform procurements into smaller lots would attract more businesses and increase competition and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have seen positive efforts from NATO’s DIANA accelerator programme to create not only funding, but also paths to market for leading defence startups. But this is not enough if we want to build a world-beating domestic defence innovation ecosystem. Investors need to be brought into the dialogue to understand and feed into MoD priorities, changing the rules of market engagement where necessary. This would provide valuable insight on the state of the art technologically for government, as well as where spending priorities are for the MoD. A funding mechanism, possibly following structures pioneered by the Enterprise Capital Funds programme at the British Business Bank, to incentivise the creation of funds that focus on mid-stage rather than early-stage growth would go a step further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK used to be a shining example of innovation across the G7 and NATO, from Frank Whittle and Percy Hobart to Alan Turing. There are still points of light, like today’s Government Digital Service. Our warfighters and defence staff deserve the very best that the market has to offer. By reshaping the formulation of requirements and the cultivation of the defence supply chain, the UK could bring British innovation back into the heart of its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, warfare at sea has been conducted at a higher level of intensity than has been seen for decades. The conflict in Ukraine, in which the Russian Black Sea Fleet was rendered “functionally inactive” by a country without a surface fleet, and the ongoing battle in the Red Sea have provided analysts and practitioners of naval warfare with a wealth of empirical evidence. It is thus germane to consider what lessons the Royal Navy might draw from these conflicts as the force continues a process of recapitalisation which will extend into the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-anti-accessarea-denial-threat-a-challenge-to-be-contextualised&quot;&gt;The Anti-Access/Area Denial Threat: A Challenge to be Contextualised&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remarkable success enjoyed by an overmatched Ukrainian Navy and the country’s security service against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has, understandably, led some to ponder the question of whether we are approaching a tipping point in the conduct of warfare at sea. The ability of the Ukrainians to combine anti-ship cruise missiles, uncrewed surface vessels and land attack missiles such as Storm Shadow into a layered anti-access area denial threat that has partially forced the Russian Navy out of Sevastopol raises important questions regarding the risks which surface vessels face, particularly in confined waters. The proliferation of these capabilities, many of which are now employed by weaker states and indeed non-state actors, will mean that what would have been largely uncontested deployments at sea in the past will involve contested theatre entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, claims regarding the risk to surface combatants themselves should be scrutinised. In the Black Sea, despite high losses in aggregate, the Russian fleet has not endured a historically high loss rate. Over the course of the two and a half year conflict, Russia has lost 22 vessels, which amounts to a loss rate of 0.03 per 100 ship days in theatre. For reference, the US loss rate against Japanese Kamikazes off Okinawa was roughly 0.2 per 100 ship days (with vessels sustaining damaging hits at a rate of 0.44 per 100 ship days), and the UK task force in the Falklands endured 1.35 damaging hits per 100 ship days – despite which both navies prevailed. In effect, then, it is not clear that the vulnerability of vessels to the anti-access threats of yesteryear, be they crewed suicide aircraft or Exocet missiles, was less acute than is the case now. The importance of not overstating the risks to surface vessels has been reinforced in the Red Sea, where the Houthis have thus far failed to successfully engage a coalition surface combatant and where UK and US vessels have enjoyed tactical successes against complex salvos incorporating capabilities such as C-802 anti-ship missiles, Samad-3 UAVs and Asef anti-ship ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, a limited loss rate can have crippling cumulative effects on a fleet over time, as it has had on the Russian Navy. This is true of all forces, but the risk is especially acute in maritime warfare as vessels are increasingly difficult to replace. This in many ways reinforces a classical principle: if a navy has a choice between seeking decision early (even at some risk to its forces) or conserving capability, it should generally opt for the former option. A conservative approach creates false efficiencies, reducing loss rates at any given time but raising the risks of a long war which many navies may not be able to sustain, irrespective of how low they can keep their loss rates. Of course, a navy cannot always force a decision in war – in truth, there was no way the Russian navy could have shortened the conflict. However, its losses in a long war still reinforce the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If a navy has a choice between seeking decision early (even at some risk to its forces) or conserving capability, it should generally opt for the former option&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in both the Black Sea and the Red Sea large surface combatants have been relatively safe, the same cannot be said for less heavily armed vessels and the fixed infrastructure that supports the fleet. Many of Ukraine’s successes have been achieved against platforms such as the Ropucha-class landing ship (which serves as a logistical workhorse for the Russian army) as well as minesweepers and patrol boats. In the Red Sea, the Houthis have enjoyed a comparatively high hit rate against merchant shipping. While warships themselves may not be more vulnerable, the threat that anti-access systems pose will be most acute for the lightly armed (or unarmed) oilers and solid support vessels that enable the Royal Navy’s operations. The effect of this will be significant when limited numbers of support vessels are available. Additionally, while tasks such as mine countermeasures have always had to be conducted under some risk of an air threat, the UK’s (Royal Fleet Auxiliary-operated) mine countermeasures vessels will face an increasingly multilayered anti-access challenge, incentivising uncrewed solutions which can be employed from greater distances and multiple vessel types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed infrastructure has also proven vulnerable even under optimal conditions. The ability of Ukraine’s armed forces to progressively target both vessels and structures in Sevastopol, which is defended by a robust integrated air defence system, illustrates that over time even relatively well-defended fixed bastions will be challenged by cruise and ballistic missiles, among other threats. For the UK, home ports such as Portsmouth are relatively safe. In the absence of a Russian intermediate-range ballistic threat, the primary threat is posed by cruise missiles, which – if launched from the eastern flank – would have to traverse a considerable amount of territory. There is a real threat posed by cruise missiles launched from Russian bombers, surface vessels and submarines from the northern flank, although even in this case, once an Allied maritime component command is stood up, the vulnerability could only be exploited if Russia was willing to risk losing key strategic assets. At home, the risk is likely to be most acute in the early stages of a conflict. That said, key seaports of disembarkation on which elements of the Royal Navy (and the wider UK joint force) would depend in an expeditionary context are far more vulnerable by dint of proximity to likely theatres of combat. Examples include Duqm in Oman and Gothenburg in Sweden. The latter, as Scandinavia’s largest port, has been an important logistical lynchpin of exercises such as Trident Juncture, which included the Royal Navy and Marines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which Russia had to eventually defend Sevastopol with not just air defences but also helicopters and barriers (to respectively slow and engage UAVs) also carries more tactical lessons. Of note is the important role played by Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft against unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which are able to remain below a surface vessel’s radar horizon for extended periods, but which are vulnerable to air attack. This could have ramifications for the Royal Navy’s Merlin and Wildcat fleet, which will also be needed to support other functions such as anti-submarine warfare (ASW), among other tasks. The addition of roles for an already stretched helicopter force might be avoided through the use of autonomous systems, and engaging surface targets in clutter may be an area where machine learning and computer vision – as well as the non-lethality of the engagement – can allow autonomy to be exploited quickly (as contrasted with more complex tasks such as ASW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk to logistical nodes will reinforce another challenge: the difficulty of achieving magazine depth. This is partially a function of cost, since interceptors such as the Aster-15 and 30 cost much more than many of the missiles they may have to intercept. It is also, however, a function of the fact that vertical launching systems (VLS) cannot be safely replenished at sea in even moderate sea states. The likelihood that vessels will expend their VLS loadout, coupled with a risk to any allied or sovereign forward bases on which they may have planned to rely, could – in extremis – force the rotation of Royal Navy vessels to home ports, significantly impacting their operational tempo. Fleet sustainment, rather than protection, may be the biggest challenge in contested theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final notable feature in both the Black and Red Sea has been the role of third-party ISR provision. While the extent of the Allied role in providing ISR to Ukraine in the Black Sea cannot be known, it is understood that the US is providing data from space-based ISR to Ukraine 32 times per day, and that Western surveillance platforms have conducted patrols over the Black Sea. In the Red Sea, Iranian special-purpose vessels such as the Behshad have provided cueing to Houthi missile batteries ashore, a role also performed by the Iranian vessel Saviz during the Saudi-led coalition’s campaign. A sub-peer opponent backed by a state source of adversary ISR that cannot be targeted for political reasons will pose a challenge to many concepts for countering anti-access/area denial (A2AD) which depend on destroying or crippling an opponent’s sensors (which may not be an option in indirect conflict). A range of options of varying complexity and risk – from jamming and cyber attacks to covert sabotage (likely conducted against the Saviz by Israel) – are available to navies, but the risks and costs of these options need to be weighed ahead of time as do the cross-service and cross-government dependencies they create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-regarding-the-pacing-opponent&quot;&gt;Lessons Regarding the Pacing Opponent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two conflicts have also illustrated a number of things about putative opponents that the Royal Navy may face, most notably Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s failures in engaging dynamic targets at sea over the course of the Ukraine conflict have been considerable. To use one example, the Russian navy and air force failed to fix and engage the Ukrainian navy’s last surface vessel – the Yuriy Olefirenko – for months, even when it was deployed at relatively close proximity to Kherson to provide naval gunfire support. The inability to engage the vessel at sea (it was eventually sunk in port), despite Russia enjoying air and naval superiority in the Black Sea during 2022, would appear illustrative of broader problems with aggregating data from multiple sensors and tasking platforms dynamically. This may reflect challenges in the stated desire to aggregate information from multiple service branches without reaching back to a higher headquarters or involving multiple separate command chains. While the failure to track a relatively conspicuous amphibious vessel was likely a failure of organisational structures rather than sensors, Russia will struggle in the latter regard as well. Though it aspired to replace the Soviet-era Tselina and Legenda constellations with a robust network of Pion-NK, Lotos and Persona satellites equipped with ELINT, COMINT and EO sensors, it had by 2021 launched only one Pion-NKS satellite, and fields a very limited EO capability. In the absence of a space-based ISR capability, Russia’s ability to track dynamic targets at long distances (except through very non-granular tools such as the Polsodnukh-E OTH radar) will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the methods which NATO has used to employ maritime power as an asymmetrical competitive tool vis Russia – including the deployment of ELINT spoofing on islets in the Aegean during the Haystack exercises and Ocean Venture, which saw emissions-dark carrier operations in Norway (where terrain added an additional layer of complexity to air-based tracking) – may be tactically feasible vis a Russia that does not employ the sophisticated A2AD capability that China does. Towards the end of the Cold War, an inability to perform dynamic tracking led the commander of the Soviet Northern Fleet to request a trebling of his budget, and was a major factor in Soviet assessments of the conventional balance. This is, in principle, good news for a Royal Navy that will be built around aircraft carriers for the foreseeable future. However, the ability to perform these actions during the Cold War depended in great measure on US aircraft carriers and was, moreover, a product of sustained training in complex waters such as those on the Norwegian coastline where operating large vessels requires considerable skill. Any European effort to replicate this (of which the Royal Navy could be an important part) would need to account for fewer available US capabilities in the event that the Indo-Pacific absorbs more capacity. Munitions sustainment and enablement will have to be accounted for, particularly given the small numbers of munitions capable of suppression of enemy air defences, such as SPEAR-3, that are likely to be available. In effect, then, Cold War concepts for employing forces forward to impose multiple dilemmas on a continental power remain tactically valid, but this will only be true if they can be resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many of the challenges of greatest significance relate to generating the capacity to leverage existing capabilities and competencies effectively&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major lesson regarding the Russian navy as an opponent, which became particularly stark after the loss of the Moskva, is that the Russian navy is designed to have strategic effects from relative proximity to its ports. From positions in Crimea, the Russian fleet – which is the only service equipped with the 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missile – has been a key component in Russia’s strike campaign against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure which is fixed and easier for Russia to target with complex salvos. Ukraine has progressively degraded this threat, but at a likely considerable cost in missiles. While it is not known exactly how many Storm Shadow/SCALP and Neptune missiles have been used against Russian ports, it is understood that 300 missiles were provided to Ukraine and that striking the Black Sea Fleet was a priority line of effort for Ukraine’s strike campaign. Moreover, each reported cruise missile strike appears to have been preceded by days of attacks using UAVs, possibly alongside other shaping activity. For navies such as the Royal Navy (and indeed the UK joint force), the challenge is not that sinking the Russian surface fleet will be inherently difficult, but rather that if the fleet opts to launch cruise missiles against civilian infrastructure from positions close to air defence networks in Kaliningrad and the northern bastion, there will be a political demand to engage it (irrespective of the military value of doing so) and the task will be a burden in terms of both planning and munitions expended. Given the likely demand for standoff munitions elsewhere in the theatre, this is of importance. Surface strike, then, is a priority line of effort even if the Russian surface fleet is a decrepit force. The requirement to engage targets within well-defended bastions while accounting for limited VLS capacity into the 2030s, even after vessels such as the Type 26 and Type 31 enter service, will make it of particular importance that weapons such as FC/ASW are able to achieve a high Single Shot Probability of Kill in defended airspace, since the smaller a salvo, the more important penetration and successful engagement becomes. Though Russia’s nuclear-powered submarines are its most potent capability, the Russian naval threat is not just a submarine threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflicts in the Red Sea and Black Sea carry a number of important lessons which might inform the Royal Navy’s efforts to generate its future fleet. In many ways, the technological dimensions of these conflicts – though the most heavily studied – have been less important than the fundamental lessons that they carry regarding how a fleet must structure and prioritise tasks to prepare for major contingencies. The lessons learned from these conflicts, then, have an evolutionary quality where many of the challenges of greatest significance relate to generating the capacity to leverage existing capabilities and competencies effectively. Technology can be an important enabler in this regard, but is not a solution in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, Jordan is rarely spoken about in politics or in the media as much more than an anchor of stability in an increasingly fragmented Levant region. To its north lies southern Syria, where Assad has managed to wrestle back nominal control of provinces by striking deals with warlords who collect rent from drugs production. Iraq and Lebanon, two of Jordan’s close neighbours, are captured states, where non-state actors supported by Iran have taken control, and strengthen their grip on power every day through normalising corruption and dispensing patronage to their supporters. To Jordan’s west are the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel, where Israel’s war on Gaza continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan, in comparison, maintains an air of stability, with a stable monarchy and democratic elections. Despite this, Jordan is in a uniquely difficult position due to instability caused by Israel’s war in Gaza and the worsening economic conditions within the Kingdom. Before the 7 October attack, Jordan already struggled with high unemployment, particularly among young people (aged 15–24), at over 40%. Since the conflict began, this problem has been exacerbated by a catastrophic drop in tourism and trade. Tour guides and tourist businesspeople this author spoke to reported almost endemic booking cancellations, with no promise of future work. Jordan’s economic model relies heavily on tourism, and the collapse of that market leaves thousands more unemployed or without income. Jordan’s economy also relies on foreign aid and support, much of which comes from multilateral institutions such as the UN. The withdrawal of US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is a sobering prospect for Jordanian policymakers, who rely on the work of UNRWA to support the two million registered Palestinian refugees currently in Jordan. In this way, UNRWA, UNHCR and the myriad NGOs within Jordan cover gaps in welfare that the Jordanian civil service simply does not have the money or capacity to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socially, Jordan is in similar disarray. There have been almost daily protests in Amman and other major cities regarding the country’s close relationship with Israel. There have also been specific cases where protestors have targeted government buildings, a recent example being a protest attempting to storm the Israeli embassy in March 2024. At the heart of these protests is the long-established Palestinian community. Palestinians make up over half of the Jordanian population, and feel frustrated that Jordan continues to cooperate with Israel politically and militarily. Particularly incendiary was Jordan’s participation in the Middle East Air Defence Alliance response to Iran’s strikes on Israel in April 2024. The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, replied to accusations by explaining that the motivation was simply to defend Jordanian airspace, but many within Jordan continue to interpret the intervention as a stance in defence of Israel. In an era of unprecedented social media use, Jordanians are consistently confronted with harrowing images and videos from inside Gaza, further inflaming tensions. Antisemitism is also widespread in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As a pivotal UK ally in the region, Jordan and its stability should be of paramount concern for UK policymakers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of an anti-Israeli sentiment in Jordan or the wider Middle East is hardly a novel phenomenon, and neither is Jordan relying on foreign aid to stave off economic collapse. However, the region’s fragmentation brings a set of novel and unique challenges to Jordan. One of these challenges is that Iran and its proxies are increasingly identifying Jordan as a potential vector for their shadow war with Israel and the West. Iran has excelled in its policy of establishing a network of dissident groups across the region, whether in Lebanon with Hezbollah, Iraq with Shiite Militia Groups, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen or Polisario in the Maghreb. Iran has continued this opportunistic support of groups in Jordan. Examples of this include weapons- and drugs-smuggling across the vast Iraqi and Syrian borders; hacking support targeting the Jordanian government; rhetorical support of dissident groups; and criticism of the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of increased great power competition, Keir Starmer and his ministers have stressed at every opportunity that their focus and priority is European security. While the UK has clear economic and energy security dependencies on the Gulf, the same is not true of the Levant region. It is clear that there is very unlikely to be new funding from the UK in the region, and we can also rule out interventionism of the kind we saw under past Labour governments, as the US looks set to concentrate resources around China. The combination of a lack of resources and the fact that what limited resources are available are focused on Europe leaves UK policy on the region at an inflection point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-jordan-actions-for-the-uk-and-international-partners&quot;&gt;Securing Jordan: Actions for the UK and International Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s long-term economic weakness, coupled with an increasingly fragmented regional security landscape, poses an increasing threat to the only stable country in the Levant. As a pivotal UK ally in the region, Jordan and its stability should be of paramount concern for UK policymakers. A weak Levant region directly impacts the UK through migrationary pressures, the export of terrorism, and the disruption of key supply lines and international trade. So what can the UK and its allies do to mitigate Jordan’s instability and support Jordanians in their struggle for a better future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, ending the conflict in Gaza would significantly alleviate pressure on Jordan. David Lammy began his tenure as Foreign Secretary by correctly pointing out that the UK has limited influence in bringing this about, then visited Israel, and the OPT, and called for an immediate ceasefire. Realistically, the UK has very limited scope for unilaterally bringing about an immediate ceasefire, though Lammy may feel that calling for one will begin to tip the pressure dial in Washington. The UK government should instead concentrate on supporting the US in its negotiating efforts and ensuring that post-conflict initiatives include steps towards establishing a Palestinian state. Still, while the UK has limited prospects for singlehandedly bringing about an immediate ceasefire, it has enduring credibility that can be leveraged with future Israeli governments. UK officials should emphasise to future Israeli governments the dangers of allowing internal political struggles to lead to breaches of conventions regarding the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and settler activity in the West Bank. Additionally, the UK should maintain and expand its policy of identifying and sanctioning those involved in illegal settler activities in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UK must persist in providing direct support to Jordan, particularly through government projects aimed at capacity building. Historically, UK spending in Jordan has largely been directed towards military training and democratisation. A shift in focus towards enhancing the capabilities of increasingly strained Jordanian government departments is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the UK should advocate for sustained regional and international support for Jordan. This includes ensuring the continued operation of multilateral aid agencies in Jordan, especially given the critical gaps left by the US withdrawal of support for UN organisations like UNRWA and UNESCO. If direct economic aid from the UK is not feasible, diplomatic efforts in the Gulf should prioritise generating and coordinating regional aid for Jordan. This could include bilateral aid packages as well as multilateral regional and international agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jordan stands at a critical juncture amid regional turmoil, grappling with economic fragility exacerbated by external conflicts and internal dissent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the UK should engage in regional and international discussions on addressing Iran’s influence. Since the collapse of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal – there has been a lack of coherent strategy, contributing to tensions on the Israel–Lebanon border, the security vacuum in Yemen, and instability in Iraq. Acknowledging this issue is crucial for any UK efforts aimed at regional stability. The new government should prioritise convening and supporting regional initiatives, in collaboration with the US and European allies, to prevent Iran from perpetuating instability. Iran’s threat to regional peace and security must be taken seriously and acknowledged for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan stands at a critical juncture amid regional turmoil, grappling with economic fragility exacerbated by external conflicts and internal dissent. The country’s stability remains pivotal for the broader Levant region, making it imperative for the UK and its allies to take proactive measures. Addressing the conflict in Gaza, advocating for Palestinian statehood, and maintaining diplomatic pressure on Israel are immediate steps, but the UK government needs to delineate a coherent strategy. While Jordan currently outperforms its troubled neighbours, complacency will not ensure sustained stability unless proactive measures are taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，辯方昨日作中段陳詞，要求法庭就黎面對的3項控罪裁定表證不成立。3名國安法指定法官今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）宣布，裁定黎所面對的3項控罪表證成立，需要答辯。經30分鐘休庭，辯方指給予法律意見後，黎選擇親自作供，另擬傳召一名專家證人就社交軟件 Signal 作供。由於3名法官在8至10月均有其他案件要處理，未能立即聽取黎的證供。經商討後，最終押後至11月20日續審，屆時黎將出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3罪表證成立-黎智英選擇親自作供&quot;&gt;3罪表證成立 黎智英選擇親自作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首被告黎智英（76歲）由懲教人員押解往法院應訊。法官杜麗冰宣布，黎所面對的3項控罪均表證成立，需要答辯。辯方隨即申請休庭30分鐘以向黎索取法律指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再次開庭之後，辯方代表、資深大律師彭耀鴻指，已給予黎法律意見，而黎選擇在本案親自作供。另外，辯方擬傳召一名專家證人，就社交軟件 Signal 作供，預料證供內容圍繞技術層面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3法官均另有案件處理-控辯雙方商討後-押後至11月&quot;&gt;3法官均另有案件處理 控辯雙方商討後 押後至11月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，就時間而言，法官李運騰下周有個人事務，難以出席本案；另外，3名法官在8月有其他案件要審理，直至8月29日之前都未能處理本案。至於10月，法官杜麗冰表示有一宗高院案件需要續審，料需時3星期，而該案已經押後多時，不能再調動。法官李運騰則關注，黎已還柙一段時間，案件應盡快續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及黎智英的證供需時多久。辯方指，預計主問需時5日。法官李運騰聞言則指，本案涉及文章數量眾多，預料控方會以雙倍時間作盤問，因此主問連同盤問應該合共需時3至4星期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經休庭商討，控辯雙方最早可以出席續審的日子為今年11月20日，這樣黎作供可以一氣呵成，而毋須打斷。辯方表示，辯方案情需時約30個工作天。最終法官杜麗冰押後至11月20日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方中段陳詞黎網上節目提及制裁-不等於呼籲外國制裁&quot;&gt;辯方中段陳詞：黎網上節目提及制裁 不等於呼籲外國制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀發布煽動刊物罪，辯方的中段陳詞指，涉案報導和評論牽涉公眾利益，發布僅為了引起公眾關注，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且言論和新聞自由均受憲法保障。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀勾結外國勢力罪，辯方指黎在2020年7月起的網上對談節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁；黎與嘉賓僅評論國際事務，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法前協議均為合法-國安法後便沒有達成新協議&quot;&gt;辯方：國安法前協議均為合法 國安法後便沒有達成新協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀」這一項控罪元素，辯方指在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他被告協議做的事，包括「一人一信救香港」、國際登報計劃等行為，均是合法；即使在《國安法》生效之後，上述行為變得不合法，但是黎與他人再沒有新的犯罪協議，因此不存在「串謀」。惟法官質疑，控方的說法是指稱黎在《國安法》生效之後，相關協議仍然繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given these contradictions, what are the ties that bind these two figures?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cement of the relationship between Venezuela and Iran is perhaps best described by the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Their shared priority is to ensure their respective regimes’ survival in the face of perceived threats, with the United States as the primary foe. Ayatollah Khomeini, the first leader of the Islamic republic, dubbed the United States the “Great Satan,” while Chávez referred to former U.S. president George W. Bush as “the devil.” This rhetoric and outlook matches that of Russia and other active rejecters of the U.S.-led international order; indeed, Russian president Vladimir Putin has spoken out against the “collective West” in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western observers have focused their attention on joint connivances of Russia and Iran in Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East, where Russo-Iranian military-security operations directly affect U.S. and European interests, the Western Hemisphere is not isolated from the two countries’ quests for global influence. In fact, in many ways it is an essential piece of the puzzle. First, both Iran and Russia perceive Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as a fertile ground for exploiting popular resentment vis-à-vis the United States and the “collective West,” which they — rather successfully — harness to advance their view of a multipolar world. Second, LAC partners could prove instrumental in offsetting the impacts of Western sanctions against Moscow and Tehran by mitigating their diplomatic and economic isolation. Finally, certain LAC countries could also serve as less scrutinized partners for further developing Russo-Iranian warfare capabilities or cooperation, sheltering mercenaries or militias — such as Hezbollah — and acting as vectors for “horizontal escalation” of conflicts in which Russia and Iran are currently involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Western observers have focused their attention on joint connivances of Russia and Iran in Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East, where Russo-Iranian military-security operations directly affect U.S. and European interests, the Western Hemisphere is not isolated from the two countries’ quests for global influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines Russia’s and Iran’s creeping influence over the Western Hemisphere, assessing the historic legacy as well as the current diplomatic, economic, informational, and military-security links that contribute to the region’s continued willingness to engage with these two countries. It then offers analysis and recommendations to Western policymakers, outlining new approaches the transatlantic community should adopt to contain potential Russo-Iranian coordination in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anti-western-sentiments-as-historical-entry-points-for-russia-and-iran-in-lac&quot;&gt;Anti-Western Sentiments as Historical Entry Points for Russia and Iran in LAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a long history of engagement with LAC countries, dating back to the nineteenth century, when the Russian Empire opened embassies in Brazil and Mexico in 1828 and 1890, respectively. Moscow’s presence on the continent only grew under the Soviet Union, and especially during the Cold War era. The Soviet leadership focused on countries where it could capitalize on existing anti-U.S. sentiment and interstate and intrastate rivalries. For instance, the Kremlin provided extensive military-security and economic assistance to Argentina, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Peru to support revolutionary movements. By doing so, the Soviet Union aimed to undermine U.S. standing and strengthen its footprint on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly established Russian Federation was unable to provide financial or security aid to LAC countries and was forced to disengage. Furthermore, in the 1990s, as Russia sought rapprochement with the United States under President Boris Yeltsin, the strategic significance of LAC in the eyes of Moscow diminished. While Yeltsin visited the United States four times during his eight years of presidency, he did not make any trips to LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attempt to establish and maintain amicable relations with the United States did not mean, however, that the Russian political elite had fully disregarded the geopolitical importance of LAC countries. The Primakov doctrine — named for Yevgeny Primakov, a foreign minister and prime minister under Yeltsin — famously posited that, as the West was meddling and exerting influence in Russia’s “backyard” through NATO expansion and the imposition of the U.S.-dominated world order, Russia’s presence in its opponent’s “near abroad” was crucial to level the playing field. Consequently, as U.S.-Russian bilateral relations became more tense starting in the mid-2000s, Moscow began resuscitating diplomatic, economic, and security ties with its former Cold War allies Cuba and Nicaragua and built new relationships with other regional powers antagonistic toward the United States, such as Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Russia, albeit comparatively limited in scale, Iran’s entry into LAC was preceded by revolutionary regime change and the anti-U.S. sentiments it unleashed. In 1979, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a leftist insurgency spearheaded by Daniel Ortega, deposed the dictator Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. That same year, the shah fled Iran, ushering in the modern Iranian theocratic state with Ayatollah Khomeini at its head. While the two movements had starkly different ideological origins, they shared a common opposition to the United States, rooted in Washington’s support for the regimes they had ousted. By the early 1980s, Nicaraguan and Iranian leaders were discussing cooperation and efforts to balance vis-à-vis both the United States and the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the close of the Cold War, Iran found its appeals to anti-U.S. sentiment losing saliency in the hemisphere as many of the militant leftist groups in the region laid down their arms or negotiated peace. In their place, Iranian proxy Hezbollah established a beachhead in the region. Its affiliate, Islamic Jihad, claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, while Hezbollah allegedly masterminded the devastating 1994 bombing of the Argentinian Israelite Mutual Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not until the mid-2000s and the height of LAC’s “pink tide,” which carried a series of socialist and otherwise U.S.-skeptical governments into power, that Iran’s engagement with the hemisphere took on a more robust, institutional character. The Chávez government in Venezuela was especially important in opening the door for Iran. In addition to their shared derision of the United States as a geopolitical demon, Chávez and former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad actively worked to cultivate like-minded LAC governments. Venezuela’s oil wealth and diplomatic clout gave it a powerful platform to advocate for an expanded role for Iran in the hemisphere, and between 2005 and 2009, Iran opened embassies in six new countries in the region: Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Uruguay. This policy has continued for the most part, especially as the Trump administration’s pursuit of a maximum-pressure sanctions campaign against both Venezuela and Iran caused these two governments to double down on their bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as Russia and Iran continue to face mounting political and economic pressure from the United States and its Western allies, expanded ties to countries in LAC, rooted in history, can serve as an important release valve for both Moscow and Tehran. Strengthened relations, not only with staunch anti-U.S. governments like those in Cuba and Venezuela but also with regional powers such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, could help Russia and Iran mitigate the impact of sanctions and offer them much-needed legitimacy on the world stage. Regular visits by high-ranking Russian and Iranian officials to the region have proven a comparatively low-cost means of challenging Washington’s preeminence in LAC. While these visits often tend to focus on the hemisphere’s three consolidated dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — Russia and Iran continue to seek political, economic, and military-security relations with a broad array of LAC countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;converging-patterns-of-russian-and-iranian-engagement-in-lac&quot;&gt;Converging Patterns of Russian and Iranian Engagement in LAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing consensus among policymakers in the United States acknowledges the Western Hemisphere as a new frontier in geopolitical competition, especially following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which has emboldened authoritarian regimes to more directly challenge the U.S.-led international order. However, most analyses of great power competition in the region have focused their attention on China as the U.S. rival with both the desire and resources at its disposal to challenge Washington in its neighborhood. By contrast, neither Russia nor Iran (commonly considered “junior partners” to China in the region) possess the economic heft to comprehensively engage all countries in LAC. Instead, both have relied on asymmetrical strategies to undermine U.S. objectives and support a small set of regional allies who serve as springboards for further influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a lack of economic clout may in fact make Russia and Iran more threatening actors in the short term. Unencumbered by China’s need to manage perceptions and diplomatic relations across more than two dozen countries, Russia and Iran can double down on disruptive and destabilizing practices. More troubling still, there is mounting evidence that, in some sectors at least, Russia and Iran may not merely be pursuing parallel strategies but could be moving toward a more coordinated approach to engagement with the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomatic-relations&quot;&gt;Diplomatic Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s post-invasion diplomatic approach to Latin America has been guided by its updated foreign policy concept, which posits an imminent decline of Western hegemony and the emergence of a multipolar world order. For instance, during his tour of the region in April 2023, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized Russia’s respect for the sovereignty of Latin American nations, referring to the region as one of the emergent centers of the multipolar world despite U.S. “bullying and imperialism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cnXstoy.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro meet at the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas in April 2023. Lavrov called for like-minded countries to “join forces” against Western sanctions “blackmail” as the longtime diplomat continued his tour of Latin America.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a majority of the region has voted in favor of UN resolutions decrying Russia’s war on Ukraine, Moscow has managed to secure sympathy and tacit support from regional powers. For instance, Brazil, under the presidency of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula), has repeatedly championed peace proposals for the Ukraine war, most recently with the release of a set of “common understandings” between Brazil and China on the contours of a possible settlement. However, Lula has faced criticism for his perceived bias toward Russia in these negotiations. Indeed, following a 2023 tour in which he claimed that both Kyiv and Moscow shared the blame for the conflict, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby accused the Brazilian president of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula is joined in the bid to forge peace in Ukraine by outgoing Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (colloquially known as AMLO), who put forth his own peace plan in the summer of 2022. AMLO, who has previously rejected U.S. intelligence claims that Mexico City is the world’s biggest Russian espionage hub, proposed a plan calling for an immediate ceasefire and the launch of a dialogue to address the war’s underlying causes. Ukrainian diplomats rejected this option as a de facto freezing of the front lines that would allow Russia to maintain its military presence in occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, neither Brazil nor Mexico signed on to the final communiqué issued at the June 2024 summit on peace in Ukraine. Regional dissonance over the correct path to a negotiated settlement in Ukraine helps muddy the waters on peace and indirectly allows Russia to undermine efforts to build a truly broad-based international coalition dedicated to a just settlement to the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Iran’s diplomatic approach toward Latin America is built on its claims to be “a nation unjustly harassed by the West,” which help it gain sympathy and secure political and economic support from the states that are either antagonistic or ambivalent at best toward the United States. For instance, in June 2023, when now-deceased Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi visited Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela for the first time since taking office, he highlighted the need for the revolutionary movements in both Iran and LAC to reassert their independence and sovereignty. “The Americans have always considered you, Latin America, as their backyard. But thank God, now you have sovereignty,” the Iranian president remarked. Raisi left the region having secured dozens of agreements with his LAC counterparts in the energy, agriculture, healthcare, education, information technology, and maritime transportation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, Iran has maintained close diplomatic relations with Bolivia. The two nations have signed defense and security agreements that might have included the delivery of Bolivian passports to Iranian citizens. As Argentina’s minister of security, Patricia Bullrich, pointed out, such an agreement, if confirmed, would open a door to Iranian citizens with Bolivian passports across the hemisphere — a strategy that Tehran has already used in Venezuela to infiltrate the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza has also severely damaged its relations with LAC, presenting another opportunity for Iran to make inroads in the region. Keystone countries including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico have condemned the Israeli government’s prosecution of the war. The broad support among LAC governments for the Palestinian cause is primarily driven by domestic political dynamics, not foreign influence. However, as the rift between Israel and the region grows, Tehran could seize on these new openings to advance its diplomatic rhetoric as the self-proclaimed leader of the “axis of resistance.” The recent election of a more reform-minded candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, as the country’s new president is also unlikely to significantly change Tehran’s engagement with LAC as, in his own words, “[t]here is significantly more potential for cooperation between Iran and the countries of Latin America than what is currently being realized.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javier Milei’s Argentina is nevertheless a major outlier, being one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel and of Benyamin Netanyahu in particular, the first leader whom the Argentinian president visited after his election. Argentina was the sole LAC country to vote against the UN General Assembly’s motion to recognize Palestine as a full member of the body, and it has designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. This political dissonance with the rest of the continent is a source of tension, with Argentina’s security minister Patricia Bullrich accusing Bolivia and Chile of being hotbeds for Islamist groups and ordering reinforcements to the borders with these two countries, prompting them to pull their ambassadors from Buenos Aires. It also created a major spat between Argentina and Iran, with the latter’s integration into the BRICS in January 2024 having been a key factor in Milei’s decision to walk back his predecessor’s decision to join BRICS+. Following Buenos Aires’ designation of Hamas as a terrorist group, Tehran issued a stark warning that it “will make [Argentina] regret its enmity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s and Iran’s diplomatic engagement with LAC, especially following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has in large part been based on presenting the West as an oppressor, which LAC countries could counter by exercising their right to sovereignty and supporting the establishment of a new, multipolar world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;influence-operations&quot;&gt;Influence Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media environment in LAC presents the lowest barriers to entry and consequentially has been a sector where both Iran and Russia have made significant strides separately and, at times, in coordination. The Kremlin has been relying on the Spanish-language affiliates of state-backed outlets, such as RT Spanish (television and online) and Sputnik Mundo (radio and online), to spread Russian propaganda and disinformation on the continent for more than a decade. With Mexico often serving as a hub for Russian disinformation operations, these outlets overwhelmingly focus on the United States, questioning its domestic and foreign policies. According to U.S. intelligence reporting, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has used media contacts in 13 countries across the continent, including Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela, to weaken international support for Ukraine. RT, Sputnik, and their regional affiliates have disseminated conspiracy theories about “denazifying Ukraine,” alleged Ukrainian aggression against Russia, NATO expansionism, and “staged recording” of civilian deaths in Ukraine. They have also depicted ongoing sanctions against Russia as beneficial for the West but harmful for the global economy and food security. In December 2023, RT Spanish even won four prestigious awards from the Mexican Press Club for its coverage of the war in Ukraine, illustrating a stark disconnect in regional perceptions of Russian news sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The media environment in LAC presents the lowest barriers to entry and consequentially has been a sector where both Iran and Russia have made significant strides separately and, at times, in coordination.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian influence operations are not only concerned with shaping attitudes toward foreign policy. In Colombia and Mexico, Russia has reportedly sought to sway the results of key elections in favor of Moscow’s preferred candidates, through its official media platforms as well as through networks of trolls, bots, and regional pro-Kremlin affiliates. In Mexico, RT Spanish broadcast a long-running video series entitled “The Battle for Mexico,” which cast then-candidate López Obrador in a favorable light as the only leader willing to confront the United States and preserve Mexican sovereignty. In Colombia, Russia-linked bots on Twitter (now known as X) were found to have promoted Gustavo Petro’s candidacy in 2022. The extent to which such efforts swayed the final result should be treated with a degree of caution, as both Petro and López Obrador won due to a confluence of factors. Nevertheless, election interference efforts remain among Moscow’s most corrosive tools to undermine democracy and sovereignty worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s Spanish-language media agency HispanTV has made similar strides in the region. In doing so, it has benefitted from partnerships with fellow authoritarian-leaning media outlets, which help amplify and advance its messages. National security analysts Douglas Farah and Alexa Tavarez have demonstrated, for instance, how Venezuelan outlet teleSUR, RT, and HispanTV often cite and recite one another’s work and rely on similar sets of pro-authoritarian journalists based in the region to convey their messages. These so-called “super spreaders” advance common messages critiquing U.S. policy toward the region as imperialist and uplifting the approaches of Iran, Russia, and China as seeking to challenge malign U.S. hegemony while encouraging economic development among LAC countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence between Russian and Iranian influence operations could be observed less than a month before the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On January 28, 2022, an article by Pablo Jofré Leal appeared in HispanTV calling for an “alliance against [U.S.] hegemony” to be spearheaded by Russia, China, and Iran. Leal, a Chilean journalist and frequent contributor to HispanTV, RT Spanish, teleSUR, and many affiliated websites, has acted as a key node for translating messages from Moscow and Tehran for a regional audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the traditional media space, organizations like Nova Resistência, a neofascist organization and part of the broader New Resistance organization inspired by the ideas of Kremlin-backed philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, have worked not only to advance pro-Russian messages but also to praise the actions of Iran and Hezbollah. A 2023 U.S. Department of State report found that the Brazilian Nova Resistência chapter was “particularly active” in convening events, writing articles, and disseminating physical pamphlets and posters advancing pro-Kremlin narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even absent formal coordination between Iran and Russia in the information space, their methods and objectives for fomenting anti-U.S. sentiment enjoy strong complementarity. As the cases of Pablo Jofré Leal and Nova Resistência also demonstrate, the audience for such messaging within LAC enjoys a high degree of overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-and-economics&quot;&gt;Energy and Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s economic clout in LAC is marginal, especially when compared to that of the United States and the European Union, which remain the key investors in the hemisphere, comprising 38 percent and 17 percent of Latin America’s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 2022, respectively. The major recipients of Russian FDI in the region include Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and these investments tend to focus on the extractive sectors, including minerals, oil, and gas. Bilateral trade between Russia and LAC countries stands at around $12 billion, with Russia mainly exporting fertilizers, mineral fuels, iron, and steel to the region (primarily to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s small economic footprint in LAC, the Kremlin has expressed strengthened interest in the region’s energy sector in recent years and, in certain cases, has even managed to challenge the Western companies operating on the ground. Brazil presents a noteworthy example in this regard, replacing Turkey as the largest purchaser of Russian diesel in October 2023. Overall in 2023, Brazil imported 6.1 million tons of diesel with a value of $4.5 billion from Russia — a 6,000 percent increase from the 101,000 tons of Russian diesel worth $95 million that it imported in 2022. Such a sharp rise in Russian diesel market share in Brazil, from virtually zero in 2022 to 50 percent in 2023 and 70 percent in 2024, has in large part resulted from its competitive pricing — one of the effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Highly reliant on cheap diesel to keep its economy moving, Brazil’s decision to pivot away from the United States in favor of Russia can further increase Moscow’s diplomatic and economic ties with Brasília, securing support from the largest country in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Brazil, Cuba and Venezuela also represent interesting case studies for Russia’s renewed focus on making inroads into the Western Hemisphere’s energy sector. In March 2023, Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s state oil company Rosneft, visited Havana and Caracas to discuss energy cooperation with the two countries. A year later, 90,000 metric tons of Russian oil arrived in Cuba to offer some relief to an island mired in power outages and gasoline shortages. Sanctioned by the United States, Cuba’s communist government has once again found itself beholden to the Kremlin, bringing additional revenue and economic and political opportunities to Russia. In the case of Venezuela, while Rosneft was pressured to cease its operations in Venezuela in 2020, Sechin’s visit amid the war in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed against Russia might imply and lead to renewed energy cooperation between the two countries. (In the past, Moscow relied on Rosneft to both expand the company’s portfolio and advance the country’s geopolitical interests vis-à-vis Caracas.) These intentions were reiterated during Lavrov’s visit to Venezuela in February 2024, with the Russian foreign minister promising to boost joint oil and gas production and foster “peaceful use of nuclear energy” in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, however, Moscow’s efforts have gone nowhere. In Argentina, Novatek — Russia’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) — reportedly offered the Argentinian government the technology to build an LNG plant, but talks between the two parties broke off without a deal. In Bolivia, Gazprom — a Russian state-owned oil and gas company that has been present in the country for more than a decade — has failed to drill and develop any natural gas or oil fields during this period, prompting criticism from local experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has nevertheless made some advances in the clean energy and mining space, with state-owned firm Rosatom signing a $450 million deal in 2023 as part of a bid with China to develop Bolivia’s lithium reserves, estimated as the largest in the hemisphere. Overall, while Latin America’s energy sector is promising for Russia — especially following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has forced Russian companies to look elsewhere for energy deals and investments — it is still rife with risks, limitations, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Russia, Iran’s economic influence in the hemisphere has been limited and primarily focused on energy cooperation. In Venezuela, Iran’s presence has had an outsized impact on the ability of the government of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, to remain in power. Iran’s expertise navigating mass international pressure was invaluable for the Maduro regime to retain oil revenues in the face of U.S. sectoral sanctions on the energy sector after the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. Venezuela shipped crude oil to Iran, Russia, and China in return for financial assistance and cheap gasoline to maintain fuel subsidies in a time of economic turmoil. Venezuela has also relied upon Iranian technical assistance, inking a deal with Tehran in 2022 to help repair Venezuela’s El Palito refinery to the tune of some €110 million (up to $120 million). Iranian technical support has been essential as Venezuela struggles to bring its hollowed-out oil sector back to life in anticipation of the lifting of sanctions. Tehran also significantly benefits from this arrangement, having leveraged its partnership with the Maduro regime to build and sell Iranian cars and reportedly acquire over a million hectares of farmland in Venezuela to support Iran’s agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases discussed above show that the energy sector could be another area ripe for cooperation between Iran, Russia, and their allies in the Western Hemisphere, especially Venezuela. While all three countries are ostensibly competitors in the global oil market, the layers of sanctions they face have engendered a peculiar form of covert camaraderie. Russian joint oil ventures with Venezuela produced an estimated 120,000 barrels per day in 2022, or more than one-sixth of the country’s total oil production. Venezuela, in turn, has relied heavily on Iranian tankers to launder its oil and deliver it to buyers — most often to China. Each country has therefore seemingly intuited that they have more to gain from attempting to subvert U.S.-led sanctions together than by forging their own path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This arrangement appears to have frayed in the months following the October 2023 Barbados Accords, when the United States began issuing licenses to companies to resume oil production in Venezuela. Now able to trade oil with U.S. firms for cash in hand rather than fuel, Venezuela’s trade with Iran plummeted from 2022 to 2023, leading to a diplomatic scramble by the two countries to restore their alliance. However, with the reimposition of U.S. oil sanctions on Venezuela in April 2024, energy cooperation between Venezuela, Iran, and Russia may be set to increase once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Military-Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s engagement with LAC countries has been guided by the aforementioned Primakov doctrine — the idea that Russia should engage with the “near abroad” of the United States in response to Washington’s meddling in internal affairs of the countries Moscow views as its “near abroad.” This is particularly true against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. For instance, in June 2022, Nicaraguan president Ortega authorized the entry of Russian troops, military ships, and aircraft into Nicaragua to assist with military training, law enforcement, and humanitarian aid. Russian state media has linked the Russian military deployment in the country to U.S. engagement with Ukraine, with one television host stating, “If American missile systems can nearly reach Moscow from Ukrainian territory, it is time for Russia to roll out something powerful closer to the American city upon a hill.” According to some estimates, up to 3,700 Russian troops have participated in different military trainings and exchanges with the Nicaraguan army between 2014 and 2024. Russia has also operated a Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) satellite ground station in Nicaragua since 2017 (Moscow also operates four other ground stations further south in Brazil). Located just outside of the capital, Managua, the facility has raised concerns that it could be used to intercept satellite communications close to the equator, where many of the U.S. critical assets are located in geostationary orbits. Finally, Moscow has helped train the Nicaraguan National Police, implicated in serious human rights abuses, from its U.S.-sanctioned counternarcotics center, also in Managua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2022, Nicaraguan president Ortega authorized the entry of Russian troops, military ships, and aircraft into Nicaragua to assist with military training, law enforcement, and humanitarian aid. Russian state media has linked the Russian military deployment in the country to U.S. engagement with Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another especially symbolic display, a contingent of Russian soldiers took part in Mexico’s Independence Day parade in 2023. Meanwhile, Russian military exercises in the Caribbean, which included port calls in Cuba and Venezuela, have been framed by some analysts as a direct response to the Biden administration’s decision allowing Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S. weapons systems. While the detachment posed little practical threat to U.S. national security, similar deployments may become more frequent as Russia looks to convey power and prestige on the world stage and continue to apply pressure to the United States within its neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k3fpDtQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A woman and a girl wave as frigate Admiral Gorshkov, part of the Russian naval detachment visiting Cuba, leaves Havana Harbor. The detachment visited Cuba in June 2024 amid major tensions over the war in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to military deployments and joint training exercises with its partner countries, Russia has been supplying Latin America with arms. From 2000 to 2023, Russia was the number three supplier of weapons in the hemisphere, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), behind only the United States and United Kingdom in sales. However, since 2019, according to SIPRI data, Russia has not made any major sales in the region, and with the Russian defense industrial base geared primarily toward its own war effort, it seems unlikely that Moscow will be able to reenter the market in a meaningful way anytime soon. Still, Russian arms provide continued influence over Latin American states. Countries such as Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru, which operate stocks of Russian-supplied weapons, still rely on Moscow for maintenance and upkeep. Colombia, for instance, is struggling to maintain its fleet of Soviet-designed Mi-17 military helicopters, which the local authorities have said is the direct result of the war in Ukraine. The region has also rebuked efforts by U.S. and European leaders to sell their legacy Russian and Soviet arms to Ukraine, even with assurances of replacements. Ecuador came closest in February 2024, offering to sell $200 million worth of outmoded Russian and Soviet equipment to the United States (which could presumably pass this along to Ukraine), only to backpedal in the face of Russian economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While joint trainings, dual-use facilities, and the deployment of military assets have all featured prominently in Russia’s playbook in the region, these tactics have also increasingly become part of Iran’s tool kit for engagement in the Western Hemisphere. For instance, the drop in Russian arms sales has been accompanied by a spike in Iranian weapons to the hemisphere. This has been driven by one country, Venezuela, which in 2023 acquired at least six Peykaap-III fast attack boats, along with an estimated 25 anti-ship missiles. In April 2024, reports also surfaced that Venezuela’s National Bolivarian Armed Forces were developing a loitering munition dubbed the “Zamora V-1” based on Iranian Shahed 131/136 drones. These drones have been widely used by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, thus enabling Tehran to combat test, improve, and promote Iranian-made weapons and technology globally. Details at the time of this writing are scarce, but Venezuela has demonstrated a capability to replicate Iranian designs, with an undisclosed number of Mohajer drones having previously been produced under license in Venezuela. Cooperation on drone production and local upgrades to Iranian drone models have helped Venezuela build technical expertise and capacity within the country’s arms industry, helping state aerospace company EANSA to become a capable manufacturer of combat drones in its own right. The Maduro regime’s growing partnership with Tehran in the defense space is especially troubling in light of Venezuela’s escalating rhetoric toward its neighbor Guyana over the disputed Essequibo territory. Cruise missile–toting fast attack craft and loitering munitions could allow the regime to menace shipping and oil platforms off the coast of Guyana, mimicking the tactics of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea and imperiling Guyana’s burgeoning offshore oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond arms sales, Iran’s security cooperation with the hemisphere has been far less mature, often relying on non-state proxies. In 2022, for instance, a Venezuelan 747 cargo plane with both Venezuelan and Iranian nationals aboard was detained in Argentina over suspicions of conducting espionage and smuggling on behalf of Iran’s Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps sanctioned and designated as a terrorist entity by the United States. Iran’s 2023 naval world tour, which included stops in Brazil and transit through the Panama Canal, also illustrates how the rotation of military assets through LAC provides a means of asymmetric escalation against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;proxies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Proxies and Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Tehran are both proficient in the use of non-state proxies to advance their interests, and the Western Hemisphere is no exception to this. The Iranian-backed militia group Hezbollah embodies this dynamic. The group’s successes at orchestrating large-scale terror attacks in the 1990s continue to shape regional perceptions today. With a decades-long presence in the region, Hezbollah continues to operate in the so-called Triple Frontier region between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Hezbollah’s operations have shifted northward to Venezuela, where it has allegedly embedded itself in criminal networks to facilitate money laundering and illicit financial activity. Former Venezuelan vice president Tareck El Aissami reportedly served as the intermediary between the Maduro government and Hezbollah, helping launder money for the group through contacts in the Colombian company Importadora Silvania. Furthermore, during his tenure, El Aissami was said to have arranged for members of Hezbollah to train on Margarita Island with members of the colectivos, Venezuela’s pro-regime paramilitary, thus maintaining a level of distance from formal state-to-state relations. A string of other high-profile money laundering cases over the past 20 years, from Paraguay to Colombia, has led one analyst to remark that Hezbollah “has achieved what other large terrorist groups could not, entrenching itself within the complex web of TCOs [transnational criminal organizations] and substate actors in a region far removed from its founding territory and spiritual heartland.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC’s varied reactions to the war in Gaza will likely shift these dynamics in unpredictable ways. Brazil and Colombia have both taken steps to curtail their relations with Israel over its conduct of the war, with the latter going so far as to sever relations entirely. Both countries had long-standing security cooperation with Israel, including a joint operation between the Mossad and Brazilian police in November 2023 that resulted in the arrest of two alleged Hezbollah operatives planning a series of attacks. However, strained relations with Israel may complicate future cooperation and intelligence sharing on Hezbollah activities in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, by contrast, is a comparatively recent entrant in its use of armed proxy groups within LAC. Perhaps the most notable episode occurred in 2019 when, amid mass unrest and fears of a potential coup against Maduro, some 400 Russian mercenaries, allegedly from the Wagner Group, arrived in Caracas to provide security for the embattled president. Similar to Wagner’s activities on the African continent, the private military contractors reportedly remain active, training the Venezuelan armed forces and protecting mining operations in the country’s Orinoco region. In May 2023, leaked U.S. national security documents showed that Wagner may have attempted to reprise this role, this time leading a scouting visit to Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As LAC continues to grapple with resurgent transnational criminal organizations, there may be opportunities for Russia or even Iran to provide further security assistance. China has already exploited a perceived gap in U.S. security sector support to stand up at least 11 private security firms in the region. Meanwhile, Russia has proven adept at leveraging security challenges in Africa to expand its influence and fill its coffers. Russian private military contractors like the Wagner Group and its successor, the Africa Corps, are by now infamous for their ruthless counterinsurgency deployments in the Central African Republic, Mali, and Sudan. As electorates throughout the Western Hemisphere call for forceful action to be taken in the face of worsening criminal violence, the “brutal but effective” methods employed by authoritarian proxies may take on heightened appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran are selective in their engagement with countries in LAC. While they cultivate close ties with the hemisphere’s three anti-U.S. dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — they simultaneously work to gain ground in more neutral or U.S.-skeptical countries, such as Brazil and Mexico. Furthermore, as this paper has argued, Moscow and Tehran do not act in isolation from one another and are in fact increasingly pursuing convergent and coordinated goals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia and Iran are selective in their engagement with countries in LAC. While they cultivate close ties with the hemisphere’s three anti-U.S. dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — they simultaneously work to gain ground in more neutral or U.S.-skeptical countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should strive to do the same in its response by partnering with like-minded allies both within LAC and across the Atlantic. In doing so, Washington should seek to strengthen its relationships with friendly nations, disrupt the ability of its foes to coordinate, and devise a resource-backed counteroffer for those countries within LAC that currently prefer to sit on the fence between the United States, Iran, and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen partnerships with friends.&lt;/strong&gt; Building partner capabilities in the media and cybersecurity space are essential elements to helping counties in LAC better insulate themselves from malign influence operations. These sectors present the lowest barriers to entry and are the areas where Russia and Iran are most clearly coordinating. To counter Moscow’s and Tehran’s inroads in the media space, the United States should look to expand scholarship programs for journalists based in LAC to help cultivate a new generation of reporters. By investing in young reporters from a diversity of backgrounds, the United States can help shape a media environment that is more discerning, critical, and capable of counteracting authoritarian political narratives organically.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LAC’s cyber defenses face a shortage of resources and strategy across the board. However, there are promising signs that like-minded countries are beginning to take concrete steps to shore up these vulnerabilities. Costa Rica may be an especially key ally: it was the only LAC country to sign on to U.S. sanctions against Russia in 2022, and it was the victim of a devastating ransomware attack by the Russia-affiliated Conti hacker collective. U.S. Southern Command has already allocated nearly $10 million to assist Costa Rica in building up its cybersecurity capabilities. Broadening these efforts to bring in additional interested parties by establishing a cybersecurity center of excellence within the hemisphere, among other measures, could help elevate the conversation and further insulate allies from malign interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disrupt and deter coordination among authoritarian adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; It has become increasingly evident that dictatorial regimes across the world pursue a common “playbook” to stifle domestic opposition and resist international pressure. Countering this requires the democratic powers of the world to devise and articulate their own playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Curbing illicit financial flows is one especially important effort in the Western Hemisphere, as governments like Venezuela and Nicaragua rely on their international connections to keep their hands on the reins of power. A new investigation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control into the universe of trade ties from Russia and Iran in LAC could provide novel insights and help better calibrate sanctions efforts against these regimes as well as the hemisphere’s dictatorships.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should also pay close attention to military-technical cooperation between autocratic regimes. Chinese, Iranian, and Russian arms have all been used as part of Venezuela’s effort to intimidate and coerce Guyana, while Venezuela’s interest in coproducing loitering munitions with Iran would provide Caracas with a worrying new capability if carried to fruition. Limiting the extent to which hemispheric adversaries can benefit from this cooperation will be crucial to managing interstate tensions and escalation dynamics in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articulate a counteroffer for fence-sitters.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, for its part, should continue to emphasize and draw attention to Russian war crimes and abuses in Ukraine. But messaging will not be enough on its own, and a more fulsome, resource-backed effort is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While Russia and Iran lack the economic dynamism of China, they remain capable of applying significant pressure to regional governments unprepared for it. The case of Ecuador’s about-face on delivering arms to Ukraine following Russian sanctions on its banana industry is particularly illustrative. Russia also remains a key supplier of fertilizer to Brazil’s all-important agricultural sector. The United States, in partnership with the European Union, should look to map potential vectors for Russian and Iranian economic pressure and seek to strengthen U.S. and EU cooperation to minimize these.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should also seek to compete more effectively in the energy and minerals sectors. Like its engagement on the African continent, Russia has used targeted overtures in nuclear power and conventional fuel sales to expand its leverage even as a web of international sanctions encircles Moscow. Bolivia and Brazil, for instance, have both cooperated with Russia on nuclear power projects in the past two years. Meeting regional demand for power and clean energy investment will be crucial to weakening this hold, and in doing so will clearly demonstrate that the United States and its allies can deliver on the economic front for their partners in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because the perception of the United States can sometimes be negative across the continent, Washington could also benefit from cooperating with other non-LAC like-minded partners that do not face similar levels of public wariness. Chief among them is the European Union, which is showing increasing interest in the region, as displayed during the Spanish presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2023 (despite the irritant of stalled free-trade agreement negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur — the trade bloc consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). This could also be the case with some of the closest U.S. Indo-Pacific partners who have a history or expressed interest in closer ties with the continent, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Although all these countries are trade competitors, they share similar strategic objectives, and while their focus has been on the threats and challenges posed by China, Iran, and Russia in Eurasia, they should consider LAC a full-fledged — not marginal — theater of strategic competition. They should harness their respective competitive advantages to build offers catering to LAC’s most urgent needs in terms of infrastructure, energy, security, and defense, as well as in the informational space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

It also highlights the serious challenges Washington and Taipei must address to have a ready response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 18, 1931, a Japanese infantry regiment conducted a “false flag” attack on the Japanese-owned South Manchuria Railway, detonating an explosive near a stretch of the track and blaming the operation on Chinese troops nearby. The next day, in response to the alleged sabotage, Japanese troops attacked a Chinese military garrison. Within months, the Japanese army had conquered Manchuria and made it a puppet state. Although a commission formed by the League of Nations eventually unraveled the deception and concluded that Japan had illegally invaded China, the international community took no meaningful action, in part because the active period of crisis had settled into a new normal and political will had evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 80 years later, in February 2014, soldiers wearing uniforms without insignias or other identifying information surrounded Ukrainian military bases and seized strategic points in Crimea. Although many observers immediately suspected that these “little green men” were Russian troops, Moscow claimed that they were “local self-defense units” acting on their own initiative. The Ukrainian government quickly lost control of Crimea, which was formally annexed to Russia. Meanwhile, Russian special operations forces began quasi-surreptitiously supporting separatist uprisings in Eastern Ukraine, an operation that eventually led to the full-scale Russo-Ukrainian war that is still underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States and its allies are focused on the threat of an even bigger war: a possible Chinese assault on Taiwan and the cataclysmic, world-changing conflict it could provoke. But in contemplating Chinese moves against Taiwan, it is worth keeping these earlier incidents in mind because they highlight an important if underappreciated fact: great powers pursuing revisionist aims often seek to disguise their actions, create a cloud of uncertainty around them, or achieve gains through a sequence of “salami slices” in order to increase the odds of a successful fait accompli that will decrease the costs they must pay for their aggression. As Washington ponders China’s next steps vis-à-vis Taiwan, it is vital to understand how Beijing might utilize subterfuge, “salami slicing” tactics, and wedge-driving strategies to isolate Taiwan and ultimately compel “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper does not take the position that China has abandoned or will abandon the possibility of a more dramatic, full-on invasion of Taiwan, should Chinese leader Xi Jinping conclude that the road to “peaceful” annexation is closed (although the two authors of this report do differ in their views on how likely this scenario is). The potential for an outright invasion is real, and the consequences of such a gambit would be dire. A Sino-American war over Taiwan would be a global catastrophe, and it is imperative for Washington and its allies to do all they can to deter such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet China has more than one way of coercing Taiwan into political capitulation. Indeed, the more successful Washington and its friends are in deterring the “D-Day” scenario, the more Beijing may be incentivized to focus on lower-intensity, or less obvious, forms of aggression instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper puts aside the prospect of an invasion or direct blockade and instead discusses four coercive approaches that Beijing could use to change the status quo: (1) a decapitation strike meant to exploit uncertainty in Taipei’s continuity of government arrangements; (2) a quasi-disguised maritime quarantine; (3) the taking, perhaps through ambiguous means, of one of Taiwan’s outlying islands; and (4) the staging of a catalytic incident in the Taiwan Strait. Each of these approaches would feature some degree of ambiguity and deception. Each would also target key vulnerabilities in Taiwan and in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, not the least of which include Taiwanese political will and Taiwanese confidence in the availability of U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that China will conduct any of these operations — each of which could fail and each of which would entail significant risks for Beijing. Nor is the argument here that a conflict with China over Taiwan is preordained. In the authors’ judgment, China would only dramatically increase its coercion of Taiwan — whether disguised or overt — if it believed it had a decent chance of success and it had run out of other, less violent options for shifting the status quo. Yet it is entirely possible that Beijing could arrive at this juncture sometime in the coming years. As is on display in Ukraine, dictators make decisions that often conflict with rationality. Thus, it is crucial to understand that the parameters of possible Chinese action vis-à-vis Taiwan are more expansive than is commonly understood, if only so that the United States and its allies can forge a comprehensive response. A complete deterrence strategy must keep Beijing from salami-slicing its way to victory in the Taiwan Strait, even as the United States also races to deter a deadly high-end fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A complete deterrence strategy must keep Beijing from salami-slicing its way to victory in the Taiwan Strait, even as the United States also races to deter a deadly high-end fight.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assumptions&quot;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis rests on several assumptions about Chinese preferences and behavior:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, China wants to annex Taiwan or otherwise bring about its political capitulation to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This has been a consistent desire of Beijing’s since 1949. Although there is a lively debate about Xi’s sense of urgency in achieving this goal, there is no doubt that he — like generations of Chinese leaders before him — seeks to bring Taiwan to heel, or that China is developing the tools, from hard military power to disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks, to do so. The fact that China is actively seeking multiple ways of achieving its long-held goal of annexation or forced capitulation means that the United States, its allies, and most importantly Taiwan itself should be contemplating all potential angles of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, Xi or any future Chinese leader would prefer to take Taiwan with minimal international blowback. That blowback could include immediate repercussions such as economic sanctions or war with the United States; it could also include longer-term costs, such as a region that rallies against Beijing after Taiwan falls. The more dramatic the action China takes against Taiwan, the stronger the regional and global reaction might be. Beijing’s grand strategy encompasses goals beyond taking Taiwan, and so it will seek to balance its global aspirations with the important objective of achieving “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, and related, Beijing would prefer to take Taiwan in ways that make it harder for the United States to intervene effectively and rally regional and global support if it does get involved. This puts a premium on pursuing annexation in ways that mask Beijing’s intentions, or at the very least sow doubt about what is happening and who is at fault. Over the past 15 years, for instance, China has often blamed the Philippines or Japan for escalating tensions in the South and East China Seas — and then used the resulting crises to strengthen its presence around key hot spots. More recently, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) launched joint military exercises in the waters and airspace around Taiwan in response to a “provocative” inauguration speech by Taiwanese president William Lai. Decisions to use military force are ultimately political choices, and the more China can move in ways that complicate the politics and geopolitics of a U.S. response, the bigger the head start it will have toward achieving a fait accompli.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, Beijing would ideally like to avoid the most vexing governance and security challenges that could occur after a direct, full-bore assault. Put differently, Beijing would prefer to rule a Taiwan that is not ruined, physically and economically, by conflict or roiled by a raging insurgency. Coercing Taipei to accept a political settlement, even an unpopular one, minimizes the governance and security challenges in comparison to a post-invasion scenario. Assuming that Beijing cannot find a (coerced) political path forward, it may still prefer to use tools other than the PLA — such as the People’s Armed Police, the Chinese Coast Guard, or the intelligence services — to precipitate a change in the status quo. Of course, the realities of pursuing an annexation strategy may complicate Beijing’s desires; nonetheless, from a planning perspective, the cleaner and less violent the path to “reunification,” the easier the security and governance challenges that follow annexation will become.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, China does not necessarily have to pursue annexation in a single bite. It could try, instead, to coerce Taipei into formal political negotiations that would have unification as the eventual endpoint, on the assumption that those negotiations would be consummated after Taiwanese resolve and U.S. credibility are shattered. Again, recent experience is instructive: Beijing’s periodic assertiveness around Scarborough Reef and Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea is driven, in part, by the desire to put pressure on the U.S.-Philippines alliance by demonstrating that Washington can do little to help Manila uphold its economic rights and territorial claims in scenarios short of all-out war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these assumptions in mind, some might look to Hong Kong’s recent experience as the model for Beijing’s preferred Taiwan strategy. Yet this analogy is both instructive and misleading. It is instructive in the sense that Beijing eventually achieved a decisive outcome — a significant blow to Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” arrangement — but it did so through measures meant to minimize collateral damage to the city’s position as a global financial hub. China did not, for instance, send the PLA into the city’s streets — a step that likely would have provoked greater global blowback. Instead, it used local police forces to quell the demonstrations and then — utilizing bureaucratic and legal channels — pushed through a draconian national security law that dealt the critical strike to Hong Kong’s autonomy. Because Beijing used lawfare to achieve its aims, it was politically and diplomatically challenging for the United States, the United Kingdom, and other stakeholders to do much beyond symbolic sanctions. The Chinese leadership calculated that this combination of measures would achieve their desired result — breaking the back of independent politics — with minimal geopolitical cost. Rather than demonstrating Xi’s unbridled appetite for risk, the Hong Kong example demonstrates his preference for lawfare and salami-slicing as a means to fundamentally alter the strategic landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Hong Kong analogy also has limitations, the most important of which is that the city had been Chinese de jure territory for more than 20 years by the time the culminating actions came. This gave Beijing legal channels through which to constrict Hong Kong’s political liberties. It also meant that China could use non-military forces, such as the police, to suppress the popular response. Such options would not be available to China in a Taiwan scenario, so Beijing would need alternative ways of generating the leverage necessary to achieve a decisive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, just because Beijing might want to take Taiwan through actions short of invasion does not mean it can do so. It is possible that increased, but not immediately decisive, coercion of Taiwan could actually encourage a stronger U.S. commitment to the island or incentivize Taiwan to take stronger measures to defend itself. It should be remembered that Mao Zedong’s shelling of Taiwan’s offshore islands in 1954 encouraged President Dwight D. Eisenhower to push through a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. Something similar has happened in recent years, as the PLA’s provocative military exercises have led to increased U.S. arms sales and more explicit promises of U.S. support by President Biden. Indeed, options beneath the threshold of outright war all suffer from this potential liability, which is why the notion that Chinese leaders might opt for dramatic, decisive military action meant to solve the Taiwan problem once and for all cannot be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the extreme risks and potentially disastrous costs of invasion also must weigh heavily on Beijing’s calculus, which is why options short of invasion must be considered, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-1-decapitation-strike&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Decapitation Strike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 19, 2004, President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu were traveling in an open-top Jeep in the southwest city of Tainan for a campaign stop when two bullets tore through their vehicle, injuring both Chen and Lu. The pair won reelection the following day, but before the authorities could complete their investigation into the assassination attempt, two of the suspected gunmen died under mysterious circumstances. Although some, including Vice President Lu, blamed the PRC for the attack, no conclusive evidence was found to support this assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, an assailant carrying a stolen Japanese sword attacked a military police officer outside of the Presidential Office Building. According to police reports, the man, surnamed Lu, had a PRC flag in his possession at the time of the attack. More recently, a member of the Presidential Office’s Department of Security Affairs and an officer from the National Security Bureau’s Special Service Center were convicted of leaking information to Chinese intelligence about then-president Tsai Ing-wen’s itinerary. According to media reporting, the intelligence included a “hand-drawn organizational chart of the Special Service Center,” as well as “the names, titles and work phone numbers of senior security officers guarding the Presidential Office and Tsai’s residence in the heart of Taipei.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These incidents highlight two underappreciated risks to Taiwan’s political resiliency: there is insufficient security around Taiwan’s elected leadership, and perhaps more worryingly, there is insufficient legal clarity on the line of succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Taiwan reportedly has an internal plan for leadership transition, Article 49 of its constitution merely stipulates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In case the office of the President should become vacant, the Vice President shall succeed until the expiration of the original presidential term. In case the office of both the President and the Vice President should become vacant, the President of the Executive Yuan shall act for the President; and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of this Constitution, an extraordinary session of the National Assembly shall be convoked for the election of a new President and a new Vice President, who shall hold office until the completion of the term left unfinished by the preceding President.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This language raises several worrying questions: What is the timeline for the convocation of the National Assembly? Hours? Days? Months? Article 30 stipulates that the president of the Legislative Yuan (LY) “shall issue the notice of convocation,” but it does not clarify under what timeline and what occurs should the president of the LY fail to issue the notice in a timely manner. Furthermore, what happens if all three individuals listed are incapacitated or killed? How can the National Assembly be convoked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may consider exploiting these vulnerabilities to create a sharp constitutional crisis, and it could use the resulting chaos to alter Taiwan’s political orientation. It might do so if years of accumulating political trends in Taiwan — such as continued Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) dominance of the presidency — convince Chinese officials that inaction would be the greater risk. Alternatively, Beijing might act if it believes that a dramatic change in cross-Strait dynamics — such as a formal declaration of de jure independence or the reestablishment of the U.S.-Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty — was highly likely to occur. In other words, an assassination attempt on Taiwan’s political leadership would be intended to serve as a substitute for a full-on invasion, carried out in a way that is designed to create confusion for the Taiwanese people and the United States. And it would not come out of the blue; it would instead follow a progression of political and diplomatic developments that Beijing considered to pose a near-existential risk to its cross-Strait strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in 2004, Beijing would be the early and obvious target of recrimination, but the key question is how or if Taiwan and the United States would be able to formulate an effective response. In the absence of clear proof, accusations would remain just that. And as was the case in Crimea in 2014, or Manchuria in 1931, even after the truth becomes apparent, the window of opportunity to take effective action might well have closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might this scenario play out? A successful attack on Taiwan’s president and vice president, perhaps during a presidential inauguration or during the president’s annual National Day address on October 10, would immediately throw the island into turmoil. If the president of the LY were unharmed, this individual would bear enormous responsibility for bringing political order to a badly shaken nation. Such an effort would be difficult even in the most mature of democracies. In this early chaos, Beijing would have ample opportunities to stoke fear and uncertainty through disinformation and covert political meddling. If the LY president were killed, Taiwan would face an even graver crisis due to the acute leadership vacuum. Even if Taiwan had an internal line of succession, the absence of a publicly and constitutionally recognized process for transferring political power would call into question how legitimate that transfer is in the eyes of a shell-shocked public. Turning again to current events, the current fractious nature of Taiwan’s legislative politics, owing to an extraordinarily divisive partisan political environment, should put a damper on how likely the prospect of the three main political parties “coming together” is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might Beijing take advantage of the ensuing chaos? There is the prospect of Beijing unilaterally sending “security assistance” to help stabilize the situation, but even as Taiwan’s people reel, this might be seen as too direct an effort. A more realistic path is for pro-Beijing voices in Taiwan’s political system to seek to utilize the confusion and constitutional crisis to seize political power or otherwise open up space for a dramatically transformed political leadership on Taiwan. Success would not be guaranteed, of course, and Beijing would only consider such a move if it saw the cross-Strait situation as dire and felt the need to take drastic steps to reorient the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, this type of brazen attack would be a huge gamble. Any assassination attempt may fail, exposing Beijing’s complicity in the process. Even if the attack were successful, there is no guarantee that a post-decapitation strike plan would be carried out with any precision. Moreover, if Beijing intended to send “security assistance” to Taiwan following an assassination, it would presumably have to build up its forces opposite the island beforehand, which might give the game away. And any attack on Taiwan’s leadership would likely be seen by many in Taiwan and the international community as obvious Chinese aggression, calling forth a punitive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s bet, in other words, would have to be that this option nonetheless carries less risk than either allowing Taiwan to drift further away from the mainland or taking more overt military action to change its trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-2-quarantine&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Quarantine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, making her the first speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives to do so in a quarter-century. Beijing responded with military exercises meant to show off the PLA’s improving capabilities to conduct a blockade, bombardment, or invasion of Taiwan. Chinese missiles overflew Taiwan (albeit through outer space) and splashed down in its surrounding waters — a clear demonstration of Beijing’s ability to choke off vital sea lanes. In May, just after the inauguration speech of President William Lai, Beijing again launched massive military exercises encircling Taiwan, including “comprehensive law enforcement operations” by the Chinese Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent exercises highlight an option available to Beijing short of invasion and formal blockade: a quarantine meant to probe Washington’s risk tolerance and potentially strain its relationship with Taipei while sending a clear signal to the people on Taiwan that they are isolated. As a recent CSIS report on the prospect of a PRC quarantine of Taiwan concluded, “The purpose of a quarantine is not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to assert China’s control over Taiwan by setting the terms for traffic in and out of the island.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing might seize on any variety of potential pretexts: a “provocative” statement or policy departure from Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te; a trip to the island by another high-ranking U.S. official; or a U.S. arms sale that, from Beijing’s perspective, threatens the status quo in the strait. A quarantine would be meant to mimic the effects of a more traditional naval blockade, without necessarily emulating its forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Beijing could announce that the Chinese Coast Guard, rather than the PLA Navy, would conduct customs inspections of shipping headed to and from Taiwan. It could further disrupt maritime traffic into Taiwan by conducting missile tests that terminate in frequently used shipping lanes in the international waters off the island’s major ports. Related, the PLA could announce a series of air and sea exercises in international waters off of Taiwan’s major western ports with no indication of duration, disrupting maritime trade under the pretext of “normal” military training. China could also ratchet up the pressure by having the PLA Air Force “escort” traffic into Taiwan’s air space, as some observers feared it might do at the time of Speaker Pelosi’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China certainly has the capabilities for any of these scenarios. Its coast guard is the world’s largest; it features significant surface combatants and is, in essence, a second Chinese navy. Beijing also boasts the world’s largest conventional missile force, with a deep magazine of short-range missiles that can target the waters around Taiwan. Its inventory of fighter aircraft dwarfs Taiwan’s and whatever contingent the United States has available in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might make this option even more attractive is the dilemmas it would create for the United States, its regional allies, and Taiwan. Of the 193 UN member states, only 11 (plus the Holy See) diplomatically recognize Taiwan. So even though Washington and its allies would strenuously object to Chinese actions, a customs quarantine would be a less clear-cut act of international aggression than an invasion or even a conventional naval blockade of a fully sovereign state. By relying primarily on the Chinese Coast Guard and shore-based assets, this option would also reduce the danger of high-seas encounters between war-fighting navies (at the outset, at least). Similarly, this approach offers China the ability to achieve some effects of a blockade without crossing into what Taiwan deems as its territorial waters; missiles splashing down just outside of that limit could scare off shipping or at least drive insurance rates skyward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The soft quarantine would thus highlight, in a very public way, Taiwan’s inherent vulnerability as an island nation dependent on imports of food, energy, and other vital resources.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft quarantine would thus highlight, in a very public way, Taiwan’s inherent vulnerability as an island nation dependent on imports of food, energy, and other vital resources. Even if a quarantine were only enforced selectively or intermittently, it would remind Taiwan of the economic noose Beijing can cinch tight around its neck. The United States and other friendly countries might try to defeat the quarantine by organizing a relief expedition and escorting planes and ships into Taiwan. But Washington might struggle to do so indefinitely, especially if this crisis happened when U.S. naval assets were already stretched thin by other commitments — for example, threats to freedom of navigation in the narrow waterways around the Arabian Peninsula. Indeed, the true goal of this strategy might be to expose the limits of U.S. support of Taiwan — and thereby soften the island up for further pressures meant, eventually, to cause its capitulation. There is also the possibility that the voices calling for “restraint” in the United States and other Western capitals would win out, after debate on whether Washington really wants to risk a conflict with China over some ships being boarded in waters thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say this approach is risk-free for Beijing. A limited quarantine would still be seen as aggression by Washington, Tokyo, Canberra, Manilla, and Seoul, to say nothing of Taipei, and so while it may “succeed” in the short term, it might also strengthen international support for Taipei, just as Beijing’s firing of rockets into Japan’s exclusive economic zone in August 2022 helped galvanize a more assertive Japanese approach vis-à-vis China. This approach could still turn into a high-stakes game of chicken, if U.S. warships and aircraft escort relief shipments into Taiwan and dare Beijing to get in the way. If China does not blink, in that scenario, it could have a war on its hands; if it falters, that could undermine the credibility of its coercive threats. Moreover, blockades and quarantines have a poor record of convincing countries to give up their independence; just as often, the suffering they cause strengthens, at least for a time, the will to resist. But a quarantine might still appeal to Xi, not least because it would also force the United States to decide if it wants to escalate to a full-blown crisis — and to sustain Taiwan indefinitely — in a situation where the PLA has not yet fired a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-3-offshore-island-seizure&quot;&gt;Scenario 3: Offshore Island Seizure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of Taiwan’s outer islands already live in the shadow of U.S. ambiguity, as the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act — which directs the president and congress to consider “appropriate action” in response to “threats to the security or the social or economic system of the people of Taiwan” — covers only “the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores [‘Penghu’].” This means that one of the only legally binding commitments the United States has to Taiwan does not extend to its outlying islands — Pratas, Kinmen, Itu Aba, the Wuchiu Islands, and Matsu. As a result, these islands are potential targets for a Chinese takeover, not necessarily as a stepping stone for a full invasion of Taiwan, but as a way of probing U.S. and Taiwanese risk appetite and exposing the limits of American commitment and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculus has been demonstrated to exist in modern U.S.-China relations. During the two Taiwan Strait crises of the 1950s (1954 and 1958), Mao Zedong repeatedly used the shelling of Taiwan’s offshore islands as a way to probe the United States and test its relationship with Taipei. As Mao stated in August 1958 meeting of the Politburo, “although we have fired dozens of thousands or rounds on Jinmen [Kinmen], we only mean to probe [America’s intention].” He added, “we need to see if the Americans want to carry these islands on their back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An appealing target might be Pratas Island, which is sparsely populated with only a small contingent of Taiwanese coast guard and military personnel. The island is of little inherent strategic value to Taiwan, and its seizure might not provoke any substantial military response from either Taiwan or the United States, assuming casualties are low to zero. At a minimum, the takeover of the island would force the United States to confront the dilemma of whether it wants to risk major war with China over a small island of just 430 total acres that sits in the middle of the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Beijing has multiple options for taking Pratas Island. It could announce military exercises in the waters and airspace surrounding the island that would have the functional effect of cutting Pratas off from its regular shipments of water, food, and other supplies from Taiwan’s main island. Beijing might then signal through lower-tier diplomatic channels that Taiwan can rotate existing military and coast guard off the island, but it cannot bring new troops and coast guard on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a more confrontational — and riskier — approach would be simply to directly overpower the tiny contingent of coast guard and marines stationed on the island. This would, of course, invite condemnation from Taipei, Washington, Tokyo, Manila, and other capitals that would see such a move as naked aggression. But it is not at all clear that any of these countries, including the United States, would be able and willing to muster a proportionate punitive response. For the United States, the challenge would be explaining to the American people why a tiny island nearly 300 miles from Taiwan, and which is not covered by the Taiwan Relations Act, is worth a possible conflict with China, the world’s second-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any of these scenarios, geography would severely constrain the response from Taipei and Washington, who would have to decide whether to tolerate the loss of a small, geopolitically insignificant chunk of Taiwan’s territory or risk a much bigger fight just a few miles from China’s shores. As Lancaster University’s Andrew Chubb has written, an outer island seizure “would offer Beijing greater flexibility and escalation control, lower risk of civilian casualties, and less likelihood of sparking a strong Taiwanese response or U.S. intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common objection to such scenarios holds that the capture of an outer island yields China little to no strategic benefit if the goal is the full annexation of Taiwan, as it would still need to attempt a direct attack on the main island of Taiwan, which would presumably be on high alert. Further, even if the PLA were to cleanly seize Pratas, it would simply confirm the fears of many countries in the region — its initial gain of Taiwan territory would have come at the expense of “tripping the alarm” and therefore galvanizing action in Tokyo, Manilla, and Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such objections are premised on the idea that Beijing’s immediate goal in undertaking such actions would be “reunification.” A more plausible objective for Beijing would be to cut a slice of salami that the United States and Taiwan will not be willing or able to defend. Here, the main goal would be a clear provocation that is met with an underwhelming response, for it would publicly demonstrate that Washington’s bark is worse than its bite when it comes to defending Taiwan. This strategy could thereby erode Taiwan’s confidence in U.S. support — to say nothing of its confidence in its ability to protect itself — while also provoking anxiety in U.S. allies and partners over Washington’s inability to credibly defend against incremental Chinese aggression. And at the point that Beijing is willing to undertake such a gambit, it may already be pricing in the erosion of its remaining goodwill in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-4-false-flag&quot;&gt;Scenario 4: False Flag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final scenario involves a false flag operation — akin to what Japan perpetrated in Manchuria in 1931 — meant to justify subsequent military action against Taiwan. The current situation offers plenty of possibilities. Chinese aircraft regularly fly across the center line of the strait or into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, where they are tracked by Taiwanese air defenses or intercepted by Taiwanese fighters. Run-ins between Taiwan’s coast guard and Chinese civilian vessels have occasionally turned deadly. Chinese drones overfly Taiwanese territory; Chinese forces intercept — and dangerously crowd — planes and ships belonging to Taiwan’s friends. The air and waters of the Western Pacific are becoming crowded, dangerous, and primed for some catalytic incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could concoct a Taiwanese “provocation” — a collision between Taiwanese and Chinese ships or aircraft, or perhaps even an alleged Taiwanese attack on Chinese forces operating in or around the strait. It could then use full-throated propaganda and disinformation to pin the blame on Taipei and exploit the incident to obliterate the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option would be to use the incident as justification for a large-scale, potentially decisive attack on Taiwan, in which case the point of the subterfuge would be simply to complicate the domestic and coalition politics of the U.S. response. Or Beijing could use the incident as pretext for something more limited, such as “retaliatory” strikes on Taiwanese bases and military assets. Likewise, the PLA Air Force could simply conduct large-scale, persistent intrusions into Taiwan’s airspace, meant to assert its ability to overfly the island at will — forcing Taipei to choose between submitting to this confidence-crushing humiliation or contesting these intrusions at the risk of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach offers many benefits for Beijing. It would showcase China’s overwhelming escalation dominance in the area around Taiwan, which leaves Taipei with few good options for responding to limited strikes or stepped-up military pressure. It would exploit the ability of China’s state-directed propaganda apparatus to rapidly disseminate a false or misleading narrative, as officials and media outlets in the United States, Taiwan, and other nations would struggle to respond. It could also strain the U.S.-Taiwan relationship by forcing Washington to decide how much risk to run in pushing back against limited Chinese aggression — a real dilemma, given that U.S. officials would presumably not wish to see matters escalate further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a false flag incident led to more dramatic forms of aggression, this approach could — by sowing ambiguity and confusion — slow U.S. decisionmaking and exacerbate the severe time pressures a distant United States faces, even in the most favorable circumstances, in rushing to Taiwan’s aid. A false flag operation does not have to fool everyone forever. It just has to foul up the international response long enough for Beijing to create new facts on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downsides are also considerable. The United States has shown, during the war in Ukraine, that it can sometimes detect and reveal false flag operations before they occur (although this may hinge on remarkable intelligence penetration of the sort Washington seems to have achieved in the Kremlin). Even if a false flag operation created momentary confusion, any further use of force against Taiwan could quickly bring clarity to the debate in Washington and other capitals. And if the false flag were merely a prelude to more limited military actions, the United States could still respond in ways that would make Taiwan a tougher nut to crack — by deploying larger numbers of troops on Taiwanese territory, for example. If this was the case, the outcome might actually be to increase Taiwan’s resilience by strengthening its faith in U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these options is a silver bullet for Beijing. Deceptions can be unraveled. Coercion, even when clouded by confusion, can invite strategic blowback. To return to an earlier example, Russia’s ambiguous aggression in Crimea gave it control of that peninsula, but at the same time, Kyiv responded to the loss of Crimea by accelerating its alignment with the transatlantic community — and thereby confronted Putin with the dilemma he tried to solve, disastrously, with a full-on invasion in 2022. Yet China might still consider limited options — both because the near-term risks associated with them remain lower than the risks associated with a large-scale, overt aggression such as a direct invasion, and because these options could create significant political dilemmas for Taiwan and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the scenarios reveals a weakness China could try to exploit: from Taiwan’s deficient continuity-of-government procedures, to its inherent economic vulnerabilities, to uncertainties around how the United States would respond in crises short of all-out conflict. Most fundamentally, these approaches would target Taiwan’s political will to resist and its confidence in U.S. support — the two vital, interrelated intangibles that Beijing must weaken to achieve unification without a brutal fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these scenarios illustrate how Beijing might try to thread that needle, they also highlight some of the challenges Washington and Taipei must address. Taiwan’s survival may hinge as much on its internal security and continuity-of-government procedures as on its stockpile of anti-ship missiles and sea mines. The United States, for its part, needs to be developing contingency plans for cases of limited aggression. The specifics of those plans will vary according to the contingency. But the crucial point is that they must include sharp, non-kinetic punishments that allow the United States to inflict damage on China without sparking a larger military confrontation in places where the escalation dynamics are unfavorable — as well as measures that defeat the intended Chinese political effect of ambiguous aggression by significantly deepening U.S. military, diplomatic, and economic support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States might communicate to Beijing that any significant coercive change in the status quo would render the norms and agreements governing U.S.-Taiwan-China relations a dead letter — thereby clearing the way for, among other things, a thicker, more robust military-to-military relationship between Washington and Taipei, and perhaps even a larger, more capable, and more visible U.S. troop presence in Taiwan. Or it could indicate that aggression against outlying islands is likely to lead to more explicit U.S. security guarantees for the Taiwanese territory that remains. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act already sets the groundwork for such messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the United States might — in coordination with allies and partners — preload packages of economic sanctions that could be applied in cases of ambiguous aggression. The challenge here is that the magnitude of sanctions needed, and the importance of signaling them credibly and early, are all difficult to pull together, especially under scenarios where Beijing’s actions are in the gray zone, and therefore not always seen as sufficiently provocative to risk a possible global recession. It would also be useful to wargame scenarios short of outright conflict with Taiwan and other friendly countries, if only to form a stronger shared understanding of the difficulties those scenarios might create in the capitals whose combined effort would be needed to forge an effective response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a contest short of war, the center of gravity is Taiwan’s confidence in its relationship with Washington and in its own ability to resist.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a contest short of war, the center of gravity is Taiwan’s confidence in its relationship with Washington and in its own ability to resist. The goal should thus be to convince Beijing that violent half-measures will backfire strategically even if they succeed tactically, as they would strengthen U.S. and international support for Taiwan and thereby harden Taipei’s hostility to unification at the point of a gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most broadly, the upshot of this analysis is that Washington needs to expand its conception of deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. If the United States prepares only for incremental or ambiguous aggression, it risks making a full-scale invasion more attractive for Beijing. But if it focuses only on high-end deterrence, it could lose on the installment plan as China uses creative tactics that erode Taiwan’s sovereignty and its confidence in the United States. Beijing has many ways to change the status quo in a sensitive area. The United States will need a holistic deterrence strategy to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，辯方今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）作中段陳詞，要求法庭就黎面對的3項控罪裁定表證不成立。就串謀發布煽動刊物罪，辯方指涉案報導和評論僅為了引起公眾關注一些牽涉公眾利益的事情，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且言論和新聞自由均受憲法保障。就串謀勾結外國勢力罪，辯方指黎在網上對談節目中的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁；黎與嘉賓僅評論國際事務，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做等。法官押後至明日上午（25日）宣布裁定表證是否成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方言論及新聞自由受憲法保障-涉案文章僅引公眾關注為一般報紙工作&quot;&gt;辯方：言論及新聞自由受憲法保障 涉案文章僅引公眾關注、為一般報紙工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻指，言論自由和新聞自由均受到憲法保障。控方的案情指稱黎利用《蘋果日報》作為平台發布煽動刊物，辯方形容指控「奇怪」，因他們發布的報導和評論均為了引起公眾關注一些牽涉公眾利益的事情，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且不同報紙本來就帶有光譜上不同的政治立場，不應被視為「煽動刊物」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官杜麗冰指，法庭判斷文章是否「煽動刊物」時，不單只要看文章內容，也要視乎發布的背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法生效後沒有新的犯罪協議-官控方指稱犯罪協議持續&quot;&gt;辯方：國安法生效後沒有新的犯罪協議 官：控方指稱犯罪協議持續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀」這一項控罪元素，彭耀鴻指「串謀」涉及多於一人協議做非法事情，或者協議用非法手段去做合法事情。彭力陳，即使在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他《蘋果》高層之間存在犯罪協議，但是在《國安法》生效之後，便再沒有新的犯罪協議，因此不存在「串謀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，控方的案情是指稱犯罪協議在《國安法》生效之前形成，當2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之後，相關協議變得不合法，然而黎與其他被告繼續。李官又指，這個議題是一個事實判斷，而非如辯方所說是一個法律議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎叫撐住意味繼續犯罪協議-辯方僅籲同事繼續經營報紙&quot;&gt;官質疑黎叫「撐住」意味繼續犯罪協議 辯方：僅籲同事繼續經營報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻則重申，在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他被告協議去做的是合法事情，當它在《國安法》生效之後變得不合法，他們便從根本上更改了整個協議。法官杜麗冰則質疑，辯方從沒有在盤問控方證人期間，向他們指出以上說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰又質疑，在沒有任何證據下，辯方基於什麼基礎而指稱被告的協議是合法，而且合法與否並非基於被告自己的意見，不是被告覺得是合法便是合法。彭耀鴻則重申，黎與其他被告之間的協議並不涉任何罪行，一向都是完全合法（perfectly lawful）。根據張劍虹和陳沛敏的證供，《國安法》生效之後，他們徵詢法律意見，以確保《蘋果》不觸犯任何法律，可見他們的協議並非觸犯法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李素蘭質疑，黎還柙後仍然叫同事繼續「撐住」。彭耀鴻則指，黎的意思是叫同事繼續營運《蘋果日報》，不代表叫同事繼續犯法。李素蘭回應指，須視乎相關證據去理解黎說「撐住」的意思是什麼。彭重申，黎的意思是叫同事繼續經營及出版《蘋果》，法庭不能以此說話來推論黎籲同事觸犯法律。法官杜麗冰和李素蘭聞言均指，這是一個牽涉事實裁定的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英對談節目確有提及制裁-但不代表呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英對談節目確有提及制裁 但不代表呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻指，黎曾經在2020年7月之前曾提倡外國制裁，但是這是在《國安法》生效之前發生，其時相關行為完全合法，然而黎在《國安法》生效之後便沒有繼續呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在2020年7月開始製作網上對談節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，但是他在節目中從沒呼籲外國制裁中國和香港。黎與其私人助手 Mark Simon 之間的訊息僅表達黎的個人意見，並不構成任何證據顯示有犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，即使黎在 Live Chat 節目中的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁。惟法官杜麗冰指，假設有人說「制裁有幫助，能迫使政府為自己的行為負責」等言論，可以被視為等同於呼籲制裁，視乎說話者在怎樣的情況下說這番言論。彭耀鴻回應指，因此法庭需要將語境考慮在內，就本案而言，「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」每集時間頗長，討論內容均圍繞國際事務，與呼籲制裁大相逕庭，不足以作出推論指犯罪協議存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英節目僅討論國際局勢-正如市民在茶餐廳討論時政&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英節目僅討論國際局勢 正如市民在茶餐廳討論時政&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英與不同嘉賓在對談節目中僅就國際事務表達意見、評論拜登政府應該怎樣做等等，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做、美國政府及歐洲政府應怎樣做等，然而這不足以達至推論指黎有犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英刊於專欄「成敗樂一笑」的文章，辯方指黎僅表達其個人見解，沒有任何內容可以被用來推論黎串謀呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指蘋果編採政策不變不代表黎同意犯法-官質疑打擦邊球&quot;&gt;辯方指《蘋果》編採政策不變不代表黎同意犯法 官質疑「打擦邊球」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方案情指稱，在《國安法》生效之後，《蘋果》的編採政策沒有改變過。辯方則指，縱使證人供稱到獄中探訪還柙的黎時，黎寄語《蘋果》同事不要害怕、要繼續如常營運《蘋果》，亦沒有指示要改變編採政策，但是不代表黎同意干犯法律，他的意思只是叫同事繼續出版報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李素蘭則引述楊清奇的證供中「打擦邊球」說法，質疑《蘋果》冒險超越法律界線。彭耀鴻則強調《蘋果》高層想盡力維持在法律界線之內，就如打乒乓球般，雙方目標是令乒乓球留在界線內，而不是瞄準界線而來發球。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏早前供稱黎智英提議製作制裁名單-辯方稱訊息非出自黎手筆&quot;&gt;陳沛敏早前供稱黎智英提議製作制裁名單 辯方稱訊息非出自黎手筆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏曾供稱，2020年7月14日，時任美國總統特朗普簽署《香港自治法》的行政命令之後，黎智英以 WhatsApp 傳送相關行政命令內文，以及提出準備一份「Shit List」，陳理解黎的意思是要製作「制裁名單」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今指稱，從 WhatsApp 訊息的字眼可見，黎當時只是將另一名美國人的訊息，連同行政命令內文和「Shit List」的提議，一併複製並傳送給陳沛敏。因為相關行政命令是很重要的新聞，而陳當時身為高層，所以黎立即傳送給陳，然而「Shit list」並非黎本人的提議。法官杜麗冰質疑辯方是在作出假設，而且相關訊息是否由黎智英撰寫、黎是否同意訊息內容，皆屬於事實爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方有充份證據證明國安法生效後-黎智英仍然是犯罪協議的一份子&quot;&gt;控方：有充份證據證明國安法生效後 黎智英仍然是犯罪協議的一份子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行重申，控方一直以來都是指稱黎與其他被告在《國安法》之前達成犯罪協議，並在國安法生效之後繼續相關協議。而且案中有充份證據證明《國安法》生效之後，黎智英仍然是協議的一份子，包括其網上對談節目內容、Twitter 上有關「重光團隊」、IPAC和裴倫德的帖文等。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行（左）、高級檢控官 陳穎琛（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，法庭不能夠只著眼於《國安法》生效之後發生的事，而是要將黎智英在《國安法》之前所作的行為納入考慮，以全面地理解案情，因此控方從頭到尾、根據時序來顯示黎智英做過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，所有以從犯證人身份出庭作供的《蘋果》高層均供稱，在國安法生效之後，《蘋果》的編採政策沒有改變，他們繼續做一直以來的工作。當張劍虹對於黎邀請美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 出席對談節目表達關注，質疑會否過於敏感，黎則回應：「我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」就另一項串謀勾結外國勢力罪，從犯證人陳梓華供稱在2020年6月16日赴壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英，當時黎要求陳繼續國際線工作，形容《國安法》「雷聲大，雨點小」。控方指以上均顯示《國安法》之後黎決定繼續涉案行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，只要有足夠證據顯示犯罪協議持續，而且參與者遵守相關協議，便可以滿足「串謀」這項控罪元素。控方又指，不只可以透過外在行為（overt acts），案中亦有來自從犯證人的直接證據，證明協議的內容、如何達成協議，以及在國安法前後如何執行相關協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官押後至明早宣布決定&quot;&gt;官押後至明早宣布決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方均陳詞完畢，法官杜麗冰押後至明日上午（25日）宣布決定。若然法庭裁定黎就控罪表證成立，黎需決定是否作供及傳召辯方證人；相反，若然法庭裁定表證不成立，黎則毋須答辯，可當庭釋放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many in both communities feel that a peace process would simply allow the other side to buy time while pursuing more maximalist goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mention a peace process in Israel or the West Bank these days, you risk sounding naive at best and borderline treacherous at worst. Both communities are reeling, polls show support for a two-state solution is at an all-time low, and the Israeli Knesset has just passed a resolution rejecting a Palestinian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the conflict isn’t going away and, at some point, engagement will again be necessary. When that time comes, the parameters cannot just snap back to the same issues that defined previous negotiations. Rather, they will need to take into account the sharply changed realities (and strikingly similar perceptions) in both communities. In my conversations with everyday Israelis and Palestinians on the ground, the same themes keep emerging – yet it’s clear that the two communities have never been further apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trauma&quot;&gt;Trauma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Israelis and Palestinians are (again) navigating unprecedented traumas, and “trauma” is the word I’ve heard the most here this summer. The Israel–Palestine conflict has long been described as one of dual victimhood, with the state of Israel emerging in the aftermath of the Holocaust, along with the mass displacement of indigenous Palestinians in the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. The intergenerational trauma of those events still deeply pervades both societies, but the events themselves are recognised as historical events that predate the lives of most members of both populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7 October attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza have brought those prior traumas surging back for the current generation. For Israel, 7 October not only marked the single deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, but also reanimated a sense of existential dread not felt in decades. Several people have told me that their overwhelming thought on the morning of the attacks was: “They are coming for us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Gaza, meanwhile, is being experienced by Palestinians as the current generation’s Nakba: “What our grandparents experienced in 1948, it’s history. But what is going on now in Gaza is so shocking, because for us, it’s the first time to see this level of destruction, of ethnic cleansing, of mass killings”, one woman told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As much as Israelis and Palestinians distrust their own leaders, they also distrust the other side’s, including the relative moderates who would be most likely to re-engage in a future peace process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are the twin traumas unfolding simultaneously, but each side has shrugged off the other’s suffering with a general response of “they deserved it”. “Even Palestinians who don’t support Hamas couldn’t help feeling a satisfaction on 7 October”, I’ve heard often, with polling reflecting the same sentiment. And most Israelis, across the political spectrum, support the war in Gaza. As one man told me, “There is a Jewish saying: if there are those who are coming to kill you, you kill them first. So what can we do?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distrust&quot;&gt;Distrust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Corrupt”. “Complicit”. “Selfish”. “Liars”. I haven’t met a single Israeli or Palestinian who trusts their current leadership – much less the other side’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of Israelis believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the war for political reasons, and citizens across the ideological spectrum blame him for the failed policies and security lapses that, they believe, allowed the Hamas attacks to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians are equally frustrated with the ossifying Palestinian Authority (PA), which has long been seen as corrupt. But for most Palestinians I’ve spoken with, it is what they view as the PA’s complicity with Israel, via intelligence and security cooperation, that has most degraded any sense they might have of the body’s legitimacy. As one activist told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People feel oppressed, we don’t have the power of political parties, and we feel we cannot do what we should do to support Gaza. Everywhere around the world, we see actions in solidarity with Gaza, or for a ceasefire. But here we cannot write a Facebook post, we cannot organise demonstrations or sit-ins, even within our own cities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as Israelis and Palestinians distrust their own leaders, they also distrust the other side’s, including the relative moderates who would be most likely to re-engage in a future peace process. Moreover, they distrust a peace process, believing such a process does little beyond allowing the other side to buy time while pursuing more maximalist goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open letter published by Palestinians in Mondoweiss put it bluntly: “Make no mistake. The offers of a Palestinian state are an illusion”. Israelis I have met expressed similar views: “No matter what [PA president] Abu Mazen says, or a piece of paper says, most Palestinians will still just want to kill Jews. And they won’t stop, even if there is a Palestinian state”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;isolation&quot;&gt;Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Palestinians and Israelis feel wholly marginalised by the international community. Despite sympathy from world leaders directly after 7 October, Israelis have since perceived a world turned increasingly hostile, from widespread student protests and unexpected boycotts to legal actions in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). “It’s like the whole world has forgotten the atrocities of 7 October”, I’m often told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more pointed criticisms. A former IDF spokesperson I met was incredulous that the World Health Organization had not condemned Hamas’s infiltration of Gazan hospitals. In Tel Aviv, a main thoroughfare is lined with posters accusing UN Women of ignoring reports of widespread sexual violence on 7 October. When I asked women at the Hostages and Missing Persons Square why they thought that was, their answer was simple: “Because we’re Jews”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians have felt equally marginalised. While international solidarity protests for Palestine are appreciated, there is frustration that government leaders, especially in the US, have continued to support Israel: “How can they just sit back and let a genocide continue for nine months?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the ICJ and ICC actions, while welcome, are seen by many Palestinians as double-edged swords, because of the lack of enforcement mechanisms. “On the one hand, the legal steps make people hope that justice might prevail”, a Palestinian human rights lawyer told me. “At the same time, when nothing happens after that, and the end result on the ground is nothing, people lose faith, not just in the court, but in the whole international system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defiance&quot;&gt;Defiance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides are also more dug in than ever before – and confident that they can wait each other out. The phrase “from the river to the sea” became well-known for its deployment in pro-Palestine demonstrations, but I hear it invoked by Israelis just as much as by Palestinians – referring to full control of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, including the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite sympathy from world leaders directly after 7 October, Israelis have since perceived a world turned increasingly hostile, from widespread student protests and unexpected boycotts to legal actions in international courts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such aspirations are not new, but they are more widespread and vocalised now than in previous years. Moreover, both sides are increasingly convinced that they can win in a long-game demographic stand-off. Palestinians have long embraced the concept of sumoud, roughly translated as “steadfastness”, or a sense of perseverance and rootedness in the land. I’m often told, “We outlasted the British and the Ottomans and centuries of other foreign occupiers. We can outlast Israel too”. Among Israelis, the word I’ve heard the most in the post-7 October context is “resilience”. Despite some reports of emigration in the context of the war, the main sentiment here was summed up by one Israeli as, “We’re not moving. We are resilient and we won’t be bullied anymore”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremists have, obviously, exploited those sentiments further. Far-right Israeli settlers, intent on retaking all of biblical Israel, have escalated campaigns of direct violence to expel Palestinians from more than a dozen West Bank villages since 7 October, attacks described to me by multiple Palestinians as “pogroms”. And many Palestinians support Hamas’s claim that the 7 October attack was “a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, still many individuals, NGOs and movements – including family members of hostages and victims – who are committed to a (fledgling) peace movement. As one activist said, “Everyone wants things black and white, but as humans, we should be able to have empathy for the hostages and their families and also for civilians in Gaza. People want revenge, and it’s understandable, but we cannot lose our identity and our humanity in search of revenge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most mainstream Israelis and Palestinians I’ve met do not see their hardened positions as motivated by revenge, so much as by survival. A new political vision, whenever it comes, will need to engage with these deeper fundamental realities if it’s going to stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brexit vote in June 2016 and subsequent decision by then-Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union in March 2017, formally starting the process through which the UK left the EU, triggered a range of consequences for the UK. In the sanctions arena, this decision created the need for the UK to develop the necessary legislation to maintain existing sanctions regimes – and have the capacity to impose further sanctions – outside the laws and regulations of the EU. This work needed to be done rapidly to ensure the UK maintained its ability to implement and enforce sanctions once the exit process was complete. At the same time, the decision to leave the EU also created the opportunity for the UK to develop its own independent sanctions policy, acting unilaterally and at a different pace from its European neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the importance of the challenge and opportunity this presented, in May 2019, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) created a taskforce on the “Future of UK Sanctions Policy”, which considered the post-Brexit design and coordination of sanctions, providing recommendations on how the UK should develop and implement its independent sanctions policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy the UK may have been developing for the use of sanctions following the completion of the Brexit process was upended by the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the significant challenges posed by the need to design, implement and enforce sanctions on Russia and the recent publication of the UK government’s sanctions strategy, RUSI has established a new taskforce to consider how the UK has addressed these challenges and what its independent sanctions policy might be in this dramatically changed sanctions environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the progress made, the challenges encountered and the lessons learned is vital for defining an effective future sanctions strategy for the UK to ensure the country is in the best possible position to create the desired impact of sanctions in an evolving threat landscape. This new UK Sanctions Implementation and Strategy Taskforce (the Taskforce), comprising 50 former government officials from the UK and elsewhere, senior sanctions executives from the financial sector and industry, and academics aims to evaluate the UK’s current sanctions policy and propose enhancements to its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce held its inaugural roundtable in June 2024 to discuss the evolution of the UK’s independent sanctions policies post-Brexit, the preparation and changes required and the early use of an independent sanctions strategy. It then discussed the challenges posed, and changes necessitated, by the sanctions regime imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A second roundtable is scheduled for October 2024 to explore opportunities for strengthening existing frameworks and ensuring the UK’s sanctions strategy is fit for the geopolitical and emerging threat environment it faces today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report gathers the main findings from the June roundtable and assesses chronologically the establishment of the UK’s independent sanctions framework and the subsequent need to rapidly adapt in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. None of the comments made by the Taskforce members are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-post-brexit-sanctions-response-201622&quot;&gt;The UK’s Post-Brexit Sanctions Response (2016–22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion first sought to understand the overall impact of the transition from an EU-based sanctions regime to the post-Brexit era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establishing-an-independent-sanctions-framework&quot;&gt;Establishing an Independent Sanctions Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Taskforce participants agreed that, while initially creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the early stages of the process, Brexit had also given the UK government the flexibility and agility to shape its sanctions policy according to national priorities. After decades of implementing sanctions – apart from those relating to terrorism – as part of multi-country groupings within the UN and EU, the UK had the chance to introduce its own legal framework, leveraging the experience gathered while in the EU, as well as exploring the development of new sanctions regimes and accompanying narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members from major financial institutions reported that the early days of the transition process were characterised by a sense of urgency among civil servants to establish the necessary legislation for imposing and implementing the UK’s own sanctions, due to a lack of certainty on the official departure date from the EU. The need for independent sanctions legislation resulted in the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA), which facilitated the roll-over of the existing EU sanctions regimes, their applicability in the UK and the future capacity of the UK to make new designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the urgency of the transition was over, the UK’s sanctions policy evolved beyond merely replicating EU sanctions. Former government officials at the roundtable noted that the UK had been a leading player in the development of the EU’s sanctions policies. With newfound independence, the government was able to leverage this experience, and introduce new sanctions regimes such as the Global Human Rights (GHR) Sanctions regime and the Global Anti-Corruption (GAC) Sanctions regime, and act with greater agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members acknowledged some of strengths of the post-Brexit UK regime. A former US government official, for instance, praised the UK’s role in facilitating transatlantic coordination with the EU and commended the country’s “political bravery” in implementing sanctions regimes that had previously been hindered by disagreements among EU member states pre-Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the UK also acknowledged the relative strength of the UK’s post-Brexit legal framework. For example, one representative from the private sector noted that the legal framework is “broadly sensible” and functional, with statutory requirements for guidance enhancing its effectiveness, and an evidentiary threshold that is more consistently applied now that the UK is not in the EU – making listing decisions more robust. Another significant success singled out by the Taskforce was the introduction of the power to grant general licences, which greatly enhanced the flexibility and responsiveness of the sanctions regime, despite not being much used before February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the strength of the legal framework, some private sector representatives argued that the new independent regime created unease among businesses that now had to comply with yet another significant set of sanctions listings and implementation requirements and engage with new authorities such as the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OFSI was established in March 2016 and became operational in April 2017. Some participants mentioned that its slow start disappointed the private sector, contrasting its performance with the decades-old Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the US. Former US officials also stressed the differences in resourcing and behaviour between the US and the UK’s “sanctions machinery”, with the latter lacking the former’s size and “aggressiveness”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Taskforce members agreed that in the immediate period after Brexit, the UK had developed an effective sanctions framework based on the new SAMLA legislation and had gradually built its capacity to implement new regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introducing-new-autonomous-sanctions-regimes&quot;&gt;Introducing New Autonomous Sanctions Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce explored one particular benefit of the UK’s independent sanctions policy – the autonomy to design and adopt new regimes. Although the UK now has 36 thematic and country regimes, the Taskforce discussion focused on two regimes in particular – the GHR sanctions regime of 2020 and the GAC sanctions regime of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Taskforce participants agreed on the limited impact and scope of these two regimes. Overall, they described human rights and anti-corruption sanctions as “presentational”, with a strong messaging value at the international level, but limited impact on the targets or on UK businesses and their sanctions compliance obligations. Some recalled former Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s vision when establishing these regimes, as he sought to articulate the UK’s sanctions strategy as demonstrating “Global Britain’s commitment to acting as a force for good in the world”. However, they posited that these expectations have not been fully realised. The UK’s GAC and GHR sanctions have been underused, with only 42 and 123 designations respectively, in stark contrast to the proactive use by the US of its Global Magnitsky Sanctions, which includes 700 designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited application of GAC and GHR sanctions is not merely about numbers. Participants highlighted a lack of clarity and transparency regarding the criteria and purpose for which sanctions are deployed – or the strategy for their use – concluding that they are mainly used for signalling, with little expectation of behaviour change or justice being delivered. According to civil society representatives attending the roundtable, the inconsistency and perceived arbitrariness in the use of GAC sanctions undermine the legitimacy of the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also agreed that the deployment of thematic sanctions has been significantly hindered by the government’s focus on the Russia regime since February 2022. One Taskforce member suggested that without Russia’s invasion, the UK would have likely developed a clearer vision for its thematic regimes, citing the successful coordination with Canada and the US on Belarus’s GHR designations as an example of effective pre-2022 implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-sanctions-reality-after-february-2022&quot;&gt;The New Sanctions Reality After February 2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants recognised that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 had fundamentally altered the sanctions landscape and had a dramatic impact on the operations of private sector compliance departments across the UK. The Taskforce recognised that the UK had found itself on a steep learning curve, rapidly scaling up efforts to match heightened global expectations, particularly from the US, to ensure the effectiveness of G7 coordinated sanctions efforts against Russia. Among the positive developments stemming from these efforts, participants highlighted the significant injection of funds and resources in key agencies such as OFSI, increased parliamentary scrutiny to monitor the government’s performance and ensure accountability, and a designation process with a more consistent application of the evidentiary threshold than before 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statutory requirement for the government to provide guidance was, according to participants, another major advance, ensuring greater clarity on implementation as well as accountability and transparency from the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants acknowledged the UK government’s efforts to engage with industry at different stages of the sanctions cycle, despite encountering a series of challenges. For instance, they argued that co-designing sanctions had proven to be difficult due to their national security nature, citing the oil price cap as a unique example of industry involvement in shaping specific measures. Meanwhile, in supporting sanctions implementation, sanctions had dominated public–private partnership meetings, almost matching the focus traditionally placed on anti-money laundering in these forums. However, after this positive initial public–private engagement, some industry representatives observed a shift from collaboration towards an enforcement-focused approach, prompting businesses to seek legal protection when engaging with authorities, which in the view of some participants has been a backwards step in terms of a cross-sector approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants welcomed the increased use by the government of the power to grant general licences. This greatly enhanced the flexibility and responsiveness of the sanctions regime by allowing multiple parties to conduct certain restricted activities without the bureaucracy of obtaining individual licences. Prior to the invasion, OFSI granted only two general licences, while since February 2022 the number of general licences has reached more than 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features of the UK’s approach to sanctions post-February 2022, which were largely absent in the immediate post-Brexit period, have become central to the post-invasion sanctions landscape. Despite these advances, the Taskforce identified several deficiencies undermining the effectiveness and credibility of UK sanctions, which require government attention. These are set out in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-resourcing-and-expertise&quot;&gt;Limited Resourcing and Expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members discussed the shortage of resources and expertise in the relevant government sanctions departments. They described how the Russia regime required the hiring of new staff within government agencies, many of whom lacked the necessary sanctions knowledge. The urgency to address a backlog of licensing requests from businesses operating in the UK also led to a “conveyor belt” approach, which prioritised speed over development of expertise. This has prevented officials from developing a wider focus beyond UK domestic sanctions, resulting in many civil servants, who were working on sanctions, remaining too UK-centric in their approach, and consequently lacking in-depth knowledge about the regimes of G7 partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid staff turnover also exacerbated these challenges. Government officials who have developed their expertise in sanctions have frequently transitioned to the private sector, attracted by better opportunities and remuneration. As reported by private sector representatives, even secondment initiatives intended to bolster expertise in the civil service often result in permanent moves away from public service, contributing to a persistent shortage of skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-maturity-in-the-non-financial-sector&quot;&gt;Lack of Maturity in the Non-Financial Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-running experience of financial institutions in implementing sanctions facilitated their readiness to confront the new obligations presented by the Russia regime and engage with competent authorities. However, most Taskforce members agreed that the non-financial sector continues to display varying degrees of readiness and capability to comply with the new sanctions regime. Deficiencies in the sector often relate to a lack of the necessary technical knowledge, skills and resources, including basic awareness of sanctions risks, rather than wilful neglect. The non-financial sector is increasingly participating in public–private collaboration efforts and enhancing their expertise and capabilities, but the gap demands greater attention from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quality-of-guidance&quot;&gt;Quality of Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Taskforce members welcomed OFSI’s recent decision to publish an FAQs document and found it useful for understanding OFSI’s expectations. Yet, one participant suggested that clearer and more comprehensive guidance might eliminate the burden for regulators to provide FAQs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant highlighted that sanctions and related guidance still do not reflect the specific nuances of supply chains. This creates a substantial compliance burden for businesses to check whether listed small components or items are present in their supply chain. They gave as an example the requirements to comply with sanctions on materials such as titanium, which required businesses to trace the origins of small components, with uncertain benefits for the ultimate goals of sanctions. Despite the overall usefulness of guidance and complementary FAQs, a sanctions lawyer in the Taskforce also raised concerns about the legal standing of the guidance, highlighting recent UK court decisions which have emphasised the prioritisation of the statutory language of the sanctions regulations over any related guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;listing-and-delisting-criteria&quot;&gt;Listing and Delisting Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal experts in the Taskforce criticised the current UK sanctions designation criteria for lacking clarity and rigorous standards, based on the low evidentiary threshold of “reasonable grounds to suspect”. Participants noted that UK courts have so far adopted an “arm’s length” approach when deliberating designation challenges, highlighting a prevailing trend in UK court rulings, viewing sanctions designations as a matter of government foreign policy with which they do not feel it is appropriate to engage, thus granting considerable leeway to the government in their sanctions decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most legal experts in the Taskforce highlighted the absence of an established delisting policy, leaving those sanctioned without recourse or explanation, further eroding the legitimacy of the sanctions regime. Some advocated for the introduction of clear, transparent criteria and procedures for lifting sanctions; these could include conditions such as divestment from problematic assets, cessation of activities linked to the Russian government, undergoing periodic independent audits, publicly supporting Ukraine, or criticising where possible Russia’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;combining-sanctions-with-criminal-justice-tools&quot;&gt;Combining Sanctions with Criminal Justice Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants raised significant concerns about due process and the rule of law when combining sanctions with criminal justice tools, due to sanctions’ low evidentiary threshold and their basis in ministerial decisions. They noted a lack of differentiation between assets of individuals or businesses of Russian heritage and/or who have divested their assets from Russia, and individuals involved in illicit activities such as corruption, money laundering or sanctions evasion. Only the latter should be subject to asset confiscation, yet discussions often fail to make this distinction. Despite these challenges, Taskforce members recommended combining sanctions with other enforcement tools, particularly criminal investigations resulting in civil and criminal forfeitures. They suggested that this approach, if carefully implemented, could enhance the UK’s independent sanctions policy and global influence. A member of the legal sector recommended looking at the activities of the US Task Force KleptoCapture as a successful example of this model to prosecute illicit conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alignment-of-sanctions-regimes&quot;&gt;Alignment of Sanctions Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While G7 countries aim for a unified approach to Russian sanctions, the Taskforce concurred that implementation varies between nations, leading to inconsistencies and challenges for international businesses. Private sector members reported that discrepancies in licensing and regulatory practices still existed between the US, the UK and the EU, causing operational disruptions. They emphasised the importance of alignment with international partners for the effectiveness of sanctions, the need to harmonise licences to simplify operations and mitigate diverging economic impacts, and the need for close coordination to minimise differences in sanctions regimes to avoid undermining collective efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-a-sustainable-vision&quot;&gt;Lack of a Sustainable Vision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Taskforce members highlighted their perception of the lack of a long-term vision in the UK sanctions strategy beyond the Russia regime. Most concurred that the current sanctions regime imposes a significant burden on businesses and regulators without necessarily achieving – or clearly evidencing – its intended objectives. For instance, despite its aim to disrupt Russian military trade flows, sanctions have not effectively curtailed Russia’s global procurement activities, but simply redirected them. Members from the private sector noted the challenge for the UK government of balancing competing political aims – for example, on the one hand, restricting finance and resources to Russia while on the other trying to maintain global energy supplies. This created a tension between political messaging of standing against Russia and the practical implementation of sanctions and licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants suggested that the UK needs to reassess its strategy to ensure that sanctions are not only punitive but also effective and sustainable. They recommended the UK revisited or eliminated measures that create undue burdens without significant impact. This approach would allow the UK to focus on sanctions that genuinely hinder the targeted activities and adapt to a changing global landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its departure from the EU, the UK embarked on an intensive journey to develop its independent sanctions policy. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine ushered in a new era, characterised by a rapid expansion and heightening of efforts, significant resource allocation, and a steep learning curve for government agencies. Despite these efforts, the Taskforce identified several deficiencies that the UK government must address to ensure the effectiveness and credibility of UK sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the Taskforce highlighted as key issues: resources and expertise; engagement with industry; alignment with international partners; and a clear set of objectives for its sanctions policy. The Taskforce agreed that the UK will need to look beyond Russia sanctions to react to evolving geopolitical risks and emerging threats. The Taskforce will reconvene in October 2024 for an assessment of the future and vision of the UK and its sanctions regimes to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of its sanctions strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

China has been a leading partner in many Latin American space projects and the primary focus of U.S. interest in space activities in the region. While important in the context of U.S.-China competition, this approach proves limiting in understanding the real imperatives and constraints behind international space engagement in the region, whether with China or the many other nations with which Latin American countries collaborate in space. Understanding the complex domestic and foreign policy factors impacting these choices is essential for developing U.S. engagement strategies and policies that fully leverage the vital opportunities afforded by space activities in the context of U.S.–Latin American relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space developments in Latin America remain relatively unknown to U.S. analysts and policymakers. One reason is that the outsized presence of China — responsible for the launch of over a dozen satellites on behalf of Latin American countries — is so often the focal point of English-language study of this topic. This analytical approach is typically framed as a chapter in the larger story of great power competition, with emphasis on strategic and security concerns given relative U.S. disengagement with the region. Yet it does little to explain why Latin American countries choose space-related partnerships with China — or, just as importantly, because the world has multiple spheres of influence and nations do not split cleanly into two sides, why they choose many other international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just about great power politics. Latin American actors operate in space as they do in other domains, with complex moves in both the domestic and foreign policy realms. When placed in a broader context that considers domestic constraints, as well as international foreign policy objectives, the complex modalities of international space engagement in the region — featuring civil and defense actors, civil society, academia, and industry — start to make more sense. For example, extensive Chinese-Brazilian collaboration to develop and operate the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) program has not prevented Brazil from making its proposed contributions to the United States’ Moon exploration program Artemis or participating in space security exchanges with the U.S. military. Instead, these reflect Brazil’s “universalist” approach to space cooperation, which echoes a foreign policy tradition of active nonalignment to keep all avenues of collaboration open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/o4rpBPJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It matters why and how Latin American space actors engage internationally. While Latin American countries’ choices in space partners are not simply an indication of attitudes toward the United States, these developments do have implications for U.S. strategic objectives, both in space and beyond. Oversimplifying these choices and failing to understand the drivers and constraints of space activities in the region risks the development of partnership strategies that fail to meet the needs of potential partners and are thus not seen as viable alternatives. It could also close the door on other opportunities beyond the realm of space. Efforts to advance U.S. objectives in the region would thus prove challenging and ineffective, with significant geopolitical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, space activities are linked to some of the most pressing issues facing decisionmakers today, from national security to agricultural production in the face of climate change. Latin American countries have observed the experience of actors such as India, which has successfully integrated space into its national development agenda, and thus see the potential for space to serve as a cross-cutting tool to address national priorities. The successful integration of space tools and applications is therefore pivotal in addressing the key Latin American issues of today, whether to support efforts to curb illegal fishing, understand the Venezuela-Guyana territorial border dispute, or assess recovery after Rio Grande do Sul’s devastating floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief captures findings from a yearlong study of the international engagement efforts of a subset of Latin American space actors through the lens of both domestic and foreign policy. It draws on extensive reading of primary and secondary sources in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; analysis of presentations and public remarks; and not-for-attribution interviews with government officials and other experts. The study fills a gap in the literature by shedding light on the broader context of space development in Latin America, where international cooperation has been central. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to the development of U.S. engagement strategies and policies that fully leverage the vital opportunities afforded by space activities in U.S.–Latin American relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief first paints a broad picture of space development and international space engagement in Latin America. It then examines three case studies that exemplify different types of international engagement, discussing the domestic and foreign policy drivers and constraints impacting these efforts. The brief then closes by assessing the implications for U.S. policymakers, offering several recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-space-region&quot;&gt;An “Emerging” Space Region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space activities are not new to Latin American countries. Space development in Latin America can be grouped into three general periods. The first began in the 1960s with Argentina and Brazil establishing space-focused entities and adopting a similar strategic approach to space as that of the United States, China, and the Soviet Union. Next, these early, largely military-led programs shifted to wholly civil or dual-use approaches in the 1990s amid the post–Cold War security landscape. The third and current phase exhibits important milestones across a wider set of countries and actors, such as universities and private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stated priorities continue to focus on acquiring, leveraging, or developing space technologies for societal need, with a particular emphasis on telecommunications and Earth observation rather than human spaceflight. For instance, the head of the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB), commenting on potential Brazilian contributions to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Artemis program, noted that while sending an astronaut to space “generates visibility,” it is “not the most important thing in the Brazilian space program. Its primary objective, from the beginning, is to generate benefits for society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is “profound heterogeneity” in the region’s space activities, which nevertheless share basic principles — such as support for the core international space treaties — and often retain an operational and leadership role for the military. A discussion of the space-related milestones achieved by the many Latin American countries is beyond the scope of this paper. It is important to note, however, that these have included activity across the technology, institutional, and international cooperation domains since the beginning — such as Ecuador ratifying the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (one of the core international space treaties) in 1972 and Costa Rica hosting the first Space Conference of the Americas in 1990. The diversity and breadth of activity in Latin America exhibits the limitations of simply describing it as an “emerging” space region, which implies that there has been very little activity and only very recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H2QgpeG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin American countries’ international engagement on space issues has been a core tenet since the 1960s. As reflected in Brazil’s National Program for Space Activities, PNAE 2022–2031, international cooperation is both a means (to advance national space development) as well as an end (to strengthen strategic alliances). In addition, every one of the projects of Argentina’s National Space Activities Commission (CONAE) has been developed through international cooperation, according to its director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas discussion of international cooperation tends to highlight joint projects or bilateral development efforts, Latin American space engagement has notably featured leadership in international coordination and cooperation bodies. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were among the 18 member states of the 1958 UN ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which later become a permanent committee and remains central for information exchange and cooperation in the peaceful use of space. Via national subject-matter experts and through the UN Group of Latin American Countries, the region has had significant weight in multilateral space governance efforts. This includes Brazil chairing a 2019 COPUOS session at which members adopted a set of voluntary best practices for space activities and Chile chairing the 2022 UN-convened working group on space threats, which saw active engagement from several other countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, today’s space activities in Latin America are increasingly spreading to the nongovernment realm, with new business ventures, including start-ups, being stood up even in countries with no national space programs. Presenting a new set of challenges for how to govern space activities, multiple civil society and advocacy organizations have formed to support the Latin American space industry and address the constraints on entry into the global space market. Worthy of future research, this is yet another dynamic that illustrates shared regional conditions and challenges. Taken as a whole, the Latin American space landscape is complex, full of energy, and hosts a diverse set of space actors who continue to advance international partnerships and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-looks-at-international-space-engagement-in-latin-america&quot;&gt;Three Looks at International Space Engagement in Latin America&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign and domestic policy considerations motivate and constrain the space activities of Latin American nations in ways that impact the priorities and lines of effort (“what”), rationales (“why”), institutions involved (“who”), and implementation approaches (“how”) of such efforts. The following case studies examine different types of international engagement among several actors. Selected collaborations do not include China and cannot be explained by great power politics, thereby highlighting the complexities at play in Latin American space decisions beyond strategic rivalry. Additionally, while these efforts began with decisions made decades ago, they represent important developments shaping space activities today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;autonomy-and-dependency-in-chiles-national-satellites&quot;&gt;Autonomy and Dependency in Chile’s National Satellites&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique among its neighbors, Chile opted to meet national security needs for data about its territory by sourcing Earth observation satellites commercially. The Chilean Air Force (FACh) used technology transfer contracts to procure its first national Earth observation satellites, FASat-Alpha and FASat-Bravo, from the United Kingdom’s Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL), then the lead manufacturer of commercial small satellites for international customers. In 1998, it successfully orbited FASat-Bravo after FASat-Alpha failed to deploy in 1995. The satellite’s successor, FASat-Charlie, was procured from Europe’s Astrium (now Airbus Defence and Space, which owns SSTL) and launched in 2011. Registered under the Chilean flag, the satellites added highly prized experience in satellite operations to Chile’s existing knowledge base on the interpretation and use of images and data from air- and space-borne remote sensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Chile announced a new national space effort. The National Satellite System (SNSat) would not just replace the aging FASat-Charlie but also include a national development component so that Chilean engineers would build the bulk of a new constellation of 10 small satellites. SNSat also includes plans to spread infrastructure and capacity more widely across Chile, helping address the development gap between Santiago and outer regions. Supported by an interministerial space council and a draft national space policy released for public comment in November 2023, SNSat attempts to address earlier calls for a national space program that meets national needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differing narratives behind these efforts, however, demonstrate the disconnects among the major Chilean institutions involved in space activities and the limitations of a program housed in a branch of the armed services. In August 2023, the Ministry of Defense, FACh, and Senate of Chile hosted a conference on “national space sovereignty.” While this makes sense from a military standpoint, this was criticized by several Chilean experts interviewed because speaking of “sovereignty” is at odds with international space law, which Chilean diplomats have long promoted and which explicitly prohibits sovereignty claims in space. Rather than a concerted shift in policy, inconsistencies such as this reflect domestic divides between operational/military voices and diplomatic voices speaking independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utilization of FASat-Charlie is also telling. A recent article found that Chile’s National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) did not use images from Charlie during the 2019–21 wildfire seasons, as had earlier been reported. Conversations with experts pointed to a combination of issues, including limited awareness of actual distribution channels, military restrictions on access, and the lack of a governance system to facilitate wider use. For example, FASat-Charlie was procured under a now-defunct law that allocated revenues from copper mining to purchases of materiel. With the satellite classified as a weapons system, it was required to remain within military control. In addition, the initial absence of guidelines to determine satellite tasking priority and distribution protocols for nonmilitary users frustrated civilians requesting imagery from FACh’s Aerophotogrammetric Service (SAF). Compounded by required user fees for SAF-processed data products, which added to both costs and delays, Chileans “turned elsewhere” to meet their satellite imagery needs, according to a former SAF official. Many governmental and private users turned to international sources of data, which could at times be acquired more quickly and cheaply. For example, Copernicus Chile, an imagery hub at the University of Chile, provides private and public institutions with data from the European satellite system Copernicus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complicated landscape has shaped the approach to SNSat, which is built on a long-term ambition of increased technical autonomy, including access to assets that Chile does not develop independently. Before the June 2023 launch of FASat-Delta — the first microsatellite under SNSat — Chile celebrated the first successful download of images from a virtual constellation of 200 foreign satellites. Providing access to different data types (e.g., radar and multispectral images beyond the visible range), the arrangement provides continuity to FASat-Charlie while better serving nonmilitary applications such as scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, SNSat involves difficult trade-offs. In contrast to its predecessors, FASat-Delta is not operated by FACh but by its contractor, Israeli company ImageSat International. As co-owner, FACh has priority access to data from the satellite — but only through a service arrangement, rather than direct satellite tasking. Recent diplomatic tensions between Chile and Israel have raised concerns about potential impacts. In March 2024, President Gabriel Boric excluded Israel from participating in the International Air and Space Fair (FIDAE) in Santiago. This was consistent with the president’s criticisms of Israeli actions in Gaza, an issue that has drawn significant domestic attention in Chile, which has the largest Palestinian diaspora outside of the Middle East. Nevertheless, this move was widely criticized for risking the multidecadal alliance with Israel in the scientific and defense realm upon which Chile relies. “The government’s decision could leave Chile without its satellites, which is very serious from the point of view of controlling the country’s security,” said former officials in an interview. While the Chilean government confirmed that it had no intentions of severing relations, Israel pulled its military attaché from its embassy in Santiago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the diplomatic strife, FASat-Delta is already facing technical challenges. As of May 2024, 300 days after launch, Delta was not yet operational due to issues discovered during validation and testing. Furthermore, until a ground segment antenna is installed in Chilean territory, a required component for receiving signals from the satellite as it passes overhead, FACh will not be able to download images directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, the delay in operations will increase users’ real and perceived reliance on external capabilities, complicating efforts to sustain the long-term political and resource investment required to execute the full vision for SNSat. In this landscape, leveraging frameworks such as the domestic space council to coordinate the apparently divergent national space communities will be essential for generating stakeholder buy-in. If successful at integrating space-related decisions into a larger national discourse, Chile’s experience will be helpful for other Latin American countries navigating the delicate balance between autonomy and dependency in space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sabia-mar-south-south-competition-and-cooperation&quot;&gt;SABIA-Mar: South-South Competition and Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Argentina and Brazil reflects broad waves of “advances and setbacks, comings and goings” as each country navigates its perceived regional and international standing and the dependencies of a shared border. Likewise, space is “a lagging (not leading) indicator of bilateral relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of intense distrust over concerns that the other nation was developing nuclear weapons, Argentina and Brazil reached a landmark bilateral solution to the nuclear question that paved the way for other collaboration. In 1989, Argentina and Brazil (now both under civilian rule) issued a joint presidential declaration calling space cooperation a “multiplying factor” in sustainable development. In 1996, shortly after establishing their own civil space agencies, the parties signed a framework agreement that has been repeatedly expanded and still guides their overarching space cooperation. From early integration and testing of Argentina’s Science Application Satellites series in Brazilian facilities to the use of Argentinean industry components on Brazil’s first homegrown satellite, Amazonia-1, the partners’ increasingly complex technical cooperation efforts are now focused on a major shared priority: water. With Argentina’s CONAE marking over 30 years of “looking at Earth from space” and Brazil’s efforts to manage its strategic maritime territory known as the Blue Amazon, the ocean-focused effort is a “natural partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a state visit to Buenos Aires in 2008, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva issued a joint statement with Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner endorsing the satellite project and noting the “strategic” nature of the bilateral relationship. Having evolved from an initial concept in 1998 which was further fleshed out in subsequent agreements, the Satellite for Applications Based on Environmental Marine Information (SABIA-Mar) project kicked off with the goal of developing two identical satellites for ocean monitoring and mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet each side did not make progress at the same rate. Significant resource constraints in Brazil were exacerbated by setbacks such as the delayed development of the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), the satellite bus Brazil was to contribute to the project, and the 2013 failure of CBERS-3, a satellite in the joint program with China. To ensure the continuous flow of data, China and Brazil accelerated development of CBERS-4 by one year, drawing resources away from other projects. Thus, despite healthy relations between AEB and CONAE, Brazil had little to show for its part in SABIA-Mar a decade in, and its role in the project was uncertain. Tellingly, in the PNAE, Brazil’s 10-year space plan released in late 2021, SABIA-Mar was listed as a “proposed project” that could potentially use “spare parts” from another satellite. According to an expert then working at AEB, the agency conducted an internal review in 2021 on what had happened with the project and came up with options for consideration, including formal withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of technical and political factors turned the tide in 2023. One of these was the success of Brazil’s first fully domestic satellite, Amazonia-1, which launched in 2021 and demonstrated the maturity of the MMP. On the political side, President Lula’s return to power in January 2023 overlapped with the end of President Alberto Fernández’s term (and consequently Fernández de Kirchner’s term as vice president), prompting a quick warming of relations. Intent on reengaging with allies after the “radical departure” of President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil hurried to strengthen ties through high-level engagements that included cooperation on science and space in advance of a similarly dramatic change in leadership in Argentina later that year. At last, with Brazil recommitting to its participation in the project, the partners are working to field two satellites: SABIA-Mar 1 will be fully developed by Argentina and SABIA-Mar 2 will be Brazil’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging steps, SABIA-Mar’s future is uncertain. Resource commitments are in no way a given in Brazil, which invested only about a third of the monies required to execute space activities envisioned in its previous 10-year plan. Now under President Javier Milei’s administration, Argentina has significantly slashed government spending as part of austerity measures and maintains a tense relationship with Brazil — making it uncertain whether Argentina’s satellite will complete development by the 2026 target launch date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008, during his speech in Buenos Aires, President Lula spoke of the bilateral alliance being “indispensable” to each country’s national goals and to the need to emphasize areas of agreement over the differences he acknowledged would always exist. Today’s tensions between Brazil’s and Argentina’s leaders increase the risk that these differences, while unlikely to threaten long-standing strategic interests, may overtake cooperative efforts, especially if problems arise that require diverting already limited resources. Analysts have pointed to the risks carried by recent visible, petty fights among Latin American leaders, noting that “multiple presidents fighting with each other as if they’re trying to win a reality show means that governing and cooperation do not occur.” While space is not going to play a leading role in the bilateral Argentina-Brazil relationship, the latest dispute between Presidents Milei and Lula could mean projects such as SABIA-Mar get caught in the crossfire as the relationship ebbs and flows over the coming years. Ultimately, if SABIA-Mar is successful, it will indeed be Latin America’s “most significant example of South–South cooperation,” not just because of complex technical demands but also due to the interplay of forces involved in maintaining this collaboration through the decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;latin-americas-esa&quot;&gt;Latin America’s ESA?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency (ALCE) was launched in Mexico City in 2021 at a session of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) presided by Mexico. Co-championed by Argentina, which has proposed a regional space entity in its national space plans since 2000, ALCE’s roots can be traced back to the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much has been written about Latin America’s expectations regarding the region’s long hoped-for counterpart to the European Space Agency (ESA), ALCE is just now on the cusp of beginning formal operations. Written into ALCE’s constitutive agreement is a requirement that at least 11 countries ratify it before it enters into force. Even as ALCE continues to garner signatories — 21 countries as of May 2024 — formal ratification has proven challenging. Reflecting on the challenges of clearing this “legal-diplomatic” hurdle, the Mexican representative to ALCE, Ambassador Gustavo Alonso Cabrera Rodríguez, lamented the confluence of institutional and political factors that has led to the significant delay. Speaking at FIDAE in April 2024, he wondered at the willingness of members to assign dedicated representatives, saying that without designated space institutions such issues default to the ministers of foreign relations and thus depend on “individual relationships.” This has meant that supporters have needed to actively promote the agency even among countries that have already committed to joining, making the formalization step lengthier and less certain. Nevertheless, with ratifications trickling in, reaching 10 as of May 2024, experts close to the effort confirmed that ALCE intends to launch formal operations by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues Cabrera Rodríguez raised regarding the formalization of the agreement ironically point to a problem ALCE is itself intended to resolve: the absence of an entry point for sustained regional cooperation. Not unique to the space realm, the lack of sustained political integration has been a persistent challenge for Latin America, which hosts over 30 regional organizations and forums, all with varying degrees of legitimacy. In contrast with Africa, which has rallied around the African Union as the most legitimate regional voice on several issues, Latin America has no such central representative body. Regional and subregional groups such as the Pacific Alliance and the Union of South American Nations wax and wane in relevance and tend not to represent the region’s views consistently or speak for all countries. CELAC itself was arguably created “as a counterweight to U.S. influence in the region,” an alternative to the Organization of American States (OAS), which includes both Canada and the United States. Similarly, while the idea of a regional space agency is old, there has not been consensus on its membership. Analysts have faulted “political grievances” for the decades-long delay in establishing ALCE and note Brazil’s absence — blamed on political differences — as a major weakness. Although Brazilian officials have spoken positively of ALCE, Brazil has not agreed to join on the basis that it was not a member of CELAC when it was negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important questions regarding how ALCE will finance its activities remain tied to the problem of sustaining domestic political support for it within member countries. As Cabrera Rodríguez said, it will be difficult to make investment in the agency attractive in a “scenario of scarcity or apparent scarcity.” Related challenges, such as the asymmetries of national space capabilities in the region, reflect a circular situation: ALCE may need to exist to create the necessary domestic support to sustain it. In some ways, it could help coordinate a space community with widely disconnected pockets of expertise, but only if national governments provide consistent support. ALCE is by nature a political effort and subject to the broader dynamics that have made regional integration a challenge — such as polarization and staunch support for sovereignty driven by a history of interventionism. There are already ideological differences that are reputedly preventing certain space nations, including Colombia and Ecuador, from joining ALCE. It is likely no accident that ALCE has been given a “coordinator role for regional space activities instead of a more political role.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest ALCE has garnered from external partners is significant and only likely to increase as formal operations begin. The ESA and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, among other space agencies, have already proposed collaboration with ALCE. In addition, “China is very interested,” said Cabrera Rodríguez in April and again in May during the first China-CELAC space forum, in Wuhan. ALCE has also been welcomed to the new Ibero-American Network of Aerospace Agencies, which is coordinated by the Organization of Ibero-American States and includes the Portuguese Space Agency. These nods of recognition, along with the persistent need for more stable institutions handling space topics, may continue to help boost the effort. ALCE is not Latin America’s ESA — but it could fill at least some of the need for integration on space issues in a region fraught with fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples serve as a reminder that space activities do not exist in isolation. Chile’s experiences with FASat and SNSat demonstrate how domestic constraints can create international positions and relationships that do not necessarily result from a determined foreign policy direction. SABIA-Mar shows an alternate scenario, wherein a project supported by a stable relationship at the institutional level is alternately buffeted and aided by higher-order shifts between the country’s leaders. Finally, the journey to an operational regional space agency, ALCE, reflects Latin America’s tortuous relationship with political integration even as it opens new avenues of external engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With space activities thus naturally rooted in domestic and regional realities, the analysis of Latin American international space engagement benefits greatly from looking beyond great power politics. Overall, Latin American countries have many options to meet their space technology and application needs, and a mix of factors (e.g., eager partners, competing domestic stakeholders, and foreign policy strategies such as hedging) will continue to be reflected in space alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter for the United States? U.S. national space policy highlights the need to expand the country’s space alliances. The bipartisan objectives articulated in the 2020 National Space Policy, the 2021 U.S. Space Priorities Framework, and the 2022 National Security Strategy include diversifying strategic partnerships with emerging and middle space powers and strengthening global governance of space activities in line with U.S. principles. But the United States should change the way it approaches these issues with potential new partners. It cannot be guided solely on the assumption that geopolitical imperatives drive Latin American space partnerships, rendering space as just a way for nations to pick sides in the U.S.-China rivalry. The United States needs to recognize that the complex space alliances prevalent in Latin America are not simply a function of its own actions but a reflection of the interplay of numerous countries’ domestic and foreign policy drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, U.S. space engagement in the region should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonstrate a whole-of-government approach to bilateral engagement across Latin America.&lt;/strong&gt; Due to impermanent roles surrounding space, a single, national point of contact often does not exist among Latin American actors. Coupled with patchwork institutional frameworks that exacerbate gaps among the communities involved in space, U.S. partners may find that there are many different, even contradictory positions on space issues and that no single decisionmaker is able to drive forward an effort. Moreover, there is a proliferation of dual-use programs that serve both civil and defense needs, reflecting the already blurred lines between civil, defense, and commercial space efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, U.S. engagement with its Latin American counterparts tends to be siloed — with civil space visits on the one hand and military-only discussions on the other, even while both seek expanded collaboration. In nations such as Chile that lack a civil space agency comparable to NASA and that are pursuing dual-use programs involving civil and defense entities, limiting conversations to U.S. civil space agencies or to U.S. defense agencies is risky. This severely limits the effectiveness of relationship-building efforts intended to develop shared understanding on space issues and ultimately advance common priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The somewhat fractured nature of some of the space communities in Latin America should not deter U.S. engagement but instead invite an integrated whole-of-government approach, as called for in the U.S. Strategic Framework for Space Diplomacy. The United States should build on existing successes — such as the Space Force’s bilateral data-sharing agreements on space situational awareness, as well as civil space agencies’ leadership in the regional Earth observation collaboration framework, AmeriGEO — to better integrate space issues into its broader relations with regional partners. This engagement could be modeled after the comprehensive dialogues the United States has held on space with important allies such as France and Japan. Even if it is not appropriate to elevate certain Latin American relationships to that level, this approach could inform engagement with key security partners such as Colombia or economic partners such as Mexico and Chile. In addition to facilitating collaboration across the U.S. agencies already engaged in Latin America, this would enable the United States to contribute subject-matter expertise and resources from across the government, modeling the kind of effective institutional coordination that strengthens the U.S. space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand engagement to other multilateral settings, even ones not dedicated to space.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should better leverage other regional forums and venues, such as the OAS and the Summit of the Americas, to create sustained engagement on space topics. Knowing that the opportunities and risks associated with space technology are not widely recognized across the different decisionmaking communities in Latin America, U.S. decisionmakers should not assume that space capabilities are being leveraged or even considered as part of collective efforts on issues such as cybersecurity, public health, or food insecurity. More consistent integration of space-related applications by U.S. agencies involved in these efforts can help foster important stakeholder connections on the Latin American side, drawing leaders’ attention to space and benefiting even communities with few or no dedicated space institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A more intentional engagement strategy that takes space discussions beyond the usual venues also presents an opportunity to counter China’s extensive reach in formal and informal regional forums. For instance, China’s engagement with CELAC, an organization it prefers because it excludes the United States, includes a space element. The recently expanded BRICS alliance, which evolved from an economic-oriented grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa into a larger political and economic forum, has also gained relevance in the space domain. From coordination projects such as the BRICS Joint Committee on Space Cooperation, which was announced in 2021 and is intended to enable satellite data sharing, to statements on space sustainability and space security in the 2024 BRICS declaration, it is clear that members see the alliance as a legitimate forum to align on space issues. To enhance coordination and collaboration with like-minded Latin American space nations, the United States should adopt a more agile engagement strategy that consistently includes space on the regional agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand collaboration on national space governance topics.&lt;/strong&gt; Since security considerations mean technology transfer arrangements may not be on the table for U.S.–Latin America collaboration, the United States should expand efforts in other substantive areas informed by the unique dynamics of the region. This should include national governance — the combination of policy, law, and regulation, supported by institutional frameworks — of space activities. The inconsistencies and misalignments referenced in this report sometimes result from gaps in these areas and threaten both the successful implementation of national programs and efforts to elevate space in the list of priorities. Licensing regimes for commercial space efforts, the development of mechanisms for regular engagement with nongovernment actors, and research-to-operations strategies that enhance adoption of government-funded science are among the many governance topics ripe for bilateral and multilateral dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States can draw on its experience with Latin American nations but also involve partners such as Canada to share perspectives on adopting governance models tailored to a different government structure and that seek different goals. These topics — while not as headline-worthy as joint hardware development projects — are a natural extension of the region’s substantial support for important U.S.-led space-governance efforts such as the Artemis Accords. In elaborating on how such principles are put into practice in a way that can account for the unique challenges of countries in the region, such collaboration could help advance national governance in Latin America, thereby advancing space development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International space engagement in Latin America is not about apolitical calculations driven by technological needs, nor does it represent just another front in the U.S.-China great power rivalry. It is instead a landscape where complex domestic and foreign policy factors interact to both motivate and constrain the choices Latin American countries make about space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges at hand for the space programs in Latin America do not correspond simply to a lack of funding or technical know-how. Ultimately, for space activities to help advance national priorities, they should be rooted in the domestic and international policy strategies of each nation. To be a strong ally and meet its own strategic objectives in space and in Latin America, the United States should shift how it approaches its regional space engagement. The considerations and recommendations in this brief can inform enhanced strategic partnerships, including cooperation on new areas such as developing institutional frameworks and bringing space discussions outside of traditional space forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Latin American space landscape is complex, but it is one that potential partners in the United States can navigate. As a leading regional expert argued recently, among the advantages the region presents for the United States is that it is both “far” from global conflicts and “near” U.S. markets. Space collaboration presents a valuable opportunity to bring the United States and Latin American partners closer — contributing to relationships that are stronger, more strategic, and better positioned to address the shared challenges of today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the main thrust of Russia’s anticipated summer offensive underway, it is an opportune moment to take stock of the significant and underappreciated changes that have taken hold in Moscow’s approach to cyber operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Western analysis to date has fixated on Russia’s highly visible opening cyber offensive, the merits of its approach, and the potential for a renewed destructive campaign of a similar nature against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. This focus is misplaced, however, and has anchored Western understanding of the war’s cyber dimensions to Russia’s countervalue strategy to amass societal pressure via the widespread sabotage of computer networks – an approach that has not seen primacy since the invasion’s first year when assumptions about a short war still guided Russia’s theory of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harsher reality is that Russia’s intelligence services have adapted their posture in cyberspace to the demands of a long war. Mounting evidence, stretching back to the months preceding Ukraine’s counteroffensive in 2023, indicates that multiple Russian cyber units have shifted their sights away from strategic civilian targets toward soldiers’ computers and mobiles endpoints in order to enable tactical military objectives on Ukraine’s frontlines. This change in operational focus has been cross-cutting, with Russian military intelligence (GRU) and the domestic security service (FSB) – long renowned for rivalry and mistrust – unifying their earlier disjointed cyber efforts and systematising a series of tradecraft adaptations intended to increase their military effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a relative shift in priorities rather than a complete overhaul of Russia’s wider strategy. There remain patterns of operational activity indicative of sustained interest in Ukrainian critical infrastructure objects that would hold no immediate intelligence value, and therefore likely represent preparations for future sabotage. What is clear, however, is that Moscow has rebalanced its overarching concept of operations to emphasise targets that can provide more direct and tangible battlefield advantages to its conventional forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These adjustments are not solely a reflection of Russia’s scaled-down ambitions in Ukraine, nor how its wider perception of Kyiv’s centre of gravity have changed over the past two years as the conflict intensified into a war of attrition. They are also an important signal of how Russia’s intelligence services have adapted their thinking about how to optimally integrate cyber and conventional capabilities after two years of high-intensity engagement, and what the coming months may bring as Russia makes a new push in eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-tactical-pivot&quot;&gt;Russia’s Tactical Pivot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refocusing of Russia’s cyber campaign to meet what is almost certainly an increasing demand for tactical-relevant signals intelligence (SIGINT) has largely fallen into a few main lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond targeted efforts to gain access to devices and systems used by Ukrainian soldiers, Russia has also reoriented its cyber forces to help locate Ukrainian military equipment and positions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first has been penetrating devices used by Ukrainian soldiers at the front. Not only has Kyiv’s emphasis on “data-driven combat” made smartphones an invaluable source of location data to establish patterns of movement and locate and target Ukrainian positions, but the military’s dependence on free encrypted messaging applications (EMAs), such as Signal for secure operational communication, has made the ability to eavesdrop on these devices of paramount importance for both the GRU and the FSB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Moscow is that collecting these types of signals is not a trivial feat at scale. The cryptographic protocols used by popular EMAs have withstood rigorous public scrutiny, and it is unlikely Russia’s services are capable of quietly breaking them. Phones at the front are also unlikely to be connected to mobile networks where geolocation and other signals can be reliably collected upstream through compromised telecommunications infrastructure or by electronic warfare capabilities. This has driven the intelligence services to adopt a few operational concepts to fill this critical collection gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One method has been conventional attempts at full-device compromise using malware, more often than not, disguised as applications used by the Ukrainian military. While this tradecraft is not altogether new – the GRU first altered a Ukrainian app to geolocate artillery units in 2016 – the masking of malware as versions of mobile applications has increased significantly in response to Kyiv’s suite of software-driven military innovations. These operations have generally relied on highly tailored social engineering, repurposing legitimate military communications, and directly interacting with targets over Signal and Telegram chats to build rapport before delivering the malicious applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other more novel method has been to siphon messages through the device-linking feature built into common EMAs. One Russian military-affiliated unit has dedicated its focus to social engineering Ukrainian soldiers into linking Russian-intelligence controlled instances of EMAs including Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp to their accounts. Similarly focused FSB operations have centred on exploiting systems already linked to Ukrainian soldiers’ phones. According to Microsoft, cyber operators linked to Center 16, the FSB’s main SIGINT unit, have shown a specific interest in stealing files containing messages from the Signal Desktop application, providing them access to the target’s private Signal conversations and attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the GRU is also engaged in the close-access exploitation of mobile devices and other systems captured by Russian forces on the battlefield to achieve similar access. Here, cyber operators have begun to technically enable their counterparts within the Russian military to independently initiate the collection of intelligence from Ukrainian devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the author’s Mandiant research has highlighted how the GRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST), commonly known as APT44 or Sandworm, has provided dedicated infrastructure and technical instructions to Russian ground forces so that they can exfiltrate Telegram and Signal communications from captured devices at the front. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has similarly reported on Sandworm using captured devices as a foothold to deliver malware known as Infamous Chisel to penetrate military networks and gather data on connected Starlink terminals and the suite of specialised applications used by the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major line of effort has been to penetrate the digital systems used by the Ukrainian army for command and control, situational awareness and other operational needs. It is no secret that digitised battlefield management systems like Delta and Kropyva have been a critical enabler of information and combat advantages for the Ukrainian army. In fact, Moscow has perceived these systems to be so effective that it has undertaken efforts to develop exact replicas for the Russian military. Unlike attempts to deliver malware disguised as these applications to compromise endpoints, this category of operations has instead focused on tricking soldiers to give up their credentials, providing Russia’s services a surreptitious lens into Kyiv’s common operational picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond targeted efforts to gain access to devices and systems used by Ukrainian soldiers, Russia has also reoriented its cyber forces to help locate Ukrainian military equipment and positions. The SBU has warned of Russian efforts to control compromised webcams in population centres to locate Ukrainian air defences and other critical infrastructure objects and feed targeting data into its reconnaissance-strike complex. Dutch military intelligence has similarly alerted publics to the overall refocusing of Russia’s cyber campaign, highlighting operations designed to locate and map military positions and equipment for later physical seizure. Those providing assistance to Ukraine should factor in the potential risks of this cyber-enabled surveillance activity, as the intensifying campaign of sabotage across Europe strongly indicates that insight into Western military supply chains is a clear collection priority for Russia’s intelligence services at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, each of these new operational concepts point to a deepening two-way relationship between Russian cyber and conventional forces, and the extension of their early coordination efforts to now encompass both strategic and tactical objectives. What’s more, they signal that for specific operations, Russian cyber elements have likely also moved closer to the front to capitalise on the short-lived tactical intelligence that these mobile devices might provide. Looking forward, it is reasonable to expect further adaptations and operational concepts to arise from this closer relationship as the war continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-ukraine-and-nato&quot;&gt;Implications For Ukraine and NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway for Western policymakers is that mobile devices have become a critical centre of gravity for Russia’s cyber campaign in Ukraine. The war’s technology-dense and sensor-rich frontlines have placed a premium on the ability to collect signals from soldiers’ devices and the digital networks that connect them. With new technologies continuing to shape the battlefield and drive tactical innovations on the front lines, these types of operations are only likely to grow more common as the war continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s impressive defensive feats aside, Russia’s adapted force employment demands renewed attention on how to best sustain international support for Ukraine’s cyber defences&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is important to recognise is that this is a fundamentally different technology environment where earlier lessons about the capacity of governments and the private sector to support Ukrainian cyber defences are less likely to hold. Visibility into sensitive military networks and mobile devices is much more opaque, virtual incident response is more difficult, and fewer defensive partners are likely to have capabilities readied for this type of security assistance. Ukraine’s impressive defensive feats aside, Russia’s adapted force employment demands renewed attention on how to best sustain international support for Ukraine’s cyber defences. This is especially important now that other emerging threats are increasingly consuming limited intelligence resources and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally as important, we must begin to acknowledge that the second-order consequences of these espionage operations can be grave. Take, for example, the lethal strike on Ukraine’s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade in November 2023 that was traced back to the penetration of a soldier’s Signal account. At a time when conventional wisdom has grown dismissive about the military benefit that cyber operations have afforded Russia, it is important that we carefully consider the implications of this mission realignment and what it portends about cyber’s expanding role in kinetic, conventional operations now that attrition is the key element of Russia’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious linked devices will continue to provide intercepts even when phones are disconnected, destroyed or otherwise inactive, as Signal messages do not need to route through the target’s phone to be delivered to a linked device. Communications will therefore still reach Russian operators even when they will not necessarily reach the intended Ukrainian recipient. As one Ukrainian expert puts it, if “a soldier from a battalion group gets captured or dies, his phone falls into the hands of the enemy, and the Russians read all the correspondence in this group for another month”. The long-tail impact of these operations can be severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should also be prepared for Russia’s new operational concepts to proliferate outside of Ukraine. Today, Signal and other EMAs have become standard practice for sensitive communications. These applications see ubiquitous use by Western militaries, politicians, civil-society groups, and other common targets of Russia’s intelligence services. Russia’s war-focused tactics could therefore reasonably see wider use to fulfil other urgent intelligence requirements, such as the collection of foreign political intelligence from Ukraine’s partners, or in potential efforts to influence one of the many consequential Western elections on the horizon. If history has taught us anything, it’s that Russian tradecraft rarely stays confined to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sir Keir Starmer’s cabinet sets about establishing what Labour policies mean in government for the first time in more than 14 years, his ministers will find there are some issues that will prove as thorny in government as they did in opposition. When it comes to foreign policy, one such example would be the Middle East; and when it comes to the Middle East, one such example would be Israel and the Palestinians. Israel’s war on Gaza has gone on for more than nine months, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, with the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, stating that civilians in Gaza are being pushed into, “ever deeper circles of hell”, due to the ensuing humanitarian situation arising from the Israeli campaign. On 7 July, David Lammy, the UK’s new foreign secretary, said that the UK seeks a “balanced position” on the current situation. How might that look on Israel–Gaza, and Israel–Palestine more generally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-and-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict&quot;&gt;The UK and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last Conservative period of government, from 2010 until this year, relations between Israel and the UK reached an apex of support signified by a 2030 roadmap agreement signed in 2023, establishing widespread cooperation in a variety of fields. At the same time, the British government’s official position on Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories remained transparent; repeated declarations by London indicated its view that international law considered East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank to be occupied territory, and settlements therein illegal. (Indeed, a Conservative minister of state, Alan Duncan, spoke at RUSI in 2014 to make this point quite clear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last year has been a challenging one for British interests in the region; the 7 October attack on Israel, followed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, raised the threat of regional conflict, be it between Israel and Iran, Israel and Lebanon, as well as other theatres. As this author has mentioned with regard to Europe in another brief: a stable wider Arab world is in the UK’s ultimate interest; a wider Arab world and Middle East region in turmoil is precisely the opposite. Indeed, due to British interests being affected, the UK committed the use of force in the Red Sea against the Houthis, as a result of the latter’s escalation on international shipping lanes in the Red Sea – an escalation that would not have taken place had the war in Gaza been averted, or a ceasefire come to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, London’s diplomatic capital internationally is being impacted by the perception that the UK’s commitment to the “rules-based order” is not as absolute as it proclaims, because of the assessment that the UK has been lacking in balance vis-à-vis Israel–Palestine. As one G7 diplomat told the Financial Times months ago, “What we said about Ukraine has to apply to Gaza. Otherwise we lose all our credibility”. The UK stands in need of more, not less such diplomatic capital, with all the challenges on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-future-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Immediate Future: Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate future, the restoration of UK funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), announced by the Foreign Secretary on Friday 19 July, is a welcome step that ought to be followed up by British moves to improve aid transfers to the Palestinian occupied territories. Criticisms by the former Conservative government about the difficulty to get aid into Gaza due to Israeli obstacles remain valid; restoration of support to UNRWA is necessary to reduce the humanitarian crisis, but there remain other difficulties to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another near-term topic that is likely to come up again quite soon is that of arms sales to Israel by the UK. While it is true that such arms sales represent a small proportion of arms transfers to Israel, as the former foreign secretary Lord Cameron pointed out, such a point is immaterial to HMG’s legal obligations. Under the UK’s strategic export licensing criteria (SELC), London is required to prevent the transfer of military equipment where there is a clear or overriding risk that such equipment might be used to facilitate a serious violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While London is not in the business of telling the Israeli population how to vote, the British government should make clear to its ally what its own values are&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 130 parliamentarians in the last parliament argued this was already the case, joining many different human rights and aid organisations. Crucially, the Foreign Affairs Committee chair in the last parliament, Alicia Kearns, repeatedly raised the issue of whether or not export licence applications for Israel have been referred to ministers over the past year. If the UK were to take the step of suspending or restricting such export licences, they would be joining a number of their allies; Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, Italy, and Spain have already done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it may be that HMG legal advice has already recommended such a step. When in opposition, Foreign Secretary Lammy criticised the then Conservative-led government for not publishing the legal advice provided; it would be prudent for him to do so now, in order to show that a page has been turned in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the short-term decisions, this is perhaps the most difficult, because it would place the UK in a place different from its close allies in the US, France and Germany. Simultaneously, it is important to note that previous British governments, including those of David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, and Margaret Thatcher, all suspended arms sales to Israel on different occasions – the precedent has already been set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medium-term-the-icc-and-palestine-recognition&quot;&gt;Medium Term: the ICC and Palestine Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, there are two critical areas that are likely to be raised. The first relates to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the ICC prosecutor general, Karim Khan. Prominent US Republican politicians, including the newly announced candidate for the US vice-presidency, J D Vance, have called for sanctions against and an investigation into Khan, as a result of the latter’s calling for arrest warrants against Israeli officials. The Biden administration has also confirmed it wants to work with Congress to penalise the ICC. As a signatory of the Rome Statute that established the ICC, in addition to the fact that Khan is a British citizen, the UK ought to vigorously defend the ICC and the prosecutor general. London’s discreet challenge against ICC jurisdiction over Israeli officials, lodged in the last weeks of the last government, should be withdrawn; its continuation, particularly given the weak legal basis and existing challenges against the ICC, would be viewed as lacklustre support for the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second medium-term issue pertains to immediate recognition of the State of Palestine, which was, until relatively recently, a Labour policy. Labour has now changed that policy to indicate that recognition will happen as part of a peace process, rather than at the conclusion of that process, and that Labour was committed to such recognition. The reluctance to immediately recognise the State of Palestine is primarily due to a desire to avoid a rift with US President Joe Biden, which is understandable given London’s overarching security architecture. But it is not a foregone conclusion that London’s recognition would create a rift of any consequence with Washington DC. A total of 144 of the 193 member states of the UN already recognise the State of Palestine, including a majority of European states – their relations with Washington DC have been unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: given the option of recognition, should the UK still resist it? British recognition of a Palestinian state would not immediately bring one into existence, so one could argue it is merely symbolic, and hardly consequential. The opposing argument is that recognition by the UK is qualitatively different than many other countries, given London’s historic role in the Israel–Palestine question. When Norway recognised a Palestinian state earlier this year, it was essentially stating that Oslo no longer believed in the Oslo Peace Process. The more such political messages are sent, the more pressure there is for a political process to be reinvigorated, rather than the continuation of an unstable status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-term-uk-political-convergence-and-divergence-on-israelpalestine&quot;&gt;Long term: UK Political Convergence and Divergence on Israel–Palestine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are longer term issues that the UK will have to address. The developing nature of the Israeli political spectrum has seen over the past decade a widening and mainstreaming of the Israeli far-right, with not only attitudes hardening on the margins, but in the centre. The latest such example was the near-entirety of the Israeli Knesset voted against Palestinian statehood, and thus the two-state solution itself, on the 18th of July; a political settlement that the international community, including the UK, has rallied behind for decades. Extreme radical views are expressed not only by members of far-right political parties, but also within traditionally centre-right ones, such as Likud. While London is not in the business of telling the Israeli population how to vote, the British government should make clear to its ally what its own values are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;London should consider re-evaluating the 2030 roadmap agreement that was signed with Israel in 2023&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, the sanctions regime that the UK FCDO has, and which it instituted against two extremist groups in Israel in May, should be widened. The settlement movement in the West Bank has not been infiltrated by extremist elements that need to be isolated; rather, the settlement movement is in itself an illegal enterprise, supported by the Israeli government and military. British courts, British politicians and the British government have made it abundantly clear on numerous occasions that East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza are all occupied territories, and that the occupying power is the State of Israel. HMG policy should make it clear that settlement activity writ large ought to result in sanctions. Moreover, as the ICC and International Court of Justice (ICJ) investigations continue, it is likely that there will be Israeli, as well as Hamas figures, that are sanctioned or the subject of arrest warrants. London should prepare for this, as it is likely that highly senior figures in the Israeli government will be affected, and London ought to make it clear that it upholds the independence of both the ICC and the ICJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London already has a strongly effective system of restrictions and sanctions with regard to Hamas and support for terrorism, via legal and political measures, and little more seems necessary in that regard. However, in coordination with particularly European allies, which has substantial leverage with regard to the Palestinian Authority owing to existing EU aid packages, the UK should focus on “more for more”; not by threatening a withdrawal of aid, particularly at a time of tremendous suffering, but by proposing increased access to European and British markets for Palestinian trade, in exchange for improvements in governance by Palestinian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the ongoing widespread concerns around violations of international humanitarian law, London should furthermore consider re-evaluating the 2030 roadmap agreement that was signed with Israel in 2023. That agreement has significant impact on bilateral relations on military support and trade, among a wide variety of other fields. Given that Israel is currently in the dock at the ICJ for genocide charges, a suspension of the agreement until the outcome of the case at least, would seem prudent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the UK, while remaining aware and humble about its ability to directly impact the situation on the ground, should nonetheless recognise its tremendous indirect leveraging power. The UK enjoys a privileged relationship with the US, which has the most direct consequential impact on the Israel–Palestine question. London also has extensive and deep contacts with Arab states that are extremely important with regard to the conflict, particularly Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE. If the US were to use the leverage it has over the Israelis, and Arab states were to simultaneously use their leverage over the Palestinians, the prospects for a genuine and sustainable peace settlement in Israel–Palestine would be far easier to materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been ongoing for decades, and it is tempting to see it as an unsolvable foreign policy issue. But such defeatist thinking led to the political dynamic that eventually led to the terrible events of 7 October, and sent the region into a deeply dangerous spiral of escalation and violence. UK national security interests stipulate that London further prospects for a wider peace in the region, if only to hold back the possibility of wider escalation of violence, and corresponding impacts on British interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of China’s entry into the UN, Foreign Minister Wang Yi boasted of China’s peacekeeping efforts, highlighting that the country had fulfilled its pledge to establish an 8,000-member standby peacekeeping force, participated in 29 former and ongoing peacekeeping operations, and contributed more than 50,000 personnel. Wang declared, “China has met its responsibilities for upholding world peace. Over the past 50 years, China has taken the side of fairness, upholding equality and opposing interference in other countries’ internal affairs, power politics and hegemonism”. He emphasised that China’s active involvement was a major departure from its longstanding policy of not participating in UN peacekeeping missions, which – from Beijing’s point of view –strategists and policymakers had underappreciated for too many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By most accounts, the international community widely appreciates China’s growing contribution due to the unprecedented demand for UN peacekeeping. Today’s peacekeeping missions are increasingly complex in terms of the scale and scope of their mandates. However, China’s expanding role in peace operations highlights its growing prominence within the UN. This development directly challenges the US’s strategic influence and its broader role as leader of the rules-based international order. It is essential to recognise that peacekeeping, stabilisation and large-scale combat operations are not mutually exclusive. Instead, peace operations should be viewed through the lens of strategic competition which the US government can use to its advantage while assisting populations in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;growth-of-chinese-peacekeeping-activities&quot;&gt;Growth of Chinese Peacekeeping Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 24 years, China has significantly expanded its participation in UN peacekeeping missions. In 2000, the country provided fewer than 100 personnel to all peace operations. Now, Beijing is the 10th largest troop and police contributor (2,274 personnel) of any country and the second largest financial supporter, providing nearly 19% of UN peacekeeping programme funding (see Figure 1). Moreover, China provides more peacekeepers to UN operations than all the other UN Security Council permanent members combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2O3pPR9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Chinese Troop and Police Contributions to UN Missions, 2000–2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these contributions may appear positive for the overall UN peacekeeping agenda, China – like other countries – is motivated out of self-interest to advance its foreign policy objectives. Strong participation in UN peace operations is an ideal way for China to gain on-the-ground operational experience abroad, build multilateral cooperation, improve bilateral relations and advance a positive image domestically and worldwide. Also, China’s peacekeeping efforts appear to match its resource investments and economic interests, particularly in Africa, where more than three-quarters of Chinese nationals on UN missions are deployed. Beijing has progressively linked these deployments to protecting its interests and citizens on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other significant factors may influence China’s peacekeeping activities apart from its economic interests, as suggested by data collected from 2012–2018 by Lucy Best. While China has disproportionately deployed peacekeepers in areas where it has commercial interests, investment levels do not necessarily lead to increased personnel counts. This implies that other factors could be at play in China’s decision to participate in peacekeeping missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its growing troop and financial commitments, China established its Peacekeeping Affairs Centre in 2018 to coordinate international cooperation and manage its UN peacekeeping troop deployments, and is actively involved in leading peace training workshops and seminars. Through these efforts, China is gradually pressing for normative changes in UN peacekeeping that align with its more technocratic and state-centric vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, China has been seeking to secure senior political and military peacekeeping leadership posts in the UN Department of Peace Operations (UNDPO), and it is alleged that Beijing wishes to supplant France as the head of the department – a position French diplomats have filled since 1966. To this end, China is building its depth of qualified personnel, as 13 of its military officers have held top UN operational peacekeeping positions, serving either as a force commander, deputy force commander, sector commander or deputy sector commander. If the assertions about Beijing’s ambitions prove correct, China could over time gain the experience and access needed to prioritise its interests to the detriment of US foreign policy objectives and Western peacekeeping norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strong participation in UN peace operations is an ideal way for China to gain on-the-ground operational experience abroad&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, Beijing distributed a short English-language promotional film on its Ministry of National Defense website (and on YouTube) called “Here I Am”, depicting its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as a benevolent force that upholds justice and peace. The two-minute video combines live footage and animation highlighting the country’s military achievements in UN peacekeeping. While the video’s declarations may seem farfetched to some, it is undoubtedly good publicity. Chinese media and government officials portray these deployments as a positive investment in the country’s promise to support multilateral peace and stability missions. According to Courtney J Fung, China is seen by the UN community and beyond “as a committed peacekeeping state, one that recognises the value of peacekeeping for the UN and for its own discrete foreign policy goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-us-peacekeeping-efforts--are-they-enough&quot;&gt;Current US Peacekeeping Efforts – Are They Enough?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inaugural mission in 1948, the US has consistently been the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping efforts. Despite maintaining its position as the top funder, the US ranks 84th out of 123 contributing countries regarding the number of peacekeeping personnel deployed. With only 24 peacekeepers participating across seven missions, the US troop and police contributions to UN peacekeeping operations have gradually decreased since 2000 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors that have contributed to this decline include US military obligations in Afghanistan and Iraq, policy shifts in response to significant geopolitical events, and the domestic political environment. In addition to its financial and troop commitments, the US provides training and equipment to assist partner countries in developing key enabling capabilities to train and sustain peacekeeping proficiencies through efforts such as the US State Department-led Global Peace Operations Initiative and the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership. With a total budget of more than $1.4 billion between fiscal years 2005–2022, these programmes provide a critical funding activity to prevent personnel readiness shortfalls in UN peace operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mPDD5jH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: US Troop and Police Contributions to UN Missions, 2000–2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, at the Leaders’ Summit on Peacekeeping, President Barack Obama committed to expanding support for UN peace missions. He issued new presidential guidance, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We’ll work to double the number of US military officers serving in peacekeeping operations. We will offer logistical support, including our unrivaled network of air- and sea-lift. When there’s an urgent need…we’ll undertake engineering projects like building airfields and base camps for new missions. And we’ll step up our efforts to help build the UN’s capacity…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit was deemed a success, with 31 member states, including the US, committing to contribute over 40,000 troops and police, along with helicopters, engineering and naval units, and field hospitals. However, in the years that followed, the US’s commitment to enhancing UN peacekeeping operations seemed fleeting. Several initiatives have since stalled or been scaled down due to shifting US national security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent China from dominating UN peacekeeping and achieving its objectives in this mission space, the US should develop and implement several actions now to reassert its leadership role in authorising and shaping peace operations, limit Chinese influence, and demonstrate that it is fully invested in bringing peace, security and stability to challenged regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, the US should support building a bench of qualified military personnel to serve in senior UN billets as proposed in a 2021 Institute for National Strategic Studies report by Bryce Loidolt. Presently, UN headquarters and peace operations deployments are not viewed by the US military services as career-enhancing assignments. However, this attitude may change if senior officers are regularly nominated and selected to serve in key UN peacekeeping staff billets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to filling UN peace mission mid-level general staff positions, the US should actively seek to fill key operational-level leadership positions such as Chief of Staff or Command Group Advisor. This would be an ideal way to make UN officer assignments more attractive within the US military and to demonstrate to all member states that the US has the requisite experience to compete for senior positions within UNDPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-impact, low-cost initiative would be to appropriately staff and fund the US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI). The institute serves as the military lead agent for joint advocacy of peace and stability operations. Additionally, PKSOI develops concepts, doctrine and training to ensure the US joint force, interagency and allies/partners have the requisite expertise to plan and execute peacekeeping and stability operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, PKSOI actively participates with the UN on doctrine and concept development, ensuring that US values and peacekeeping norms are upheld. In a 2018 cost-cutting move, the Army decided to decrease PKSOI’s staff and budget dramatically. Restoring PKSOI’s staff and funding to pre-2018 levels (42 billets for $3 million per year) would go a long way in expanding its doctrinal reach inside the UN and signal to the military departments, interagency and the international community that the US values peacekeeping operations and understands that they are a critical conflict management tool, particularly in an era of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US rarely makes public pronouncements or consistently touts its longstanding support for UN peacekeeping. So, the US government should develop a comprehensive and active engagement plan to communicate all the ways in which it contributes to UN peacekeeping operations. For example, the US Military Observer Group – the Department of Defense’s focal point for military members serving in the UN – does not have a social media presence, and the State Department has few articles announcing its achievements in support of UN peacekeeping. Frequently broadcasting these milestones on US government social media accounts and public-facing webpages would be a low-cost strategic investment that would enable the US to enhance its image and effectively use peacekeeping as a tool to advance its key foreign policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, formally published US peacekeeping themes and messages may encourage Combatant Commanders to develop complementary talking points in order to foster better relations and increase US credibility on the issue when they engage in bilateral discussions with major UN peacekeeping troop-contributing countries. The preponderance of these large troop contributors are in the Indo-Pacific and Africa – two strategically important regions to US security interests. Better messaging would assist in emphasising the importance of upholding Western-backed peacekeeping norms – protecting civilians, monitoring and preventing human rights violations, and pursuing governance and security sector reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While increasing US participation and visibility in UN peacekeeping operations offers benefits, it also entail risks. The US possesses substantial military capability and capacity, but these resources are finite and subject to ever-evolving foreign policy priorities. Despite these challenges, the US should capitalise on its contributions to UN peacekeeping by fostering relationships and securing access. This strategic approach would help to counter China’s influence, safeguard national security and advance the US’s foreign policy goals, ultimately enhancing its competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original concept of operations for the Ukrainian offensive was sound. It required 12 armoured and mechanised brigades to achieve a breakthrough along 30 km of frontage, the isolation of Tokmak within seven days, and thereafter a breakout south towards Melitopol. Tempo was supposed to prevent Russia from bringing the majority of its forces to bear, so that the attacking force would need to overcome only six regiments in defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of operation was not implemented. This arose from operational errors made by both Ukraine and its international partners. Ukraine’s international partners missed two critical decision points prior to the offensive. First, whereas Russia began to transition to a war economy from May 2022 and began the mobilisation of troops from the autumn, Ukraine’s international partners did not take significant steps to address their industrial limitations. In consequence, while many nations gifted Ukraine a significant proportion of their national stocks, this did not amount to a sufficient volume of equipment to provide the doctrinal minimum of critical enablers required for the concept of operation to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second decision point missed was when that equipment needed to arrive in Ukraine. Ukraine’s international partners wasted four months in deciding to act, so that only a part of the pledged equipment arrived in Ukraine prior to the offensive, and the Ukrainian brigades did not have enough time to train on the equipment that did arrive. The brigades were, therefore, undertrained at the start of the offensive, which accounts for a significant proportion of the tactical mistakes made during the execution of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also made a series of errors. First, experienced troops were used to hold the line of contact and thereafter conduct fixing operations during the offensive, while the main force was for the most part newly raised. This left the lead elements with a dearth of combat experience, which led to tactical errors during the execution of the operation. Second, Ukrainian planners exacerbated their shortage of properly equipped forces by committing troops on multiple axes, which were then further resourced with ammunition and enablers, at the expense of the main effort. The combination of these two errors limited the ability of the force to operate at and maintain tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious error made in planning by Ukraine appears to have been the basis on which it was determined that the main effort could succeed under these circumstances. Rather than using tempo and concentration to defeat six Russian regiments, it was hoped that shock action would cause Russian troops to break, as had occurred around Kharkiv in 2022. Insufficient planning was done to assess how the critical conditions for such a collapse in morale could be achieved, so that this proved an overly optimistic planning assumption. In the event, the initial attacks failed, and tempo was lost, such that Russia could fight the battle with the full 105,000 troops it had in the target sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesson for both Ukraine and its international partners is that operational security was inadequate, such that Russia knew precisely where and approximately when the offensive was to take place. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that with only a couple of brigades properly equipped for offensive operations, Russia only had to track a small number of units to determine Ukrainian intent. Given that this lack of security partly stemmed from the multinational process of organising the offensive, this should be examined carefully by NATO, which relies on comparable processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a great many tactical lessons identified in this paper. Some, however, raise questions about necessary adaptations to prevailing doctrine. First, there is a need to have an effective counter-reconnaissance capability to reduce sustained enemy observation of the intended axes of advance. The inability to screen axes of advance from enemy ISR risks sustained exposure to precision fires, producing an unacceptable rate of equipment loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is the need for electronic protection, and a corresponding requirement for electromagnetic command and control. Fratricide in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is a major problem for controlling large-scale operations under modern conditions. Given the density of systems dependent on the EMS and the actively contested condition of the spectrum, it is not viable to simply deconflict frequencies at the divisional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also evident during the offensive that while software-defined systems were critical to the competitiveness of the force, they were also susceptible to targeted electronic warfare interference. This was especially true in relation to precision strike. Over time, the enemy developed hard counters to a range of Ukrainian capabilities including Excalibur and GMLRS (guided multiple-launch rocket systems). It is therefore evident that retaining technological advantage requires the ability to rapidly update systems in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of sustained enemy observation and long-range fires meant that once troops were committed to offensive operations, their ground lines of communication became predictable and targetable, collapsing tempo. Where operations required gap crossing, the issue of sustainment became insurmountable. The question of how enduring protection of crossing points to sustain a force across a wet gap can be established should be a critical area of capability focus for NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the density of precision effects, even at tactical echelons, has left prestige enablers, such as offensive breaching vehicles, exceedingly vulnerable. Without such assets, there is no mobility, and thus no scope for manoeuvre. NATO militaries should therefore carefully examine how the density of enablers can be increased without overburdening the force, or how enabling capabilities can augment other platforms, such as to improve the organic mobility of units. Dependence on small fleets of specialist enablers is increasingly non-viable when the enemy can discern and engage specific targets within a formation and will do so throughout the depth of an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the lead times involved in regenerating offensive combat power mean that renewed offensive operations are not viable in the foreseeable future. To that end, Ukraine must now reprioritise inflicting as much damage as possible on the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to buy the necessary time. At the same time, Ukraine is likely to pursue trying to constrain Russian revenue generation through strikes on Russian revenue-generating infrastructure. Time can be bought, albeit at a heavy price. The question for Ukraine and its international partners is what is done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Ukraine launched an offensive operation in an attempt to break through Russian defence lines and sever the land corridor occupied by Russia at the neck of Crimea. The operation failed to achieve any of its objectives. Understanding why is vital to ensuring that future Ukrainian operations are properly planned and resourced, and to inform the way in which NATO land forces endeavour to rebuild their offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several reports on the Ukrainian offensive of 2023, including some contributions by the authors, emphasise tactical considerations in explaining its failure. This report does address tactical lessons, but it is primarily concerned with the operational shortcomings of the offensive, relating to planning, operational decisions, the absolute shortage of critical means, and the challenges of mobilisation, force generation and logistics. The report seeks to shed light on how much decision space the Ukrainian military had, and where decision points actually lay. For example, problems with the concentration of a critical mass of Ukrainian troops on the main effort, and with Ukrainian force quality at the beginning of the offensive, have been widely reported. This does explain why particular assaults failed. However, the factors leading to these limitations were the result of decisions made months earlier, and so correcting such vulnerabilities has a long lead time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report was written in collaboration with the Ukrainian General Staff. The report is based on interviews with Ukrainian military personnel and commanders at tactical, operational and strategic echelons throughout 2023. It also draws on the operational data accumulated by the Ukrainian General Staff on troop strengths, casualties and equipment levels in units. The authors also worked closely with the lessons learned department of the Ukrainian General Staff, responsible for identifying adaptations to training, tactics and organisation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). In addition, the authors engaged extensively with Ukraine’s international partners throughout the offensive. While observations from those interviews shaped the thinking in this report, no data from Ukraine’s international partners is used. The report builds on and extends a report written by the authors covering the first six months of the war, published in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has a range of methodological limitations that should be declared up front. This is not an impartial piece of analysis. Ukraine is fighting an ongoing war, meaning there are parts of the dataset examined that cannot be released. There are also topics – such as some of the details of the relationship between Ukraine and some of its international partners – that remain sensitive and cannot be addressed. This report also – while identifying a range of shortcomings in decision-making, planning and tactical execution – avoids allocating blame. The authors aim for lessons to be learned, rather than seeking to offer an exercise in accountability. It should also be noted that the data in this report is derived from figures declassified for release in Ukrainian General Staff assessments. Other assessments have been made at various times, which often cite different numbers. In some instances, these may be more precise; in others, they are less so. However, there are very few alternative open source datasets that are persistently available using a consistent methodology across the period under examination. Some of the more complete datasets in the public domain are either Ukrainian or Russian information operations. This report therefore generally uses the Ukrainian General Staff figures because the consistency in methodology allows for like-for-like comparisons over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very briefly, it is worth noting one topic that is conspicuous by its absence: airpower. Much has been written about the importance of airpower in NATO offensive operations. The reality, however, is that while Ukraine’s lack of airpower was undoubtedly a serious disadvantage, it would not have been possible to build Ukrainian airpower capabilities in a manner where Ukraine would have been capable of conducting effective close air support inside the threat envelope that prevailed and within the timeframe of the Ukrainian 2023 offensive being planned and executed. Airpower was used during the offensive, with the Russians launching dozens of glide bombs per day onto Ukrainian positions. But in this it was used more as an augmentation of artillery, rather than as a parallel campaign. It therefore affords limited data points to discuss the application of airpower. As such a discussion would be somewhat theoretical, it has been omitted from this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is divided into four chapters. Chapter I describes the command decisions that shaped Ukrainian operations from September 2022 to the commencement of the offensive in June 2023. It establishes a baseline context and explains the correlation of forces. Chapter II describes the phases of the Ukrainian offensive, concluding in October 2023. Chapter III analyses the factors that contributed to Ukraine’s failure during the summer offensive, which are specific to this conflict. Chapter IV examines tactical and operational challenges that were new and are not accounted for in existing doctrine among Ukraine’s international partners, which are relevant for the regeneration of offensive combat power in NATO countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-operational-context&quot;&gt;I. The Operational Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, the AFU halted the advance of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) in Donbas. There were three factors that caused the Russian offensive to culminate. Russia had suffered heavy attrition among its best units during the early phase of the conflict – which were, in any case, inappropriately organised for large-scale offensive operations – and was thus finding it difficult to sustain offensive momentum. The AFRF had been compensating for this shortcoming through the application of an overwhelming fires advantage. Ukraine’s use of long-range precision strikes destroying Russian logistical infrastructure in June and July 2022 denied Russian forces this advantage. After months of bruising defensive operations, this created the first opportunity for Ukraine to seize the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s political leadership, uncertainty as to the longevity of international support was the critical factor in planning. Ultimately, Ukraine could be defeated in two ways: the AFU could be broken on the battlefield, or the loss of international support could leave it without arms or ammunition. By summer 2022, Ukraine had exhausted its own stocks of most critical munition natures and therefore depended on the international community. It was also believed that the flurry of gifting of equipment would not last unless Ukraine’s international partners perceived a viable path towards favourable war termination. Thus, the political direction to the AFU was twofold. First, the AFU had to generate a plan for offensive operations that could be sold to Ukraine’s international partners, who would need to resource it. Second, successful offensive operations of symbolic significance had to take place imminently. A further drive towards an early offensive was the threat that Russia would annex, depopulate and thereafter entrench the boundaries of the occupied territories. Russian officials had openly discussed annexation prior to the invasion, as well as during its early stages, and it would mirror the Russian playbook in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the AFU’s combat power in August 2022 was fixed defending the line of contact. Many units had been attrited, and so there was a relatively small number of brigades that had a sufficient level of readiness as a reserve to be used in offensive operations. With political direction to undertake offensive operations, the General Staff had to determine against which axes these forces would be committed. In terms of impact on the war if successful, the most attractive plan was to push south from Zaporizhzhia towards Melitopol and thereby sever the neck of Crimea, while simultaneously cutting the supply lines to Russian forces holding the right bank of the Dnipro River around Kherson. This axis was high risk. The consequence of the thrust would be a long and thin penetration with Russian forces on both sides. If the Russians responded aggressively this thrust could fail. The thrust would be close to the main concentrations of Russian forces in Ukraine at the time, who had been moved to the area to deny this very axis. Many of the Russian troops there had also not participated in the offensive in Donbas and had suffered fewer losses of equipment or personnel. The decision was therefore made to commit several brigades to attack the Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnipro to liberate Kherson, since the river would protect Ukrainian forces from any Russian attempt to counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation to liberate Kherson began on 29 August 2022. The fight would prove challenging. The Russians had committed some of their best troops to the city. The fact that the Ukrainian political leadership needed to demonstrate a “win” to Western partners meant that the objective of the operation had been heavily signalled. The Russians knew what was coming and had prepared three defence lines around the city. Despite the rate of resupply for Russian forces being constrained by the need to move materiel across contested crossing points over the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces found themselves advancing into well-sited ATGM (anti-tank guided missile) ambushes and artillery killing areas. The Russians used the limited artillery support they had in the region effectively. The AFU made some initial gains, only for their tempo to diminish as equipment and personnel losses mounted. Nevertheless, Russian troops were in a vulnerable position and, given Ukrainian fire control over their supply lines, risked slowly losing many competent troops. This pressure on Russian supply lines eventually saw Moscow withdraw its forces from Kherson in an orderly manner in October and November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader operational challenge faced by Russian forces in summer 2022 was that the initial invasion force was too small to maintain a sufficient concentration of troops across the breadth of the front. As the Kherson operation drew in Russian reserves, the question therefore arose as to whether the AFU could apply pressure elsewhere on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place to attack was assessed to be in Kharkiv Oblast, which had several attractions. First, the Russian army lacked forces there, with units having suffered heavily during Russia’s offensive in Donbas. Second, as things stood, Izium remained a launching point for further attacks on Donbas, while the Russians were in artillery range of Kharkiv’s suburbs. This latter point, given Kharkiv’s significance as a major population centre, made Kharkiv a priority axis. While Russian forces observed Ukraine’s build-up of troops on the Kharkiv axis, they lacked forces to respond, having committed them to the south. It is also reasonable to conclude that while Ukraine did not achieve surprise as regards their intentions, they did achieve surprise with the timing of the attack. The gains exceeded Ukrainian expectations, as the Russian Western Group of Forces collapsed. Ironically, although the liberation of Kherson had been prioritised because it was a notable objective, the unexpected speed and scale of the gains in Kharkiv had an outsized effect in convincing Ukraine’s international partners that resourcing offensive operations could bring about results, thereby achieving the political goals of the operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn 2022 was marked by notable successes on the part of the AFU. Nevertheless, the AFU entered 2023 facing several significant challenges. Over the course of 2022, the AFU had taken approximately 30,000 killed and missing, and a significant number of wounded. Most losses took place during the Russian offensive on Donbas in May and June 2022, and during the offensive to liberate Kherson. Many of these losses were concentrated among Ukraine’s professional military brigades, which had been on the frontline continuously since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Besides killed and wounded, the AFU had also lost a large quantity of materiel. New units could be mobilised, but without equipment for them they could not be made suitable for offensive operations. The Territorial Defence Forces were left largely unmechanised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was available commands. Although the AFU had capable brigade staffs, these were largely committed to managing defensive sectors. The expansion of the AFU after the invasion increased the number of troops, but there was not a proportional number of experienced brigade staffs so that brigades tended to be given more battalions under command. The limited number of brigade enablers made it difficult to rotate full brigades off the line of contact so that they could conduct exercises to prepare for brigade operations. The challenge of rotation was exacerbated by the risks involved, due to the congestion it caused on the roads. Given the persistent threat to Ukraine’s training areas from Russian long-range strikes, and the lack of ammunition, spares or platforms to equip new units, Ukraine could raise new units, but training and equipping them depended on support from the country’s partners. If the AFU was to conduct further successful offensive operations, it needed to build new brigades, appropriately equipped for the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main outlines of a plan for a major offensive were in place by September 2022. The successes of the Kherson and Kharkiv offensives created the political belief that liberating further territories held by Russia could be possible. This spurred the Ramstein process – in which Ukraine’s international partners pledged the provision of materiel and other support – to begin cohering donations of equipment from Ukraine’s allies. Unfortunately, the process of agreeing what equipment could be gifted took almost three months, with pledges only made in January 2023. This wasted time would come at a terrible price later in the year. The process also established a clear tension between the need to sell the plan and the requirements of operational security. Regrettably, both Ukrainian messaging and speculation by Western officials were already setting clear expectations of a Ukrainian spring offensive and its potential objectives as early as December 2022. These discussions were noted in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Ukraine’s offensive operations, the AFRF adopted several measures to stabilise their front that would fundamentally alter the context for the future Ukrainian offensive. First, the AFRF had declared mobilisation to raise troop levels after the Ukrainian breakthrough in Kharkiv exposed how Russian forces were stretched. Second, the AFRF withdrew from the right bank of the Dnipro through Kherson, turning the river into a natural defensive barrier and securing their flank. Third, the Russians set about building deliberate defences across the approaches to the neck of Crimea in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Mobilisation did not rapidly produce well-trained soldiers. The defence lines would also take time to erect. Russia therefore embarked on an offensive in late January 2023, beginning in Vuhledar but rapidly spreading to most of the eastern front, with a particular emphasis on the city of Bakhmut. This ill-prepared offensive using under-trained troops was extremely costly for the Russians, but the command appears to have judged that it could trade lives for time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian mobilisation placed the AFU in a challenging position, where tactical successes could increasingly expose Ukraine to operational vulnerability over time. There has been a protracted debate about the efforts expended by the AFU in the defence of Bakhmut. Once depopulated by shelling, the city itself was of little value. However, the concern within the Ukrainian General Staff was that if Bakhmut fell without the AFRF culminating there, their next objective would be Chasiv Yar. Chasiv Yar not only straddles a ridge that would have facilitated further offensive operations, but if captured would also bring the rail and ground lines of communication from Kostyantynivka under Russian fire control and could bring Kramatorsk within range of Russian artillery, risking its depopulation. Furthermore, if the Russians did not culminate in Bakhmut they would force the AFU to fight for vital ground at a time when the intent was to be committing resources to offensive operations elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russia’s assault on the city offered the prospect of an urban defence where the AFU could inflict disproportionate losses, the decision was made to mount a determined defence of the city. Initially, this decision was vindicated by high Russian losses. However, Bakhmut was a highly unfavourable position to defend, situated in low ground. Russian gains around Bakhmut meant that by February the AFRF had established artillery control over the main ground lines of communication into the city along which Ukrainian troops were rotated. At this point, the disparity in losses became unfavourable for Ukraine. Overall, approximately 10,000 Ukrainian troops were killed or severely wounded during the fight for and around Bakhmut. Russian forces attacking the city were largely composed of Wagner Group troops and mobilised convicts, with support from the VDV (Russian Airborne Forces). In total, 19,547 Wagner fighters were killed in Bakhmut, with a similar number seriously wounded. In theory, this produced a 4:1 exchange ratio in favour of Ukraine. However, 88% of Wagner losses were of mobilised convicts, with the number of trained Wagner troops killed averaging between 40 and 60 per week. Thus, while Ukraine was losing experienced personnel, Russia was expending what it considered disposable untrained troops to fix the AFU, while inflicting heavy losses with its 5:1 advantage in artillery. Militarily, it is evident that the optimal tactical course of action would have been to withdraw to a new defence line once the AFRF had artillery control of the ground lines of communication into the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, however, the Ukrainian government believed that withdrawing from Bakhmut came with considerable risk. The decision point for the withdrawal coincided with several key decisions on the release of critical equipment, including tanks, munitions and enablers to Ukraine, mainly from Germany, for the planned offensive. The idea of the news from the front being Russia’s success against its main objective was, therefore, judged to endanger the speed with which Ukraine’s international partners would push materiel forward. Thus, the city was allowed to acquire a strategic symbolic significance that defied operational military logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 2023, the scale of a Ukrainian offensive had been determined, based on the volume of equipment being supplied by Ukraine’s partners and the troops that had been raised to conduct it. Ukraine and its partners thereafter set about apportioning equipment and training to these units. The challenge that emerged from the fight for Bakhmut was that many of those lost were experienced troops who could have been seeded throughout new units to raise their tactical proficiency. Instead, while experienced forces held the Russians back, new units were prepared for the offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By March 2023, equipment deliveries were starting to arrive in Ukraine. Given the limitations of available equipment in NATO countries that had run down their own militaries for three decades, the donations of equipment represented a large proportion of national stocks. It is important here to reflect on the scale of the conflict, as it highlights the extent to which many of Ukraine’s international partners have come to depend on fleets of military equipment that are manifestly too small for the purpose for which the equipment was procured. Relative to Russian forces, the quantity of equipment provided to Ukraine has been small. The total number of tanks given to Ukraine as aid over the course of the war is 671. Only 150 of these are Western models, with the majority Soviet models. At the same time, Ukraine has captured 495 Russian tanks over the course of the war, which makes Russia its largest single supplier of tanks. Ukraine received 480 infantry fighting vehicles from its international partners, more than 300 of which were BMP-1s. Ukraine has also captured 424 Russian BMPs. And yet, Russian equipment levels in theatre have expanded over the course of the fighting, with Russia producing and refurbishing approximately 1,500 tanks per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that there was and to some extent is a significant cognitive dissonance between what Ukraine’s international partners gave to Ukraine and what they thought could be achieved. In essence, while what was gifted was a significant proportion of the national stocks of Ukraine’s partners, that did not make the volume of equipment commensurate with the task. The inability of Western officials to grasp the scale of the fighting sat behind a persistent misalignment of expectations and outcome that haunted the 2023 Ukrainian offensive. This hype was exacerbated by Ukrainian information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment of experienced troops to blunt the Russian winter–spring offensive meant that the new units raised for the Ukrainian offensive were predominantly made up of fresh recruits. This was identified by commanders of these units in after-action reviews as a mistake, as it left an insufficient proportion of the force with combat experience during early engagements. These troops received basic training in the UK and Europe, and some subsequently received collective training. Other personnel received specialist training in operating donated equipment. This proved problematic. First, Ukraine received a vast range of equipment, and even within the same platform type it received multiple varieties. The result was that each formed Ukrainian brigade was fielding up to five different armoured vehicles. Moreover, while equipment that was to be donated had to be brought out of storage and either repaired or demodernised to remove sensitive systems, the equipment that many Ukrainian specialists trained on came from active military units in the donor nation. This meant that the vehicles on which Ukrainian troops trained differed in the workflow, capabilities and maintenance requirements from those that arrived in Ukraine, usually without manuals or spares. The result was that the units prepared for the offensive lacked combat experience among their junior leaders, had received accelerated tactical training on equipment that differed from the weapons with which they were to fight, and had a limited ability to maintain and operate the few platforms they received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time was needed to build up the readiness of the brigades created for Ukraine’s offensive. However, time was also unavailable, as it would give Russia the opportunity to extend and deepen its defence lines and to raise and train more forces. With Russia’s force expansion proceeding faster than Ukraine’s, there was a point after which no offensive could have been possible. The key lesson for NATO leaders is that the preference of politicians to defer decisions is extremely costly in war. Just as Russia paid a heavy price for not mobilising in April 2022, Ukraine suffered for not expanding mobilisation, backed by an earlier commitment from its partners to train and equip its forces at scale, made in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In planning for the offensive, the Ukrainian General Staff had assessed five options for the axes of advance. First, there was the eastern direction around Bakhmut. This axis offered the greatest freedom of manoeuvre, but there were no objectives in this direction that would alter the logic of the conflict, unless Ukraine could surround or isolate a large body of Russian troops. This was deemed unlikely. All other options would aim to bring the neck of Crimea under physical control or fire control, complementing the roll back of the Black Sea Fleet to bring about the isolation of Crimea, thereby altering the dynamics of the war. The second axis would see amphibious operations across the Dnipro River. This would bypass much of the Russian defence line, but Ukrainian troops would face the same challenge of contested supply lines as had undermined the Russian defence of Kherson. There were three axes heading south. The westernmost axis would strike along a ridge line, parallel to the Dnipro, through Vasilyivka. This had some attractions. It would bypass the densest parts of Russia’s defence line, while a large stretch of the axis had been the basis for exercises in Ukrainian professional military education, such that many officers were familiar with the ground. There were drawbacks. First, it would involve two river crossings in the initial phases. Second, it would leave Ukrainian forces advancing on a narrow front, with the risk of being pinned against the Dnipro. Third, this axis would have brought fighting close to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant at Energodar, with the risk that it could be damaged or sabotaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two axes ran from Orikhiv via Tokmak towards Melitopol, and through Velika Novosilka towards Berdyansk. The density of Russian defences was comparable on these axes, with a slightly greater concentration on the former. The latter, however, required much more ground to be covered to be successful. Considering all these factors, the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was identified as the direction of the Ukrainian main effort. Fixing actions, meanwhile, would be undertaken towards Bakhmut and threatened across the Dnipro to reduce Russia’s lateral redeployment of forces to defend Tokmak. The subsequent blowing of the Nova Kakhovka dam by the AFRF during the first week of the offensive removed the possibility of a fixing operation being executed across the Dnipro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFRF was aware of the Ukrainian plan in detail. Between Ukrainian messaging, the leaking of highly classified information from the US, and terrain analysis, the Russians had concentrated their defences on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis. Thus, by the time the offensive was to be executed, the correlation of forces was unfavourable to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offensive plan envisaged Ukraine fielding 12 brigades. As originally conceived, three brigades were to support a fixing operation against Russian forces in the east. Three armoured brigades would then be committed to breach the Russian defence line, with another three mechanised brigades echeloning through to defeat Russian forces defending Tokmak. The final three brigades were to function as an exploitation force. In principle, the breach was to be accomplished within seven days. Such a tempo would mean that the Ukrainian forces would need to defeat six AFRF regiments, producing a favourable local force ratio. In practice, the original plan could not be executed at the time when the offensive was launched because of the equipment and readiness of the brigades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brigades for the offensive comprised three brigades of the National Guard of Ukraine (the 3rd, 14th and 15th Brigades) and three tactical groups of the AFU. The latter were called corps (the 9th Corps, the 10th Corps and the “Maroon” Corps), even though they were definitely not corps, by neither NATO nor Ukrainian standards, lacking corps echelon troops or the cohesion to function as formations. At best, they were division-sized units without divisional or adequate numbers of brigade enablers. Rather than being full armoured and mechanised brigades, the tactical groups consisted of two to three mechanised battalions each, with additional unmechanised units. The subordinate brigades fielded few critical enablers. The original scheme of manoeuvre had been for 9th Corps to be responsible for the initial break-in through the Russian disruption belt, for 10th Corps to penetrate to Tokmak, and for the Maroon Corps to then exploit towards Melitopol. Because these brigades lacked the equipment or readiness to execute a plan at the requisite tempo, the Russians would have time to bring to bear their forces throughout the area of the operation, which shifted the correlation of forces to unfavourable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of the Ukrainian forces were arrayed three defence lines comprising a disruption belt and forward defence line, a main defence line, and a reserve defence line, collectively straddling about 30 km of depth. These were defended by the 7th Airborne Division and the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division of the AFRF. For every 10 km of defence, the Russians thus had one motorised rifle regiment (70, 71 and 291 Regiments across the frontage of the axis) and one airborne regiment. In the second line were the 56th, 108th and 247 th Regiments. The 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation and one of the battalions of the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment were also deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, two motorised rifle divisions (19 and 42) and two airborne divisions (7 and 76, consisting of the 104, 234 and 347 Regiments) were available to be brought to the defence lines, under command of the 58th Combined Arms Army. Additional artillery units were also assigned, including the 439th Artillery Brigade, equipped with Tornado-S MLRS (multiple-launch rocket systems). At the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive, the Russians had cached 35 days’ worth of supplies of ammunition around their gun lines, amounting to three replenishments of a standard load per day. In addition, the Russians fielded about 60 combat helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that while the AFRF had reverted back to the divisional and regimental force structure from the battalion tactical group in 2022, the composition of its units at this time was somewhat irregular. Many battalions included Storm-Z companies, territorial units and other attachments, while also lacking some of the conventional elements of their order of battle. The unit designations above should not, therefore, be taken as proxies for the order of battle, but rather as the command and control (C2) elements of the Russian defensive echelons. In total, if the Ukrainian offensive had prosecuted its three phases, there were 105,000 Russian troops that were available to defend the Orikhiv–Tokmak–Melitopol axis. These troops fielded approximately 470 tanks, up to 1,410 armoured fighting vehicles, over 720 artillery systems, up to 230 MLRS, and 12 operational–tactical missile complexes. However, if the tempo envisaged in the original plan had been achieved, Ukrainian forces would only have had to contend with 30% of these forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacking the units of action to execute the plan as originally intended, Ukrainian planners nevertheless felt that an offensive had to be attempted, and so began to hypothesise that if the initial attack applied enough pressure, they could advance into a numerically superior enemy by breaking its morale. The defeat mechanism of the Russian defence lines was premised on deep strike and shock action causing localised collapse. It was hoped that this would thereafter lead to a manoeuvre defence that would see Russian troops lose cohesion. These were very optimistic assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Ukraine fielded approximately 400,000 combat troops including the Territorial Defence Forces, the National Guard and State Border Guards at this time, there has been much discussion as to why more troops were not concentrated for the attack. First, many of these troops were not equipped or trained for breaching operations. But it is also important to note the broader context of the conflict to appreciate the risks that further concentration would have created elsewhere. Unlike in September 2022, when the Russian concentration in the south came at the expense of other parts of the line, mobilisation had allowed the AFRF to maintain significant forces across the front and to replenish losses. Thus, despite the losses suffered by Russia in early 2023, in July the number of Russian troops fielded in the Operational Group of Forces attacking Ukraine increased to about 450,000 personnel, fielding 2,200 tanks and 5,150 armoured combat vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-ukrainian-offensive-of-2023&quot;&gt;II. The Ukrainian Offensive of 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-May, Ukraine initiated operations on the Bakhmut axis, intended to fix Russian forces ahead of the main effort in the south. The attack on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was opened on 3 June, with operations by supporting brigades to secure the flanks of the main axis. The intent was for artillery preparation and an assault to take place during the night of 3–4 June. During these opening phases, however, several tactical errors were made. First, deconfliction between the troops assigned to the main effort and those that had been holding the front prior to the offensive was inadequate. This led to several incidents of friendly fire and disruption caused by Ukrainian defensive obstacles, prior to the initiation of attacks. Second, this disruption led to a time lag between the initial fire preparation missions and the assault of approximately three hours, leading to the opening of the main effort commencing after dawn. These errors reflected the limited cohesion carried out at brigade level during training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battalions of the 47th, 65th, and 33rd Brigades from 9th Corps opened the offensive with a series of attempted breaches by mechanised companies. MICLIC and UR-77 Meteorit explosive breaching lines were used to create lanes in the minefields, but these were often of insufficient depth to deliver a complete breach, while inexperienced vehicle crews deviated from the cleared path. A lack of demining equipment then became a problem. The corps had 10 demining vehicles, mainly Vincent-1s. These could clear ground but would overheat and shut down after ploughing for a sustained period. Russian units concentrated ATGMs, fired from infantry positions and from tanks stationed on high ground, against the demining equipment. Furthermore, a shortage of mine ploughs meant that usually only the leading vehicle had clearing equipment in each breach. The Ukrainian artillery also lacked smoke rounds to obscure their lines of advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was that multiple company attacks suffered the same fate. They entered the narrow breaching lanes, only for the lead vehicle to be knocked out or immobilised. At this point, the cleared lane was too narrow for vehicles to turn, so that, when following vehicles, if either tried to turn around or to move around the destroyed leading vehicle, they would become immobilised by mines. This led to large concentrated groupings of immobilised Ukrainian armour, which would then be targeted by Russian artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the blunting of initial armoured advances, the first Russian defensive positions were lightly held. Following the initial failed assaults, Ukrainian forces made a series of dismounted attacks drawing on troops from more experienced units, which managed to enter the first series of Russian fighting positions. Consistent with Russian doctrine, the first belt of defensive positions was a disruption zone, and thus Russian forces withdrew from some of their positions before Ukrainian troops entered them during the first two weeks of the offensive, only to counterattack before the enemy could consolidate. This was not conducted in an orderly manner, and so Russian forces took losses to Ukrainian artillery. There were two drivers of this disorder. First, Russian guns lacked the range to conduct effective counterbattery fire. Second, weeks of Ukrainian propaganda had convinced some Russian soldiers that they were about to face the brunt of NATO’s heavy equipment, and morale among some troops was low, although this phenomenon was uneven. Nevertheless, as the mechanised Ukrainian units began to accumulate losses and videos of these engagements spread among Russian troops, their confidence started to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses during the initial assaults had an impact on the morale of as yet uncommitted Ukrainian units. The Ukrainian troops’ confidence in both their equipment and training diminished, especially since the second echelon was largely mounted in BMPs that lacked the crew survivability offered by Western infantry fighting vehicles. As a result, Ukrainian commanders moved experienced troops from a range of unmechanised supporting brigades into the line to conduct assaults using dismounted assault group tactics. Because these units had not been prioritised for the provision of Western equipment, many of them lacked means to support their assaults. This led to the blending of units, with tanks or breaching equipment borrowed from one brigade to support the assault groups of another. The result was that in some instances a company attack might have supporting components from up to three brigades enabling the effort. This proved highly problematic. The Ukrainian brigades that were prepared for the offensive also had not previously practised working with the brigades protecting their flanks. For those troops lacking combat experience, with very short training courses in the West, control of direct fire was a serious problem, such that there were many cases of friendly fire between intermingled sub-units from different brigades. Despite these complications, the assault units did make some progress into the Russian defence lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukrainian forces got deeper into the defences, new challenges started to emerge. First, by late June, Russian troops started to counterattack. At first, this involved the use of their artillery, held out of range of the front, to destroy abandoned fighting positions once they were occupied by Ukrainian troops. Second, Russian troops began to use dismounted infantry supported by armour to attack the positions at night. Given that each Ukrainian battalion produces at best two platoons of fully capable assault troops, it was vital that Ukrainian forces replaced assault troops with line infantry on positions they occupied. In general, there were insufficient troops to conduct rotations. The tempo of Russian counterattacks also meant that troops would then need to be resupplied. Resupply at night through the narrow breaches in the minefields was extremely dangerous, especially given the limited availability of night vision equipment, and Russia’s use of artillery-deployed scatterable mines. Thus, Ukrainian units often had to resupply during the day, when Russian troops would begin to attack the resupply routes using FPV loitering munitions and barrel-launched ATGMs fired by tanks from hilltops, and attack aviation firing ATAKA and Vikhr ATGMs. Given the absolute shortage of demining equipment, this often had to be accomplished by hand, which was slow and dangerous. The overall effect was to prevent any build-up of tempo, such that Ukrainian units had to continually attack prepared positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of enablers in 9th Corps meant that this equipment had to be committed from 10th Corps to continue the attacks. Without these enablers, and without the C2 to conduct a large-scale forward passage of lines in a convoluted battlespace, 10th Corps began to be committed piecemeal, not only on the main axis, but also on the eastern axis around Bakhmut, and on the supporting Velika Novosilka axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Ukrainian troops managed to gain sufficient lodgements to push further into the defences in some sectors. These were, however, highly predictable for the Russians, so defensive means could be concentrated at these points. Moreover, because of the narrow width of the proposed axis of advance and the persistent threat from Lancet-3Ms hunting Ukrainian artillery, the guns could not be brought forwards. This meant that proportionally more Russian artillery could cover Ukrainian lines of advance without Ukrainian counterbattery fire being able to reach the Russian guns. Thus, for the second round of assaults, the resistance became harder. With most of the available demining equipment already lost, the proportion of breaching that needed to be conducted by hand increased. The units conducting it largely lacked dismounted breaching equipment. This time, Russian troops consistently held their positions, having often set up flanking ambushes from the tree lines while counterattacking aggressively with armour. During this phase, Ukrainian troops often took positions, only to lose them to counterattacks, such that assaults would need to be repeated several times. As a result, by late June, Ukrainian officers feared that the counteroffensive would not achieve its aims and paused while they debated where and how to commit additional units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original plan had seen the 9th, 10th and Maroon Corps as distinct units of action. In practice, units of the 9th Corps had been expended in the first assaults, while 10th Corps had been committed piecemeal, exacerbated by the need to amalgamate breaching equipment. By July, Ukrainian commanders had to judge whether to commit units from the Maroon Corps to continuing the southern axis, or to call off the offensive. Politically, halting the offensive seemed unacceptable. Fears that there would not be another chance and hopes that the Russian resistance would falter if the attack were sustained led to the decision to continue pushing south, but with the revised objective of capturing Tokmak. The AFU, recognising that to use its exploitation force for the assault would prevent an exploitation after the breakthrough, also switched its prioritisation of fires towards a damage-centric strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s long-range strike campaign during the offensive deserves some discussion. More than 300 Storm Shadow and SCALP cruise missiles were delivered to Ukraine over the course of the offensive, although only small numbers could be launched at any given time. Despite some strikes on Russian C2 and logistics during the offensive, long-range fires had little impact on the fighting. Given the extent to which NATO militaries hope that precision and deep strike can offset volume of unguided artillery, it is worth examining the reason for these results. First, the priority of the precision strike campaign was to destroy the Russian Black Sea Fleet and to degrade defences on the Crimean Peninsula. Combined with the use of uncrewed surface vessels, long-range precision strikes degraded Russian sea control. This had the strategic effect of allowing Ukraine to resume exports from its ports. It also set the conditions for the isolation of Crimea from the sea, although this effect would only be felt if the neck of Crimea could be threatened. The long-range strike campaign was therefore successful against its primary objective, but the failure of the ground operation meant the success was not fully exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes using Storm Shadow in support of the ground operation proved less successful. Several headquarters were destroyed, including the reserve command post of the 58th Combined Arms Army in Berdyansk, along with strikes on bridges at the neck of Crimea. Collectively, however, these strikes never reached the critical level of damage that would disorder the C2 or logistics system. Nor were the strikes themselves effectively synchronised with ground operations that would have caused pressure in tempo with disruption in the deep. This was partly because having effect in the land domain requires the simultaneous servicing of more targets than operations targeting naval forces. The damage to the Black Sea Fleet was absolute. Damaged command posts and bridges, by contrast, could be replaced and repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the offensive, GMLRS strikes had been prioritised in maximum depth, to disrupt Russian C2 and logistics and also to target air defence systems and other targets that could have improved the efficiency of loitering munitions raids on Crimea. Once the objective became more limited to Tokmak, the depth of the fires campaign also came back, with an emphasis on fires in shallow depth to assist with the attack. Thus, GMLRS in particular started to be reprioritised, from targeting high-value targets to striking Russian artillery. This was also driven by the inability to push Ukrainian guns forwards, as the breach was insufficiently wide, and scoured by Lancets. While many Russian guns were destroyed, with only approximately seven GMLRs (munitions, not launchers) per day to service the whole theatre, the rate of destruction was something Russian troops could absorb during the critical period when Ukraine had remaining offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of precision strike was further mitigated by Russian countermeasures. The munitions that were to deliver these precision effects had been employed for almost a year by the time the offensive began. Whereas Excalibur, for example, was achieving around 70% effectiveness at the beginning of the conflict, by August 2023, it was hitting the designated point only 6% of the time, a rate lower than non-precision munitions. This was because of exquisite electronic warfare (EW) countermeasures fielded by the AFRF. The impact on GMLRS was slightly different. The first challenge was that electronic protection systems were able to redirect entire salvos of GMLRS targeting specific areas. The second issue was that Russian air defences had been calibrated to be able to shoot down GMLRS. These problems could be overcome by layering effects. The use of other munition types such as HARMs, EW or decoys, or selecting the right time to engage, made GMLRS strikes highly effective. But these shaping requirements significantly reduced the tempo and scale at which strikes could be directed against operationally significant targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment of Maroon Corps units in July began to exert significant pressure on the 58th Combined Arms Army. Along with small numbers of strikes in depth using Storm Shadow, the attrition of artillery systems with GMLRS, and the fact that Russian troops had been in the line for two months of heavy fighting, Ukrainian units began to achieve results in small tactical actions, largely by narrowing the axis on which they were working from a 30 km frontage to a 10 km frontage. In one incident, for example, a Ukrainian assault group of 15 personnel managed to dislodge 88 Russian troops from a position. Despite these kinds of incidents, the pace of advance was extremely slow and always gave the Russians time to reset their defences, such that every attack had to be a deliberate assault action. The need to secure the flanks of any gains further slowed progress. Furthermore, Ukrainian advances began to be canalised between two pieces of high ground across an area 7 km wide. This left troops vulnerable to plunging fire from the flanks, further constraining the rate of advance. The commitment of the Maroon Corps, as the exploitation force, also removed any risk for the Russians that further Ukrainian axes could be prioritised. This freed up Russian troops to rotate the more damaged units of the 58th Combined Arms Army, such that Ukrainian forces found themselves fighting fresh troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been persistent discussion about the Ukrainian decision to commit some of the troops prepared for the offensive towards the Bakhmut axis, rather than concentrating forces in the south. This is, to some extent, the wrong framing of the choice facing the AFU. The allocation of ammunition to the eastern axis certainly contributed to Ukraine having insufficient fires on the southern axis. Nevertheless, since Ukrainian artillery was being held back from advancing by Russian mines and Lancets, adding more artillery pieces to the southern axis would not have axiomatically increased Ukraine’s firepower where it mattered. The same can be said of committing more troops. Given the frontages involved, pushing more companies of assault troops southwards would not have vastly increased the scale of operations that could be carried out and thus the combat power applied. As it became clear, however, that the southern axis might at best reach Tokmak – and even this objective appeared in doubt – there was a strong political direction to demonstrate progress, so that more troops were committed to the Bakhmut axis. Without sufficient mechanised forces, however, these attacks could not achieve sufficient tempo to produce encirclements of Russian troops. The eastern direction therefore devolved into fights for treelines. The real trade-off decision, therefore, was not between the commitment of units between two axes or one, but rather whether these reserves should have been committed at all, or else preserved. In hindsight, the commitment of these forces appears to have been a mistake, as Ukraine is now short of cohered units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian attrition during the offensive arguably reached its height in early August. The use of counterattacks, and the provision of dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICM) to Ukraine, which increased both the number of rounds that could be fired per day and the lethality of these fire missions, all drove up Russian casualties. Nevertheless, Russia continued to rotate its regiments under its divisions to ensure that there were fresh troops holding the defences. If a breakthrough to Tokmak was going to happen, this was most likely in early August. After that, the likelihood began to diminish. Ukrainian ammunition stocks meant that the rate of fire to support offensive operations could be continued until October at the latest. By mid-September, offensive actions were largely aimed at improving tactical positions, as commanders recognised that a breakthrough – even to Tokmak – was not going to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offensive may have culminated, but one last operation was attempted, to cross the Dnipro and attack through Krynky. For this purpose, some 55 GMLRS were stockpiled, along with a large volume of other fires. The Ukrainian marines conducting the operation were attacking into their old training grounds and knew the terrain well. It was hoped that a surge of force across the river might turn the flank. When the crossing was made, Ukrainian forces managed to secure a lodgement on the eastern bank, and for approximately three days there was an opportunity to move a significant number of troops across. This was not attempted. The reason was simple. While a large body of troops might have been projected over the river, they could not be sustained, and the larger the force the less viable their sustainment would be. The Krynky operation does not need to be covered in detail as it was never fully carried out, but it does offer one salutary lesson to which observers should pay attention. Under modern battlefield conditions, the establishment and protection of a crossing on a wide wet gap against sustained observation and the indefinite threat of fires is a problem to which there is not yet a doctrinal answer. Given the number of these gaps in Eastern Europe, it is a problem set that deserves study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-assessing-the-causes-of-failure&quot;&gt;III. Assessing the Causes of Failure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most analyses gravitate towards the conclusion that the reasons for the difference between the failure of Russian operations in 2022 and their comparative success in 2023 is that the Russians are learning and adapting, and are becoming more tactically proficient. Although Russia has adapted its tactics, the main reason for the striking difference in the effectiveness of Russian operations is that in the preparation of the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin’s main effort was that of its Special Services, which were supposed to destabilise Ukraine and disorganise its system of state and military administration. The military invasion was not supposed to meet serious organised resistance, other than in Donbas. The defeats suffered by the AFRF in the battles of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson were primarily the consequences of an initial miscalculation in the planning of the invasion, and the employment of forces improperly structured and commanded for conventional warfighting. After the failure of the initial coup de main, attempts were made to rectify the structural shortcomings, but without an uplift in mass, and because of the losses during the opening phase of the war, the Russian military failed to achieve its objectives. In 2023, Ukraine was dealing with an enemy that had completely changed its strategy. Russia began to take seriously the planning and conduct of military operations, moving from a blitzkrieg strategy to a protracted war, with the mobilisation necessary for this through its human and industrial resources. It placed its main bet on the fact that Western partners will tire of supporting Ukraine, allowing Russia to eventually gain the necessary advantage on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the AFRF’s operational failures in 2022 was the insufficient number of ground troops to conduct effective combat operations along multiple independent axes. In fact, the lack of the necessary forces and means for a successful full-scale invasion was one of the foremost reasons why many analysts, including in Ukrainian intelligence agencies, were sceptical about the probability of a Russian invasion in February 2022, predicting such an invasion later, in June or even September 2022, and only in the limited theatre of the south and east. Such sceptical assessments of the probability of a successful invasion allowed the Russians to achieve operational surprise, which explains the success in capturing the south of Ukraine, as well as the deep advance in the north, where the AFU did not have significant forces. The Russian plan came much closer to succeeding than is often acknowledged, but when the bet on speed failed, the plan was invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to defeat the AFU during its initial blitzkrieg and heavy losses in people and military equipment meant that Russia faced the problem of an acute lack of the troops necessary not only to continue the offensive, but also to hold territories in the east and especially in the south. It was the lack of adequate personnel that forced the Russians to withdraw from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, and prevented them from organising the proper density of defences near Kharkiv, enabling the AFU to carry out a successful breakthrough there and a further offensive almost to the borders of the Luhansk region. Although Ukrainian fire control of Russian lines of supply explains the tactical decision to withdraw from Kherson, the unwillingness of the AFRF to lose the quality troops deployed there reflected the shortages in personnel elsewhere on the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many military conflicts before, including the First and Second World Wars, after the end of the first phase of the war, which was characterised by rapid manoeuvre by the first echelon, the second phase began, during which the skirmish line stabilised, the fighting became positional, and the parties concentrated on generating the reserves to win the war. As a result of the mobilisation that began in October 2022, Russia managed by May 2023 not only to replenish its losses, but also to increase the size of the group of forces in Ukraine to approximately 420,000 personnel (not counting the units of the Russian Guard and the police involved in running an occupation regime), as well as to establish the production of weapons and military equipment in the volumes necessary to support their operations. As a result, the Ukrainian offensive, which began in June 2023, was conducted in conditions that differed significantly from those that prevailed when the plan for the offensive was developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In autumn 2022, the AFRF in Ukraine consisted of 130 battalion-tactical groups and separate units of the 1st and 2nd Army Corps with a total number of about 200,000 servicemen, about 930 tanks, more than 2,500 armoured combat vehicles, 1,350 artillery systems, 660 MLRS and 40 operational-tactical missile systems (OTMS). By the beginning of June 2023, Russian ground forces in Ukraine comprised about 420,000 personnel, 1,980 tanks, 4,450 armoured combat vehicles, 2,750 artillery systems, 860 MLRS and 46 OTMS. During this time, the AFRF abandoned the use of battalion-tactical groups and switched to the army management system, cohering 50 brigades, 128 regiments, 102 separate battalions and about 50 combined units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Russia’s group of forces in Ukraine, outlined above, constitutes its combat troops. These troops were not responsible for guarding the Russian border, a task undertaken by other parts of the AFRF. Nor were they primarily concerned with supporting the administration of the occupied territories. For this, the Russian Federation had deployed in Ukraine 25,000 servicemen of the Russian Guard, fielding their own 520 armoured combat vehicles, about 140 artillery systems and 22 helicopters. By contrast, the AFU’s combat power had to hold the entire Ukrainian border, stretching out AFU resources while the AFRF maintained freedom to commit resources on particular axes. The presence of AFRF units on the Russian–Ukrainian border, their constant shelling of Ukrainian territory with MLRS, artillery and mortars, airstrikes and the use of sabotage groups forced Ukraine to keep part of its troops in the north, making it impossible to transfer them to other directions. A further 50,000 troops of the AFU were committed to generating mobile air defence groups with their necessary support echelon to defeat a sustained Russian long-range strike campaign throughout Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to use artillery to compensate for the limited force density along much of the front limited the concentration of firepower on the main effort. The largest number of 155-calibre guns simultaneously operating on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was 55 units. Ammunition levels for Ukrainian artillery varied throughout the offensive. At its peak, these reached approximately 70 rounds per gun per day for those guns on the main effort. However, ammunition supplies were uneven and would peak and trough, so that for periods of the offensive, Ukrainian guns had as little as 10 rounds per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both at the beginning and during the conduct of the Ukrainian offensive operation, the AFU did not have a numerical advantage over the enemy in the number of personnel, combat systems and ammunition, or enablers necessary for successful offensive operations, especially against a well-organised and echeloned line of defence. At times, the AFU did establish localised superiority, but this could rarely be maintained as forces advanced. The balance of forces in many cases was not in favour of Ukraine, which forced Ukrainian units to storm the positions of a more numerous enemy. Conditions were especially unfavourable given the lack of air support. Against this, Ukraine had some qualitative advantages in both troops and equipment, but this did not provide a sufficient offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of numerical advantage, the AFU counted on a moral advantage due to both the high level of motivation of the Ukrainian troops and the low morale of Russian troops observed during their winter offensive. To some extent, Ukraine repeated the mistake that Russia had made during the first stage of the war, counting on shock induced by offensive operations preventing the enemy from putting up an adequate resistance. This theory of success was a poor planning assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, therefore, the Ukrainian offensive failed because the plan was not properly calibrated to the available resources. Nor were appropriate troops assigned to the tasks for which they were suited. Undertrained personnel spearheaded the main effort, while experienced troops were committed to diversionary or fixing axes. Ukraine’s international partners failed to mobilise industry early in the conflict, while over-optimistic planning assumptions by Ukrainian planners based on the conditions prevailing before Russian mobilisation had grave consequences. The reason to place such emphasis on this point is that Ukraine’s international partners missed their decision points for industrial mobilisation, while Ukraine missed its decision points for the mobilisation and adequate training of personnel. It is thus vital that for future operations Ukraine and its partners do not lull themselves into believing that an under-resourced operation has a strong likelihood of succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this foremost operational point, numerous shortcomings of the preparation of the Ukrainian offensive can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-lack-of-surprise&quot;&gt;A Lack of Surprise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the anticipated mechanisms enabling success during the Ukrainian offensive was the shock to Russian troops. In the initial plan, this was hoped to enable the 12 brigades to break six enemy regiments across 30 km of front. When planners realised that this was not possible, it was hoped that the violence of the initial attack would dislodge the defenders. Where tactical surprise was achieved during the war, as in the Kharkiv offensive in 2022, Ukrainian forces effectively dislocated Russian troops. Conversely, in both Kherson and on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis, surprise was not achieved, and operational security failed. In the Kherson direction, the Ukrainian government signalled the intention to attack on this axis. The subsequent decision to attack Kherson was therefore made against a prepared defence and was neither particularly successful in terms of the ground assaults nor did it cause shock among Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis, the failure of operational security occurred at multiple levels. At the strategic level, leaks of top secret information from Ukraine’s international partners (including terrain analysis and other materials) gave the Russians a precise picture of the Ukrainian assault force’s structure, anticipated capabilities, limitations and options for axes of advance. Furthermore, the public messaging from the Ukrainian government, and public discourse from partners, gave Russia a clear understanding of the timing of a likely assault and informed AFRF planning. Finally, Russian penetration of Ukrainian communications systems enabled capture of a range of materials. The result was that when the offensive started, Ukrainian efforts to compartmentalise planning often left friendly forces with less understanding of the wider plan than Russian commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson is clear: future operations must be accompanied by appropriate deception and more effective operational security. For Ukraine, this means less public telegraphing of intentions. However, there are also lessons for Ukraine’s partners about the transparency of its political discourse on collective planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inadequate-force-generation&quot;&gt;Inadequate Force Generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the greater human reserves of the Russian Federation, Ukraine must seek qualitative superiority among its forces. For situations in which the AFU are on the defensive, this has largely been achieved. For offensive operations, 2023 demonstrated that the system of training and force generation is not producing sufficient force quality to execute a high tempo of operations. There are several reasons for this. At the most basic level, the training is appropriate neither in duration nor content. There are differences of approach between AFU and NATO members on how battle inoculation should be carried out. Nevertheless, restrained use of BATSIM (battlefield simulation) and other techniques to habituate trainees to the felt effect of artillery manifested in a proportion of units performing poorly early in the offensive. A lack of familiarity and training with artillery for example saw troops unwilling to keep pace with close support fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other fundamental problem related to drill proficiency. With five weeks training at Operation Interflex, and perhaps a month of collective training before being committed, troops did not have a well-rehearsed repertoire of battlefield movements they could execute at pace. Tactical control of direct fires was also very limited, partly because safety constraints on training without sufficient time to lay strong foundations prevented fire and movement at platoon and company level from being adequately drilled. In consequence, fire discipline was largely poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method adopted by the Ukrainian military to make up for this force quality problem was to select a cadre of assault troops from within its units, such that a battalion might generate two platoons of assault troops, while the remainder of the battalion formed conventional companies. In practice, this meant that rather than being able to echelon through one another to maintain offensive momentum, each attack had to be deliberately planned and would culminate on completion. Furthermore, the loss of these assault troops would remove the offensive combat power of the battalion. This made commanders cautious, further impeding tempo. Although the approach adopted by the AFU made sense in the limited time available, the time for training was inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem was the training of brigades as a cohered formation. With most brigade staffs fixed on the front to manage defensive sectors, Ukraine has struggled to train brigades, or to exercise battalions beneath a brigade headquarters. The result was that when Ukrainian units reached the battle area, they tended to plan and execute separate company actions, managed by the brigade headquarters and supported by brigade fires, rather than conforming to a brigade scheme of manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to raise force quality for offensive operations through a deliberate process taking approximately eight months, with up to 18 weeks of individual training and collective training thereafter, must be factored in to war planning. Planning by Ukraine or its international partners has rarely been conducted over such horizons, especially among the political echelon. But failure to plan in this way means that the available force will not be suited to the envisaged task. The largest attacks during the offensive were battalion attacks. This reflected the small cadre of trained staff officers able to synchronise larger operations. To overmatch Russian units, it is necessary to increase the scale at which Ukrainian units can operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deficiencies-in-planning&quot;&gt;Deficiencies in Planning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original concept of operations, as previously described, envisaged a 12-brigade operation taking seven days to breach the defence lines along a 30 km frontage and isolate Tokmak. The evidence suggests that had this concentration of forces and tempo been achieved, a breakthrough to Tokmak was possible. However, this concept defining requirements was unburdened by the limitations of the actual force employed. The original concept was reasonable. But when the concept was turned into a plan, reflecting the limitations of the forces that had been generated, the time that had elapsed, and thus the disposition of the enemy, errors in planning emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the theory of success for the operation as executed depended on a collapse in Russian forces, but the forces and means were not concentrated sufficiently to achieve this effect. It is not evident on what basis planners thought this would be achieved. Instead, planning appears to have proceeded on the basis of significant optimism bias. This appears to have stemmed partly from a belief that Russia’s collapse around Kharkiv arose from a lack of morale, when in reality it arose from Russia’s lack of sufficient troops. This is not a new problem, but given the extent to which NATO members hope to offset the enemy’s numerical superiority, methodologies for more accurate assessments of the morale of an enemy seem worth developing. The UK, in particular, has for some time emphasised the importance of information manoeuvre and the cognitive dimension of war. It is evident, however, that planners did not correctly evaluate Russia’s mindset or vulnerabilities in this regard. Thus, it appears there are insufficient means for staffs to sense or conduct battle damage assessment on morale, to enable accurate planning for how a collapse might be induced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also evident that planners failed to properly apportion the right forces for the operation. Rather than being recovered from the front to form the core of new units, experienced troops were instead left with diminishing levels of mechanised equipment and were committed on various diversionary axes, such as Bakhmut, or in fixing actions on either side of the main effort. When troops from these units were thereafter pushed into the offensive force, the units lacked critical means, including demining equipment, to be able to succeed. The decline in equipment quality in follow-on forces was also pronounced, such that Ukrainian units began to have to attempt offensive breaching operations with MaxxPros and other vehicles unsuited to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain planning failures were made jointly between Ukraine and its international partners, for example, the weight given to effects of deep strikes, which were intended to disrupt the Russian defences. While the campaign targeting Crimea was well planned, the deep battle in support of the main effort employed too few munitions against too diverse an array of targets to ever deliver a critical scale of effect. Nor were the application of long-range precision fires synchronised with tactical actions that would best exploit the pressure placed on the Russian defensive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another curious element of the planning is the lack of mitigations in place to overcome identified Russian strengths. During wargames carried out with Ukraine’s international partners prior to the offensive, a number of Russian capabilities were identified as especially problematic. Russian aviation was one such capability. Yet the operation was launched without any means to counter the threat from Russian attack aviation. The US eventually approved the use of ATACMs in October to strike Russian helicopters at their airfields. This was all very well, but by October Russian attack aviation had already played its part in blunting Ukraine’s offensive. By then, the application of ATACMs merely contributed to an attritional writing down of Russian systems. It did not enable manoeuvre. The point here is not that ATACMs were the answer to aviation. Russia tactically adapted to mitigate the risk to its airfields within days of these strikes. The point is that nothing was done to mitigate the risk when it mattered. This problem was not limited to the issue of aviation. Minefields were similarly identified as a major problem. At the beginning of the offensive, Ukraine had significantly fewer demining vehicles than would be considered the minimum required in doctrine. This had predictable results, which had been identified by Ukraine and its partners during the pre-offensive wargames. Yet Ukraine’s partners continued to push demining vehicles into Ukraine as late as August, when the US provided M117s. The AFU took two months learning how to operate and maintain these vehicles so they were not ready to be used until October 2023, after the offensive had completely culminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about this is that Ukraine’s international partners provided equipment in a manner that was completely inconsistent with NATO doctrine, such that Ukraine could not concentrate a critical mass of the relevant capabilities at the decisive point. Much of this failure was political. The US had recommended releasing DPICM to Ukraine in autumn 2022 and ATACMs early in 2023. The release of these systems was approved late. The question that NATO members must confront is whether their systems of government prompt leaders to make decisions when they must be made if they are to have their intended effect, or whether the system allows for delay beyond the point of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-identifying-emerging-tactical-challenges&quot;&gt;IV. Identifying Emerging Tactical Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of large-scale offensive breaching operations is one of the hardest tasks that land forces must be able to carry out. In the First World War, it took the Entente powers three years to develop the concepts and capabilities and generate the capacity to effectively breach German defences on the Western Front. Holding units that are equipped and trained for this operation represents the largest resource commitment in most armies. For example, while the UK has many units that have widespread utility, only 3 UK Division, which is by far the most expensive element of the Field Army, is expected to be able to conduct large-scale offensive breaching, and it is at present not equipped to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrinal framework for offensive breaching has remained essentially unchanged since the formulation of AirLand Battle in the 1980s. The last time offensive breaching was conducted by Western forces at scale was in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and this appeared to vindicate the equipment, formation structure, tactics and doctrine underpinning AirLand Battle. Prior to 2023, the only large-scale offensive breaching operation to have been conducted in a conventional war since 1991 was Azerbaijan’s operation to retake Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. This operation was, however, carried out against an Armenian force that was barely modernised from the 1980s. Thus, the established formula once again proved successful. Breaching operations in Iraq during the war against Islamic State and in Afghanistan during fighting with the Taliban required clearing through complex fields of IEDs, but these were not covered by artillery, and so coalition forces dictated the tempo of manoeuvre. It is therefore reasonable to argue that Ukraine’s attempts to breach the Surovikin Line over summer 2023 were the first attempts at large-scale offensive breaching operations in 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over that timeframe, new technologies have had a considerable impact on how armies fight. It is therefore worth examining the experience of Ukrainian forces to assess the extent to which established doctrine remains valid and where it may need to be adapted or revised. These lessons are not only relevant for Ukraine’s forces, as they endeavour to recover and prepare for future offensive operations, but also for Ukraine’s international partners, who must be credible if they are to deter Russia from challenging Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fighting in Ukraine during 2023 revealed several requirements and problem sets that have not widely confronted NATO forces and are not effectively accounted for in Western doctrine. These issues need to be thought through during the design of future forces and operations. Several of these challenges are unpacked in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pervasive-observation-and-precision-fires&quot;&gt;Pervasive Observation and Precision Fires&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the offensive, both sides made extensive use of UAVs to watch the battlefield over the frontline and into opposing rear areas. Russian troops made substantial use of Lancet-3M loitering munitions to deliver precision strikes against Ukrainian artillery and support elements. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, used an expanding number of first-person-view UAVs as they moved onto the defensive, and as their own availability of artillery ammunition diminished. For both sides, these capabilities have proved more impactful for defensive than offensive operations. This is primarily because it is easier to deconflict these systems when one’s own forces are manoeuvring less, because using them in the close against advancing troops means they are in closer proximity to their control antennae than to enemy jamming, and because it is the attacking party that must increase its signature and will outrun its ability to use deception or decoys to protect itself, as the attacker must advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of EW and low-altitude air defence for offensive operations did exist in older doctrine. Largely, however, this was a divisional responsibility, as it remains in US concepts. Today, the localised ability to generate precision fires means that all units require electronic protection. In concept, advancing formations must be able to create electronic barriers, and since sub-units are unlikely to have dedicated air defence, systems must be multifunctional, with the ability to engage small aerial targets. Electronic protection is too vulnerable if kept on a small number of dedicated platforms. Instead, while electronic protection modules must be programmable and relatively autonomous, they must be widely distributed. Antennae will become a crucial layer in a protection system, vulnerable to direct fire. They must therefore be replaceable, rather than integral to the unit generating the jamming frequencies. Projecting navigational interference is particularly important for providing area defence against precision fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there is the dilemma, noted above, of how a force that must create a time-limited snowdome of protection from precision fires can avoid increasing its exposure to statistical artillery (non-precision munitions). The old answer – to win the counterfires battle – is only a partial solution, because high-fidelity ISR now allows fewer guns to deliver more concentrated effects, thus raising the threshold of suppression needed to protect the force. Thus, alongside the requirement to protect the force from stand-in observation, it is also necessary to be able to defeat enemy longer-range UAVs, either at low altitude but stood off up to 10 km, or at medium altitude above the MANPADS ceiling. Combined with the fact that the targets being engaged will often be relatively inexpensive, this presents a key challenge for short-ranged air defence. There is also the requirement to shift the task from counterbattery kills to left-of-launch targeting of enemy artillery. This brings into the close battle concepts that had previously been more relevant to discussions of Integrated Air and Missile Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electromagnetic-battlespace-management&quot;&gt;Electromagnetic Battlespace Management&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force that can employ precision fires responsively is likely to be disproportionately efficient compared with their adversary. The ability to minimise concentration is simultaneously dependent on coordination of activities at reach or beyond line of sight. This depends on access to the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The result is that even without enemy EW, the EMS is becoming crowded. The number of systems communicating is increasing. The volume of data being passed is increasing. And the advantages to be gained versus vulnerabilities ceded by not contesting the EMS are shifting to a point where although forces must be able to revert without their primary systems, this does not mean they should accept loss of communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contested nature of the EMS and its impact on the efficiency of fires and manoeuvre must be addressed. In the defence, runners, ground-laid cable and other reversionary methods can be used to limit traffic, signature and vulnerability. On the offence, these are not viable options. Without careful frequency management, forces are liable to engage in widespread fratricide in the EMS, including degrading the efficiency and survivability of their own UAVs. This was a serious problem in Ukraine, and often caused commanders to limit electronic protection to their forces, thus increasing their own situational awareness but also giving freedom to enemy ISR and fires. Russian forces would reset their frequencies every 24 hours, deconflicting UAV orbits, and would synchronise EW with manoeuvre, so that when precision coordinates needed to be generated, electronic protection would dip before being brought back up. This was achieved despite the AFRF distributing EW capabilities to the company echelon. For Ukraine, absolute shortage of systems reduced the complexity of the task, but most EW was nevertheless managed at the brigade echelon, and even then was often not maximally exploited, because of the difficulties it created for C2 and ISR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to allocate sufficient bandwidths for software-defined systems to avoid broad-band jamming, and yet have enough spectrum available for the range of systems in a modern force, is a serious problem. It is also one that most military personnel are not trained to manage. Yet this is becoming a key planning constraint at all echelons. There is a need for signallers to be trained differently to support these requirements down to brigade and battlegroup level. At the same time, commanders in the combat arms need to be better trained in how to use EW troops and how to plan manoeuvre in the EMS. Increasing the skills of signallers is of little value if the level of understanding among the other arms diverges rather than converges, leading to the capabilities being neglected or misapplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accelerated-capability-refresh-cycles&quot;&gt;Accelerated Capability Refresh Cycles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a new observation to say that innovative capabilities have their greatest impact when first fielded and then offer less advantage as the enemy adapts. This problem was well understood in the wake of the First World War. Today, however, software-defined systems are highly vulnerable to bespoke electronic countermeasures, while also being disproportionately effective when compared with non-software-defined capabilities. The result is that a force must use software-defined systems to be competitive, but the peak effectiveness of a software-defined capability is therefore operationally short-lived and, once the enemy has adapted, tactically volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifested in various ways during the 2023 offensive. First, Western planning assumptions about the effects deliverable by precision munitions proved exaggerated, owing to enemy countermeasures. Excalibur and GMLRS suffered from this. Second, Ukraine found that with systems such as UAVs, a rapid refresh rate of both software and radios was necessary to maintain their effectiveness. This impinged, however, on their ability to scale production and therefore to reap the rewards of their technical advantage. Instead, innovations would be tested at small scale and deployed at moderate scale when industry could begin supplying a solution. However, the adversary would develop exquisite countermeasures before production could be accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that this interaction is going to be a feature of future conflict. It poses major challenges to how NATO militaries contract industry, how systems are tested and validated, and how training and safety of systems is managed. Other than for night-one capabilities, designed to open the door, it is clear that maintaining technological advantage, and thus a qualitative edge, must be premised on having software engineers in tactical formations empowered to interfere with systems, and the ability to rapidly swap out hardware components like radios without having to discard the platforms to which they were attached. Vendors must be incentivised to provide sub-systems and to understand that there will be repeat custom cyclically as they adapt their products, rather than refining a single product and endeavouring to lock the customer into keeping with it. In many states, this will require legislative changes to oversight. Within operational – rather than tactical – timeframes, however, this is crucial to maintaining tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diversification-of-last-mile-resupply&quot;&gt;Diversification of Last-Mile Resupply&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistence of surveillance over the frontline, combined with cheap and scalable precision strike using UAVs, poses a particular threat to the resupply of forces on the offence because the available ground lines of communication become constrained to established breaches and are therefore easy to monitor. Furthermore, deception and other methods aimed at keeping resupply vehicles alive are irrelevant once they are forced to traverse known routes, where the enemy will not have to deal with false positives. Moreover, the pressure put by the enemy on lead elements through counterattack means that they can impose when resupply and casualty evacuation is most critical, limiting the agency the offensive force has to shape conditions to enable last-mile resupply. Resupply vehicles must also be supported in breaching artillery-delivered scattered mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One answer for this is that last-mile resupply becomes a combined arms endeavour requiring the layering of air defence, counterbattery fires, EW, engineering support and other measures to create windows of opportunity for movement. This is extremely resource intensive and, in Ukraine’s case, resources are lacking. In certain circumstances, resupply may have to become the main effort of a force’s supporting arms, but this is highly undesirable and, in any case, limits the number of resupplies that can be achieved. Although not directly related to last-mile resupply, the inability to advance less protected support platforms such as artillery and medical support, owing to the persistent threat of precision strike over the forward line of own troops (FLOT), is a further challenge that limits the ability to keep support and enablers moving forwards with the combat arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, methods must be found for diversifying last-mile resupply. The UK, in particular, has been experimenting extensively with uncrewed systems in this role. While helicopters are expensive to operate and vulnerable in the face of Russian air defences, UAVs may offer a means to move pallets of food, water and ammunition forwards. Using uncrewed ground vehicles for breaching similarly offers the opportunity to widen and multiply the lanes through which supplies can pass. Uncrewed ground vehicle technology is not currently ideally suited to offensive obstacle breaching, because it is easily knocked out through damage to key sensors and often depends on remote control, while such breaching must be done either from close proximity to the vehicle or via fixed cable. Once behind the FLOT, however, such systems have significant potential, and experimentation in this space could mature the capability until it is able to support offensive breaching operations. Increasing the throughput of materiel and thereby extending the reach and endurance of a given assault unit buys time for the breach to be expanded, for additional forces to echelon through and ultimately for the maintenance of momentum. Medical evacuation via UAV is more morally complex, but in many instances may improve the rate of survival considerably by allowing casualties to be recovered across complex or denied terrain to a medical facility in a hardened position where a better standard of care can be provided. Improving the rate of survival from injury also has a positive effect on morale, contributing to the maintenance of momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important context in which NATO members should examine this problem is how it relates to gap crossing. Russia’s control of Kherson Oblast was ultimately rendered unsustainable because of Ukraine’s ability to interdict crossing points. Ukraine’s decision not to exploit its opportunity in Krynky was driven by the assessment that a force large enough to have any significant impact on the left bank of the Dnipro could not be supported across it. Any terrain analysis of NATO’s eastern flank shows that wet gaps are regular terrain features. How NATO members can develop capabilities for emplacing and protecting crossings is therefore a vital conceptual area for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-of-critical-enablers&quot;&gt;Vulnerability of Critical Enablers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final significant challenge that must be overcome conceptually is the vulnerability of critical enablers such as engineering vehicles. Historically, this has been addressed by heavily protecting these platforms and by having them covered by main battle tanks. The concept has been that although ATGM operators and hostile main battle tanks will seek to engage breaching vehicles, this will reveal their positions and allow them to be engaged and destroyed by overwatching direct fires. Psychologically, the threat of this rapid and lethal response has the effect of suppressing the scale at which threats manifest. Speed then reduces the time available for the enemy to safely execute engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under modern conditions, this concept of overwatch is deeply flawed. The problem is that an increasing array of threat systems, from FPV drones to non-line-of-sight ATGMs and UAV-mounted laser designation for artillery munitions, can be launched and directed from concealed positions. This means that individual prestige equipment can be picked out. It also extends the timeframe within which it can be targeted, because those launching these munitions can fire multiple times and can concentrate on guiding their munition without concern about receiving fire. The result is a high probability of mission kill against key enabling equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolving this problem requires new approaches to offensive suppression and to the design of enabling equipment. For offensive suppression, the utilisation of loitering munitions, provided with target coordinates by EW baselines, could enable strikes on operators of threat systems that are otherwise safe beyond line of sight of their targets. An equivalent to the Lancet-3M would be very useful for this. It would also require an uplift in the density of Ukrainian EW baselines at brigade level to identify enemy UAV operators and engage them. For defensive measures, the utilisation of multispectral smoke would help, although not entirely alleviate, the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical line of effort, however, is that if these vehicles can be picked out then it follows that they will be attrited. More of them are therefore required. At present, these are often prestige assets and are heavily protected, able to carry out a range of functions. It seems likely that the number of vehicles in engineering units needs to increase, while their flexibility and complexity needs to decrease to make such an uplift in platforms affordable. Furthermore, the diversification of tasks that can be carried out with modules mounted on other armoured vehicles should be prioritised. If such systems are targetable, then the aim should be to make fewer targets single points of failure in the ability of the force to breach obstacles. It is notable that Israel, when entering Gaza, determined that it required 20 D9 armoured bulldozers per brigade to overcome the anticipated IED threat. D9s may not be ideally suited to combat in Ukraine, but the density of such vehicles is a good yardstick for what should be the aim. The requirement for such an uplift in the number of platforms speaks to a need to change the design priorities for the platforms dedicated to these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes of the failure of Ukraine’s offensive operations in 2023 may be summarised as a lack of personnel and critical materiel, inadequate time to train and cohere the relevant forces, the misallocation of personnel to the identified axes, and a lack of solutions to several identified tactical problems. Ensuring that these mistakes are not repeated requires a more deliberate and longer force generation process, and for Ukraine’s international partners to calibrate equipment provision to the outcomes they have stated they want, rather than to what is politically convenient to provide in the short term. Given that addressing these challenges requires the industrial mobilisation of Europe, and that this has started late, it will take some time before Ukraine can recommence major offensive operations. Creating the conditions for the eventual termination of the war on favourable terms must be achieved through shaping in the intervening period. This has driven a change in how Ukraine looks to fight the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the current phase of the conflict, the AFU’s focus is on inflicting maximum damage on the Russian Federation, not on liberating Ukrainian territories at any cost. On the battlefield, the AFU is prioritising the destruction of those systems that the AFRF will struggle to replace or repair. The AFU is also building extensive defensive positions to try to maximise the AFRF rate of losses for any gains made on the battlefield. Such a damage-centric approach is intended to buy the maximum possible time, both for force generation and for damage to be inflicted in the deep. For Ukraine’s international partners, provision of artillery ammunition and long-range strike systems are most important in support of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s capacity to continue its aggression against Ukraine is fundamentally a result of its large capital reserves. The ability to pay high salaries to contract soldiers is enabling Russia’s regeneration of forces, while money generated from petrochemical exports allows Russia to expand military equipment production, even as sanctions and supply chain disruption drive up the price. Ukraine is therefore targeting oil and gas infrastructure in Russia to initially reduce its reserves and thereafter the availability of liquid capital. Ukraine’s international partners can support this effort by targeting the manufacturing facilities of Russia’s defence industries, and the global supply chains that allow Russia to sustain the war, through rigorously enforced sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another line of effort for inflicting damage on Russia is the use of information operations to reduce Russian confidence in the rouble, and to take measures to drive up inflation. Creating a felt cost of the conflict for the Russian population, and ascribing blame for that feeling to local officials, increases the jeopardy for the Russian government as the war protracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying time and slowing Russian force expansion are ways to support the regeneration of offensive combat power. To regenerate this power, Ukraine must levy troops that it does not immediately commit as battlefield replacements, but instead allows to train collectively until they are tactically proficient. This requires the opportunity to exercise headquarters to enable Ukrainian units to operate at scale. The combat arms officers leading such formations must also be familiar with using electronic protection, reconnaissance and attack so that they can protect their units once committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for the commitment of additional forces should not be fixed in relation to a timeline governed by political expectations. Instead, the AFU should plan a shaping operation to create the conditions for offensive operations to be possible. While critical conditions are being established, Ukraine’s international partners must work with these units to develop methods of overcoming the threat from Russian long-range fires. These include effective counter- reconnaissance capabilities, and the ability to protect the logistics routes in support of offensive operations and key enablers supporting offensive action. If these measures are not taken, Ukraine risks prolonging the conflict without shifting its trajectory, with tragic consequences for both the country and the security of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

The fragile interconnectedness of the norms urges global action to reinforce these pillars and prevent a destabilizing cascade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, nuclear norms have faced significant challenges, as exemplified by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s November 2023 decision to withdraw Russia’s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). This decision is part of a broader trend undermining nuclear institutions, such as the breakdown of bilateral arms control dialogue and the failure to achieve consensus within the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The erosion of these norms poses a critical question for the international community: Can the nuclear order be maintained — or will it collapse under persistent contestation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes the health of three key nuclear norms: nonproliferation, nonuse, and no testing. The findings indicate that while these norms are broadly supported and critical for stability, they are increasingly contested. The research paints a picture of a network of nuclear norms under stress. This contestation is led by a relatively small cast of characters, but growing friction within nuclear institutions from multiple directions and by a wide set of actors also challenges the existing nuclear order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norm development is frequently depicted as a cascade, yet this cascade can also operate in reverse should a norm experience significant weakening. Such a reverse normative cascade has the potential to make the nuclear order collapse like a house of cards, whereby the violation of a single nuclear norm, such as the norm against testing, could have knock-on effects potentially undermining other norms, such as the one against proliferation. The interconnected nature of these norms means that a significant weakening of one could lead to a cascade effect, jeopardizing the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear norms are interdependent, and a normative cascade can go both ways: While the norms are often represented as stand-alone pillars, these pillars are arranged like dominoes: if one falls, another could follow. Proliferation, for example, has historically been followed by testing, and it could undermine the credibility of not only the NPT and CTBT but also their associated norms. Similarly, any use of a nuclear weapon could call into question the entire nuclear order and its ability to restrain nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Norm cascades or reverse cascades are exacerbated by regional dynamics: For example, Russia’s suspension of arms control agreements, such as New START, correlates with its invasion of Ukraine. States’ decisions to observe norms, therefore, depend not only on the wider international security environment, but particularly on the regional security environment and perceptions of threats from neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear testing is strong, but the weakest of the three: The norm against nuclear testing faces the most active contestation, highlighted by North Korea’s ongoing testing over the past decade and Russia’s potential resumption of testing. Another challenge is coming from contestation of the CTBT. One point of contestation is the treaty’s delayed entry into force, which remains a distant and unlikely prospect both because of the security environment and because of domestic political polarization, particularly within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treating nuclear possessors as a monolith could undermine nuclear norms: Many international actors treat all nuclear possessors as norm contesters because of nuclear modernization programs and continued reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Overall, third-party responses have been strongly supportive of upholding all three norms. However, responses to potential nuclear use and nuclear threats have been less strong than the other two norms. The main example of this is the hesitant international response to Russia’s threats of nuclear use related to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Nuclear Possessors: Continue to uphold and reinforce nuclear norms through transparency, restraint, and collective efforts such as the P5 process (involving China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND) initiative. Specific activities might include reciprocal visits to test sites, along with incorporating risks of emerging technologies into multilateral dialogues. To strengthen the nonproliferation norm, the United States and United Kingdom can be more explicit about the historical nonproliferation benefits of extended nuclear deterrence. Additionally, states should refrain from explicit nuclear threats or escalatory language, such as threatening “World War III.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the P3 (France, the United Kingdom, the United States): Lead efforts in risk reduction and norm reinforcement, engaging with both nuclear and non-nuclear states to address emerging threats and regional dynamics. These efforts might take place within the context of CEND, the initiative on irreversible nuclear disarmament (IND), or other new risk reduction efforts. This will require continuing to operate within the P5 process, but the P3 can also engage either bilaterally or multilaterally with a wider group of non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to understand and strengthen norms at the regional level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Non-Nuclear Possessors and Civil Society: Play an active role in norm enforcement, particularly in the context of the NPT. One specific area where NNWS and civil society can strengthen nuclear norms is to avoid treating nuclear possessors as a monolith. They should also continue to pressure the P5 to continue with their dialogues and to address the risks of weakening norms in the context of emerging technologies, transparency of doctrine, and risk reduction initiatives. This group should also play an important role in championing the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty and CTBT. A final point is that civil society can lead the way in public denouncements of norm violations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is a call not only for nuclear weapon states (NWS) to uphold the nuclear norm network, but also for leadership by key states, such as the United Kingdom and United States, to engage with NNWS to strengthen norms and hold norm violators accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 13, 2024, Russian president Vladimir Putin added to his list of nuclear threats, stating that Moscow was ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” This statement was the latest in a string of challenges to nuclear institutions, including the breakdown of bilateral arms control dialogue and the failure to reach consensus in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), often cited as the cornerstone of the nuclear order. In a statement to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in 2024, for example, UK ambassador James Kariuki cited the importance of the NPT in “preventing the erosion of non-proliferation.” Nuclear norms are being tested from multiple directions, and how the international community responds to these challenges will determine if the nuclear order can be stabilized through existing institutions or whether it faces an era of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the status of nuclear norms is not a purely academic exercise, although much of the thinking about norms is rooted in scholarship. The health of nuclear norms also has direct policy implications. Policy objectives for the international community, particularly for nuclear weapon states (NWS) with unique nuclear responsibilities, include upholding existing nuclear norms so as to avoid escalation to nuclear use or nuclear proliferation. The nuclear order, to include institutions and norms, is important because it provides stability and predictability on nuclear risks in a time of growing uncertainty. Treaties, norms, and other commonly observed practices inhibit potentially dangerous behaviors such as nuclear proliferation or testing, along with upholding the taboo against nuclear use. But a worsening security environment and new technologies, among other factors, threaten to undermine nuclear norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nuclear norms are being tested from multiple directions, and how the international community responds to these challenges will determine if the nuclear order can be stabilized through existing institutions or whether it faces an era of uncertainty.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three norms serve as the foundation of the nuclear order: nonproliferation, nonuse, and no testing. This study uses an analytical framework to assess the health of these three nuclear norms and to identify policy options for strengthening them. The research paints a picture of an increasingly contested network of nuclear norms. This contestation is led by a relatively small cast of characters, but growing friction within nuclear institutions from multiple directions and by a wide set of actors also challenges the existing nuclear order. Much of the current contestation is driven by regional and domestic factors — including individuals — rather than by major strategic shifts or great power competition. Norm development is frequently depicted as a cascade, yet this cascade can also operate in reverse should a norm experience significant weakening. Such a reverse normative cascade has the potential to make the nuclear order collapse like a house of cards, whereby the violation of a single nuclear norm, such as the norm against testing, could have knock-on effects potentially undermining other norms, such as the one against proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proceeds in three sections. First, it provides an overview of the three key nuclear norms. Second, it uses an analytical framework to assess the health of nuclear norms and identify which are strongest as well as which are being contested and by whom on the basis of concordance, third-party responses, compliance, and implementation. This framework is derived from robust scholarship on norm evolution and health, and it demonstrates the value of bridging the academic and policy communities on pressing nuclear issues. Finally, the paper summarizes the four main findings from the analytical framework and offers a series of policy recommendations for strengthening norms, such as greater transparency, cooperative efforts to reduce nuclear risks, and public denouncement of norm violations. The paper is a call not only for NWS to uphold the nuclear norm network, but also for leadership by key states, such as the United Kingdom and United States, to engage with non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to strengthen norms and hold norm violators accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;Three Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonproliferation, Nonuse, and No Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Krepon, in his 2021 book Winning and Losing the Nuclear Peace, emphasized the importance of sustaining the norms against nuclear proliferation, the use of nuclear weapons in warfare, and further nuclear weapons testing. Krepon argued that arms control efforts should focus on upholding these norms. Like Krepon, this paper does not include norms of disarmament or deterrence in its analysis, given that disarmament and abolition “reflect aspirational standards that have been beyond reach for every generation that has lived uneasily with nuclear danger. . . . The human costs of continued warfare have been great, but not anywhere near as great as in wars fought before the Bomb was invented.” Similarly, it does not include disarmament as a norm because while disarmament is captured in NPT Article VI and nuclear arsenals have been reduced by approximately 88 percent since the height of the Cold War, progress toward disarmament has stagnated and is not a consistent practice. Additionally, scholarship by Jean-Baptiste Jeangene Vilmer and Lawrence Freedman has demonstrated that nuclear disarmament does not constitute a norm because it does not have a norm “entrepreneur” among nuclear possessors and may fail to fully emerge. Nuclear deterrence, conversely, remains a consistent practice among nuclear possessors and states covered by extended nuclear deterrence (such as within NATO), and it is also occasionally cited as consistent with the norm of nonuse. But nuclear deterrence remains widely contested among NNWS and much of civil society, and it has not reached the same widespread acceptance as the nuclear taboo, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset, it is important to recognize the potential limits of focusing on norms as an indicator of the strength of the nuclear order and as a policy framework. Norms are intended to set rules of the road to shape broader behaviors. The hope is that a norm violation would inspire widespread condemnation and outrage. However, sometimes outrage is not enough to shape states’ behavior in the face of unprecedented security threats. Norms are neither valued nor observed symmetrically among states, possessors and non-possessors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the three nuclear norms and their approximate years of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RNEU3kC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Nuclear Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear nonproliferation norm is defined as a set of principles, agreements, and international efforts aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information. Koplow, for example, defines the nonproliferation regime as “the set of treaties, agreements, conventions, formal and informal groupings, rules, and norms that seek to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.” Despite four nuclear-armed countries remaining outside of the 1968 NPT, nuclear nonproliferation has been marked by the widespread international recognition that having more states with nuclear weapons would be destabilizing and could increase the risks of nuclear use. The treaty itself, supported by 191 countries, states that “the proliferation of nuclear weapons would seriously enhance the danger of nuclear war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present analysis focuses on the norm against horizontal proliferation: the spread of nuclear weapons and materials between states or other international actors. This paper does not include so-called vertical proliferation (i.e., nuclear modernization) as part of the norm. Established nuclear powers, including the United States, Russia, and China, continue to modernize, and in some cases expand, their arsenals, which challenges the emergence of a norm against vertical proliferation. Despite their commitments to nuclear disarmament, these states justify their proliferation efforts based on security imperatives, technological advancements, and the perceived necessity of maintaining credible deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear weapon use is largely based on the recognition of the potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear detonations and the potential for escalation associated with the use of nuclear weapons. It dates back over seven decades, emerging after the United States used atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The norm endured the end of the nuclear monopoly with the development of nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union, as well as the intense geopolitical rivalry of the Cold War era, when the threat of nuclear warfare loomed large. However, despite the temptation to employ nuclear weapons, both superpowers exhibited restraint, recognizing the immense consequences of nuclear conflict and the risk of mutual assured destruction. As Nina Tannenwald highlights, for example, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Secretary of State Dean Rusk opposed the use of nuclear weapons during the Vietnam War because of the fallout risks and unacceptable destruction, reinforcing the taboo against nuclear use. Similarly, the Soviet Union chose to lose the war in Afghanistan rather than seek to achieve its objectives through “winning” with the use of nuclear weapons. Subsequent diplomatic efforts, international treaties, and various arms control agreements — such as the 1973 Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War — strengthened the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the norm against nuclear testing refers to a shared understanding that states will refrain from conducting explosive nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, underwater, in outer space, underground, or anywhere on earth. The first nuclear test was conducted by the United States in July 1945. After that, nuclear testing quickly became a crucial aspect of the Cold War competition between Washington and Moscow. The United States conducted 1,032 tests and the Soviet Union conducted 715, with the Castle Bravo test being the worst radiological disaster in U.S. history due to its contamination of local civilians on the Marshall Islands. The subsequent arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union fueled an extensive period of testing in different domains. However, concerns over the environmental and humanitarian consequences led to international efforts to halt testing, beginning as early as 1954. After a testing moratorium was put in place between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union between 1958 and 1961, as well as limited test ban agreements, a new test ban was proposed in 1990. The norm is now supported by various agreements and initiatives aimed at reducing the risks associated with nuclear testing. Major legal mechanisms to identify concordance with the norm are the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT), which prohibited atmospheric testing, and its successor, the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which further restricted nuclear testing. The CTBT has not yet entered into force. Since it was opened for signature, none of the NPT’s NWS have engaged in nuclear testing; however, India and Pakistan tested in 1998, and North Korea continues to test or threaten to test nuclear weapons as part of its nuclear signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to acknowledge at the outset a high degree of dynamism across the three norms, as evident in their evolution, interaction, and roles in shaping international relations. They essentially form a network of reinforcing mechanisms for nuclear stability. The norm against the use of nuclear weapons, for example, emerged amid Cold War rivalries, with both superpowers laying the groundwork for mutual restraint. Recognizing that any conflict between the two would have catastrophic consequences, President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev agreed at the Geneva Summit in 1985 that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Since the emergence of these norms, their robustness has varied due to fluctuations in levels of enforcement, adherence, and the institutional strength of the United Nations and other international bodies. Despite varying degrees of strength over time, these norms, working in concert, serve as the foundation of the nuclear order, highlighting the dynamic interplay between policy, historical evolution, and contemporary challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-health-of-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;The Health of Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section assesses the robustness and health of the three nuclear norms. Informed by case studies in security and humanitarian law, an analytical framework from Nicole Deitelhoff and Lisbeth Zimmermann identifies conditions affecting the strength, resilience, and durability of global norms. While it can seem in the nuclear policy discourse that these nuclear norms are on the verge of disappearing, the framework shows that they tend to be much more robust than many others in international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four common critical indicators across norms in security studies: concordance, third-party responses, compliance, and implementation. The first two constitute discourse-based metrics of a norm’s strength, whereas the third and fourth components are practice-based and entail specific behaviors. The four indicators are equally weighted to evaluate a norm’s robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concordance with the norm describes the acceptance of a norm’s legitimacy by a state or the general public. It is characterized by belief in norm-enforcing entities, including institutions tasked with monitoring or implementing the norm. Concordance is also measured by the absolute and relative number of ratifications and the standard and quality of opt-out clauses. High concordance, for example, would see universal or near-universal participation in international treaties, with few, if any, opt-out clauses. Low concordance, conversely, would be shown by the absence of international agreements capturing a norm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third-party responses to norm violations can include discursive and material sanctioning. Strong third-party responses include universal sanctioning to noncompliance. Weak responses, such as ignoring or directly or indirectly endorsing violations, would rank low in third-party responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compliance indicates behavior consistent with norms. This is evaluated by how widespread or rare compliance is. All norms encounter a certain amount of noncompliance, often inadvertent, and compliance alone does not explain robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation of a norm is critical and can help illustrate when norms withstand challenges. This is measured through the inclusion of norms in policy papers and protocols, the creation of institutions, or the adoption of norms into domestic law. Compliance and implementation are practice-based dimensions to measure the robustness of norms over time and across cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of this framework offers insights into the robustness of international norms. Table 2 provides an overall assessment of the strength of the nuclear norms, evaluating them from moderate, to strong, to very strong. The table includes some nonexhaustive examples. Justification for the metrics of “Very Strong” to “Moderate” is explained below in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5BxtjRc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Assessing Nuclear Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that this framework alone does not inherently capture dynamic factors, such as the mutually reinforcing nature of many of these norms. Nor does it capture the evolution of the norms over time, an important point of analysis given changing strategic and technological landscapes. Below is a more in-depth analysis, including consideration of dynamism across the norms, to better understand the health of the three nuclear norms and their relationships to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonproliferation&quot;&gt;Nonproliferation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear proliferation has high concordance in policies and treaties, making the norm very robust. The NPT is a cornerstone of global cooperation against nuclear proliferation, with near-universal acceptance, from 191 UN members, creating a robust legal framework against nuclear proliferation. In addition to the NPT, UNSC Resolution 1540 further solidified efforts against proliferation by mandating member states to establish legal measures against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The nuclear nonproliferation regime encompasses various formal agreements, institutions, and informal groupings beyond the NPT and UNSC resolution. These elements — including nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZ), institutions such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and other informal efforts (e.g., the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Zanger Committee, the four Nuclear Security Summits, the Six-Party Talks, and the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament initiative) — contribute to the strengthening of the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope and number of institutions and groupings committed to nuclear nonproliferation signal a widespread third-party response to violations. Breaches of the norm prohibiting nuclear proliferation have prompted robust responses from numerous actors, eliciting international condemnation, economic sanctions, and diplomatic isolation. Whether from individual state actors, alliances such as the European Union, or the UNSC, there is a historical precedent of condemning norm violations by would-be proliferators. The UNSC Sanctions Committee on North Korea, for example, was created in 2006 to address North Korea’s nuclear testing and proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With high acceptance rates, compliance with the norm against nuclear proliferation is nearly universal. The IAEA, through comprehensive safeguards agreements and the Additional Protocol, plays a crucial role in verifying compliance. For instance, the agency conducted numerous inspections in Iran to ensure adherence to its nuclear obligations. Regional organizations also ensure adherence to specific treaties, emphasizing the multilevel implementation of the norm. For example, the compliance with the obligations of the Treaty of Tlatelolco is ensured by the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the African Commission on Nuclear Energy ensures the implementation of the Treaty of Pelindaba. Overall, the norm against nuclear proliferation exhibits high robustness due to its concordance, reactions to violations, and effective implementation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, today the nonproliferation norm faces challenges from various actors. Iran’s nuclear program poses a major provocation, and while Iran claims that its activities are intended for peaceful purposes, Western nations and international organizations have raised concerns about the intent and extent of its nuclear endeavors. Similarly, North Korea’s withdrawal from the NPT in 2003 and its development of nuclear weapons have been an ongoing challenge to the nonproliferation norm. Efforts to negotiate and redefine norms related to nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula continue amid diplomatic tensions. Additionally, in March 2024, Russia vetoed the mandate of a UN Panel of Experts tasked with monitoring enforcement of the sanctions regime against North Korea. This not only weakens the implementation of the norm but also suggests a weakening in third-party responses to norm violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overall, the norm against nuclear proliferation exhibits high robustness due to its concordance, reactions to violations, and effective implementation mechanisms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But potential challenges to the nonproliferation norm are also coming from new directions. Given the threat from North Korea’s nuclear program, South Korea may contest the norm against nuclear proliferation, although the likelihood of this is hard to measure. However, polling data shows a gap in public and elite opinions on the issue of South Korea developing an independent nuclear program. A majority (71 percent) of the South Korean public supports an independent nuclear deterrent, while only one-third of the elite supports it (34 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has stated that if Iran did successfully develop a weapon, Saudia Arabia “will have to get one.” Of course, Iran’s ongoing nuclear program itself challenges the nonproliferation norm. While officially endorsing the NPT, concerns persist about Saudi Arabia’s potential interest in developing its nuclear capabilities, posing challenges to existing norms. Saudi Arabia pursuing a nuclear program would hold serious implications for regional stability and the integrity of nonproliferation efforts. Whether or not South Korea, Saudia Arabia, or other states pursue an independent nuclear weapons program will depend not only on regional security dynamics but also on the restraining power of institutions such as the NPT. At present, it is hard to imagine that South Korea, for example, would be the second state to withdraw from the NPT after North Korea. However, if the normative power of the NPT or other nuclear institutions weakens over time, that restraining power may diminish as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonuse&quot;&gt;Nonuse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, there is high concordance with the norm of nonuse, yet there are fewer legal mechanisms to enforce this norm compared to nonproliferation. While the NPT — the primary treaty for nonproliferation — does not explicitly prohibit nuclear use, norms regulating potential nuclear use (or nonuse) are directly and indirectly addressed through international humanitarian law. However, international humanitarian law refers to the use of force more broadly, rather than nuclear use specifically. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) explicitly refers to the prohibition of nuclear use, but the treaty is not universally accepted. Despite some reservations, the ratification of NWFZs contributes to increasing concordance regionally. For example, a basic party obligation in the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia is “not to allow in its territory: the production, acquisition, stationing, storage or use, of any nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Generally, there is high concordance with the norm of nonuse, yet there are fewer legal mechanisms to enforce this norm compared to nonproliferation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party reactions&lt;/strong&gt; to the use of nuclear weapons have been strong. Acting and former UN secretary-generals António Guterres and Kofi Annan both called out the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan in 1945 as a moment of unmatched horror for humanity. Reactions to the threat of use, however, have been fairly mixed, with condemnation by many Western states, but overall the responses have not been universal. Guterres told the UNSC in March 2024 that “nuclear saber-rattling must stop [and] threats to use nuclear weapons in any capacity are unacceptable.” Steen Hansen, minister counsellor of the European Union, similarly condemned Russian threats as dangerous and unacceptable. But many other international actors have remained largely silent about Russian nuclear threats amid the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third-party actors, including civil society groups and human rights organizations, bolster norm robustness by condemning nuclear use and emphasizing humanitarian and environmental effects. This ranges from the Hibakusha — people affected by the atomic bombings of Japan — to scientific groups such as the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. For example, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons issued a statement in 2022 condemning “nuclear threats [as] unacceptable at any time, by anyone. Putin’s threats increase the risk of escalation to a nuclear conflict.” In 2023, Chinese president Xi Jinping emphasized the need for the international community to “jointly oppose the use of, or threats to use, nuclear weapons.” But not all actors were swift to condemn Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling. The first TPNW Meeting of States Parties, for example, failed to call out Russian nuclear threats, despite the treaty explicitly prohibiting the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. Some nations with close economic or security ties to Russia, particularly in Central Asia, were hesitant to openly criticize Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance&lt;/strong&gt; with the norm is nearly universal, with few actors showing behavior that would suggest an intent to break the nearly 80-year tradition of nuclear nonuse. States have largely been dissuaded from using nuclear weapons in conflicts since the first use of atomic weapons in 1945. While nonuse has persisted, there have been nuclear threats. The United States and the Soviet Union issued nuclear threats during the Berlin Crisis (1958–61) and Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), North Korea has threatened South Korea and its allies multiple times over recent decades, and India and Pakistan have made veiled threats against each other in the past. More recently, nuclear threats have been an integral part of Putin’s strategy for deterring Western intervention in the ongoing war in Ukraine. In February 2024, for example, Putin stated that Western nations “must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory.” The extent to which these threats have the potential to lower the threshold for nuclear use remains unclear, but they should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt; of the norm occurs at various levels, with regional enforcement through NWFZ agreements indicating high implementation — with the caveat that countries in NWFZs cannot use or threaten to use nuclear weapons and none of these states possess nuclear weapons. NWFZs are an example of the interconnectedness of the nuclear norms, with some institutions and actors encompassing all three nuclear norms. Some states include the norm against nuclear use in their domestic nuclear strategy through declared no-first-use policies, adding a level of implementation. Other domestic efforts such as law of war manuals subject nuclear use to the principles of proportionality and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-testing&quot;&gt;No Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concordance&lt;/strong&gt; with the norm against nuclear testing is captured primarily in legal mechanisms such as the PTBT and CTBT. While the CTBT is considered the cornerstone of efforts to halt global nuclear testing, it has not yet entered into force due to reluctance by a key group of states to ratify or sign the treaty. Nevertheless, nuclear possessors, with the exception of North Korea, continue to refrain from nuclear testing. Although a significant number of countries have ratified the treaty, the absence of universal participation from nuclear states could diminish the robustness of concordance with the norm, according to the analytical framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violations of the norm have elicited strong &lt;strong&gt;third-party reactions&lt;/strong&gt; in recent years, including international condemnation and sanctions by individual states as well as the European Union and the UNSC. Civil society efforts by affected communities and organizations have also played a significant role in condemning nuclear testing, resulting in legislative measures such as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in the United States. Strong reactions are nearly universal and occur at various levels. For example, the UNSC has passed nearly a dozen sanctions on North Korea since 2006 because of the state’s nuclear program. This includes sanctions on military and arms trade, along with impacts on the financial assets of key individuals, in response to nuclear testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the norm against nuclear testing taking hold with the end of the Cold War, a handful of states have continued testing to develop their nuclear weapons programs. There have been 10 nuclear tests since the CTBT opened for signature in 1996: two by India (1998), two by Pakistan (1998), and six by North Korea (2006, 2009, 2013, two in 2016, and 2017). Compliance has been widespread over the past 30 years, although there have been concerns about low-yield testing, particularly by Russia, such as those raised by the U.S. State Department’s annual compliance report. Thus, while the nonproliferation norm is supported by an active treaty and the nuclear nonuse norm lacks a universally accepted treaty, the nuclear testing norm is upheld by a treaty that is not yet in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the nonproliferation norm is supported by an active treaty and the nuclear nonuse norm lacks a universally accepted treaty, the nuclear testing norm is upheld by a treaty that is not yet in force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt; of the norm involves various verification methods, including monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratories operated by CTBT signatories. The treaty relies on data from monitoring stations around the world, which is collected and analyzed by the International Data Center. While all signatories have access to this data, only countries that have ratified the treaty are considered full participants. Regional enforcement mechanisms, such as those embedded in NWFZs, signal a high level of implementation in specific regional zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and the United States have engaged in extensive discussions regarding the interpretation of the CTBT. Although both countries have signed the treaty, they hold differing views on what constitutes a violation, illustrating applicatory contestation as they negotiate the scope and interpretation of the norm against nuclear testing. A key point of contention is the concept of zero-yield testing. The CTBT bans all nuclear explosions, but some argue that explosions with an immeasurably small yield are not truly nuclear tests and should be permissible. Putin’s remarks in October 2023 about Russia’s possible readiness to resume nuclear testing reflect this ongoing debate: “I am not ready to tell you right now whether we need or do not need to carry out these tests.” He framed Russia’s potential return to testing as contingent on whether the United States tests. Additionally, some officials in the Trump administration suggested that a return to nuclear testing might be an option. Most recent, Robert C. O’Brien, former national security adviser to Trump, reiterated this need to “test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like others, the norm against nuclear testing is being contested by a small group of nuclear possessors. North Korea continues to defy the norm by testing or threatening to test nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. Despite international condemnation, Pyongyang argues that such tests are vital for its defensive capabilities. A public statement accompanying one of its 2016 tests emphasized North Korea’s right to self-defense and its intention to bolster its nuclear force against perceived threats, particularly from the United States. Additionally, Russia’s deratification of the CTBT in 2023 and Putin’s suggestion that Russia could return to testing also have the potential to undermine the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-a-reverse-normative-cascade&quot;&gt;Avoiding a Reverse Normative Cascade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normative framework presents both a positive but also a cautionary tale. Overall, the nuclear norms remain strong and are widely observed, despite contestation by a small group of actors and a worsening security environment. They are buttressed by widespread concordance with treaties and agreements, particularly the NPT and regional initiatives, such as NWFZs. And yet, despite the historical resilience and overall robustness of these norms, they face ongoing challenges and adaptations. The nonuse norm, for example, demonstrates considerable resilience and is widely recognized as “taboo.” And yet it is being contested by continued Russian and North Korean nuclear threats — some of which do not receive widespread international condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, this paper’s intention is not to present an overly optimistic perspective, but rather to offer a word of caution. The network of nuclear norms could either be reinforced as a lasting foundation of nuclear order or it could collapse like a house of cards. The interconnected nature of nuclear norms is both their strength and their vulnerability when faced with concerted and persistent contestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The network of nuclear norms could either be reinforced as a lasting foundation of nuclear order or it could collapse like a house of cards. The interconnected nature of nuclear norms is both their strength and their vulnerability when faced with concerted and persistent contestation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question from the analysis is who creates, upholds, and challenges norms. Norm establishment, to include normative cascades, typically requires norm entrepreneurs or key stakeholders that can build domestic and international consensus. Similarly, norm contestation also begins with individuals; the inverse of entrepreneurs are norm contesters. When it comes to nuclear decisionmaking, particularly in authoritarian countries such as North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China, individual leaders play an outsized role. Russia’s threats of nuclear use in the war in Ukraine have been seemingly driven by Putin. North Korea’s nuclear program is driven by Kim Jong-un and has been personalized to the Kim family. This finding aligns with other scholarship pointing to the importance of individuals in international security. Solingen, among others, has found that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . systematic differences in nuclear behavior can be observed between states whose leaders or ruling coalitions advocate integration in the global economy, and those whose leaders reject it. . . . Conversely, leaders and ruling coalitions rejecting internationalization incur fewer such costs and have greater incentives to exploit nuclear weapons as tools in nationalist platforms of political competition and for staying in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the normative framework and the present analysis, this report draws four main conclusions about the health of nuclear norms and the strength of the existing nuclear order. It then offers three sets of recommendations for strengthening nuclear norms, grouped by who should execute them: (1) nuclear possessors, including those in the P5 process (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States); (2) the P3 (France, the United Kingdom, and the United States); and (3) nuclear non-possessors, which includes civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 1: Nuclear norms are interdependent, and a normative cascade can go both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While nuclear norms continue to benefit from widespread international support, particularly in comparison to other international norms, all three are being tested concurrently. This contestation reflects states’ responses to a dynamic and uncertain geopolitical and technological landscape. While the norms are often represented as stand-alone pillars, these pillars are arranged like dominoes: if one falls, another could follow. Norm development is often portrayed as a cascade, but this cascade could also work in reverse if one norm is significantly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this interconnectedness could contribute to strengthening norms. Third-party responses and compliance could speak to multiple norms at once. For example, the NWFZs contribute to strengthening all three norms. On the other hand, one norm’s breakdown could undermine the others. Proliferation, for example, has historically been followed by testing, and it could undermine the credibility of not only the NPT and CTBT but also their associated norms. Similarly, any use of a nuclear weapon would be a game changer and could call into question the entire nuclear order and its ability to restrain nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 2: Norm cascades or reverse cascades are exacerbated by regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Norm contestation appears particularly linked to regional issues. For example, Russia’s suspension of arms control agreements, such as New START, correlates with its invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling, which has the potential to undermine the norm against nuclear use, is tied to its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Early on, Putin blamed the United States and NATO for its overreach and expansion in Europe: “What the United States is doing in Ukraine is at our doorstep. . . . And they should understand that we have nowhere further to retreat to. Under [U.S.] protection, they are arming and urging on extremists from a neighbouring country at Russia.” For the Middle East, Saudi Arabia’s threat to pursue nuclear weapons is explicitly tied to regional proliferation and stability, namely whether or not Iran develops nuclear weapons. Similarly, in South Asia, violations are tied to the tensions between India and Pakistan. In response to India’s two nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan announced its own tests only a few days later. States’ decisions to observe norms, therefore, depend not only on the wider international security environment, but particularly on the regional security environment and perceptions of threats from neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 3: The norm against nuclear testing is strong, but the weakest of the three.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The analytical framework indicates that the norm against nuclear testing is currently facing the most active contestation from multiple directions. The most recent violation of any of the three norms occurred due to North Korea’s 2017 test, not to mention its ongoing threats to test again, which all challenge the norm against testing. In 2022, for example, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol indicated that North Korea had completed preparations for a seventh nuclear test. One positive trend in the norm against testing has been the strong response to North Korea’s most recent nuclear tests, particularly by China. This is an important development compared to earlier nuclear tests; however, given Pyongyang and Moscow’s growing closeness, a future test may not receive consensus or UNSC condemnation. Senior officials from Russia and North Korea are meeting regularly to enhance collaboration across various domains such as the economy, science and technology, and culture. In September 2023, for example, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to Russia’s Far East to promote military and technological links with Russia. Only a few months later, in June 2024, President Putin made his way to North Korea, likely deepening the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given Pyongyang and Moscow’s growing closeness, a future test may not receive consensus or UNSC condemnation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another challenge is coming from contestation of the CTBT. One point of contestation is the treaty’s delayed entry into force, which remains a distant and unlikely prospect both because of the security environment and because of domestic political polarization, particularly within the United States. The CTBT is also contested by Russia’s deratification. Amid the increasing tensions in the international order, some nuclear-armed states may propose alternative normative frameworks prioritizing national sovereignty over disarmament efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 4: Treating nuclear possessors as a monolith could undermine nuclear norms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While this analysis points to a small group of norm contesters, many international actors treat all nuclear possessors as norm contesters because of nuclear modernization programs and continued reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Overall, third-party responses have been strongly supportive of upholding all three norms; however, responses to potential nuclear use and nuclear threats have been less strong than the other two norms. The obvious example of this is the muted international response to Russia’s threats of nuclear use related to Ukraine. While Western leaders, including NATO, explicitly and publicly called out Russian saber-rattling, for example, in the fall of 2022, others were more subdued in their responses. It is believed that Chinese and Indian leaders privately signaled to Putin to de-escalate tensions and nuclear threats in the fall of 2022, but the lack of public outcry does little to strengthen the norms. China and India can take on a more influential role in messaging to Putin the risk that his nuclear threats incur.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, the paper offers three sets of policy recommendations for nuclear possessors and nonpossessors to strengthen existing norms and their associated institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 1: Nuclear Possessors and the P5 Process&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First and foremost, nuclear possessors should continue to observe and uphold the three nuclear norms. This may be more complicated than it appears. For example, a historically successful tool of nonproliferation has been extended nuclear deterrence to allies and partners, which could require strong nuclear deterrence signaling. Francis Gavin points to NATO as an efficient example of this strategy. Another complication is the fine line between threatening nuclear use — which could undermine the norm against use — and policies of nuclear deterrence which hold at risk what an adversary values to prevent escalation. To reconcile these challenges, nuclear possessors, particularly the United States and United Kingdom, can be more explicit about the historical nonproliferation benefits of extended nuclear deterrence. Additionally, states should refrain from explicit nuclear threats or escalatory language, such as threatening “World War III.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition to unilateral restraint and policies, nuclear possessors can also work collectively to uphold and strengthen nuclear norms through forums such as the P5 process as well as the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND) and Irreversible Nuclear Disarmament (IND) initiatives. The P5 process is under pressure because of tension in the security environment, but it remains one of the best opportunities for reinforcing norms and reducing risk. Some recent proposals would contribute to strengthening norms against use and testing, such as reciprocal visits to former test sites, a joint statement on a continued testing moratorium, and transparency of doctrines and risk reduction efforts to avoid escalation to nuclear use. The CEND initiative continues to hold plenary meetings, including subgroup work on emerging technologies and risk reduction. One potential area of work would be for CEND participants to identify how emerging technologies, such as additive manufacturing, could undermine norms of nonproliferation. Likewise, the IND initiative is an important opportunity to explore the role of norms in making progress toward political, legal, and technical mechanisms to facilitate irreversible nuclear disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 2: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States (P3)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear possessors have unique responsibilities. Ideally, the P5 would act in concert in fulfilling those responsibilities by jointly pursuing many of these opportunities to strengthen nuclear norms. In the absence of P5 unity and consensus, however, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States might lead efforts to pursue these actions. Other opportunities include leading in CEND, IND, and new risk reduction efforts, such as inviting other NWS to join a “human-in-the-loop” commitment in nuclear decisionmaking. There are challenges and risks with this approach. The biggest risk is breaking the P5 process. Undermining the P5 process at a time when the NPT is under pressure could be dangerous. If the P5 process fails to yield substantive results in disarmament, arms control, risk reduction, and transparency, this would be met with deep dissatisfaction by many NNWS and continue to exacerbate polarization within the NPT while inhibiting its ability to serve as a foundation for the nuclear order.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another area of opportunity for the P3 is to engage, either bilaterally or multilaterally, with members of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates) and NNWS to work cooperatively to strengthen nuclear norms. This can include engaging with groupings to better understand risks to nuclear norms at the regional level, along with building consensus around norms against the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 3: Non-Nuclear Possessors and Civil Society&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;States without nuclear weapons also have responsibilities for upholding nuclear norms, and this paper has demonstrated the importance of third-party responses in contributing to the health of nuclear norms — NWFZs, for example, have a cross-cutting effect on strengthening nuclear norms. But one specific area where NNWS and civil society can strengthen nuclear norms is to avoid treating nuclear possessors as a monolith. All NNWS, including in the context of the NPT review cycle, should call out norm-contesting behavior, such as nuclear threats and withdrawal from existing arms control agreements. These statements can be directed at various members of the P5 process, but they should be specific. They should also continue to pressure the P5 to continue with their dialogues and to address the risks of weakening norms in the context of emerging technologies, transparency of doctrine, and risk reduction initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One area ripe for NNWS and civil society to increase pressure on nuclear possessors and upholding norms is around fissile material. These groups often criticize the Conference on Disarmament (CD) for failing to make progress in recent years, such as progress toward a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT). This approach, however, treats all CD members as the same, whereas lack of progress on an FMCT can be explicitly linked to two specific states: Pakistan and China. Pakistan continues to ask for a verifiable FMCT that addresses existing stockpiles of fissile material, not just future production, and China emphasizes the need for prioritizing disarmament by NWS, along with issues around verification. These concerns are understandable and grounds for dialogue, but they should not completely derail FMCT efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;One area ripe for NNWS and civil society to increase pressure on nuclear possessors and upholding norms is around fissile material.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NNWS can also play an important role in enforcing the CTBT. By ratifying the CTBT, they contribute to its global legitimacy and pressure NWS to comply. They can engage in diplomatic efforts to advocate for the treaty’s universal adoption and implementation. Additionally, NNWS can increasingly participate in the CTBT’s verification regime, providing data and support to the International Monitoring System, which enhances the treaty’s enforcement and helps detect and call out any illicit nuclear tests in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-call-for-action&quot;&gt;A Call for Action&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the current geopolitical climate, there are still positive developments in the nuclear norm landscape worth noting. No new nuclear states have emerged in two decades, and President John F. Kennedy’s fear of dozens of nuclear possessors has not come to fruition. Nuclear weapons have not been used in conflict since 1945. And while North Korea remains the only country continuing to test nuclear weapons, it has been widely condemned as an international pariah as a result. Overall, nuclear norms are healthy — for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three norms are being actively contested amid a worsening geopolitical landscape. For this reason, policymakers should not be complacent about the health of the nuclear order, thinking that it is safe while underpinned by these norms. Instead, they should consider the interconnectedness of nuclear norms, as emphasized in this paper. With the possibility of a reverse normative cascade on the table, where the weakening of one norm could have ripple effects on others and potentially topple the nuclear landscape as it exists today, the risk is too great for policymakers to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田指行動前一晚無去安全屋 向隊員戲稱正「同啲女仔一齊」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qPLPxYA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（17日）踏入第55日審訊。被告李家田接受控方大律師周凱靈盤問。李多番表示不知道「屠龍」成員討論的「20 kg」、「大Plan」是甚麼，亦不知有隊員藏槍。李稱知道小隊於12月8日在港島有行動，但前一晚決定不前往灣仔安全屋，不過卻騙隊員自己會去，並著對方把鎖匙放門口。他指當時向隊員戲稱自己正「同啲女仔一齊」，並表示「阻人」。李解釋，他引用電影《賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯》中，演員萬梓良的對白：「阻人扑嘢，死咗會畀人燒春袋。」庭上被告聞後不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱自己有入理大-不忿屠龍公開表示無成員進入&quot;&gt;李家田稱自己有入理大 不忿「屠龍」公開表示無成員進入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第八日作供，接受控方代表大律師周凱靈盤問。控方繼續問及李的電話紀錄中，他在 Telegram「滅龍」群組內發出的訊息。2019年11月21日，李在群組發送「屠龍」在「育龍」頻道澄清沒有成員進入理大的訊息，李表示自己曾進入理大，對於「屠龍」的說法感不開心，「覺得佢哋冇當我係屠龍小隊成員」，因此「發晦氣」傳送出來。控方追問：「你以屠龍身份入理大？」李不同意，強調是以個人身份，但認為小隊應公開交代有成員在理大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知道隊員討論的20-kg指甚麼&quot;&gt;李稱不知道隊員討論的「20 kg」指甚麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於11月22日，有成員在群組發送新聞連結，提及懲教署區域應變大隊成員，以「特務警察」身份借調到警隊，主要負責守衞警方指定的政府處所。其後成員林銘皓 Kan 表示：「我想同佢哋用眼鏡」。李解釋「眼鏡」指槍，而「佢哋」可指懲教署職員。嚴文謙另表示：「我想用 AK 47，搶支 AR 15 都好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，群組成員討論「20 kg」。黃振強早前供稱，他理解「20 kg」是指炸藥。其中張俊富表示：「20 kg 交畀你？」，梁政希則表示：「20 kg 係咪開心嘢？」，並獲林銘皓回覆「Yeah，超開心」。李表示不知道「20 kg」所指的是甚麼，自己亦無詢問。控方質疑，其他成員似乎都知道「20 kg」的意思；李表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李否認曾出席11月兩次小隊會議&quot;&gt;李否認曾出席11月兩次小隊會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李表示沒有出席成員在群組提及的會議或飯局，包括11月17日在荃灣大鴻輝的會議、同月25日在三陂坊的會議。李表示隊員沒有問他為何不出席25日的會議。控方問：「你有冇失落？」、「有冇覺得不被重視？」李回答：「都有少少。」控方指，李服從黃的要求，在地圖寫上「手足」、「搵人跟」等字眼，卻不依照黃的提議參加小隊會議。由於李早前指自己依靠資助到 HKTVmall 領取食物，控方遂質疑：「記唔記得你要去 HKTVmall 領取食物，好艱難？黃振強請你食飯，點解你唔去？」李解釋計算車費後選擇不去。控方指出，李均有出席上述兩次會議；李不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦在群組表示：「票站得兩隻，點睇？I am ready」，成員程于寶則回應「行得」。李解釋，自己當時在區議會選舉的票站觀看點票情況，見到在場有兩名警察。他想起其他小隊會於24日進行激進行動，因此思考會否有關。李又指，「I am ready」是指準備好在現場觀看事件發生，並非指加入其他小隊的行動。李續解釋「行得」可能指「票站」，但遭控方質疑：「個票站會行？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李否認知道小隊有人藏槍&quot;&gt;李否認知道小隊有人藏槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，林銘皓在群組表示：「Poly 游繩嗰個位得6隻」、「想幫佢哋戴眼鏡」。李表示按字面理解，相信對方表達想用槍對付警察。控方問：「你知道『屠龍』小隊有槍？」李不同意並指：「想，可以未有。」成員張銘裕曾在群組傳送引爆裝置的片段，李表示印象中沒有看過該影片。控方指出，成員沒有問片段內的裝置是甚麼，顯示他們知道。李表示有可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，沒有打算參與12月1日的尖沙咀行動，但無向成員表明。於11月29日，黃振強與成員在群組討論12.1行動，並表示：「我直接打啦，仲哨？」，林銘皓回應：「講緊嗰20，唔使睇？」，黃表示「唔使睇，我想落場打」。林回答「咁就咁㗎啦，你想做大嘢，係要 plan 㗎喎。一係直接嗰日用囉，一了百了」。黃亦指：「啪尖沙咀狗屋」，林回答「佢哋喺入面都炸唔死佢哋，佢哋要出嚟」。控方問：「用咩炸？唔會係汽油彈？」李表示：「可能係。」控方追問：「汽油彈會炸？」李表示可用這個詞語形容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，成員談及「鴻仔」好像有防彈盾，嚴回應「係就好，順便畀支 AR 15 我」。控方指出，成員均知道「鴻仔」的身份，嚴亦知道他藏有槍械。李對此不同意。控方又指，當成員討論台灣軍訓時，李有參與其中，又指「去完台灣咪有得打」。李表示常理覺得軍訓會包括槍械訓練，但否認知道有「屠龍」成員管有槍械。李亦否認想參與軍訓，因訓練內容「聽落好辛苦」，包括左右腳各深蹲30下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示無興趣知道成員談及的大plan&quot;&gt;李表示無興趣知道成員談及的「大Plan」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12月6日，嚴文謙於群組問：「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避？」程于寶則指「淨係引班狗嚟就掂，走得」。林回覆「我哋引戰，然後一班狗嚟，班狗一放煙或者開槍，佢就嚟」。李表示當時看到訊息，但不明白內容。其後黃振強表示：「星期日有大 Plan」；李表示沒有興趣知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示知道屠龍128有行動-但前一晚沒有去安全屋&quot;&gt;李表示知道「屠龍」12.8有行動 但前一晚沒有去安全屋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，有部份訊息並不在李的電話紀錄中。李表示12月8日早上黃振強等人被捕後，他離開群組時，看到18小時前的訊息正被刪除，他認為可能是管理員發出的指令。這些對話紀錄包括，李於12月7日表示：「係咪今晚去定港島先？」李表示知道12月8日「屠龍」在港島有行動，但不同意隊員前往灣仔安全屋是為翌日行動備戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示引賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯對白-戲稱阻人扑嘢死咗會俾人燒春袋&quot;&gt;李表示引《賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯》對白 戲稱「阻人扑嘢，死咗會俾人燒春袋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，12月7日的下午仍在考慮是否去安全屋，直至8月凌晨他決定不去，因當時在飲酒。李承認當時欺騙黃，聲稱自己會去安全屋。於12月8日凌晨12時，李表示：「我一陣嚟」、「等等我，好快，搞掂埋就得」，並要求黃提供地址。黃提醒李「你一陣嚟嘅時候，搭𨋢搭上兩層」。李表示不明白，但不覺得事態嚴重。黃於凌晨4時許問李：「瞓着啦，嚟未？」李回覆「擺條鎖匙喺門口先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李同時在群組表示，自己當時正「同緊啲女仔一齊」，並對黃表示「阻人」。李解釋，他為「搞笑」故引用電影《賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯》中，演員萬梓良的對白：「阻人扑嘢，死咗會俾人燒春袋。」庭上被告聞後不禁發笑。法官張慧玲問：「係阻邊個？」李回應：「嗰一幕萬梓良係講緊自己。」控方其後亦補充：「中英對照添嗰幕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李家田作供完畢，案件明（18日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（16日）踏入第54日審訊。被告李家田接受控方大律師周凱靈盤問。對話紀錄顯示黃振強曾稱「今晚試，副眼鏡唔知清唔清」。李解釋以其理解，眼鏡代表槍，黃當時打算去試槍，但可以是指「氣槍」。控方追問：「你覺得試水槍？豆槍？射唔到嘅槍？」李回應：「有諗過，可能裝易燃液體。」另外，李一度忘記控方的問題，遭控方質疑：「警方人員又打又水刑，你話擔心阿媽安危，佢哋（警方）講嘅嘢你記得，我問你嘅嘢你唔記得？」李回應：「係，因為你未打我。」控方遂表示「放心」並問：「即係打你，你先記得？」李回答：「如果你經歷過會明白。你冇經歷過，嗰刻係性命攸關。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱部分示威者如童子軍在場揸住雞毛當令箭&quot;&gt;李家田稱部分示威者如「童子軍」在場「揸住雞毛當令箭」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第七日作供，接受控方代表大律師周凱靈盤問。控方問及李在 Telegram「滅龍」群組內發出的訊息。於2019年11月14日，「屠龍」成員梁政希表示「荃灣好多南亞」，嚴文謙則回應「宣戰二陂坊」，梁再表示「唔理，掃晒」。李家田則回應「喺荃灣插支旗」。李解釋，他與成員是在「吹水」，最後沒有發生任何事情。被問及「插旗」的意思，李表示不懂解釋，控方追問：「係咪即係『屠龍』喺荃灣立一個聲譽？」李表示同意。他亦同意法官張慧玲所指，目的是宣示在某地方有勢力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，自己於11月14日仍身處中文大學，他在凌晨時分在群組表示：「中大等成日，狗影都冇」、「你哋走咗之後，變咗啲童子軍帶」。李昨解釋，「童子軍」意指行為較愚蠢的示威者，包括在對峙期間拿床褥抵擋。控方追問：「佢哋嘅武力程度好幼稚？」李不同意，並解釋示威者不需要拿床褥抵擋，因現場有其他物品如壁報板。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，有成員傳送用丫叉發射燃燒物體的片段，李回應「呢舊嘢10次得2次過十米」。他解釋，曾在中大見過有人使用類似武器，因此作出評論，認為該武器作用不大。李亦曾表示「呢咋童子軍唔識射，佢哋串」。控方追問：「係咪你去教佢哋，佢哋唔接受？」李不同意，並向控方解釋：「好似你唔信我講嘢咁。」張官追問示威者的表現如何令李感覺「串」；他解釋對方「揸住雞毛當令箭」，例如向其他示威者下指令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又發訊息表示「前排啲友仲串，當正自己大佬咁講嘢」。他解釋，部分示威者「代入自己係領導者角色咁講嘢」，但當時示威並無「大台」。李表示，在中大逗留兩日期間並無與任何人溝通，只是查問糧食或洗手間的位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李曾發訊息指黑警死全家否認把口號掛嘴邊&quot;&gt;李曾發訊息指「黑警死全家」否認把口號掛嘴邊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日傍晚，李發訊息指「黑警死全家」。他解釋，自己看完新聞後想作評論，於是套用示威者常說的口號，而口號是「鬧緊啲警察」。控方質疑：「咁多口號唔用，用呢個？」李表示自己關心與警察相關的問題。控方追問：「呢個係唯一關於警方嘅口號？」李回答：「而家唔記得仲有冇其他關於警察嘅口號。」控方續問：「點解揀呢句？」李表示：「順口。」控方最後問：「你經常掛在口中？」李不同意。其後，有成員發送「屠龍小隊圍爐談 籲港人覺醒」報道的連結。李表示不知道內容是否屬實，亦無考究真假，因覺得沒有需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至11月15日凌晨3時，李發訊息指「學生會騎咗，無了」。李解釋自己經已離開中大，並從網上消息得知中大二橋的示威者選擇撤離，而學生會發出撤離聲明，因此認為學生會「騎劫」了行動並「攞彩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被控方質疑記得被警打細節卻忘記問題-李因為你未打我&quot;&gt;被控方質疑記得被警打細節卻忘記問題 李：因為你未打我&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，李轉載香港大學聘請保安的資訊，並附上自己的評論，稱「呢個順便守HKU，正喎」。控方問：「你覺得要搵社運人士入去做保安？」李表示討論區文章標題已提及「有冇手足可以幫手」。李之後忘記控方的問題，控方卻質疑：「警方人員又打又水刑，你話擔心阿媽安危，佢哋（警方）講嘅嘢你記得，我問你嘅嘢你唔記得？」李回應：「係，因為你未打我。」控方遂表示「放心」，並問：「即係打你，你先記得？」李回答：「如果你經歷過會明白。你冇經歷過，嗰刻係性命攸關。」張官協助問：「係咪打你先記得？因為畀人打，監你去記就記得？」李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又強調，自己只是作出評論而非建議，他認為做保安既可以賺錢，亦可以守衛港大。控方不斷問及李認為「正」的原因，張官遂表示：「大家都明大學發生咩事，無謂兜兜轉轉，手足去做冇理由唔破壞？」李不同意並指：「可以唔破壞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示即使痾血仍前往理大及行山&quot;&gt;李表示即使「痾血」仍前往理大及「行山」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於15日下午約1時，張銘裕發訊息問李：「仲有冇嚟M？」，李表示「仲有」。李解釋自己正「痾血」兩至三日。張亦表示自己「嚟咗5日」、「好似停唔到咁」，又一度表示擔心失血過多，李則回應「好燥呀而家，要發脾氣了」。控方問：「你有冇睇醫生？」李表示沒有。其後李發訊息，表示「放料話中大入口放咗菠蘿，引狗入去炸佢哋」，他於晚上又稱「我喺 Poly 添，好似仆街了」。控方質疑：「你痾緊血都去咗 Poly？」李確認自己於15日晚上已身處理大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至11月16日下午2時，黃振強問：「你唔係行山咩？」，李回覆「今晚行」，黃再表示「記得報平安」。被問及為何要報平安，李表示：「可能係溫馨提示。」控方再質疑：「你行程緊密，喺中大三日兩夜，出嚟痾血，15號去 Poly，夜晚仲要去行夜山？」李同意。控方追問：「痾血都辛苦？」李解釋是大便有血。控方再問：「都係唔舒服？除非你話畀我聽好舒服？」李同意是「唔舒服」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李可不去行山-毋須唯命是從&quot;&gt;控方質疑李可不去行山 毋須唯命是從&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，既然李當時認為行夜山是「童軍行山」性質，那是否「可去可不去」。李同意，但沒有向黃振強建議找其他人代去。李早前稱，為免失去黃提供的資助，故答應陪他行山。控方追問，既然李得知黃因在中大受傷未能去行山，並由張銘裕頂上，李是否有沒有必要唯命是從，可以有更大的理由要求換人。李不同意，因當初是黃著他去行山，故他會繼續參與。控方亦質疑，李聲稱要到理大搜集資料，為何他卻去行山；李對此不同意。李又曾發訊息指：「迫出老解」，他解釋僅說笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示不知成員試甚麼槍-以為是水槍&quot;&gt;李表示不知成員試甚麼槍 以為是水槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強同日稱「今晚試，副眼鏡唔知清唔清」。李解釋以其理解，黃因要去試槍而未能行山。控方質疑為何發生如此「大事」，李卻沒有向對方查問。李解釋試槍可以指「氣槍」。控方問：「試水槍？豆槍？射唔到嘅槍？」李解釋：「有諗過，可能裝易燃液體。」惟控方質疑李不知就裏卻搭話：「我想鍍金落鏡框」，又指有人曾提及「滅聲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示為免成員知道自己身處理大-故訛稱會參與開會&quot;&gt;李表示為免成員知道自己身處理大 故訛稱會參與開會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李曾表示自己正「行山」，中途被要求站遠點，期間聽不到槍聲或爆炸聲。他否認控方所指，因不想碰槍械而沒有向同行者過問。11月17日凌晨，黃提議晚上開會。李稱自己在行山後返回理大，並說笑提議晚上到「藍店」麥當勞開會。成員在群組「Tag」李，並指「噚日行山嗰兩個一定要到」。李表示，黃曾勸隊員不要前往理大，因此隊員均不知道他身處理大。李於是隨口說自己「好快到」，以「氹住佢哋先」。李其後表示：「到我塞緊」，表達未能到場的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑無人問李退出群組原因-他解釋可能佢哋覺得我唔重要&quot;&gt;控方質疑無人問李退出群組原因 他解釋「可能佢哋覺得我唔重要」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，其後群組長達一小時沒有人發言，因此質疑：「喺紀錄入面都算創舉？你覺唔覺得奇怪？」李表示不感奇怪。最後李發現自己未能離開理大，因此於晚上10時多離開群組。控方問：「覺唔覺得奇怪，冇人問你咩事？點解你冇到？」李表示：「我有唔開心⋯⋯可能因為佢哋覺得我唔重要，我覺得唔奇怪。」控方指出，實際上李有出席在大鴻輝的飯局，期間成員得知李會前往理大，因此沒人問他離開群組的原因；李不同意。控方追問：「因為你可有可無？你有冇問？」李回應：「我冇咁矯情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強其後指「有冇人可以 Keep 眼鏡？阿檸出唔到嚟」。李解釋黃猜到他身處理大。控方質疑：「你隻字不提，佢哋估到你喺入面出唔到嚟？」李同意。於11月18日晚上8時，嚴文謙問「檸走唔走到？」，Kan 表示「走到，啱啱走到，游繩」。李卻表示自己並非游繩。直至20日，李要求 Kan 將他加回群組。李表示自己沒有翻看早前的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（17日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;
