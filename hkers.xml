While the two countries enjoy a near-unbreakable bilateral relationship and close political ties, there has been an ongoing intelligence war between the two since the Islamic Revolution in Tehran.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few days have seen global headlines focused on the tit-for-tat airstrikes between Iran and Pakistan. There has been speculation about an Iranian escalation and a wider Middle Eastern conflict that might suck in the Pakistani military. To be clear, no such scenario is on the cards. Iran and Pakistan are already deescalating, with both sides stating a lack of interest in harming their “brotherly ties”. However, a clear violation has been committed by both countries, initiated by Iran, and there is historical bad blood when it comes to the Baluch border, with both sides backing each other’s respective proxies. Friction between the two countries has also been raised by competition for control and influence in Afghanistan, overt Pakistani support for Azerbaijan, and Iran’s recruitment of Shia fighters from Pakistan to fight in the Middle East. While the two have not engaged directly in open conflict in the Middle East, there have been numerous irregular small wars between Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-shahs-steadying-hand-to-support-a-young-pakistani-state&quot;&gt;The Shah’s Steadying Hand to Support a Young Pakistani State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long before 1979, the Shah of Iran had been one of Pakistan’s foremost backers against a much larger India. Indeed, the Shah even threatened to attack India if it went beyond its remit when it came to attacking East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1971. The Shah along with Jordan and Syria were the only countries in the Islamic world that helped Pakistan with military hardware, intelligence and logistics. All of this is described in some detail in a lucid account by the Shah’s chief courtier, Assadollah Alam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Baluchistan, which has seen numerous insurgencies sponsored by India and Afghanistan, was always a sore point for the Shah. Iranian jets and military helicopters used to be based in Pakistan while hunting Baluch and Afghan insurgents on both sides of the Iran–Pakistan border. The Shah also repeatedly batted for Pakistan, convincing Nixon and Kissinger to go all the way in supporting Pakistan against the Indians in the 1971 war. In fact, Kissinger’s first trip to Pakistan was to study the Baluch insurgency and its impact on US–Persian Gulf security relations. Both Roham Alvandi’s Nixon, Kissinger and the Shah and Alex Vatanka’s Iran and Pakistan go into some detail about the US influence on the Pakistan–Iran joint strategy for security partnerships to protect the Persian Gulf and South Asia from Soviet designs. Baluchistan was central to the security partnership that had endured since 1947, and the Shah was resolute in protecting a young and inexperienced Pakistani state from implosion, especially after the loss of East Pakistan. However, after the ousting of the Shah by Islamic hardliners in 1979, the ebb and flow between Iran and Pakistan began to change for the worse, with an increasing hostility between the two and the convergence over Baluchistan becoming a divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tehrans-export-of-its-revolution-and-changing-tides&quot;&gt;Tehran’s Export of Its Revolution and Changing Tides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the early years of the Iranian revolution, the two sides continued to maintain close relations and to cooperate on security issues. Pakistan was pivotal in ending the Iran–Iraq war, with former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani mentioning in his memoirs that along with Syria, Pakistan played a key role as an arbitrator between Tehran and the Saudi-backed coalition led by Saddam Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, ties began to worsen after the Soviets left Afghanistan in 1989, as various proxies in the country began to aim their guns at each other. Iran favoured the Shia-dominated warring parties, while the Saudis and Pakistan backed the Sunnis. Before the emergence of the Taliban, the Iranians had already begun to support Shia groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan to challenge a growing Saudi madrassa movement which had been spawned by the Afghan war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1990s and early 2000s also saw a peak in the power and strength of Saudi-funded groups in Pakistan, culminating in multiple bombings and the targeting of Shia mosques and prominent Shia figures. The Iranian consulate in Peshawar was attacked twice, and a senior diplomat was also kidnapped in the same city in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A clear violation has been committed by both countries, initiated by Iran, and there is historical bad blood when it comes to the Baluch border, with both sides backing each other’s respective proxies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the use of proxies was a two-way street, and Tehran allegedly had a hand in attacking the Saudi consulate in Karachi. The Pakistanis had not been comfortable with the Iranian-Indian alliance in Afghanistan, which was seen as a direct attempt to undermine both Baluchistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Iran’s cooperation with India over the port of Chabahar (bypassing Pakistan) is also seen by Pakistan as a threat to its own port of Gwadar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Pakistani Shia fighters in Syria and Iraq was another red line that  crossed by Iran. This took the competition firmly into the sectarian realm, with the risk that thousands of battle-hardened Shia would return to cause havoc in Pakistan, and has upset the status quo in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2020, Javad Zarif, the then Iranian foreign minister, said that Shia fighters could be used to stabilise Afghanistan and Pakistan. This caused considerable anger in both countries, but showed the Iranian desire to dominate by using proxies to fight local civil wars and to provoke ethnic and sectarian strife. The Saudis have also shown an increasing mistrust of Iranian involvement and influence in domestic Pakistani politics that has bordered on purely sectarian lines. Further evidence of this emerged when one of the former president’s right-hand men confessed to spying on the Pakistani military on behalf of the Iranians, with political cover provided by a party the Saudis had always suspected of being pro-Iranian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-india-factor-and-super-spies&quot;&gt;The India Factor and Super Spies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the new Afghan Republic also pulled closer to India and Iran when it came to trying to isolate Pakistani influence in Afghanistan. In contrast to the Shah’s time when Iran ensured that India kept out of Baluchistan and Afghanistan, Tehran now welcomed India in both Afghanistan and Baluchistan owing to its desire to weaken the Pakistanis’ grip over Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of the Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, captured in Iran by the ISI, has led many in Pakistan to suspect that the Iranians have tolerated Indian spies in sensitive Baluch areas, thereby confirming an Iran–India partnership to trap Pakistan. However, the Indians firmly believed that the ISI had used its own Baluch agents to capture Jadhav deep inside Iranian territory. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made no secret of his desire to raise the temperature in Baluchistan to test Pakistani defences and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular film Kandahar, released last year, portrays a four-way battle on the Iran–Afghanistan–Pakistan border between Pakistani, Indian, US and Iranian intelligence agencies to solidify gains in the Afghan endgame. The Great Game for control of Central Asia has now morphed into an all-out battle between regional players in Afghanistan, as opposed to the Russians and the British of the 19th century. India has even moved into Kabul and established friendly relations with the Taliban, in stark contrast to its entrenched enmity with the group in the 1990s. Iran and India have both cornered Pakistan by doing a U-turn on their ties with the Taliban, ensuring that the ISI can no longer use the group against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geopolitics-trumps-sectarianism&quot;&gt;Geopolitics Trumps Sectarianism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the use of significant sectarian elements by both sides in the pursuit of strategic and tactical intelligence wins, this fight is by and large about power and influence, from Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan all the way to the Caucasus. Pakistan has closely supported Shia-majority Azerbaijan in its fight against Iranian-backed Armenia. Moreover, Pakistan has had multiple Shia Chiefs of Army Staff and a significant number of Shia generals, and so it is clear that in their military calculus, there is no room for sectarian-influenced decisions. Wajahat S Khan of the Atlantic Council, Pakistan’s foremost defence journalist, also believes that Iran and Pakistan are engaged in extensive geopolitical competition in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Notwithstanding the use of significant sectarian elements by both sides, this fight is by and large about power and influence, from Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan all the way to the Caucasus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in contrast to an almost war-like situation with the Taliban in the 1990s, Tehran is now heavily embedded in the Taliban’s return to power despite the group’s heavy Sunni tilt, with little or no room for Shia minorities in its leadership. The Iranians began recalibrating their previous animosity towards the Taliban by hosting senior Taliban and Al-Qa’ida leaders who were on the run. A lot of this was done out of necessity in order to balance against the Pakistanis and to widen mistrust between Pakistan and the US during their joint quest for an amicable balance of power in 2021. The killing of the Taliban leader Mullah Mansour in 2016 in a drone strike was viewed with suspicion by the Pakistani military, given that Mansour had just crossed the border from Iran into Pakistan. Pakistan alleged that Iran and the US had colluded in making Pakistan the fall guy once again, when in fact the Taliban were now also being supported fully by Tehran. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, another former Sunni strongman in Afghanistan who was previously a favourite of Pakistan’s, subsequently fled to Iran and became its ally against the US. Iran and Pakistan both used him against each other, with his presence in Kabul after his return during Ashraf Ghani’s government making him a major asset in the ongoing intelligence war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major General Sahibzada Isfandiyar Pataudi (Retired), a former Director General of the ISI, told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There has been an intelligence failure in Iran that has caused a disproportionate response and a violent lashing out in all directions – particularly so in Pakistan’s case – which has been immature and unnecessary. I would not put a sectarian twist on it, nor would I suggest a Cold War-type situation. I do believe, however, believe that Pakistan’s measured response shows our resolve to deal with any violation of our sovereignty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries have already restored their diplomatic channels, and their ambassadors will be returning to each other’s capitals very soon. There will not be a further escalation. However, from Karachi to Baluchistan and all the way to the Caucasus, both are waging a covert war for influence and leverage against each other in the modern-day Great Game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;4.28反送中遊行前夕報導林榮基彭定康 張劍虹：黎智英冀催谷上街人數&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：感覺黎智英會晤美國官員後「幾雀躍」 編採政策轉趨「偏激」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第13日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方在庭上展示多則 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示黎智英在2019年4月28日反送中遊行前夕，先後指示張劍虹訪問前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基和報導彭定康對《逃犯條例》修訂的評論，希望「催谷」遊行人數。同年7月，《蘋果》推行付費訂閱，首階段向每名讀者收取3元的訂閱手續費，張提議把其中1元撥出來作為抗爭者的訴訟費和醫療費，後來因為民陣成立一個支援反送中抗爭者基金，黎便指示把款項捐給民陣基金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英指示訪問林榮基-以催谷428反送中遊行&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英指示訪問林榮基 以催谷4.28反送中遊行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就黎智英向張劍虹下達的編採指示，控方指黎於2019年4月以 WhatsApp 指示一名叫「廖兄」的同事：「我們會用林榮基的新聞催谷廿八號大遊行，但要做頭條必須有林的電話訪問，請與林聯絡促成此事。謝謝。黎」，而相關訊息其後轉發給張。張解釋林榮基是前銅鑼灣書店店長，因在國內被人拘留一段時間，回港後連同律師何俊仁召開記者會講述事件，此後便沒有再返回國內，故在國內被通緝。林其後移居台灣，因此張請當地的《蘋果》同事嘗試聯絡林，並回覆黎稱「老闆，我已經請台灣同事處理」。黎回覆「很好，謝謝」，之後再傳送另一個訊息「衷心感謝」。以張的理解，黎是「希望利用《蘋果日報》的頭條來谷28號的大遊行人數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹按黎指示訪問林榮基-遊行前一日頭版報導&quot;&gt;張劍虹按黎指示訪問林榮基 遊行前一日頭版報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，由於當時他正在台灣公幹，而同事大概知道林身處某一間書店，所以便與台灣《蘋果》的攝影師一同前往尋找林。完成訪問後，張向黎報告「老闆，已經完成訪問了」，其後撰寫報導，然後把稿件分別傳送給香港和台灣的《蘋果》同事。其中香港的同事即時任總編輯羅偉光，讓他可先行以網上新聞形式發布。至於實體報紙，張跟時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏聯絡，轉達黎智英想以此新聞作為頭版，「就催谷跟住禮拜日嘅遊行，我就請佢（陳）去做A1。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月27日的《蘋果日報》頭版，標題為「林榮基流亡台灣 臨別呼籲 守護香港明日上街」。報導首段提到：「《逃犯條例》修訂殺到埋身，因偷運禁書被中國公安部追緝的前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基為了不想成為逃犯，只好選擇逃命。他在佔中九子被判刑翌日隻身出走到台灣，投奔免於恐懼的自由。要永遠離開土生土長之地，他雖然難過，但痛心香港已淪陷，期望「香港人唔好詐瞓」，為了自己及下一代，每個人都要盡一己責任，上街反對《逃犯條例》惡法。」張解釋稱，林在訪問中以過來人身份，講述被壓迫要離開香港的經歷，並呼籲市民上街。而4月28日「反送中遊行」的確有舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎未覺滿意-繼而指示報導彭定康&quot;&gt;張指黎未覺滿意 繼而指示報導彭定康&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;遊行前一日，黎向張傳送訊息，稱林榮基的報導對催谷遊行有幫助，但認為氣氛仍然「未夠熾熱」，希望催谷更多人參與翌日的遊行，「俾我感覺係，佢未夠滿意。」黎又轉發數個訊息給張，顯示黎邀請「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）訪問前港督彭定康，以得到其對於《逃犯條例》的評語。之後羅傑斯回覆黎，他本人身在雅加達，而彭定康則在法國，會嘗試透過電話做訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭定康後來以訊息回覆，稱修例對於填補制度漏洞並不重要，反而它侵害香港的價值和繁榮穩定，對於香港的營商環境帶來恐懼和不確定性。政治活動亦陷入險境。彭定康又稱修例直接衝擊法治制度下的一國兩制和香港自治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱黎希望《蘋果》能報導彭定康上述評語，並在網上新聞及翌日報紙盡快刊登。張遂向同事轉達黎的指示，最終報導在4月27日刊於《蘋果》網站，並於4月28日刊於實體報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英眼睛有問題-難以閱讀屏幕訊息內容&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英眼睛有問題 難以閱讀屏幕訊息內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休之前，辯方代表、大律師關文渭指黎智英因眼睛有問題，所以在被告欄內透過庭上電視屏幕閱讀涉案訊息時有困難，只能依靠聆聽證人讀出相關訊息內容。關又透露黎的眼睛曾做過手術，未知何時將會做下一次手術。控方遂表示會放大相關訊息方便黎閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再次開庭後，關指懲教人員已安排黎坐在被告欄第一排，但這仍未足夠，經辯方與懲教、法庭職員和控方商討後，各方同意安排把一個電子屏幕搬到被告欄內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎智英指示印製反送中長幡-隨報附送&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎智英指示印製「反送中」長幡 隨報附送&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎於2019年6月13日指示張，指「星期日遊行泛民想我們印十萬張長幡35寸長15寸闊，派給遊行人士，給他們從家裹的窗口放出來」。張指因6月16日有反送中遊行，黎希望張以毛筆字寫「反送中」，然後印製十萬張長幡，隨報附送，讓市民遊行期間可以拿著該長幡。庭上展示長幡樣本，其中一張以黃色做底色，除了有黑色字「反送中」之外，還有「罷工、罷課、罷市」，張解釋當時職工盟正在策劃罷工，所以黎希望寫上「三罷」字眼以作宣傳。張指由於《逃犯條例》修訂暫緩，及後有人自殺，泛民人士如李卓人建議不要派發長幡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張提議三分一訂閱手續費支援抗者-獲黎同意&quot;&gt;張提議三分一訂閱手續費支援抗者 獲黎同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方之後展示2019年6月15日的 WhatsApp 訊息，張建議「就今次出來抗爭的人日後療傷和訴訟，我們可以在三元手續費撥一元出來成立基金協助」。黎則回覆：「非常好idea！」張解釋，由2019年4月1日起，黎決定推行「免費訂閱」，讀者只要登記做會員，便可免費閱讀《蘋果》網站新聞；同年7月1日起至9月1日期間，《蘋果日報》需向每人收取3元手續費，讀者才能看到網站新聞；直至9月1日起，《蘋果》開始正式收取訂閱費用，即每日1.68元。黎認為，將3元手續費之中的1元撥出來作為示威者的訴訟費和醫療費，可以鼓勵支持抗爭運動的人訂閱《蘋果》。後來黎指民陣已成立一個「支援反送中抗爭者基金」，指示「我們的錢可以給他們運用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月5日，張劍虹向黎報告指付費人數突破30萬人，並會按照黎的指示，請會計部同事以《蘋果日報》名義簽發支票，向民陣的基金捐款30萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第13日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。他稱黎於2019年7月赴美會見時任副總統彭斯和時任國務卿等官員，事後感覺到黎「幾雀躍」，並指示張報導訪美一事及「做大佢」。張憶述後來在言談之間，覺得黎「講制裁係多咗」，《蘋果日報》的編採政策亦轉趨「偏激」，例如「對成個運動比較暴力場合，同埋激進嘅場面，都會照報導、同情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹感覺黎對會見官員感到幾雀躍&quot;&gt;張劍虹：感覺黎對會見官員感到「幾雀躍」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一則由美國國務院前顧問 Christian Whiton 發送給前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 的訊息，載有《彭博新聞》的報導連結，標題為「Trump Team Sends Defiant Signal to Beijing by Meeting Activists」，內容講述黎智英赴美國會見官員。黎於2019年7月11日將該訊息轉發給張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱以他所知，黎的確於2019年7月赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧和美國國家安全顧問 John Bolton，該次旅程結束後相隔一段時間，黎與張才有機會就旅程談話，張感覺到黎對會見官員感到「幾雀躍」，認為對反送中運動有幫助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英出席網上節目談制裁-事後指示張劍虹報導及做大佢&quot;&gt;黎智英出席網上節目談制裁 事後指示張劍虹報導及「做大佢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示一則《蘋果》報導，內容提及黎智英出席何俊仁主持的網上節目「細說中南海」，當中黎談及與蓬佩奧會面，蓬佩奧問黎：「美國可以怎樣做？」黎則回答美國可以實施制裁，讓中國官員知道其所作所為會有後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張供稱，黎出席節目後，吩咐他報導節目內容及「做大佢」，包括較詳盡篇幅、擺在較顯眼位置和安排推播通知（push notifications）。張遂通知時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光，著他跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在張的記憶中，黎在訪美之前，曾經在私下談話間提及制裁官員，「等佢哋唔敢亂嚟」，但是首次公開談論制裁則是在「細說中南海」節目裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎訪美後多談制裁-蘋果編採政策轉趨偏激&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎訪美後多談制裁 蘋果編採政策轉趨偏激&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，黎會見美國官員一事，有否影響到《蘋果日報》的編採政策。張則指，當時人們覺得「黎生原來可以去到白宮見到啲咁勁嘅官員」，並把香港的情況告知美國官員，張形容「好似有啲 high 咁囉，原來真係可以去到白宮㗎」，又指事件令人們認為「個運動好似⋯⋯啫係有希望咁囉」。張表示，後來與黎言談之間，「覺得佢（黎）講制裁係多咗囉。」他又指，《蘋果日報》的編採政策「後來愈來愈激烈，啫係偏激咁囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「偏激」的意思，張劍虹指黎在飯盒會及二人見面的場合裡，曾說過「示威抗爭、和勇唔好畀佢哋分化」的言論，「佢又會提到『抗爭會係長期性』咁囉」，「《蘋果日報》就會因為咁樣，而對成個運動比較暴力場合，同埋激進嘅場面，都會照報導、同情，啫（認為）係個政府同中共逼成咁嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎冀藉訪問抗爭者激起同情及抗爭情緒&quot;&gt;張表示黎冀藉訪問抗爭者激起「同情」及「抗爭情緒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹稱，黎智英曾經在台灣舉行的「飯盒會」上，吩咐台灣及香港《蘋果》增加「訪談節目（video talk）」的數目，由每星期4次增至40次。訪談節目需要找「泛民反對派有代表性嘅人」或「抗爭者」作為拍攝對象。張在回港後有跟進上述事件，而黎亦有與張討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，他們會找「抗爭者」講述為何出來抗爭，以及他們的經歷和苦況，張相信黎希望藉此「激起啲人對抗爭者嘅同情，同埋抗爭情緒」。但由於很多「抗爭者」不願出鏡，因此張建議用訪問形式拍攝，然後將片段上載至動新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示節目以泛民反對派代表或抗爭者作主題&quot;&gt;張表示節目以「泛民反對派代表」或「抗爭者」作主題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰希望了解更多關於「訪談節目」的詳情，張解釋節目時長45分鐘，通常會用「Zoom」軟件對話，由港聞組節目部同事負責，並以「泛民反對派代表」或「抗爭者」作為節目主題，有時會找他們到《蘋果》的工作室對談。張表示，曾討論過訪談節目是否最適合的方法表達上述題材。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張稱港聞組全程投入處理反修例主題節目&quot;&gt;張稱港聞組「全程投入」處理反修例主題節目&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，訪談節目是否由2019年反修例運動衍生，張回答不是。李亦問，自2019年7月至年底，訪談節目的主題是否全都與反修例及示威相關，張表示大部分均是，且「成個港聞組差唔多全程投入晒去做呢個運動」。另外，張表示負責決定訪問對象的同事需向羅偉光負責，而羅會向張報告，張最後會按照黎智英指示執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰表示自己沒有看過《蘋果》動新聞，因此問及誰人可以觀看訪談節目。張表示，付費訂閱的讀者可以觀看。他又確認，直至2019年7月初，共有30萬名訂閱者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下周二（23日）續審，下周一會給予時間張閱讀文件，但不會開放法庭予公眾。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹：黎智英指示報導陳方安生會見彭斯 「做到最大嘅效果」 翌日擺頭版&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zIeR8bv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（18日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第12日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。談到黎曾下達的指示，控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息，顯示2019年3月前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯之後，黎指示張報導及「做到最大嘅效果」。張遂把黎的指示轉達給其他同事，包括時任總編輯羅偉光和副社長陳沛敏。翌日《蘋果日報》實體報紙頭版便以〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權〉為標題。此外，黎於2020年5月指示管理層籌備英文版，形容黎「好心急英文版快啲面世」，又催促資訊科技部同事盡快設立英文版網站，因黎希望讓美國讀者「成為《蘋果日報》同美國政治嘅槓桿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹續作供黎智英好心急冀英文版盡快面世&quot;&gt;張劍虹續作供：黎智英「好心急」冀英文版盡快面世&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就《蘋果日報》英文版的成立過程，張憶述約於2020年5月中，黎智英成立了一個名為「English news」的 WhatsApp 群組，黎是群組管理員，其他群組成員包括張自己、副社長陳沛敏、總編輯羅偉光、動新聞平台總監張志偉、兩岸版的副總編輯蔣美紅、資訊科技部同事Connie Chan。而英文版主筆馮偉光亦在後來加入英文版工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，黎在 WhatsApp 群組裡開宗明義，當時「覺得係好需要成立英文版嘅時候」，遂吩咐管理層盡快成立英文版，並在群組內詳細解釋他對英文版的目標、期望和做法。黎亦指示張負責聯絡馮偉光重新入職《蘋果》，主理英文版。張遂於同年5月下旬相約馮午餐，其後馮答應6月初回來上班。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張形容，「黎生亦都好心急英文版快啲面世」，又催促資訊科技部同事盡快設立英文版網站，以及在《蘋果》的手機應用程式引入英文版頁面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹：黎智英冀英文版「走向美國」 使美讀者成為蘋果與美國政治「槓桿」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，為何黎智英認為當時是合適的時候設立英文版。張指黎曾在群組中表示，「如果外國讀者、支持香港的讀者，透過訂閱《蘋果日報》英文版，咁樣對《蘋果日報》本身嚟講都係好大幫助。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指：「黎生特別提到做呢個英文版係走向美國啦」，因他希望「讓呢啲美國讀者成為《蘋果日報》同美國政治嘅槓桿」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱黎表明英文版寫手要「偏黃」、意指「支持抗爭及逆權」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，馮偉光憑甚麼準則，揀選中文版部分文章翻譯成英文。張劍虹解釋，馮主要根據黎智英的指引，黎在英文版 WhatsApp 群組，「開宗明義」表示選擇英文版寫手的標準，就是要偏向《蘋果日報》的立場，即「偏黃」，以張的理解即是「支持抗爭、支持逆權」。張又指黎曾經吩咐不要揀選「Pro China（親中）」的文章。於是同事討論後，確認揀選出來的文章「要係啲抗爭呀、逆權呀、制裁呀」，並與「反香港政府」及「反中共」相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英專欄「成敗樂一笑」其中一篇文章，標題為〈大時代快將來臨〉，又展示該文章同時被翻譯成英文並上載至網站。張表示，文章是由馮偉光根據黎智英定下的框架自行揀選。法官李運騰問，黎智英是否不會指明揀選哪一文章，張同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎冀透過與外國前官員等有影響力人士訪談-以造成輿論&quot;&gt;張表示黎冀透過與外國前官員等有影響力人士訪談 以造成輿論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及英文網站上的節目《Live Chat with Jimmy Lai》，張確認節目成立於2020年7月9日，並為公開節目，公眾可於《蘋果》網站及其手機應用程式觀看。控方問及黎設立節目之目的，張表示黎智英希望在《國安法》生效之後，與「外國知名學者、政客和前官員」進行訪談，因「佢哋都係有影響力嘅人」，黎希望藉此「造成輿論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎會在訪談中提及香港被打壓情況-希望外國援助&quot;&gt;張指黎會在訪談中提及香港被打壓情況 希望外國援助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎會在訪談中提及香港的局勢情況，特別是《國安法》成立之後，「香港被打壓嘅情況、對於法治嘅影響、對金融中心地位嘅影響」，黎希望外國可以援助香港。張表示自己沒有親自參與製作上述節目，而時任《蘋果》動新聞平台總監張志偉則要協助將訪談片段上載至各網上平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示黎及助手mark-simon負責邀約嘉賓&quot;&gt;張表示黎及助手Mark Simon負責邀約嘉賓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，誰人負責訪談前的安排和準備工作，例如邀約嘉賓。張表示據其所知，是由黎智英及其助理 Mark Simon 自行處理，並沒有經張及《蘋果日報》其他同事處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英指示報導陳方安生會見彭斯-做到最大嘅效果&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英指示報導陳方安生會見彭斯 「做到最大嘅效果」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後在庭上展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎智英於2019年3月23日以 WhatsApp 轉發一張照片給張劍虹，顯示前政務司司長陳方安生赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯。張稱黎告知他這是很重大的新聞，並吩咐他將此新聞「做到最大嘅效果」，張之後回覆「收到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hInLWwg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎在另一個訊息中提及英國駐港澳前總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）。訊息中，郭明瀚提及已經與陳方安生傾談，指對方關注修例爭議及抵抗的需要。郭明瀚提議陳方安生應該在美國報章《The Hill》（國會山報）發表意見。陳太表示已經嘗試，但好像未能凝聚「民主」力量。張解釋，郭明瀚亦都建議黎將這個新聞做到最大效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到何謂「最大效果」，張形容意即將該新聞「做到最盡」，以他所知，同事有需要採訪陳方安生及其隨行人士，以獲得會見彭斯的內容。此外，編輯可將相關新聞擺放在《蘋果》手機應用程式的「焦點」一欄，使讀者一整天均可見到，而不會被後來的新聞替代。編輯可以決定該新聞放在「焦點」欄目為時多久，也可安排重要的新聞「推播」，使讀者收到推播通知（push notifications）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，他收到黎的訊息後，便把該些訊息轉發給時任總編輯羅偉光，又著羅盡量採訪陳太與彭斯會面的詳情及更多資料，以及將相關新聞置放在「焦點」欄目，若果採訪到新資訊便可不斷更新網上新聞，「搵到新嘅料可以再豐富佢。」張亦把黎的訊息轉發給時任副社長陳沛敏，「等佢知道黎生吩咐我哋將呢個新聞做到最大效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示翌日《蘋果日報》實體報紙頭版，題為〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權〉，照片則與黎轉發給張的照片相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第11日審訊。已認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張於1991年加入《壹週刊》，並於1994年升任為總編輯，其後於2005年離開壹傳媒集團。5年後，張接受黎的邀請重新入職，並於2016年升任為《蘋果日報》社長。張形容黎是集團的「最高領導人」及「最終決策人」，被問到何謂「黎智英的編採指示」，張指黎的形象「一直以來都好鮮明」，即追求「民主、自由、反極權」，特別是2019年反修例事件開始，黎認為要透過《蘋果日報》呼籲市民上街、示威及抗爭，並在國際層面上希望獲得西方民主國家的關注，「希望佢哋能夠提供援助，甚至一啲強烈啲嘅行動，好似制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前蘋果日報社長張劍虹循職員通道出庭&quot;&gt;前蘋果日報社長張劍虹循職員通道出庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方傳召首名證人、前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹出庭作供。張於2022年5月承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙候判。他身穿黑色西裝褸、深藍色格仔恤衫，透過法官席旁邊的職員通道進入法庭，由三名懲教人員的帶領下步行至證人台就坐。張手持聖經，以基督教儀式宣誓，其後開始以廣東話作供，一名法庭傳譯員坐在其身旁把供詞翻譯成英語。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹於1991年加入壹週刊-1994年升任總編輯&quot;&gt;張劍虹於1991年加入壹週刊 1994年升任總編輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方主問下，張確認他畢業於香港中文大學社會科學及新聞學學士學位課程。他於2021年6月17日被警方以「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪名拘捕，之後被正式起訴該罪及煽動刊物罪，同案被告包括黎智英、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光、楊清奇及3間蘋果公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認自己於2021年6月17日被捕，而控罪則提及他直至2021年6月24日仍參與本案的串謀，法官李運騰關注到，這是否指稱張在還柙的數天期間仍然有參與串謀。李官認為情況並不尋常，並要求控方澄清。周天行表示稍後會向張問及此事並澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方提問下，張先交代他在壹傳媒集團的工作經驗。他憶述於1991年加入《壹週刊》，當時任職財經組編輯。1994年，他獲黎智英委任為《壹週刊》總編輯：「因為黎生對我工作表現滿意。」張提到，雖然當時《壹週刊》社長是楊懷康，但是黎智英每日都會在辦公室工作，參與雜誌的事務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張解釋，他加入《壹週刊》時候，公司業務只有一本雜誌，後來發展出愈來愈多雜誌，包括《一本便利》。及後1995年，黎智英創立《蘋果日報》，並於1999年上市，就在那時形成了一個壹傳媒集團。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹於2005年離職-5年後黎智英邀請下重新入職&quot;&gt;張劍虹於2005年離職 5年後黎智英邀請下重新入職&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續稱，在2000年左右，黎智英決定在台灣創辦《壹週刊》，於是委派張赴台灣協助創辦雜誌。張稱在2001至2005年間，他是台灣《壹週刊》的社長，並與黎緊密合作，故有很長時間留在台灣工作，平均每週有約3日身處台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直到2005年4月，張有見台灣《壹週刊》業務已上軌道，加上開始有盈餘，所以他決定離開壹傳媒集團，「因為想趁呢個機會休息吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2010年，在黎智英的邀請下，張劍虹重新加入壹傳媒集團，任職內容顧問。約於2011年4月，黎將他調職往《蘋果日報》，擔任總編輯。在2011年4至12月期間，張根據本地報刊條例登記為《蘋果日報》的註冊編輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2016年張升任蘋果日報社長-相信因獲黎欣賞工作能力&quot;&gt;2016年張升任蘋果日報社長 相信因獲黎欣賞工作能力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱他於2014年12月起擔任《蘋果日報》副社長一段時間。至2016年左右，他獲黎智英升任為社長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到張知不知道為何黎決定將他升職。法官李運騰一度打斷，質疑此問題與案件無關，控方則稱可以顯示黎與張之間的關係。張遂回答，相信是因為黎欣賞他的工作能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續稱，他作為《蘋果日報》的社長，會負責整個《蘋果日報》的營運和確保報紙每日出版。被問到社長與總編輯之間在職務上的分別，張解釋總編輯負責每日登報文章的審批及決策，而決策包括新聞選材、角度及決定哪一宗新聞做頭條；而社長則負責較高層面的監督工作，包括確保報紙的出版及運作，以及確保編採方針符合黎智英的政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017年，張獲黎委任為壹傳媒有限公司，即整個壹傳媒集團的副行政總裁。2018年2月，張繼而獲委任為集團的行政總裁、執行董事，以及集團旗下公司的董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹指黎智英為壹傳媒的最高領導人及最終決策人&quot;&gt;張劍虹指黎智英為壹傳媒的「最高領導人」及「最終決策人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向張展示壹傳媒集團的2019至2020年度的年報，封面寫有「Witness History」字眼，年報內容包括主席黎智英的話、公司的業務分佈、香港及台灣《蘋果日報》的出版業務等。控方續展示列出董事局成員的頁面，張確認直至2020年3月31日，董事局共有7名成員，包括2名執行董事、2名非執行董事，以及3名獨立非執行董事。直至同年5月25日，董事局成員的組合有變，改為3名執行董事、1名非執行董事，以及3名獨立非執行董事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;年報中列出黎智英為主席，張劍虹則為行政總裁。張確認黎於2018至2020年均任主席。控方問及兩人的職務有何分別，張表示：「黎生作為主席，係成個集團嘅最高領導人同最終決策人」，「我自己作為行政總裁，負責執行黎生同董事局嘅指示。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指3名非執行董事包括華爾街日報前社長南華早報前總編輯&quot;&gt;張指3名非執行董事包括《華爾街日報》前社長、《南華早報》前總編輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續解釋該3名執行董事，分別為黎智英、他自己以及周達權。他指周為財政營運總裁，負責的範疇包括行政、公司秘書、廣告以及管理印刷廠。至於1名非執行董事為葉一堅，他為台灣《蘋果日報》的顧問，亦負責監督董事會。另外，3名獨立非執行董事分別為：《華爾街日報》前社長 Louis Gordon Crovitz、《南華早報》前總編輯 Mark Lambert Clifford，及專業會計師 Lam Chung Yan, Eric。3人均負責監察董事局的運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎智英曾任非執行董事-期間仍積極參與集團決策及運作&quot;&gt;張指黎智英曾任非執行董事 期間仍積極參與集團決策及運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張確認黎智英於2018年2月至2020年5月25日期間，為集團的非執行董事；但於2020年5月25日後，他恢復為執行董事。控方追問原因，張表示不清楚記得原因，但補充指：「不過我自己覺得，雖然佢自2018年2月到2020年月係非執行董事，但係佢都好積極參與成個集團嘅決策同運作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示副社長陳沛敏負責每天揀選蘋果日報頭版新聞&quot;&gt;張表示副社長陳沛敏負責每天揀選《蘋果日報》頭版新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及壹傳媒集團的高層，張表示陳沛敏於2019年4月至2021年6月為副社長，主要職責是負責《蘋果日報》紙媒的決策，以及每日揀選《蘋果日報》的頭版新聞、港聞各版的頭條，同時亦負責審批各部門的開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張表示總編輯羅偉光負責網站新聞管理編採部同事&quot;&gt;張表示總編輯羅偉光負責網站新聞、管理編採部同事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，羅偉光則任總編輯，主要負責《蘋果日報》網站的中文新聞出版，以及管理港聞版編採部同事。張表示理論上羅應該同時紙媒稿件的審批工作，但由於2019至2021年公司集中於網上新聞，而網上新聞需要24小時運作，因此張把紙媒工作交由陳沛敏負責。張表示陳的職位較羅高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於執行總編輯林文宗則為陳沛敏的助手，於陳休假時會協助處理審批紙媒的職務，包括跟進執行編採會議中陳給予員工的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一執行總編輯馮偉光，自2020年6月起負責《蘋果日報》的網上英文版，並會在每天的紙媒或網上稿件中，選取某些翻譯成英文。他亦負責管理外判翻譯團隊，並聯繫專門為英文版寫稿的寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指黎智英會透過-mark-simon-等介紹英文版寫手&quot;&gt;張指黎智英會透過 Mark Simon 等介紹英文版寫手&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，馮需否向任何人索取指示，張表示馮會自行決定揀選甚麼稿件翻譯，有需要時馮會問他。他補充，雖然架構上馮應該向羅偉光負責，「但係多數有關於呢樣嘢，佢都會搵我嘅。」控方追問馮需否向其他人索取指示；張解釋黎智英原本已經好清楚指示英文版的編採運作，黎亦會透過 Mark Simon 及 Mark Clifford 介紹寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，馮亦以筆名「盧峯」在專欄「蘋論」撰寫政治評論，他尚未負責英文版職務時，每周會撰寫兩篇社評，但於擔任上述職位後，黎智英認為他應該減少寫社評，於是改為每周一篇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張志偉則為蘋果動新聞平台總監，負責動新聞製作，以及網上非新聞類的內容，包括娛樂、副刊、馬經及波經。他同時負責《蘋果》旗下的社交媒體帳戶，包括 Facebook、Instagram、Twitter、YouTube、PSCP.TV，以及網上直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，楊清奇為《蘋果日報》主筆，會以筆名「李平」撰寫社評，同時負責管理紙媒及網上的評論文章，需要審批稿件及聯絡作者，邀請對方寫稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張指楊清奇按黎的編採指示審批文章-形容黎追求民主自由反極權&quot;&gt;張指楊清奇按黎的編採指示審批文章 形容黎追求民主自由反極權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問張是否知道楊審批的準則，張表示楊會「按住黎智英定下嘅編採同評論政策」，即其編採指示審批文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到何謂「黎智英的編採指示」，張回答指黎的形象「一直以來都好鮮明」，即追求「民主、自由，同埋反極權」，特別是2019年反修例事件開始，黎智英認為政府對香港的民主自由存在打壓，並認為要透過《蘋果日報》去呼籲市民上街、示威及抗爭，以向政府施壓。此外，在國際層面上，黎希望獲得西方民主國家的關注，「希望佢哋能夠提供援助，甚至一啲強烈啲嘅行動，好似制裁。」張又指，上述《蘋果日報》高層的職位均由黎指派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告黎智英（76歲）否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」及兩項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第11日審訊。控方傳召認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。張提到，黎智英透過每週召開的「飯盒會」，向《蘋果》高層下達編採方面的指示。他指由《蘋果》創刊至2014年佔中之前，《蘋果》基本上予人印象是「狗仔隊、娛樂」，後來黎投入參與佔中，自此積極制訂編採政策，因而成為了《蘋果》的分水嶺，「好似成為一間反政府、對抗中央嘅一個報紙。」2019年政府提出修訂《逃犯條例》，黎亦曾向管理層稱修例侵犯香港人的民主自由和人權，並擔心倘通過修例「傳媒都冇得做」，所以認為要透過《蘋果》呼籲市民上街抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹午休後簡述蘋果日常運作-列出各種會議&quot;&gt;張劍虹午休後簡述蘋果日常運作 列出各種會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早開始傳召首名證人、已認罪的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹出庭作供，他上午交代其在壹傳媒集團的工作經驗，下午則開始談及《蘋果日報》的日常運作。張作供期間，被告欄內的黎智英不時手執原子筆和記事本抄寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹供稱，營辦一份報紙牽涉很多新聞材料，要在當中揀選角度及決定「做幾大」，乃涉及整個《蘋果日報》的編採政策，所以他們的日常運作過程中，每天都需要召開不同會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指每日下午2時半有一個「鋤報會」，出席的同事包括陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗，以及各部門主管，會議目的是檢討當天已出版的實體報紙，審視內容、標題有何不足及需要改進的地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，每日下午3時則有一個「初會」，出席的人包括陳沛敏、林文宗、羅偉光，亦有不同部門的主管，包括突發新聞、港聞、國際、兩岸、法庭及財經等。會議由陳沛敏主持，各部門主管會匯報當天有哪些新聞發生，而陳則會從中揀選一些新聞，指示同事如何繼續跟進及「做詳細啲、豐富啲」。張又指，上述牽涉《蘋果日報》的編採政策，由管理層按照黎智英的指示而訂立。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，每日下午大概5時至5時半有一個「編前會」，主要決定翌日出版的實體報紙頭版，以及港聞版每頁的頭條。出席者包括陳沛敏和林文宗，但張不肯定羅偉光是否出席者之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，《蘋果日報》逢周二都會舉辦一次「Planning 會」，出席者包括陳沛敏、林文宗、羅偉光及各部門主管，由陳主持會議。各部門主管會報告手上有什麼新聞材料及正在跟進什麼專題，而陳、林和羅會向一眾部門主管下達黎智英的指示，包括有哪些「故仔」可以跟進、吩咐他們如何準備。此外，《蘋果》主筆楊清奇會報告星期六的論壇版會有什麼專題，同樣是按照黎的立場而定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張表示，他通常不會出席上述會議，而據他所知，黎智英亦沒有出席這些會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱黎智英透過飯盒會下達編採指示&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱黎智英透過「飯盒會」下達編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎智英如何下達編採方面的指示，張劍虹指會透過召開「飯盒會」。每逢星期四，黎會輪流與《蘋果日報》、《壹週刊》、《飲食男女》、廣告部等舉行「飯盒會」，例如今個星期與《蘋果日報》團隊開會，下周便會與《壹週刊》團隊開會，接著下周則是《飲食男女》團隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《蘋果日報》的「飯盒會」，張指由黎主持，其他出席者包括他自己、壹傳媒集團財務總裁周達權、資訊科技部主管Connie Chan、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗，以及陳邀請的部門主管，每次與會者人數有10至15人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張指，由於「飯盒會」逢星期四舉行，所以早於星期一或二，有意出席的同事會加入黎智英設立的聊天群組，若有任何想法或問題可在群組內提出，屆時黎會在「飯盒會」中現身解答。張指會議之前，眾人會在壹傳媒大樓的飯堂買飯盒，然後於下午12時半前往5樓的貴賓房，一邊吃飯盒一邊參與會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎在會議期間會談及對時局的看法、其政治取態，以及在當時形勢底下《蘋果日報》的編採政策，讓與會人士再下達給沒有出席會議的管理層，之後各人會各司其職。張稱黎指示他做會議記錄，另會吩咐他跟進某些工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎不只參與會議，更是制訂編採政策的角色，問張是否正確。張確認，因黎是《蘋果日報》的創辦人，也是最大股東，持有超過70%股權。張亦形容黎是《蘋果日報》的「舵手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹2014年黎智英投入佔中運動-蘋果成反政府報紙&quot;&gt;張劍虹：2014年黎智英投入佔中運動 《蘋果》成反政府報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹表示，他記得由《蘋果日報》創刊至2014年佔中運動之前，黎智英比較少參與《蘋果》的編採工作。「當時基本上好多人都認為《蘋果日報》嘅形象都係狗仔隊、娛樂」，直至2014年佔中前後，「黎生就好積極咁制訂《蘋果日報》的編採政策。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，黎當時要求用《蘋果日報》去呼籲市民爭取民主、上街抗爭，「嗰時我好記得，要推動6.22公投，啫係爭取『我要真普選』，反對白皮書吖。」（註：2014年國務院發表的《一國兩制在香港的實踐》白皮書）張提到當時有一首歌曲改編自電影《孤星淚》歌曲，《蘋果》曾找人演唱，黎亦獻唱了一、兩句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來2014年9月佔中爆發，張形容「黎生亦都好投入呢個佔中運動」，「我覺得呢件事係一個分水嶺，《蘋果日報》呢就好似成為一間反政府、對抗中央嘅一個報紙。」張指「由嗰時開始《蘋果日報》就行緊呢條路」，管理層亦跟從黎智英這個方向去經營這份報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英憂倘通過修例-傳媒都冇得做-冀透過蘋果籲上街&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英憂倘通過修例 「傳媒都冇得做」 冀透過《蘋果》籲上街&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行提及2019年的香港社會騷亂，問張事件有否影響《蘋果》的編採方向。張表示有影響，當政府宣布修訂《逃犯條例》後，黎智英會向高層說「《逃犯條例》啫係侵犯香港人嘅民主自由，同埋香港人嘅人權」，並認為「中共要透過呢個條例，將唔聽話嘅人，同中共政權嘅眼中釘送返大陸」。黎又提到「商界都好擔心」，並指若然修例通過，「傳媒都冇得做」，「所以黎生認為要透過《蘋果日報》叫啲人上街、抗爭。」在國際層面，黎亦認為要透過《蘋果》呼籲西方民主國家關注修例事件，希望他們出手對抗中央，甚至制裁香港官員，務求「等佢哋唔敢亂嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張補充，黎於2019年3至4月期間，除了在「飯盒會」談及過上述言論，亦曾在張的辦公室房間內說過相同言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹蘋論作者須經黎智英批准才能聘用&quot;&gt;張劍虹：「蘋論」作者須經黎智英批准才能聘用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於評論文章，張劍虹指黎智英同樣有下達指示，因新聞報導和評論的方針均是一致。張指《蘋果》社論一定要根據黎訂立的方向去撰寫，而刊於評論版的文章則由楊清奇負責審批。楊亦是按照黎的編採方向批核稿件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「社論」和「評論版」之間的分別，張指社論即是「蘋論」，每日均在一個專欄刊出，共有4名寫手，分別為馮偉光（筆名盧峯）、楊清奇（筆名李平）、方圓和古立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張提到，黎智英會就社論寫手人選給予建議，並會把一些寫得好及符合其方向的作者介紹給楊清奇。其中方圓乃由黎介紹，因他的文章多是批評政府和「反共」，黎認為方圓對中國共產黨熟悉，所以文章寫得好。由於社論作者必須經黎的批准才能聘用，所以從未試過社論作者不符合黎的指示的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而評論版則由不同的作者撰寫文章，內容比較多元化，不過「評論版」與「蘋論」一樣均刊載於「A疊（港聞版）」。楊清奇負責審批文章，當中部份作者由楊邀約，有的則由黎介紹，張自己也會不時介紹適合人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張稱，他在2020年曾向楊清奇建議邀約一名日本人撰寫評論文章，惟一時記不起該日本人的名字。由於該日本人曾經訪問過黎智英，二人互相認識，他的文章亦有批評政府和談及日本的政治鬥爭，所以張認為他適合在供稿予《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英專欄文章-冇人敢修改&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英專欄文章 「冇人敢修改」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎智英的專欄「成敗樂一笑」，張指它每逢星期日出版，但不是刊登於港聞的評論版，而是刊登於副刊的專欄版。他形容黎的文章「一般都係反共同批評政府」，但因為楊清奇不需負責審批副刊的專欄文章，所以不需要處理黎的專欄文章，除非黎要求其文章刊登於港聞的評論版，但這情況只發生過一、兩次。張又補充：「可以咁講，黎生嘅文係冇人敢修改。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gfsn9Fk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第10日審訊。辯方反對控方專家、香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國的兩份專家報告呈堂，因認為與本案控罪元素無關。3名《國安法》指定法官考慮控辯雙方陳詞後，認為王貴國的證供有助法庭了解美國針對中港官員而實施的措施，以及提供足夠資訊予法庭判斷相關措施是否能夠構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」，最終批准兩份專家報告呈堂。控方表示，明天將會傳召首名證人，預料主問需時一星期。據悉首名證人為前蘋果日報社長張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方反對專家報告呈堂-稱黎涉案行為與外國措施沒有因果關係&quot;&gt;辯方反對專家報告呈堂 稱黎涉案行為與外國措施沒有因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方擬引用香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國分別於2022年11月17日及2023年11月15日撰寫的兩份報告，以圖列出美國針對中港官員而實施的制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為，以及解釋相關措施的法律效力，包括影響、後果和時效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方代表、大律師關文渭則反對報告呈堂，並指它對於本案沒有足夠關聯，因黎智英的涉案行為與報告提及的外國措施之間並沒有因果關係，例如《香港人權及民主法案》於2019年下半年立法，比兩項串謀勾結外國勢力控罪時段更加早。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 辯方大律師 關文渭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則認為，當外國政府聲稱會實施制裁，並不代表相關措施構成「制裁」，法庭需要王貴國的專家證供，去判斷外國採取或立法的措施是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。李官澄清，王貴國的報告並未有評論黎智英的言論或請求，因此與黎的犯案意圖無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報告提及外國措施立法過程-辯方質疑轉移焦點&quot;&gt;報告提及外國措施立法過程 辯方質疑轉移焦點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭續指，王貴國提交的補充報告提及《香港人權及民主法案》影響香港的利益，他質疑這部份何以與措施是否「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」有關係。關又指，報告闡述外國措施的立法過程和背景，可是既然外國立法並不是因為黎智英的言行所致，這些資料僅轉移焦點（red herring），並不能協助法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則指，專家報告是否能協助到法庭，最終可交由法庭決定。法官李運騰則指，法庭需要一名專家的協助，以了解這些外國措施的法律效力和後續影響，否則難以知道它們是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。關文渭則指這與控罪元素無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行則表示，他們並非依賴王貴國的證供去證明黎的行為導致外國採取制裁措施。但控方指相關因果關係乃依賴「共犯證人」的庭上證供。控方重申王貴國的專家報告能夠協助法庭理解外國的措施是否構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官批准王貴國專家報告呈堂&quot;&gt;官批准王貴國專家報告呈堂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經休庭約一小時考慮，由法官李運騰讀出裁決，他指王貴國的專家報告與本案相關，批准呈堂。控辯雙方均不爭議王貴國是一名美國法律專家，至於報告提及美國以外的其他國家，控方則不會依賴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，兩項串謀勾結外國勢力控罪均是「串謀」請求外國實施制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為，而控方並不需要證明外國實際上有實施相關措施。若然真的有任何外國措施擬訂立或實行，那只是環境證據，協助控方證明涉案「串謀」存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指專家證供的作用在於告知法庭外國法律的內容，以及在有需要時解釋外國法院如何解讀相關法律，因此法官接納控方所指，外國法律的事實部份有待專家證供證明。法官認為王貴國的證供有助法庭了解美國針對中港官員而實施的措施，以及提供足夠資訊予法庭判斷相關措施是否能夠構成「制裁、封鎖及其他敵對行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又提到，現階段只需處理專家報告是否可以呈堂，而不需處理證據比重，至於法庭最終是否接納王貴國的證供則有待決定。假如法庭最終認為王的證供無助他們判斷，他們便不會予以考慮。基於以上，3名法官批准王的專家報告呈堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Based on interviews with ransomware victims and incident responders, this paper outlines the harms to organisations, individuals, the UK economy, national security and wider society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research reveals a wide range of harms caused by ransomware, including physical, financial, reputational, psychological and social harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out a framework of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation and their staff directly targeted by a ransomware operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation or individuals that are indirectly affected by a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; The cumulative effect of ransomware incidents on wider society, the economy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on an existing taxonomy of cyber harms, this framework will enable policymakers, practitioners and researchers to categorise more case studies on ransomware incidents and to better explain new and existing types of harm to the UK and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware is a risk for organisations of all sizes. The findings from this paper highlight that ransomware can create significant financial costs and losses for organisations, which in some cases can threaten their very existence. Ransomware can also create reputational harm for businesses that rely on continuous operations or hold very sensitive data – although customers and the general public can be more forgiving than some victims believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harms from ransomware go beyond financial and reputational costs for organisations. Interviews with victims and incident responders revealed that ransomware creates physical and psychological harms for individuals and groups, including members of staff, healthcare patients and schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can ruin lives. Incidents highlighted in this paper have caused individuals to lose their jobs, evoked feelings of shame and self-blame, extended to private and family life, and contributed to serious health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harm and cumulative effects caused by ransomware attacks have implications for wider society and national security, including supply chain disruption, a loss of trust in law enforcement, reduced faith in public services, and the normalisation of cybercrime. Ransomware also creates a strategic advantage for the hostile states harbouring the cyber-criminals who conduct such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downstream harm to individuals from ransomware is more severe when attacks encrypt IT infrastructure, rather than steal and leak data. There is no evidence from this research that the ransomware ecosystem is exploiting stolen or leaked personal data in a systemic way for fraud or other financially motivated cybercrimes. At present, exploiting stolen data for other activities is less profitable than extortion-based crime that takes away victims’ access to their systems and data. This finding may inform victim decision-making on when they should and should not consider paying a ransom demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) recently assessed that ransomware remains one of the most acute cyber threats facing the UK. In 2023 alone, companies and public bodies affected by ransomware incidents in the UK included the Royal Mail, outsourcing firm Capita and an NHS trust. In late May 2023, one cybercrime group exploited a critical software flaw within a file transfer platform (MOVEit), reportedly impacting over 60 million individuals and more than 2,600 organisations worldwide. In the UK context, this incident enabled attackers to compromise a third-party HR company, likely exposing employees’ personal data – including company IDs and national insurance numbers from organisations such as British Airways, Boots and the BBC – to organised cyber-criminals. This may have been the largest ransomware incident of 2023, with a Russian-based threat actor linked to the CL0P ransomware operation claiming responsibility and demanding ransom payments in exchange for deleting the data. It demonstrated ransomware threat actors’ ability to continue to evolve their tactics and scale their operations to affect multiple victims in one operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat from ransomware shows no signs of abating, thanks to its profitable and innovative business model, poor cyber security practices in many organisations, and a permissive law enforcement environment in Russia. No sector is off limits as threat actors continue to target public and private sector organisations, schools, hospitals and local government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the victims of these attacks rarely share their experiences. There are many reasons for this reticence, including legal reasons, reputational concerns, or even plain fear – ransomware groups use aggressive language and methods to increase the victims’ propensity to pay a ransom. Consequently, the lack of reporting to law enforcement and cyber security agencies, and limited transparency on the part of victims (including in terms of communicating with the media) means that there is scant understanding of the range of harms experienced by victims during and after such incidents. This research paper addresses that gap, by speaking to victims or others associated with an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shining a light on the harms experienced by victims, this research provides a clearer picture of the harm caused by ransomware and therefore also the economic, societal and national security risks posed by ransomware groups to the UK and beyond. This is important for policymakers and industry, as a more holistic understanding of the harms stemming from ransomware will allow government to make more informed policy prioritisation choices so as to reduce the threat and help law enforcement, incident responders and organisations to better support victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, much of the coverage of ransomware focuses on the financial harm inflicted by ransomware incidents. This is understandable, as financial harm is a highly relevant impact that is both tangible and, at times, measurable. For example, media coverage often addresses the immediate financial impact of ransomware in the form of ransom payments and business continuity costs. Similarly, several studies focus on the cost of data breaches or other cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks. This paper does not seek to play down financial harm – indeed, ransomware causes wider financial harm than is usually recognised, but there are few studies that attempt to make a macroeconomic impact assessment of the harm from ransomware beyond the cost to a particular organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a range of other harms from ransomware too, beyond the obvious financial impacts. These harms go beyond just affecting the direct victim of an incident – indirect victims can include other organisations, communities and individuals – and can be physical and psychological in nature. There is a real human impact to ransomware attacks that is yet to be fully grasped and measured. Although some reporting has tried to focus on this aspect by exploring the impact of incidents on students and council tenants, or by exploring the psychological and long-term harms caused by ransomware, such reports remain few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can ruin lives. This paper addresses the broader harms caused by ransomware, ranging from individual victims through to UK national security and prosperity. By engaging with victims and those associated with an incident, such as incident responders, insurers, lawyers, law enforcement officers and government officials, this research uncovers unique insights into a range of harms from ransomware. The findings should not only alert more policymakers to the scourge of ransomware, but also lead to a serious rethink about the resources required to combat ransomware in a meaningful way, both in the UK context and more widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper comprises three chapters. Chapter I sets outs out the tactics and techniques used by ransomware threat actors to cause harm. Chapter II details the harms that result from ransomware attacks, in an analysis based on interview data, workshops and public reporting; impacts from ransomware incidents are listed as first-, second- and/or third-order harms respectively. Chapter III sets out important implications for policymakers and practitioners to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is part of a 12-month research project on “Ransomware Harms and the Victim Experience”. The project is funded by the UK’s NCSC and the Research Institute in Sociotechnical Cyber Security, and conducted by RUSI and the University of Kent. The paper’s aim is to understand the wide range of harms caused by ransomware attacks to individuals, organisations and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper focuses on the question of what harms (for example, physical, economic, societal, psychological) ransomware incidents cause to organisations and individuals in the UK, and to the UK more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collection and analysis for this paper entailed a literature review, semi-structured interviews and workshops. One strength of the research approach is that participants were encouraged to speak freely about their own experience of ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Literature review&lt;/strong&gt;: This consisted of a literature review of publicly available sources on ransomware harm and ransomware victims. It included a non-systematic review of publicly available academic and grey literature, including surveys and reports conducted by stakeholders in the ransomware ecosystem. The initial literature review was conducted in August and September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-structured interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; The primary dataset for the paper is based on 42 semi-structured interviews with victims of ransomware attacks and with subject matter experts from across the ransomware ecosystem, including individuals from the insurance industry, government and law enforcement, as well as incident responders. Interviews were conducted between November 2022 and March 2023, and were anonymised to allow individuals to speak openly about potentially sensitive issues. The research team then analysed the interview transcripts using NVivo data analysis software. Throughout this paper, an anonymised coding system, based on Table 1, is used to refer to interview data in the footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshops:&lt;/strong&gt; In November 2022 and February 2023, the research team conducted two online workshops with key stakeholders from UK government, the insurance and cyber security industries, lawyers and law enforcement. Attendees included a mix of interviewees and new participants, using contacts established during the interview phase. The first workshop was used for data gathering and had 26 participants; the second was used to validate and reassess themes identified in the first workshop, the literature review and in interviews, and had 21 participants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper focuses primarily on the harm caused in a UK context, but it also draws on experiences from other countries, such as the US. A small number of international participants were included in this research project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Interview Participants (Non-Victims/Victims).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;definitions&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this paper, a “victim” is any person or organisation that experiences harm as a result of a ransomware attack. This term can apply to individuals and organisations that are directly impacted, and to those that are indirectly affected and experience harm as a result. The term “harm” refers to any negative impact the victim may experience, which could be of a financial, physical, psychological, reputational or other nature. These underlying definitions are intentionally broad, allowing this paper to examine the full range of harms and victims that are impacted by ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of factors limit the generalisability of the research’s findings. First, the victim interviews should not be considered representative of a “universal” victim experience. As identified in the research, there is variation in the harms experienced by different victims. Additionally, the interviews included more public sector than private sector victims, with a very limited number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represented. Moreover, there may also be a self-reporting bias, given that the interview data is based on organisations that were happy to speak about the harm they experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the observations made in this paper are primarily about the UK. While many businesses – victims and those that are part of the cyber security ecosystem alike – provide services globally, the focus of this research rested on incidents and victims in the UK and their interactions with the UK cyber security ecosystem, including UK law enforcement and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-ransomware-tactics-and-targeting&quot;&gt;I. Ransomware: Tactics and Targeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware has historically been defined as a form of malware that disrupts a user’s access to their computer system through encryption or locking. However, in recent years “ransomware” has become a catch-all term for different types of cyber extortion – including data theft. As such, this paper follows the Ransomware Task Force’s broader definition of ransomware as activity where threat actors compromise computer systems and demand a ransom for the restoration or non-exposure of encrypted and/or stolen data and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creators-of-harm-the-ransomware-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Creators of Harm: The Ransomware Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware, after nearly a decade of growth and innovation, is a highly profitable criminal enterprise supported by a diverse and professionalised ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no fixed business model for ransomware threat actors, a recent joint report by the UK’s NCSC and the National Crime Agency (NCA) outlined three broad business models that all cause harm to UK victims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “buy-a-build” model, which usually involves smaller groups of less experienced cyber-criminals obtaining existing ransomware code to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “in-house” model, where the same organisation responsible for developing the ransomware also conduct the operations (although they may still rely on other parts of the cyber-criminal ecosystem for other services necessary to monetise ransomware).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The “ransomware-as-a-service” (RaaS) model, which involves collaboration between groups/individuals who develop and maintain the infrastructure and tools behind ransomware operations, and “affiliates” who conduct operations for a percentage of profits. This model has become dominant in the ransomware ecosystem and has enabled operators to scale and increase the volume of attacks, thereby increasing the amount of harm ransomware causes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware operations are also supported by specialists in the criminal ecosystem, such as botnet operators, initial access brokers (who specialise in gaining access to victims’ networks), negotiators and money launderers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methods-of-harm-extortion-tactics-and-techniques&quot;&gt;Methods of Harm: Extortion Tactics and Techniques&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware criminals are profit-driven and have developed a range of tactics and techniques to extort payments from victims. These methods rest on causing harm (or the fear of potential harm) to victims to pressure them into ceding to threat actors’ demands. Cyber-criminals use two primary extortion methods, although these are supported by a range of additional extortion tactics and techniques to increase their leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary Extortion Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption:&lt;/strong&gt; Encrypting data is the most common tactic used by ransomware threat actors. This approach involves gaining access to a victim’s network, escalating privileges and accessing as many systems as possible before deploying malware that encrypts files and delivers the ransom note. Although early “pray-and-spray” ransomware campaigns only targeted individual endpoints, ransomware affiliates now aim to compromise domain administrator accounts so as to encrypt thousands of computers within a single organisation in one go. To maximise disruption and harm, threat actors will often spend time seeking out the critical systems and backups before encrypting them. These attacks can be particularly harmful to organisations that rely on maintaining continuous operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data theft:&lt;/strong&gt; Since late 2019, cyber-criminals have also adopted so-called “double extortion” tactics, stealing victims’ data as well as encrypting it, then threatening to leak it unless the ransom is paid. Data theft can be a particularly useful tactic for targeting organisations with sensitive intellectual property, safeguarding data (such as schools) or medical data. Stolen financial information, including accounting and insurance policies, can be used to help threat actors design negotiation strategies and set ransom demands. Recently, some ransomware operations have foregone encrypting victims’ data altogether, and just stolen it. This trend is in part driven by larger organisations’ efforts to improve their resilience against ransomware by introducing offline backups and other measures, but also by the emergence in 2022 and 2023 of ransomware operations that exploit vulnerabilities in file transfer services, enabling criminals to steal data from dozens or even hundreds of victims at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secondary Extortion Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After encrypting systems and/or stealing data, ransomware threat actors often use additional methods to raise the stakes for victims and disrupt their response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data leak sites:&lt;/strong&gt; Since adopting data theft tactics, ransomware operators have also launched “name-and-shame” leak sites, on both the dark and clear webs, where they can name victims and leak data. This shames victims, but also serves as a warning to future victims who might consider refusing to pay. Threat actors can also draw additional attention to data leaks through social media or by contacting journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harassment of employees and customers:&lt;/strong&gt; More aggressive ransomware threat actors will also directly contact an affected organisation’s employees or customers. This method can be untargeted – for instance, cold calling a company’s phonelines in the hope that an employee will pick up; or more targeted – such as directly contacting executives or sending stolen personal data to relevant employees. This can be particularly embarrassing – and involve reputational risk and commercial consequences – if cyber-criminals send stolen data to a victim’s customers or users. Some reporting suggests that ransomware threat actors are adopting more extreme forms of harassment as victims’ willingness to pay ransoms decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DDoS attacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware threat actors have also been known to use distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to increase disruption to victims’ digital infrastructure. However, industry reporting indicates that this is not a widely used tactic: for instance, a report by the cyber security vendor Unit 42 (part of Palo Alto Networks), suggested that only 2% of the ransomware incidents they responded to in 2022 involved a DDoS attack as part of the extortion attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-experiences-harm-ransomware-targeting-and-victimisation&quot;&gt;Who Experiences Harm: Ransomware Targeting and Victimisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware threat actors are largely agnostic about who they choose to target, which means that almost any organisation is a potential ransomware victim. However, there are several considerations that, to varying degrees, appear to influence ransomware targeting and victimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunism:&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware affiliates either gain access to organisations themselves or use specialist access brokers. In either case, organisations are typically compromised through opportunistic tactics and techniques that are designed to gain access to a wide range of victims through scanning for internet-facing vulnerabilities or poorly secured remote desktop protocols, or via phishing campaigns. This makes organisations and sectors that underinvest in or mismanage IT infrastructure and cyber security particularly vulnerable to ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature of business/organisation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some ransomware threat actors appear to prioritise organisations that are incentivised to quickly resolve incidents. Criminals often seek targets for whom it is critical that their operations provide certain products or services in a timely manner. Alternatively, being attuned to the potential regulatory and reputational risks that the exposure of customer or client data can entail, they might prioritise organisations that hold sensitive information. This means that victims may be targeted by virtue of the vulnerabilities linked to their industry sector. While some ransomware actors adopt a risk-averse avoidance of critical national infrastructure (CNI) sectors (although this is unlikely to be an absolute commitment to avoid disrupting such sectors), others prioritise their targeting based on the assumption of an increased likelihood of payment. Some ransomware groups were relentless in their targeting of healthcare organisations during the Covid-19 pandemic, while one more recent ransomware operation, Vice Society, has focused on targeting and stealing sensitive data from education providers in the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size of organisation:&lt;/strong&gt; Some threat actors deliberately target larger organisations. So-called “big game hunting” ransomware operations aim to generate sizeable pay-outs from large corporations. However, size does not matter for most ransomware threat actors, and reporting from Coveware, a specialist ransomware response firm, consistently highlights that the median ransomware victim is a medium-sized organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors emphasise that a wide range of organisations (and by extension, their employees and customers, or users of their products and services) can be harmed by ransomware. The rest of this paper examines the impact of ransomware on organisations, individuals and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-ransomware-harms&quot;&gt;II. Ransomware Harms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter identifies the range of harms that organisations, individuals and countries such as the UK experience as a result of a ransomware incident. The findings build on existing research that analyses or categorises ransomware or cyber breach harms. Existing research has, for instance: drawn a distinction between “direct” and “indirect” harms to a victim (particularly financial); explored cumulative impacts, such as reduced employee productivity; emphasised the potential societal impacts arising from protracted CNI downtime; articulated the risk of tangible loss of reputation; considered psychological harms experienced by impacted individuals; and reflected on the broader range of impacts that may be experienced by clients, including hospital patients and school students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve understanding of the different types of harm caused by ransomware across society and to help understand the scale of the policy challenge, this paper uses a framework with three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation (and its staff) directly targeted by a ransomware operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; Harms to any organisation or individuals that are indirectly affected by a ransomware incident (e.g. organisations that are customers or clients of a victim, or individuals that are customers of a victim or use a service that is disrupted).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-order harms:&lt;/strong&gt; The cumulative effect of incidents on wider society, the economy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eUaX3wO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: The Three Different Categories of Ransomware Harms, and Who/What They Affect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 illustrates how ransomware attacks can cascade through the supply chain, economy and society, distinguishing between harms that are experienced by organisations, individuals and countries. Some harms impact the organisations directly targeted by ransomware, others impact organisations and individuals indirectly affected by ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis draws on a 2018 taxonomy of cyber harms, which identifies five broad types of harm: physical or digital; financial or economic; reputational; psychological; and social or societal. These five themes are applied to the three categories in the framework to illustrate the range of harms that organisations, individuals and countries can suffer. Each order of harm is contextualised using an author-generated figure, the content of which was derived from interviews and workshop data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this framework is not intended to be definitive. It builds on previous research and should be added to in the future. We urge policymakers, researchers and practitioners to continue to identify new types of harms based on further case studies and personal experiences, particularly with regard to sectors not represented in our evidence base. New types of harm will no doubt emerge as ransomware operators find new ways to harm and extort their victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;first-order-harms&quot;&gt;First-Order Harms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first category involves harms to the organisations and staff directly targeted by ransomware. Interview and workshop data highlighted areas of convergence and divergence between “organisation” and “staff” harm, to the extent that it is necessary to distinguish overtly between the two. The distinction between an organisation and individuals (and the harm they experience) is less apparent for small business owners or sole traders. They typically do not distinguish between the organisation and themselves, and might not have any other employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DaqRPfT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Categorisation of First-Order Harms to Organisations and Their Staff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First-Order Harms to Organisations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the organisational level, this research has identified three main types of harm caused by ransomware: physical/digital harm to systems and data; financial harm; and reputational harm. While general reporting on ransomware harms often focuses on the immediate financial harm, for example, when media reporting stresses the size of a ransomware payment, the research data indicates that the range of harm experienced by the victim organisation is much broader. The following section identifies themes that emerged from the research data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital and Physical Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category of harm describes negative impacts on an organisation’s digital and physical systems, and on its data. Broadly, such harm results from the effects of ransomware threat actors’ efforts to encrypt systems or steal data, and sometimes, in turn, from defenders’ efforts to contain an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks involving encryption can have a profound negative impact on an organisation’s IT infrastructure. Several of the victims interviewed revealed that their servers had been encrypted by the ransomware in their entirety, with one victim in the education sector losing access to more than 10,000 computers as a result. The impact becomes even more significant if ransomware operators are also able to encrypt or delete any backups. Interviewees also highlighted how common it is for cyber-criminals to deploy ransomware at the end of the week or during public holidays, when organisations are slower to react and defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of disruption to IT infrastructure from ransomware varies from incident to incident. One government agency described how, in the aftermath of the ransomware deployment, “we had lost access to all of our systems and … all of our data. We were right back to being a non-digital non-IT organisation”. Indeed, a number of interviewees highlighted how, in the absence of key digital services, ransomware often forces organisations to return to operating by “pen and paper”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, ransomware can be isolated to a single server or IT function, either because it fails to deploy as planned or because security controls or resilience measures are (at least partially) effective. However, even in these cases, the effort to contain ransomware can still have significant impacts on the delivery of business operations. Several interviewees highlighted how they had to disconnect or isolate their IT infrastructure from the internet for several days – or even weeks – while they assessed the extent of the attack and removed the threat actor’s access to their networks. The impact from drastic incident response measures can be as harmful to operations as the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ransomware attack and the subsequent recovery efforts can also result in prolonged reduced performance of IT infrastructure. Although some victims are able to recover within weeks or months, interviewees reported that recovery efforts can sometimes stretch into years. One interviewee from the professional services sector emphasised that their company still had trouble with impacted financial systems several years after the incident. Hackney Council, which was targeted by cyber-criminals using Pysa ransomware in October 2022, took more than two years to recover fully from the incident. And if backups are encrypted or destroyed, organisations may lose access to data permanently. One interviewee from the education sector, for instance, highlighted how teachers permanently lost teaching material following an attack against their academy trust, with some losing 20 years’ worth of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can also harm physical systems and processes. Although most ransomware operations lack the capability to directly compromise industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT), the disruption of IT infrastructure can cause cascading operational impacts. Indeed, the increasing convergence of IT and OT leaves physical infrastructure more vulnerable to ransomware. One notable example is the 2019 ransomware attack on Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian aluminium and hydroelectric producer, which caused several plants to shut down at great cost. A small number of the victims interviewed for this research paper used ICS as a core part of their business or operations, but most did not. Nonetheless, several interviewees highlighted examples where disruption to their IT digital infrastructure had knock-on effects on their operations. These included schools that lost access to CCTV, fire control systems, and doors and gates, and a victim in the education sector that lost control over fridges and freezers containing sensitive research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims of ransomware attacks experience a wide range of financial harm. Some forms of financial harm – such as the cost of a ransom payment – can be measured relatively easily, with studies finding that both ransom demands and incident response costs are steadily increasing. Other aspects of financial harm are harder to quantify, such as the cost of missed opportunities and reduced productivity. This means that there is limited understanding of the long-term financial harm caused by ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, interview data confirmed that, in line with wider public reporting, primary attention rests on immediate financial harm, for example in the form of the additional costs encountered from a ransom payment, or losses arising from business interruption. One notable finding is that interviewees from victim organisations frequently reported that senior leadership would make assessments of the cost of the given ransomware incident, although it was challenging to disaggregate the overall costs of the ransomware incident from other fiscal shocks that occurred in the same timeframe as the incident, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. These assessments would typically have a tightly restricted readership. The interviews also confirmed that many organisations generally have limited understanding of the overall financial impact a ransomware attack has on the organisation, particularly with respect to financial harm that is not covered by an insurance policy, or which plays out over the long term. Therefore, the data represented here is subject to the same limitations: assessments of financial impact are unlikely to be definitive, and there is a need for further research in this area. Given the scale and depth of ransomware as an impactful form of contemporary cybercrime affecting almost all organisational sectors, it is important to further collective understanding of the scale of this harm to individual organisations and the wider economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional Costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediate financial harm spans the cost of paying the ransom itself and hiring external parties to help with the response to the incident – for example, incident response teams and lawyers, but also PR professionals. Often, the costs of hiring such third parties far exceeds the demand for the ransom payment. Some providers, such as lawyers, are costly, especially when incidents are complex. The high additional costs of hiring help from third parties are financially challenging where they are not covered by insurance, especially for small companies or for public service providers with limited financial reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional costs may also be incurred from paying existing staff overtime, or from hiring new (or temporary) staff. A victim from the education sector, for example, paid employees extra during the initial response phase, but also hired a cryptocurrency broker to facilitate access to cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But additional costs can also occur in less expected ways: one victim in the education sector was no longer able to charge students for school meals, and as a result had to cover the cost of food in the interim. Some companies also offered to pay for counselling services for their staff, but these costs are typically not covered by insurance. Some organisations also paid for credit monitoring for their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many victims also face additional costs due to increased insurance premiums. While interviewees were often able to renew their cyber insurance policy after a ransomware attack, they had to do so at a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate reaction to a ransomware attack, additional costs may arise when replacing technology, as a ransomware attack often infiltrates many devices, or impairs communications for the victim. The victim may have to acquire additional devices, as was the case for one interviewee, who described how their company replaced all its employees’ phones after a ransomware attack. When phone systems in a local government entity failed due to a ransomware attack, extra telephones and mobile phones had to be acquired to enable staff to communicate with local citizens. Another victim purchased large numbers of Chromebook devices to access their Microsoft 365 environment so as to enable communication between employees and with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further significant, long-term costs are accrued when improving cyber security measures and updating IT networks. While these measures are not always strictly required in response to a ransomware attack, such incidents often create the impetus for increased cyber security measures and spending. The costly decision to “build back better” is often deemed necessary or even overdue, but not covered by insurance. As a victim in the education sector said, “It’s all a lot of money, but money we should have spent a year earlier”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other long-term costs stem from regulatory fines, although in the UK it is not clear how many fines have been issued to victims of ransomware by the Information Commissioner’s Office. Moreover, decisions on these fines are often only delivered months or even years after an attack, in the meantime weighing on a victim’s mental health and limiting their ability to move on after the incident. Similarly, litigation costs may also only arise months or years after the ransomware attack has occurred. Again, victims often require legal support during these processes, dragging out the additional costs incurred for hiring third parties such as data protection lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some additional costs come in the form of clearly defined bills, others are harder to directly trace back to the ransomware attack. One example of this is the additional cost of employee turnover. While some individuals might lose (or leave) their jobs directly as a result of an attack and need to be replaced, employees’ decisions to leave often have more than one cause. A ransomware attack may be a contributing factor or the tipping point in a decision process, for example due to the stress or anxiety the attack evoked. Other influencing factors – such as the Covid-19 pandemic or an organisation’s existing internal dynamics – make it hard to isolate a ransomware attack as the sole factor causing employee turnover. Nevertheless, exit interviews in the education sector revealed that some teachers leaving the profession cited the ransomware attack as a tipping point, due to some of their data being lost to the attack – something they felt their employer should have protected them from. Another victim described how the ransomware attack led to lower morale among employees, which in turn had “a knock-on effect as people started to leave. It makes those people that are on the fence of … leaving make that decision”. Low morale and other such intangible influences take a long time to overcome, the interviewee noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other interviewees, ransomware incidents were clearly the reason why people left their jobs, for example due to stress levels experienced during the ransomware response or because the person’s account had been used by the hacker (and, although this was not their fault, the repeated mentioning of their name throughout the response led to them leaving the organisation in question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher costs due to employee turnover may also arise because experienced IT staff receive more attractive employment offers from elsewhere. An interviewee in the engineering sector explained that “trying to hold on to people who are battle-tested in that kind of space is extremely difficult because everybody wants them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, higher costs may occur where staff needs to be – temporarily – replaced due to burnout or other psychological harm. For example, one interviewee described how staff were unable to return to work for months after the ransomware response due to the high stress levels experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, victims often experience a more intangible type of cost: opportunity costs, wherein budgeting is disrupted by the need to redirect resources away from other objectives. A recent survey of 100 directors of UK firms impacted by ransomware identified that their organisations cut operating costs by an average of 17% following their ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of opportunity costs is likely to affect all victims operating with constrained finances, but may be particularly noticeable for victims in the public sector, such as councils, schools or hospitals, which are already running on tight budgets and have little ability to build back reserves. One interviewee in the public sector described how further cuts in funding put them in a worse position now than they were when the attack occurred, and that, in order to build back reserves, the organisation had to be particularly frugal in its spending and to increase revenue sources. In other ways, opportunity costs stem from reductions in productivity or from diverting staff from other pressing priorities to work on recovering from an incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware victims thus encounter additional costs in many ways, some of which are better anticipated than others. These additional costs often exceed the ransom demand by a significant degree. Moreover, many additional costs only occur in the long term, such as litigation costs or the cost of building back IT networks. Long-term costs can also arise as a consequence of other harms, for example when new employees need to be hired after former employees leave their positions or need to be replaced due to burnout. Some of these costs are covered by insurance providers, but where this is not the case, ransomware victims often have limited insights into the long-term additional costs they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Losses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the additional costs a victim organisation may face due to a ransomware attack, it may also experience a number of financial losses; indeed, small businesses may face the threat of going out of business. Even where the financial losses do not present an existential threat, they can nevertheless be significant. The following paragraphs provide some examples of the kind of financial losses that can occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business interruption accounts for the majority of financial losses after a ransomware attack – for example, when a company is unable to produce products or provide services to customers. The high financial impact of business interruption was confirmed by a 2022 study of cyber insurance claims for ransomware that found that the average cost of business interruption amounted to $657,000. Similarly, the interview data confirmed the significant financial harm caused by business interruption. One incident responder recalled working with manufacturing firms that were “losing tens, if not hundreds, of millions of euros or pounds a day because … their manufacturing lines were flying [disrupted]”. Business interruption also affected a victim in the charity sector, where the memberships team was unable to collect money from renewed membership subscriptions. As the annual direct debit collection was no longer working, the renewal process (worth £3 million) had to be delayed by a month. Business interruption, including delayed payments, is thus not only a significant financial harm but can also lead to reputational harm if a victim is no longer able to provide their services. While there are generally few examples of organisations going out of business or facing insolvency solely due to a ransomware attack, financial losses due to business interruption can be a significant influence in causing a business to shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This factor is closely linked to financial harm caused by loss of expected income, for example where a victim organisation had to cancel several reservations for a venue it offers as a conferencing space. Delay to another victim’s project meant that an education institution was unable to secure funding for further related research. Loss of expected income is of course closely related to the loss of clients. While often mentioned as a feared consequence, loss of clients is often difficult to directly attribute to the ransomware attack. An interviewee in the insurance business explained that although most insured parties do not lose a significant proportion of their customer base, this may happen in certain sectors (in the technology sector, for example, where customers display lower risk tolerance). For organisations that provide immediate services, losing clients may be a more tangible harm, for example in the construction industry, where the inability to provide a service would lead to the client immediately looking for a different supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the financial loss caused by loss of clients or expected income, ransomware attacks also result in a loss of time: the time that is needed to respond and recover. Ransomware attacks are highly disruptive, requiring the attention not just of IT staff but of staff from all departments. Financial harm also arises from time being spent responding to the ransomware attack, rather than on the usual tasks. As a victim in the education sector said, “The time cost is immense … The time cost of not only recovering, but not doing the work that you could have been doing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these financial losses and additional costs, interviewees widely regarded ransomware as a severe risk for organisations and potentially even as “business ending … if you haven’t got your data, you don’t have a business”. An executive of a micro-enterprise noted that they would have lost their house and their company would have gone bankrupt if they had not had the cushion of cyber insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While public reporting has highlighted some cases of organisations permanently ceasing to trade after a ransomware incident, none of the victims interviewed reported that their organisation had ceased to be a going concern as the result of a ransomware attack. Interviewees from the ransomware recovery ecosystem (for example, incident responders and cyber insurers) were also hard-pressed to identify concrete cases where an organisation had ceased trading altogether. This may indicate a degree of selection bias: for example, organisations that were unable to afford incident response or did not have cyber insurance would not have been on these professionals’ radar. The limited cases of this kind that interviewees could recall tended to relate to the healthcare sector – such as a fertility clinic holding highly sensitive data – where it was the combination of business interruption and irrecoverable reputational harm that resulted in the business folding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reputational Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside any financial impact, harm to their external reputation is often a primary concern for victim organisations. Victims fear reputational harm arising either from media reporting or because customers and clients realise that the organisation is unable to provide a particular service. In some instances, victims have a contractual or regulatory – if not a moral – obligation to disclose that they have experienced a ransomware incident. Such incidents are, however, typically perceived as reflecting organisational weakness, and victims – who are also often subject to victim blaming – often fear that this will affect their reputation and professional credentials. A victim in the technology sector felt that “we were humiliated in front of the customer”, while another victim, in the education sector, confirmed that their “biggest bit of damage was probably reputational and confidence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver behind such fear is the assumption that reputational harm in turn also leads to financial harm, for example due to loss of expected income or loss of clients. One employee at a manufacturing company recollected that customers would repeatedly ask about the ransomware incident even months after the attack, and that rumours about customers’ leaked personal data added to the reputational harm done. As a result, the company was perceived as being less safe, and questions were raised about whether larger competitors were a safer choice for doing business with, indicating that this perception could have resulted in/contributed to a loss of orders. Furthermore, the employee also noticed an impact on customer relations, as open communication with customers was prohibited, resulting in a feeling of lost trust among customers, who thought the employee knew more than they were telling. This echoes a risk highlighted more widely in reporting on the subject: that, where there is an alternative supplier, the reputational fallout from a ransomware incident can include the loss of existing and future customers. In 2023, the hosting firms CloudNordic and AzeroCloud experienced ransomware attacks which irrevocably removed some hosted client data; the director of the companies said publicly that he did not expect many customers to remain with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reputational harm is often especially impactful for smaller firms providing professional services, particularly where there is an “implied and contractual level of confidentiality” – for example, in legal or accountancy firms. Customers perceive that it is part of these organisations’ duty – but also their business model – to guard customers’ personal information, which is often of a sensitive nature. In these instances, the disappointment and loss of trust increases the risk of reputational harm. Victim blaming after an attack can further aggravate reputational harm, including via social media platforms. While less pertinent for some of the interviewees at organisations that are less exposed to direct financial implications as a result of reputational damage (for example, because they are public sector organisations with no real competitors), reputational harm can thus have a significant impact on organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while the fear of reputational harm heavily influences victims’ decision- making, some interviewees, including crisis communications experts and lawyers, indicated that reputational harm may not be as severe as has been assumed in the literature. One interviewee did not think that there is “stigma attached to being the victim of a cyber attack in the same way that there was inthe past”. Some victims said they had supportive clients or, in the case of schools and universities, students. A victim in the professional services sector found that the attack “did not do damage to our reputation as much as one might think, clients were quite sympathetic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the extent of reputational harm caused by a ransomware attack appears to be highly contingent and based on a range of factors. Some interviewees, for instance, highlighted that sympathy is likely to be dependent on the context of the incident and the nature of the business. One interviewee noted that their inability to speak openly about the incident led to increasingly strained interactions with clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interviewees also indicated that, if data exfiltration occurred, “the risk of reputational harm is much greater”. The same is true if customer services are interrupted. An interviewee at a professional services provider found that clients were “reasonably sympathetic” as long as the company was still able to provide the relevant services and secure their data. Other interviewees highlighted that the timing, cadence and tone of client communications was an important consideration for minimising harms to the organisation, its staff, clients and other third parties. While each ransomware case will be different, it was emphasised that there was a balance to be struck between transparency and opacity, particularly with a public audience. Such assessments are speculative, but again illustrate the prominence that the fear of reputational harm has for victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important finding from the interview data was that reputational damage can also occur within the impacted organisation itself. This is particularly likely where internal communication is poor, and especially among employees who are not directly involved in responding to the incident and who may, as a result, feel excluded. A victim in the professional services sector, who found that external reputational damage was not as significant as expected, said that the attack was indeed “more damaging to our internal reputation”, adding that the attack’s impact on morale made the organisation a bad place for people to work and that people were leaving as a result, with the organisation’s reputation as an employer also suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, victim organisations are often concerned about experiencing reputational harm as a result of media reporting. The interviewees for this project only mentioned a small number of examples of negative reporting in the media. Individual cases are not discussed here, given the risk of inadvertent attribution, but the interviews made clear that the fear of negative press often meant that victims – particularly those in the private sector – were less likely to be transparent about the attack. One victim spoke of negative publicity on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First-Order Harms to Staff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the harm experienced by an organisation itself, the individuals who work for (or own) an organisation that has fallen victim to a ransomware attack are also directly impacted. As an interviewee in the charity sector put it, “everyone was affected in a way, but just to different degrees”. The degree to which staff members experience harm depends on a number of factors, including the extent to which they are involved in the immediate incident response and whether there are underlying issues, such as pre-existing health conditions. This section provides an overview of the different ways in which staff members may be negatively impacted by a ransomware attack, including psychological, physical, financial, reputational and social harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to public reporting, which often focuses on the financial harm of ransomware attacks, our interviews stressed that the first-order harm employees experience is primarily of a psychological nature. Interviewees repeatedly emphasised that psychological impacts are often overlooked in the wider discourse on ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological impacts are naturally perceived at an individual level and are therefore highly subjective. The categories of psychological harm listed here are therefore not based on medical definitions but are guided by the interview data and by the words that individuals used to describe their feelings. Furthermore, psychological and physical harms are often closely interlinked, especially where psychological harm has physical consequences, such as mental burnout leading to tiredness or physical exhaustion. The distinction between the psychological and the physical is thus not always straightforward, but, to avoid duplication, not all harms are listed in both categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, experiencing and responding to a ransomware attack creates considerable stress for the individuals involved. For example, an interviewee from the engineering sector confirmed, “There’s a huge amount of pressure and stress that everybody was under”, to the extent that their company hired a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) support team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While stress was widely reported, the interview data shows that individuals experience different forms of stress, depending on their position and allotted tasks. An interviewee in the professional services sector explained how management- and board-level employees felt stress due to financial concerns, while people in the middle management tier were stressed by the extremely long workdays, including particularly stressful communications with the threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress is often particularly grave for individuals in involved IT teams. One external service provider went so far as to state that “the IT staff – they’re the main victims of crime here”. An interviewee from the education sector explained that the human toll on the IT service was especially severe due to their detailed understanding of the gravity of the situation, adding that the impact on the IT team was, however, often not talked about. As the technical details of attacks are often difficult to understand, the wider perception is that “magical IT will come and sort it all out”, obscuring how stressful this experience can be for the IT team. Stress is also particularly prominent for IT teams because they feel a direct responsibility for protecting an organisation’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although stress is thus often acknowledged as a harm inflicted by ransomware attacks, the interview data implied that the more detailed impact of stress, particularly on IT teams, is often overlooked and insufficiently addressed. This is particularly regrettable, as in some instances stress on staff is so significant that it leads to other harms such as burnout or other sickness, leading personnel to leave their jobs or to be absent temporarily on sick leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with stress, victims also often described a feeling of confusion and loss of orientation in the initial phase of a ransomware attack, especially where victims were not familiar with technical details or did not yet have enough information to form a full picture of the situation. The loss of orientation may be rooted in there being insufficient preparation or procedures in place, while confusion can also stem from victims questioning why they have been attacked, or from uncertainty among staff about what is going on and how they should respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case for other categories of harm, victims noted that emotional reactions to ransomware attacks also varied with time. For example, a victim in the education sector said that “those first few hours are quite horrific actually, until you get into a position where you start working out what the facts are”. Others described feelings of very low mood in the first week after the attack. One victim recalled a burdensome feeling that they “for the foreseeable future belonged to the criminal underworld”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some victims of ransomware attacks were also said to be angry, for example when an insurance provider recalled client interactions with victims who were angry at the attackers, questioning why they had been targeted. Other interviewees said that former employees whose data was exfiltrated were also less sympathetic but “much more angry”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial reactions of panic in the wake of a ransomware attack can also cause psychological harm. One interviewee said “there was a terror about what might happen next”. On a related note, worry was a typical harm experienced by victims, for example worry about reputational risk, but also, while responding to an attack, worry about whether they were taking the right actions. An external counsel noted that “it’s a harm in itself of distress and worry of making the wrong decision”. A victim in the education sector spoke of a fear of recovering the IT systems too quickly, in case criminals still had access to the networks. Fear of a repeated incident also affected other victims: when receiving suspicious emails or similar, even after the ransomware incident had been dealt with, victims experienced a sense of “PTSD” (in the non-technical sense used by lay people), for example saying that “there was a bit of a PTSD about every time I walked through the office door”. Others described a sense of fear over potential job losses as a result of the ransomware attack. These feelings underline how personally victims experience an attack, and how a ransomware incident casts a shadow over their personal and professional life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviews revealed a number of further emotional harms that were experienced in response to ransomware attacks, stressing how wide-ranging the psychological impacts can be. The difficult decision about whether to pay the ransom demanded often weighs heavily on victims and is not a purely financial or risk management decision: it often raises feelings of guilt, an aspect often overlooked when considering the seemingly binary decision to pay or not to pay. A victim in the education sector described how challenging it was to make a decision in this context, given that they believed “it’s not ethical to pay the ransom”. This concern had, however, to be balanced against students’ potential delay to their studies. While the interviewee believed it was ultimately right to pay the ransom in this instance, they also stressed that “we’re not happy with the decision of paying”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the feeling of guilt are feelings of shame and self-blame. An interviewee from the charity sector said “we all blame ourselves” – a human reaction that was difficult to overcome. Some members of IT teams can feel particularly responsible, often because they feel that they knew about potential system problems and did not raise them sufficiently, subsequently blaming themselves and burning themselves out working on the ransomware response. Again, this underlines the overlooked – but heightened – impact that ransomware attacks have on the mental wellbeing of IT teams in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews also highlighted that ransomware attacks caused feelings of doubt and resignation among victims, again underlining how personal the attack is felt to be by its victims. One interviewee said the incident made them doubt everything they had done. Similarly, another interviewee said that the incident made them question whether they had run their business properly, because “at that time you second guess yourself, [and] that adds to the mental anxiety”. Another victim described a sense of doubt about whether they were doing enough, but also a feeling of resignation “to the fact that if someone wants to get in [and] if they have enough time and enough energy and enough effort – they’ll get in”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research shows that the range of psychological harm experienced, and its severity, can affect victims’ mental health. Indeed, interviewees overwhelmingly felt that this aspect was often overlooked in popular discourse. One victim concluded that “the overall piece is that we very rarely talk about the mental health impact of these events”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other categories of harm, psychological harm continues far beyond the immediate timeframe of the incident, creating an additional mental health burden and making it challenging for victims to move on after the incident. Victims repeatedly mentioned concerns over the role of the Information Commissioner’s Office and the impact that the prospect of being fined had on their mental state. The challenge of moving on mentally after an incident was also reported by an interviewee in the education sector, who said that subsequent Ofsted surveys revealed that “some staff are still very raw about this. When you ask them about workload, they may well say the ransomware attack … made our lives hell”. Another victim felt “a real disappointment” given that their company was ultimately unable to find out how the attacker gained access to their systems. Indeed, one victim went as far as to say that the attack made them feel like they had “failed”. Another victim found the ransomware attack “actually really traumatic” (especially given their strong identification with success in business, and in their own business in particular), indicating that this had brought them close to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interview data shows that not only is the psychological impact of ransomware incidents overlooked in the short term, but that the long-term psychological impact of attacks is even less likely to be noticed (or sufficiently addressed) than immediate harms such as stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the psychological harm a ransomware attack causes is of course highly context specific and also depends on the individuals involved and their existing mental health conditions, the interviews stressed the significance, extent and multiplicity of ways in which victims experience psychological harm. Such psychological harm can reach far beyond the immediate response to a specific incident, affecting an individual’s wider professional life and impacting their personal life. Interviewees repeatedly noted that the psychological impact of ransomware attacks is insufficiently recognised, not only by the broader public, but also in academic and/or industry studies and within the organisations responding to such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research data demonstrates how central the psychological impact is to victim experience and how varied the psychological harm is, especially for IT teams. In turn, such psychological impact on individuals also has financial impact for victim organisations, for example where it affects productivity, when staff suffer burnout and need replacing, or in terms of other forms of employee turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victims’ physical health also suffers in the wake of ransomware attacks. Physical harms reported by interviewees ranged from minor ailments (for instance, weight changes) to serious health issues (such as heart attack or stroke). While not a commonplace occurrence, one law enforcement interviewee noted that they knew of a member of IT staff at an organisation who took their own life following a ransomware incident. Far more commonly, interviewees reported sleep deprivation and follow-on impacts, with employees falling asleep at the office or reporting problems sleeping at home. One victim reported that “the fatigue on people was extreme”, referring to physical but also mental exhaustion, illustrating how closely linked the two harms are. This is also true for harms such as burnout, which can manifest in both mental and physical ways. Other reported physical impacts included weight loss and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee even reported health issues within their team that resulted in hospitalisation, with employees not looking after themselves well in the immediate response to a ransomware attack, for example by drinking too much coffee and not enough water (which in this instance resulted in the need for hospital checks because of pre-existing heart complications). In a more grievous example, a victim experienced a heart attack and required surgery, citing the stress of managing the incident as a key factor. Physical harm is thus closely linked to the mental harm experienced, such as stress and anxiety; this can be especially grave where victims have underlying health conditions (albeit this is the exception rather than the rule).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While wider reporting of ransomware incidents often focuses on the financial impact for organisations or the economy more broadly, the interview data stresses that financial harm is also experienced by individual staff members. (The distinction is, of course, somewhat superfluous in the case of sole traders or freelancers, whose individual financial situation is hardly distinguishable from that of their business.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees can suffer financial harm as a result of a ransomware attack, for example if they lose their job as a result of the attack – an outcome that is more likely for members of the IT team or an organisation’s board members. An external counsel reported that, especially where a publicly listed company pays the ransom, board members are likely to be changed within six months to a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many victims reported that their organisation was still able to meet payroll despite the ransomware attack, this was often because the incident came just after staff had been paid, or otherwise that it had been a close call with regard to meeting payroll during response to the incident. Not being paid, or being underpaid (for example, because a recent pay rise has been ignored due to fallback to earlier backups of personnel data), is thus another way in which a ransomware attack can financially impact staff members. Another example of harm was described by one victim, who paid for their own therapy sessions (which were not covered by insurance) and had to cancel holiday plans in order to make time to respond to an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reputational Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like organisations, individual staff members may also be concerned about suffering reputational harm as the result of a ransomware attack. This is particularly true for IT staff, who often feel that they may not have done enough to prevent the incident from occurring. They might also be blamed by board members or other senior staff for not doing what might superficially be considered “doing their job”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reputational harm is also a problem for staff who might have clicked on a malicious link (allowing ransomware to access the organisation’s systems) or whose credentials have been abused during the attack. Even if they were not necessarily responsible for the breach, their reputation might suffer if they are erroneously assigned blame by superiors or colleagues. Blaming individuals and contributing to their reputational harm might also cause them further psychological harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the psychological, physical and financial harm caused, a ransomware attack can also impact employees’ professional lives, and the social relations between members of staff, and their relationships outside work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the psychological harm experienced by staff members can have wider impacts on social relations within an organisation or team, potentially leading to strained relationships with colleagues. One victim described employees as being “grumpier”, amid increased workloads and diminished pastoral care. Others noted the negative effect on morale and said that the repeated complaints of colleagues were “annoying”. Work relationships might also become strained if external help is hired. One victim described how the in-house IT team felt challenged when an external IT team was hired as additional help, with poor integration leading to duplication of efforts and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of ransomware attacks is, however, also felt beyond social relations in a professional context, extending into private and family life. Some victims reported missing out on personal or family life. One victim described “a personal toll”, particularly given increased commuting demands and long working hours. The impact on personal life was also felt by a victim in the technology sector who described a “work–life balance loss through extended hours of working weekends”. Another interviewee, who coordinated incident response, described how he personally provided impromptu childcare for one of their chief IT technicians, so that the technician could be “hands-on-keyboard”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those staff members who are not part of an organisation’s “core” ransomware response team also experience harm to their professional and private lives, although the nature of the harm may differ from that of those forming part of the “inner circle”. Those outside the immediate response team might feel “like really nobody had a handle on it” and feel left out of the communication loop, receiving little information about what is going on. Understandably, there is also a degree to which professional and personal life entwine, particularly where staff pursue their work as a personal passion. Interviewees also noted that some staff treated the ransomware attack as an opportunity – or impetus – to resign from their role or take retirement; for instance, educational staff who had lost many years’ worth of teaching materials. Another interviewee noted that staff who had been with their organisation for decades felt a form of “love” towards the archives of data that they had personally collected during their career, and felt bereft at the loss of this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many staff members experience different degrees of ransomware harm, which in turn have negative impacts on their professional and private lives. Such negative impacts are closely tied to the psychological impact staff members experience, again demonstrating the interconnectivity of harms – as well as the wide range of forms that psychological harm can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section has illustrated the categories of harm experienced by direct victims of ransomware attacks: that is, the organisations and staff members who experience the ransomware attack. Organisations face potential digital/physical, financial and reputational harm, while staff members may encounter financial, reputational, psychological, physical and social harm. Importantly, though, harm is also felt beyond these first-order harms, extending to those who indirectly experience harm as a result of a ransomware attack. The following sections illustrate what these second- and third-order harms can look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;second-order-harms&quot;&gt;Second-Order Harms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second category of harms involves organisations and individuals indirectly harmed by ransomware. The former group includes organisations that are customers/clients or in the supply chain of a victim entity that has had its IT systems encrypted or data stolen, while the latter group – individuals – refers to the customers or users of a public or private organisation that provides services or holds data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research conducted for this paper highlights that, the further “downstream” we get from the initial impact of the attack, the more challenging it is to effectively characterise and illustrate harms to organisations. However, the research has been able to identify a range of second-order harms to organisations and individuals through the interviews with direct victims, third-party experts and law enforcement, and via academic literature and media reporting. The results of a ransomware-harm modelling exercise conducted as part of this project and published as an academic conference paper have also been important in highlighting the different types of harms that can indirectly affect individuals, particularly healthcare patients and residents of local authorities that are affected by ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the various types of second-order harms from ransomware operations help emphasise their long tail and wide reach, shedding light on the various ways in which individuals are impacted by ransomware attacks. Ransomware attacks that disrupt the operations of businesses and public services have cascading effects that harm the lives of citizens of the UK and many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JEKyuJe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Types of Second-Order Harms Affecting Downstream Organisations and Individuals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second-Order Harms to Organisations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in Figure 4, ransomware operations have the potential to create a range of second-order harms for organisations and their employees, even when they are not directly targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks on outsourced IT services, such as managed service providers or cloud hosting providers, can harm organisations’ digital systems and data. A 2022 ransomware operation against Rackspace Technology, a cloud hosting provider, encrypted Microsoft Exchange email servers and caused thousands of SMEs to lose access to email services for several days. A more recent ransomware attack against CloudNordic, a cloud services provider, resulted in customers losing all their data after the company’s backups were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruptions to organisations’ supply chains and subsequent harms are not limited to ransomware attacks on technology providers. Nor are they a rare exception, with data indicating that 52% of firms say that one of their suppliers has experienced a ransomware attack. Physical supply chains can be particularly sensitive to ransomware harm: attacks against organisations in sectors such as manufacturing and logistics can create cascading effects that spread financial and reputational harm down the supply chain as suppliers and customers experience delays and loss of trust. One interviewee from the manufacturing sector, for example, highlighted how a ransomware attack against their company resulted in delays to their customers’ operations; in some cases, this resulted in customers finding new suppliers. Interviews also highlighted that being downstream from a ransomware attack can be even more challenging than being at the epicentre, as access to information about the attack may be much more limited. As a breach response lawyer argued, second-order harms may be “in a way, slightly worse, because you’re reliant on [the organisation experiencing the ransomware attack] for information … but they’re not going to be able to give you complete information in the early stages”. In some cases, suppliers experiencing ransomware attacks may even attempt to pretend the ransomware attack is not happening in an effort to reduce their own reputational harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, first- and second-order harms are not discrete – rather, they are closely linked. Severe second-order harms are likely to multiply the extent of harm or pressure on the direct victim organisation. For instance, an insurance claims handler recalled supporting an industrial system supplier to the fast food industry. The victim emphasised to the interviewee that their clients had zero tolerance for downtime; kitchens were supposed to be operating at full capacity in a context where fryers and other equipment would routinely break down, warranting rapid repair. If the victim could not return to operations within a matter of hours or days, they would be “booted off” contracts worth millions of pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also increasingly common for organisations to have data stolen by ransomware threat actors via their suppliers’ systems. When Capita, a major provider of outsourced IT services in the UK, was targeted by cyber-criminals using BlackBasta ransomware, more than 90 of its customers had data stolen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listing all the various potential types of financial, reputational, physical, psychological and social second-order harms to organisations and their employees from ransomware is beyond the scope of this paper, given that the interviews and workshops focused predominantly on the experiences of direct victims. However, it is reasonable to conclude that second-order harms may take a similar form to the first-order harms listed in the previous section, since they ultimately stem from disruption to business operations and the theft of data. In this sense, the harms experienced by third parties can be comparable to those experienced by the direct victim (rather than being seen as vicarious nuisance). As one breach response lawyer articulated, “If you’re reliant on someone that has an incident, you can’t do business as a result of their incident, then clearly you’re in a pretty similar position in a way, insofar as you may not be able to do business properly”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second-Order Harms to Individuals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware also creates a range of second-order harms – some of which are sector specific – for individuals downstream from the initial victim. Here, the term “individuals” refers to customers or users of goods and services, including people from groups such as hospital patients or schoolchildren. Given the digital dependencies of most businesses and service providers in modern economies and societies, individuals have significant exposure to ransomware harms. This paper’s research shows that individuals who are already vulnerable, such as patients seeking medical treatment or people receiving benefits, are disproportionately impacted by the indirect harm caused by ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing body of evidence that ransomware causes downstream harm to the physical health of individuals, most significantly when such harm reduces health outcomes at hospitals after attacks. Many ransomware groups have been ruthless in directly targeting hospitals and healthcare providers, showing scant regard for the impact on essential services and patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the attack on Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) by the Conti ransomware group illustrates, the disruption of IT services can cause cascading harms to clinical services and patients. Attacks against hospitals have forced elective surgeries to be cancelled and disrupted patient services such as cancer treatments. During the HSE attack, for instance, radiation therapy stopped at five centres, while 513 patients had their cancer treatment disrupted. In other cases, ransomware attacks have caused emergency services to be diverted to other hospitals; in critical care services, where minutes or hours can determine whether a patient lives or dies, these kinds of diversions can reduce survivability and recovery. One recent report has suggested that between 2016 and 2021, between 42 and 67 Medicare patients in the US died as a result of ransomware incidents, while several surveys and studies indicate that ransomware attacks are linked to increased mortality rates at affected hospitals. In a recent survey of healthcare professionals in the US by the Ponemon Institute, for example, 24% of respondents said their hospital experienced an increase in excess deaths following a ransomware attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other effects may be less noticeable, but nevertheless still degrade the quality of care individuals receive. Losing access to electronic health records, for instance, forces doctors and nurses to revert to pen and paper; this reduces productivity, which in turn limits the number of patients that can be treated. In the longer term, patients whose detailed records inform choices about their treatment receive less effective care if those records are inaccessible or corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can affect individuals’ physical health even if their healthcare provision is not disrupted. The attack on Hackney Council, for example, contributed to delays in repairs to social housing stock. According to reporting, one resident’s home suffered damp, mould and leaks after the council lost access to records about the property. Disruptions to the provision of social care can also cause physical harms: a disabled resident in Hackney told a journalist that the ransomware attack had prevented her from accessing social care services for several months – “I could not wash myself. I couldn’t wash my own hair”. These examples highlight how ransomware attacks against local government entities can be particularly harmful, due to the range of basic services these entities provide, further emphasising that it is the already vulnerable who are disproportionately affected by the second-order harms caused by ransomware attacks. Policymakers must consider what policy measures can be taken to protect these vulnerable people from such harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In extreme circumstances, the exfiltration and release of data also has the potential to expose individuals to varying degrees of personal physical risk. This stems from an emergent trend in which ransomware operators exfiltrate data from organisations that hold highly sensitive personal data – for instance, schools and law firms. A severe example highlighted in interviews was the possible doxing of relocated domestic abuse survivors following the theft of data from a law firm; the malicious public release of such data could put such individuals and those around them at extreme personal risk. An interviewee from the education sector recalled feeling relief when they realised that the ransomware operators involved in their attack had gained access to commercial data – including payroll – but did not get access to pupil safeguarding data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware also has the potential to harm individuals financially. In some cases, second-order financial harm can stem from disruption to particular financial services or goods; or, in a small number of cases, from the risks associated with stolen and leaked personal financial information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, ransomware operations against local authorities have disrupted residents’ ability to access housing benefits, again disproportionately impacting those who were already vulnerable. One senior leader at a council described the “massive disruption” to local residents, recounting that “people couldn’t pay their rent”. Hackney Council’s housing benefit services were also significantly impacted, and in July 2022 a news report suggested that a family of seven living in Hackney had been forced to leave their home because the council was unable to update their housing benefit payments. A UK law enforcement officer said that disruptions to state benefits “might stop [residents] being able to put food on the table for their kids”. Critically for policymakers, these examples highlight how personally ransomware attacks are experienced, and how already vulnerable groups are disproportionately affected by them – problems that require nuanced consideration when designing policy responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More intangible are the potential downstream impacts from ransomware attacks on the costs of goods and services for individual consumers. Although this research did not uncover specific evidence of price rises for consumers following ransomware attacks, a study by IBM highlights that 62% of firms affected by ransomware raised their prices in the aftermath. It is reasonable to expect that some price rises may be directly felt by individuals, particularly for consumer-facing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a small possibility that individuals whose personal data is stolen by ransomware operators may be personally extorted or defrauded by other cyber-criminals in the ransomware ecosystem. On a small number of occasions, threat actors have tried to personally extort individuals whose data has been stolen as part of a ransomware operation, the most notable example being the theft of healthcare data from a Finnish therapy provider by cyber-criminals, who then also extorted patients. However, interviewees highlighted that this example is likely to be the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An insurance claims interviewee recalled an attack on a private school, wherein the ransomware operators directly contacted pupils’ parents before delivering the ransomware payload. These fraudulent emails offered parents a 10% discount on forthcoming school fees if the parents made an expedited payment (to a false payment address). This reflects the relatively new ransomware attack model of “triple extortion”, wherein the threat actors not only encrypt and exfiltrate data held by the direct victim organisation, but also target secondary parties (clients) to solicit additional payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media reports on ransomware, particularly incidents involving large stolen datasets, often speculate that stolen and leaked personally identifiable information and financial details might be used for identity theft and fraud. However, the research conducted for this paper suggests that ransomware operators or other cyber-criminals are not monetising stolen personal data in a systematic way. Interviewees and workshop participants from incident response, law firms and law enforcement all emphasised there is little evidence that ransomware operators are cleaning and aggregating stolen data in a way that would allow them to sell it to other cyber-criminals or use it for financial fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are likely several reasons why ransomware criminals do not currently exploit stolen data for further criminal gains. First, for the time being, it is simply much more profitable for criminals in the ransomware ecosystem to engage in or enable extortion-based crimes. Second, it is costly and time consuming to host, clean and aggregate stolen data in a way that would be useful and monetisable. A ransomware negotiator noted that a personal record for an individual was likely to be worth between $1 and $4, thus offering limited profitability unless the dataset was ordered in a readily hostable and saleable format. The saleability of such data is also likely to be hampered by the cost of server storage and the unreliability of darknet-hosted platforms. As a lawyer involved in breach response explained, lawyers and forensic experts often take weeks or months (with the use of specialist software) trying to figure out what type of data has been stolen during a ransomware incident, a process which cyber-criminals are unlikely to have the resources or inclination to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors suggest that the potential financial harm to individuals from data stolen by ransomware threat actors is not as significant as many people believe. While policymakers must be aware that further extortion from leaked data is a possibility, this impact should not be overestimated, although this should certainly not distract attention from the concrete psychological harm that victims experience (and which is currently often overlooked). However, this does not rule out cyber-criminals or other threat actors exploiting this data in the future, particularly if technological changes enable them to aggregate it more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychological Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware can also cause psychological harm to individuals who are not involved with the immediate response or who do not work for the targeted organisation. Although the research conducted for this paper does not include interviews with victims from outside (direct) victim organisations, other sources such as media reporting, academic literature and our interviews with subject matter experts illustrate some of the negative impacts from ransomware on individuals’ mental health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, ransomware attacks that cause downtime for essential services like healthcare, local government and education can cause stress, anxiety, confusion and fear for the individuals who use these entities’ services. Beyond the immediate impact on physical health stemming from ransomware attacks on healthcare services, the mental health effects on patients and families have also been made clear in news coverage. Delays to important test results or outpatient services like cancer treatments or elective surgeries can cause distress and anxiety for patients and their families, as the attack against HSE illustrated. The interruption of local government services such as social care, housing and child benefits, and council housing can also lead to stress and even anger among affected residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the rise of double-extortion ransomware operations has created additional psychological harms for individuals whose data has been stolen and leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the concrete risk of fraud and identify theft related to data stolen by ransomware threat actors appears to be low, this is not the dominant public perception. As one incident response practitioner suggested, “you can’t necessarily reassure [people] who, through no fault of their own, have had all of their details compromised”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2yq5e5a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Ransomware Incidents Involving Exposure of Personal Data.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://therecord.media/ransomware-attacks-record-in-UK&quot;&gt;Alexander Martin, Ransomware Attacks Hit Record Level in UK, According to Neglected Official Data’, The Record, 12 September 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted in Figure 5, a range of personal data can be impacted by ransomware incidents. When particularly sensitive data, such as private photos or medical records, is stolen and leaked, it has the potential to create psychological harm such as considerable levels of stress, anxiety and embarrassment for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one legacy of the recent surge in ransomware attacks targeting schools is the exposure of large amounts of safeguarding data and other sensitive pupil records. Following a ransomware attack against Minneapolis schools in March 2023, threat actors leaked intimate and graphic reports about students that included descriptions of sexual assaults, domestic violence and mental health issues. Many of the most sensitive files were posted on Twitter and Facebook, increasing the chance of families and pupils discovering them. Although none of the UK schools interviewed had pupil data stolen and leaked, one leader at an academy trust emphasised that the attack on their schools caused fear among pupils, as they understood they were being targeted by criminals. And while the Minneapolis schools example comes from a US context, similar events could also occur in the UK. Moreover, the fact that ransomware threat actors are finding it harder to monetise their operations means that there is a risk of them adopting the kind of extreme “shaming” tactics like the ones used in the Minneapolis schools incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasising that first-order harms to organisations and second-order harms to individuals can flow in both directions. For instance, a client’s psychological distress may be sufficient for secondary victims to file legal action against organisations compromised by ransomware. In a recent case, patients launched a lawsuit against a cosmetic surgery provider after their pre- and post-operation photographs were leaked by ransomware operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second-order harms to organisations and individuals largely resemble the first-order harms. For organisations that experience indirect harm because a supplier has suffered a ransomware attack, this means they can still experience financial, reputational or physical/digital harm, but also often lack first-hand information about the evolving situation. Like the staff members who are direct victims of a ransomware attack, individuals outside the targeted organisation can also experience financial, psychological, or physical harm indirectly in the wake of the attack. Finally, although the risk to individuals due to ransomware operators’ theft of personal data is currently low, this calculus could change in the future if cyber-criminals develop the intent and capability to exploit such data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;third-order-harms&quot;&gt;Third-Order Harms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This category of harms describes the cumulative effects of ransomware incidents on a state’s economy, society and national security. Taken together, these harms emphasise the threat ransomware poses to states, as well as to organisations and individuals. It should be noted, however, that there are significant knowledge gaps about the impact of ransomware at a national level. This makes it challenging to assess the severity of the harm caused by ransomware to the UK and other countries, and creates the risk that governments will not prioritise and properly resource responses to ransomware. This chapter draws on examples from both the UK and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/197HLII.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Third-Order Harms to the Economy, National Security and Society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economic Harms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware has the potential to create considerable economic harm at a national level. However, there are significant challenges to be overcome when assessing the cost that ransomware exacts on the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted elsewhere in this paper, ransomware operations generate costs and losses for victims, reduce productivity, lead to missed opportunities for growth, and disrupt supply chains, in turn spreading financial harms downstream to businesses of all kinds and scales. Disruptions of specific sectors or of individual companies that have significant market share of niche (but essential) products for global or national supply chains also have the potential to cause economic harm. One recent example of this was a ransomware attack against MKS, a US manufacturer that produces specialist parts and tools that are essential for companies making semiconductor chips. The incident caused disruptions to the semiconductor supply chain – an essential component of modern digital infrastructure and the global economy. As the challenges posed by Covid-19, geopolitical tensions and energy price rises have highlighted in recent years, disruptions to supply chains can have a wide range of negative effects that reach into all corners of a modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensitivity of modern globalised supply chains means that disruption to the operations of just one contributory logical element – for instance, imports at ports – have the potential to cause economic harm at scale. An interviewee with first-hand experience of a protracted ransomware event in a developing country noted that its society had “a total dependency on the customs system. Therefore, when this service disappeared, the imports and exports disappeared, the fruits were lost by the docks, they rotted. The technological products that we import, they were blocked. Everything was scarce in the country”. Developed countries are also vulnerable to societal harms resulting from attacks on freight-related systems. A November 2023 incident against a shipping firm – responsible for 40% of Australian goods traffic – left shipping containers stuck at Australian ports. This incident reportedly threatened the supply of Christmas goods, risked higher inflation, and raised the prospect of a future interest rate increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while it is possible to describe the types of economic harms that ransomware causes a country, it is considerably more challenging to accurately calculate economic costs and losses. In order to assess the scale and scope of economic harm to the UK from ransomware, reliable costings for incidents are required, as well as aggregated quantitative data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing governmental, law enforcement and regulatory reporting mechanisms have several limitations in this regard. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has published data showing that since Q2 2019, there have been 1,940 ransomware incidents in the UK that required notification due to the risk to personal data. However, data protection reporting is not focused on financial costs, and many attacks may not require ICO notification if the incident only encrypts servers that do not hold personal data. Reporting of ransomware incidents to law enforcement, meanwhile, is likely much lower. The UK’s NCA, for instance, has estimated that less than 10% of victims report ransomware attacks to Action Fraud (the UK’s national centre for reporting fraud and cybercrime). Moreover, existing Action Fraud reporting mechanisms are not designed to capture the variety of costs and losses that ransomware imposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the section on first-order financial harms, surveys and other forms of research by cyber security vendors can shed some light on mean/median financial costs. Sophos’s annual survey on ransomware includes figures on ransom payments, recovery costs and loss of business (although the 2023 version did not include these for the UK), while IBM’s annual Cost of a Data Breach report also includes the average cost of a ransomware attack. Coveware, an incident response firm specialising in ransomware, also produces quarterly reports on mean/median ransom payments and incident length. However, there is no standardised approach for calculating the costs and losses from ransomware, or their long-tail financial impact on other organisations, individuals or the economy. As a 2021 report from the US’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency highlighted, there are considerable barriers to putting a value on the economic harm of ransomware and cyber incidents, be it for an individual victimised organisation or a country’s economy as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harms to National Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware is now widely considered to be a threat to national security in the US, Germany, Canada and the UK, among others. Two primary harms to national security emanate from ransomware: the disruption of CNI and strategic sectors, with knock-on effects on economic prosperity and public safety; and the strategic advantage that ransomware can create for hostile states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware operations targeting CNI in a number of different countries are now well publicised. The disruption of emergency services, energy infrastructure, telecommunications and healthcare has demonstrated the ability (or potential) of ransomware threat actors to cause harms to public safety. In some cases, ransomware operations have explicit implications for national defence. There are now several examples of cyber-criminals targeting defence and aerospace companies, disrupting defence supply chains, or stealing sensitive data on intellectual property or military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of ransomware has also created strategic advantages for some states hostile to the UK and its allies. In the case of North Korea, ransomware operations by threat actors linked to the North Korean state are primarily financially motivated and aim to generate revenue for the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Russian-speaking ransomware ecosystem provides a number of advantages to the Russian state. Although the Russian state does not direct all cyber activity that emanates from within its borders, it provides a safe harbour, maintains close ties to some cyber-criminals or groups, and co-opts them or their capabilities for its own needs. In 2019, the US Treasury highlighted the direct relationship between Evil Corp, a Russian cyber-criminal organisation responsible for a number of ransomware attacks, and Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB); the same US Treasury advisory note suggested that Maksim Yakubets, one of the leaders of Evil Corp, was directly tasked by the FSB to conduct cyber espionage on its behalf. In a similar vein, the organised cyber-criminal group linked to the Conti ransomware operation was reportedly tasked by the FSB to collect intelligence on researchers at Bellingcat, an investigative non-profit organisation whose reporting has frequently embarrassed the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ransomware ecosystem also provides more indirect benefits to the Russian state. Russian intelligence units can benefit from using services, malware or tools developed by the criminal ecosystem to augment their own capabilities or provide plausible deniability for their own operations. Moreover, while the vast majority of ransomware operations conducted by Russian cyber-criminals are financially, rather than ideologically, motivated, the fact that they harm the economic and societal resilience of the Kremlin’s adversaries in North America and Europe is a useful by-product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Societal Harm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been argued elsewhere, ransomware creates a range of societal harms. Disruption of basic services, the diversion of resources from other priorities, and citizens’ potential loss of trust in the state to protect them all illustrate the impact of ransomware on modern societies. These types of harm are arguably less well understood or prioritised than those that more obviously affect economic prosperity and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As highlighted earlier in this paper, the disruption of healthcare providers can degrade the quality of care that individual patients receive. Several participants stressed that the HSE incident in Ireland was one of the most impactful ransomware cases they had seen. Harms to patient care can extend beyond the blast radius of an incident: one study in the US, for instance, showed that any hospitals physically adjacent to a hospital directly disrupted by a ransomware attack also experienced drops in their quality of patient care. On a broader scale, ransomware operations targeting the healthcare sector can have cascading impacts that undermine the state’s ability to provide or protect healthcare services. In national healthcare systems like the UK’s NHS, single incidents can have systemic effects. In August 2022, for example, a ransomware operation against Advanced, a major NHS IT provider, caused disruption to NHS services that lasted for months, degrading the quality of patient care and increasing the workload of administrative and medical staff who were already under strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of ransomware on educational institutions also has societal implications. Although the UK government does not currently designate education as part of the country’s CNI, it plays an essential role in maintaining the development of a well-functioning society. Ransomware operations targeting the sector have grown in frequency, with one ransomware threat actor, Vice Society, seemingly deliberately targeting schools and universities. Although none of the interviewees from the education sector believed that the incidents involving their schools or universities caused lasting harm to students’ education or outcomes, such attacks create significant recovery costs for victims, and are often timed to coincide with the beginning of the school or academic year so as to maximise disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the immediate impact on the quality of life, wellbeing and development of citizens, ransomware operations against basic services also create significant opportunity costs and diversion of resources away from other priorities. Although these impacts also affect other organisations affected by ransomware, these types of harms, when inflicted on providers of public services, have societal implications. In the UK, ransomware attacks involving the NHS, state education or local authorities take place within a broader context of acute public spending constraints. At the time of writing, for instance, Hackney Council had spent £12.2 million on recovering from the attack in 2020, having previously experienced nearly a decade of some of the highest budget cuts in the country. One interviewee from a UK local authority described how their council had been forced to use up most of its reserves to recover from an attack, diverting resources from other pressing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the prevalence of ransomware has the potential to undermine trust in the state. The workshops and interviews highlighted the low level of confidence that many victims and ransomware response providers have in the ability of the UK government (or law enforcement) to protect UK organisations or disrupt ransomware threat actors. If citizens perceive the security of public services and data as being in doubt, they may lose confidence in the ability of law enforcement and government to protect them. One recent study of a ransomware attack against a hospital in Düsseldorf, Germany observed a sharp reduction in the local population’s trust in the government and security agencies after the attack. At present, though, there is little evidence that ransomware specifically has caused the UK public to lose trust in the NCSC or in law enforcement, although this could change if there were to be a significant attack against CNI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is often challenging to directly link specific developments to a ransomware attack or to put a number on the financial cost of third-order societal harm caused by such attacks, the interview data has illustrated repeatedly that the harm caused by ransomware attacks has implications for wider society and national security, be it due to the interplay of cyber-criminals and state actors, or to the cumulative effects of ransomware harms on individuals, organisations, the economy and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-implications-for-policy-and-future-research&quot;&gt;III. Implications for Policy and Future Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has described the wide range of harms that ransomware attacks can cause and has provided examples of how victims – organisations as well as individuals – and countries experience these harms. In doing so, it starts to fill the knowledge gaps surrounding the ways ransomware causes harm to organisations, individuals and the UK as a whole. Deeper knowledge of these vectors of harm is critical to designing better responses to the ransomware threat and mitigating harm to victims. Several key findings from the research are important for pushing forward ransomware policy and future research. The next paper from this project will provide recommendations on how to mitigate some of the challenges laid out below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-there-is-generally-a-low-level-of-understanding-of-the-long-term-economic-impact-of-ransomware-attacks&quot;&gt;1. There is generally a low level of understanding of the long-term economic impact of ransomware attacks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, there are ongoing efforts within the UK government to calculate the economic impact of ransomware on the UK. Mobilising political will, prioritising intelligence and law enforcement resources, and building industry support for combating ransomware are to some extent all predicated on a clear costing of the harm being done to businesses and the UK economy. This paper has highlighted the wide range of costs, losses and downstream economic harms that must be included in any effort to calculate the economic impact of ransomware on the UK, but also the numerous challenges in doing so. For example, the costs of psychological harm caused to victims (impacting their productivity) and the long-term costs that might arise from additional staff turnover do not seem to be captured in interviewees’ financial assessments, which focus predominantly on immediate costs – especially those that are recoverable via insurance. Including long-term and indirect costs, although methodologically challenging, would paint a more accurate picture of the true financial harm caused by ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these reporting challenges for governments and law enforcement, there is little evidence that victims or ransomware response services are collecting data on the full range of financial costs and losses from ransomware. This is partly due to the methodologically challenging nature of this task, but such data gathering is also hampered by the fact that many victims may not be resourced to assess the impact of incidents on their finances; moreover, victims sometimes have very little interest in dwelling on incidents. A number of interviewees highlighted that their organisation wanted to “move on” in the aftermath of a ransomware attack, with little desire to measure or quantify long-term financial harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as victims are unlikely to have a comprehensive understanding of the financial harm inflicted, no stakeholder in the ransomware ecosystem possesses the long-term insights or general overview that would make possible an assessment of the wider economic harm. The other parties in the ecosystem (for instance, incident responders, insurers, legal counsel, law enforcement and regulators) only have limited insights into specific aspects of the financial harms and are therefore unable to collate all the information that is needed to make a comprehensive assessment of long-term financial harm. Likewise, it is unlikely that any other party would feel it was their responsibility to take on such a burdensome task. Consequently, it is unlikely that we will attain a comprehensive picture of long-term financial harm in the near future, meaning that the current figures probably underestimate the level of financial harm, since they are unlikely to have taken into account other forms of indirect additional costs or financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-reputational-harm-is-a-major-concern-for-organisations-but-may-be-overestimated-by-victims-in-some-contexts&quot;&gt;2. Reputational harm is a major concern for organisations, but may be overestimated by victims in some contexts.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the interview data confirmed that victims have a considerable fear of reputational harm, and that this often guides their response to incidents, the actual degree of reputational harm stemming specifically from data theft/exposure is not always as significant as imagined. Customers and clients can be forgiving, potentially indicating a wider societal acceptance that cyber security breaches cannot always be prevented. However, poor communication practices, both internally and externally, may have significant reputational consequences, as may the risk of data exfiltration. Reputational harm is also to some extent business- and sector-specific, and tightly interconnected with financial harm. Businesses that rely on continuous operations or that hold particularly sensitive information are more susceptible to reputational harm, which can lead directly to financial harm. Public sector organisations, on the other hand, are less exposed to reputational harm given that they often have a monopoly on the provision of basic services and that their funding is less dependent on reputational standing. While reputational harm should not be overlooked, the fact that such harm is often not as serious as some victims fear has important implications for organisations which believe that, in order to protect their reputation, they need to pay ransoms so that ransomware threat actors will delete stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-there-is-currently-little-evidence-that-exfiltrated-data-is-systematically-exploited-for-further-criminal-activities&quot;&gt;3. There is currently little evidence that exfiltrated data is systematically exploited for further criminal activities.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is wider concern about the potential for leaked data obtained in ransomware attacks to be exploited for fraud or other criminal activity, we have not found evidence that the ransomware ecosystem is exploiting stolen and leaked data in a systematic way. For the time being, exploiting stolen data is less profitable than extortion-based crime. While developments in cybercrime (particularly the skills and methods of large-scale data analysis) are likely to impact criminal practices in the future – with criminals potentially revisiting previously exploited data – our research indicates that such data is currently not being systematically exploited for criminal gains. This finding has implications for victims who believe they should pay ransoms to mitigate some of the risk from stolen and exfiltrated personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-psychological-harm-to-staff-and-individuals-is-significantly-overlooked-both-in-public-discourse-and-in-organisational-responses-to-ransomware-attacks&quot;&gt;4. Psychological harm to staff and individuals is significantly overlooked, both in public discourse and in organisational responses to ransomware attacks.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the fear of reputational harm among victims is perhaps overstated in many instances, the opposite is true with regard to the psychological impacts of ransomware attacks, which are relatively neglected. Interviews highlighted that the psychological harm to staff is significantly overlooked, both in wider reporting and in organisational responses to ransomware attacks. Interviewees also repeatedly stressed that IT teams in particular suffer the psychological impacts of ransomware attacks. To reduce the harm caused by ransomware attacks, addressing the psychological impact on staff (and other individuals) needs to be at the centre of responses to a ransomware incident. This would involve not only raising awareness of potential psychological harm, but also ensuring that crisis management best practices focus on mitigating psychological harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-the-second--and-third-order-harms-from-ransomware-attacks-disproportionately-affect-vulnerable-groups&quot;&gt;5. The second- and third-order harms from ransomware attacks disproportionately affect vulnerable groups.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks start by harming technology and organisations, but ultimately lead to harm to individuals. However, the effects on individuals are not felt equally. As noted above, within organisations, certain members of staff will likely experience more harm than others. Similarly, the external, downstream effects of ransomware may affect certain groups disproportionately. This is underlined by the impact that attacks on schools, hospitals, law firms that hold sensitive data, and local government services, have on vulnerable groups such as schoolchildren, healthcare patients and residents who rely on benefits or social care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-government-responses-to-ransomware-must-focus-more-on-highlighting-and-reducing-societal-harms-rather-than-focusing-solely-on-economic-harms&quot;&gt;6. Government responses to ransomware must focus more on highlighting and reducing societal harms, rather than focusing solely on economic harms.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By targeting essential public services and other forms of CNI, ransomware harms the physical and mental health, development and prosperity of UK citizens. However, the enduring focus on the financial costs of ransomware risks making wider societal impacts seem abstract and unrelatable to policymakers and the public. In the simplest terms, ransomware has the potential to ruin lives. More openness and clarity about the impact of ransomware on society may help to galvanise efforts, boost resources and increase the political will to find solutions. People – whether politicians or individual citizens – might be more likely to publicly categorise the cumulative effect of ransomware as a societal or national security risk if they knew that many cyber-criminals, some harboured by hostile states, regularly disrupt the services that are an essential part of modern society such as GP appointments, schools, and having rubbish bins collected by local councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has underlined how impactful ransomware is upon individuals, organisations and wider society. Different forms of harm are felt by a wide range of individuals and groups, who are impacted directly or indirectly. To foster a better understanding of the necessity and nature of policy interventions, it is vital that policymakers understand the scale and breadth of ransomware harms. While ransomware crime is an intractable contemporary issue with no immediate solution, action, where it is applied, should seek to increase resilience and alleviate harms. Greater attention urgently needs to be paid to the human impact of ransomware attacks, be it the psychological harm often overlooked in the wider discourse or the fact that vulnerable groups such as patients and benefits recipients are disproportionately impacted by ransomware harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware attacks remain a threat to individuals and organisations across the UK and indeed the globe. While the wider focus of reporting is often on the financial implications of ransomware attacks, this paper has set out a detailed analysis of different kinds of harm experienced directly or indirectly by ransomware victims and by society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data has suggested a framework including first-, second- and third-order harms to assist in distinguishing between those directly impacted by ransomware, those indirectly impacted, and the cumulative effect ransomware has on society at large. Within each order of harm, this paper identified several categories of harm, such as financial, psychological or reputational harm, and provided numerous examples of how such harm is experienced by victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key findings based on this research underline that the psychological impact of ransomware attacks is significantly overlooked, and that currently no-one has a full understanding of the economic impact of ransomware attacks, such that the cost of the long-term and indirect financial harms is likely to be missing from current estimates of the economic harm caused by ransomware attacks. While the reputational harm stemming from a ransomware attack is a valid concern for some companies, especially those whose clients expect a higher level of privacy (such as customers of legal or financial services), the danger of reputational harm is often overestimated by victims. Similarly, the feared impact of exfiltrated data being used to cause further harm through financial fraud or other crime was not confirmed by interviewees. Instead, interview data showed that groups that are already vulnerable, such as benefits recipients or healthcare patients, are disproportionately impacted by ransomware harm. Finally, the paper found that government responses to ransomware attacks must focus on preventing societal harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s detailed account of the ways in which ransomware attacks negatively impact individuals, organisations and society offers new insights into the actual harm caused by ransomware attacks. Although naturally limited, given that it reflects interview data and contemporary criminal activities that must be expected to evolve, the framework proposed in this paper will allow policymakers and practitioners – as well as those preparing for a potential cyber incident – to understand the ways in which victims are negatively impacted by ransomware attacks. This knowledge provides a critical baseline understanding for taking effective steps to mitigate such harm, both when responding or preparing for individual instances but also when designing policy interventions to tackle the ransomware threat. The framework further offers a valuable starting point for future analysis and data gathering, as findings from further research can be incorporated into the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

To cover this gap, the United States and its partners need to explore a variety of promising technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to help the defense industry and governments identify future capabilities to deal with the rising challenge from China. The AUKUS agreement has been a major development in facing this challenge, but insights here apply to the full spectrum of U.S. allies and partners in the Pacific. Although strategists seek to expand the number of submarines, the U.S. submarine fleet will not grow beyond its current size until the 2040s. Thus, the project studies wargames and the war in Ukraine to identify ways for the United States and its partners to manage this submarine gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-challenge-ahead&quot;&gt;The Challenge Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for action is clear. China’s military buildup is well documented and continuing. Its fleet now outnumbers the U.S. Navy, and its ground-based missile force is massive. The United States has many partners and allies in the region, but the lack of an integrating structure like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) means that any coalition responding to Chinese aggression must be developed bilaterally. This requires U.S. presence and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUKUS agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States represents a major development in the Western Pacific. Pillar 1 of the agreement will develop an Australian nuclear submarine capability and enhance U.S. submarine presence in Australia. Pillar 2 seeks to share emerging technologies across the three countries. The insights of this report relate particularly to Pillar 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategists inside and outside of government see submarines as a key capability in a conflict with China because of the stealth and firepower of these platforms. They have proposed U.S. submarine fleets ranging in size from 66 to 78 vessels, compared to the current fleet of 53. However, the U.S. submarine fleet will decline through the 2020s due to a lack of submarine construction in the 1990s, reaching a low of 46 in 2030 before rebuilding and returning to the current level in the late 2030s. Fleet levels after that are highly speculative, but even under optimistic circumstances, the submarine fleet will not reach the size targeted by strategists until the 2040s or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;filling-the-gap&quot;&gt;Filling the Gap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should the United States and its partners do to manage the impending gap in submarine numbers over the coming decades?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wargames of a Chinese invasion, blockade, or gray zone squeeze of Taiwan illuminate capabilities that would be helpful. Early assessments of the war in Ukraine give additional insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following provides a thematic menu of possibilities. Some are available in the near term, while others are possible in the longer term. Not all will work out, but many could evolve into programs of record that would balance China’s military buildup, enhance deterrence, and strengthen warfighting if deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make existing submarines more effective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Large uncrewed underwater vessels (UUVs) can operate autonomously inside the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Medium UUVs can extend the reach of individual submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced submarine maintenance would increase the number of operational submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring more forces to bear more effectively:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deployable command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) packages would allow U.S. forces to link more effectively with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contractors can expand coalition training without diverting military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational contracting can supplement limited military logistics units in providing the logistics needed to cover the vast expanses of the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan to operate in a hostile environment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispersed aircraft basing complicates Chinese targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building hardened aircraft shelters would protect aircraft remaining at large bases during conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stronger surface ship defenses would allow operations deeper inside the Chinese defensive zone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assisting Taiwan in developing a balanced force with both traditional and asymmetric capabilities would hedge against the spectrum of threats it faces, from gray zone harassment to invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sustaining efforts to build resilience against cyberattacks would help prevent such attacks from having an operational or strategic effect even if they cannot be fully thwarted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Backup systems for communications and geolocation would provide a hedge against jamming and GPS spoofing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Peacetime preparations can enhance wartime operations in an environment where logistics are contested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedge against unconventional threats:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stronger countermine capabilities, long neglected by the U.S. Navy, would protect against a common adversary tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter-swarming capabilities would allow military and civilian ships to continue operations without resorting to lethal force against harassing elements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) could be used to harass Chinese harassers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defend against air threats in all their manifestations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded defenses against cruise and ballistic missiles would protect forces against an expanding and constantly evolving threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding and fielding systems to counter adversary UASs would protect friendly forces from adversary reconnaissance and attack amid the ubiquity of such systems on the battlefield, and defensive systems against aircraft are generally too expensive for this use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think offensively, even when on the defensive:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced jamming and counter-C3I would disrupt China’s ability to coordinate forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) can extend the awareness and reach of crewed vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UASs can perform missions that are too dangerous, extended, or monotonous for crewed platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hypersonic missiles, even if niche weapons, can contribute to campaigns by attacking high-value, well-defended targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sea mines with standoff capabilities can emplace minefields with less risk to the launch platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report does not make recommendations on which of these capabilities to pursue. That requires an in-depth analysis of each capability’s cost, technological maturity, operational effectiveness, and political acceptability. The report does recommend moving forward across many possibilities to illuminate the most promising approaches and to provide signals to industry about where it should focus its attention and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-this-study&quot;&gt;Why This Study?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific security has been at the top of the national security agenda since at least 2014, when the Obama administration announced an end to the United States’ focus on counterinsurgency and regional stability and laid out five challenges: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorism. China was challenge number two after Russia, which had just occupied Crimea. The Trump administration continued this framework, clearly articulated a new focus on great power conflict, and moved China to the top position ahead of Russia. The Biden administration has essentially continued this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most dramatic recent event in this space has been the signing of the AUKUS agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to develop a nuclear-powered Australian submarine fleet and share key technologies. The challenge from China and the AUKUS response has spawned a wide variety of analyses. This study adds to that body of research by focusing on one key question: What promising technologies are available in the near and mid-term to enhance capabilities while the United States and its partners wait for this expanded submarine force to arrive? The report aims to help industry work with governments to pursue these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report does not claim to be a comprehensive analysis of what is needed to compete against China. That would include new operational concepts, force posture, force readiness, force size and structure, relations with partners and allies, and budget — all important topics but beyond the scope of this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this short introduction, the report is organized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 examines today’s security environment in the Western Pacific, including a brief overview of the challenge from China, U.S. alliances and partnerships in the region, and finally the AUKUS agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 describes what wargames and campaign analyses say about potentially useful capabilities. The chapter concludes with insights from the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4 analyzes the U.S. submarine fleet and the submarine industrial base. It concludes that while additional submarines would provide critical capabilities, the U.S. submarine fleet will decline through the mid-2030s. Therefore, enhanced near and midterm capabilities will need to come from elsewhere to meet China’s rising military challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Chapter 5 pulls all these threads together. It identifies capabilities that should be expanded, technological areas for exploration, and some services that the defense industry might provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;todays-security-environment-in-the-western-pacific&quot;&gt;Today’s Security Environment in the Western Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China’s Challenge, U.S. Alliances, and AUKUS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter sets the stage by exploring three key elements of today’s security environment in the Western Pacific: the China challenge, U.S. alliances and partnerships, and the AUKUS agreement. These shape the military requirements the United States, Australia, and other partners must meet to compete in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-challenge&quot;&gt;China’s Challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonplace to note how China has become increasingly assertive diplomatically and politically, backed by a massive military expansion. This assertiveness arises from China’s view of itself as an alternative to the U.S.-led international system based on free markets and democratic values. As a result, the Biden administration’s National Security Strategy identifies China as the primary global competitor to the United States: “The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power.” In response, Congress has taken several legislative actions, from bolstering U.S. semiconductor manufacturing via the CHIPS Act of 2022 to cutting off U.S. funding from Chinese entities that abuse human rights via the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021. The House of Representatives has created a committee focused on China: the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To implement its new strategic vision, China began a long-term military modernization program in the late 1990s, focusing particularly on air and maritime capabilities. This was a change from China’s previous military strategy, which was land-focused, relied on masses of poorly trained conscripts, and could not exert influence at a distance from its borders. Its poor performance in the 1979 border war with Vietnam underscored its weakness, as did the 1996 transit of the Taiwan Strait by U.S. naval forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has changed. As the Department of Defense (DOD)’s annual assessment of Chinese military power notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, the PRC turned to the PLA [People’s Liberation Army] as an increasingly capable instrument of statecraft. Throughout the year, the PLA adopted more coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific region while accelerating its development of capabilities and concepts to strengthen the PRC’s ability to “fight and win wars” against a “strong enemy,” counter an intervention by a third party in a conflict along the PRC’s periphery, and to project power globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NeJQJ5O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Map 1: Taiwan and Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD report also documents the continuing expansion of the Chinese military. The Chinese navy — the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) — grew from 216 ships in 2005 to 351 ships in 2022, making it nearly 60 ships larger than the U.S. Navy. China’s nuclear modernization has accelerated, growing from 300 to 500 nuclear warheads, “exceed[ing] some of our [DOD’s] previous expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This military buildup and assertive diplomacy — characterized in China as a “wolf warrior” attitude — pose challenges to countries in the region. Three challenges — to Taiwan, Japan, and the South China Sea region — are particularly important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; China has been emphatic that Taiwan is a part of greater China. It therefore regards Taiwan as a renegade province, not an independent or autonomous entity. China has also been clear about its intention to reunite Taiwan with the mainland and that it will not renounce the use of force to achieve reunification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan and China have a long history of conflict, from the Mongol invasions of the thirteenth century to the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s and 1940s. Recently, those tensions have focused on the Senkaku Islands (called the Diaoyu Islands by China), which both nations claim. China has sailed warships near Japan and fired missiles into Japan’s Exclusive Economic Zone. Japan also has concerns about China’s client, North Korea, which has launched missiles over Japan and regularly threatens nuclear holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South China Sea region:&lt;/strong&gt; Although recent attention has focused on Taiwan, the South China Sea is also a region of intense competition. The region is important because of the high level of seaborne traffic and large oil and gas deposits. China’s infamous “nine-dash line,” by which China seeks to claim most of the South China Sea, exacerbates regional tensions. These claims have put China in competition with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, which also have territorial claims. China has been aggressive in asserting its claims, including by building and fortifying artificial islands in the region, demanding that ships and aircraft recognize an expanded Chinese identification zone, and harassing the ships of other nations. Such tactics were seen recently as China endeavored to prevent the Philippines from resupplying a garrison in the Second Thomas Shoals. The United States does not take a position on territorial claims but regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations in the region, to which China strongly objects&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Admiral Philip S. Davidson, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) until April 2021, testified the same year that the Chinese threat to invade Taiwan “is manifest . . . in the next six years.” . . . The notion of a “Davidson window” has thus entered the national security vocabulary.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alliances-and-partnerships&quot;&gt;Alliances and Partnerships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a strong set of Pacific alliances with a variety of wealthy, powerful, and strategically located nations. In addition, the United States has less formal security links to many other countries. However, all these relationships are bilateral, not united through a common structure like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As a result, nations will react individually to any crisis. Such ally countries include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia:&lt;/strong&gt; The Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty) binds the United States, Australia, and New Zealand to meet common dangers together, and the countries have a long security relationship, having fought side by side in six wars: World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and Iraq. The relationship has become closer with the AUKUS agreement (discussed later) and regular rotations of U.S. aircraft and Marines to bases in northern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;China has attempted to squeeze Australia economically to make Australia’s policies more China friendly. For example, in 2020, after Canberra questioned the origins of Covid-19, China imposed restrictions on the import of Australian beef, wine, and other commodities. This alerted Australia to the dangers that China posed. In a 2022 event held at CSIS, Australian deputy prime minister and defense minister Richard Marles noted, “For the first time in decades, we are thinking hard about the security of our own strategic geography; the viability of our trade and supply routes; and above all the preservation of an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Australia is a strong democracy with high-quality armed forces. As Australia’s 2023 Defence Strategic Review states, a close relationship with the United States has ensured that, since the 1960s, “While small in size, the ADF [Australian Defense Force] was [is] highly capable and could outmatch potential regional opponents in critical areas of technology, planning, and operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The downside is that Australia’s armed forces are relatively small, and Australia is far from some potential conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan are bound through the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security of 1960. This authorizes the United States to station troops in Japan and obligates the parties to defend each other if either is attacked on the territories administered by Japan. This alliance is particularly important because 53,600 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, about half on Okinawa. The Japanese constitution allows the country to maintain only self-defense forces as a result of the country’s defeat in World War II; indeed, its military is called the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force. For decades, Japanese governments have defined self-defense as 1 percent of GDP and focused on defensive weapons. However, in response to China’s aggressiveness, Japan has made plans to acquire more offensive weapons, increase its defense budget above the traditional 1 percent, and conduct exercises aimed at China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and South Korea are bound through the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty. As a result of the Korean War of 1950 to 1953, the United States still has 24,300 troops stationed in the country and a joint military command with the South Korean armed forces. The Mutual Defense Treaty obligates the parties to defend each other if either is attacked in the Pacific on territories under their administrative control. South Korea has powerful armed forces, but they are designed for national defense. Although South Korea sent combat troops to Vietnam and peacekeepers to Afghanistan, the willingness of the South Koreans to participate in conflict outside of the Korean Peninsula is unclear. South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol has strengthened ties with the United States and other regional partners such as Japan and has been willing to criticize China. However, he has stated that in the event of a U.S. conflict with China, South Korea would keep its forces at home to deter any aggression by North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Philippines:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the Philippines are linked through the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty and a long history of mutual security arrangements dating back to when the Philippines was a U.S. colony. Although the United States has provided equipment and training over the years, the Philippine armed forces are relatively limited, being equipped with older equipment. A major recent development is a set of agreements by which the Philippines granted the United States access to nine bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thailand:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Thailand are bound to defend each other’s territory in the Asia-Pacific by the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty of 1954. As a result, the countries conduct regular military exercises together. However, Thailand’s military forces are weak, as are its democratic institutions. This limits the strength of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to formal alliances, the United States has security relationships with several countries in the region:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the United States has no formal security agreement with Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 states, “Any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes is considered a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States.” For decades, U.S. policy has been governed by “strategic ambiguity” regarding how the United States would react to any Chinese attack on Taiwan. However, Congress and President Biden have recently indicated that the United States would defend Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singapore:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Singapore have an agreement that allows U.S. access to port facilities in the city-state but are not formal allies. Singapore’s legendary founder, Lee Kuan Yew, established this relationship after the United Kingdom withdrew from Asia in the 1960s, and it has since been a central element of Singapore’s security architecture. However, that close relationship has faded somewhat since Lee’s death in 2015, and most Singaporeans now view China more positively than the United States. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has stated that Singapore does not want to choose sides in a U.S.-China war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India:&lt;/strong&gt; India is a major military power with nuclear weapons and 1,460,000 personnel on active duty in its armed forces. It is also intensely independent, being one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement. It resists the establishment of formal alliances. However, increased tensions with China have compelled India to augment security ties with partners, including the United States, Australia, and Japan. India has been incrementally diversifying its defense imports away from Russia while attempting to jump-start a stronger indigenous defense manufacturing base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vietnam:&lt;/strong&gt; Once bitter enemies, Vietnam and the United States have been pushed together by mutual concerns about China. China is Vietnam’s traditional enemy, having occupied the country at various times in the past and most recently having fought a border war in 1979. Although Vietnam has large ground forces — its army numbers 412,000 personnel — its air and naval forces are limited, and it is overshadowed militarily by China. Therefore, Vietnam is unlikely to participate in a U.S.-China conflict unless attacked directly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that the United States will be able to draw on support from many other countries in the event of a crisis or a conflict. However, the amount and nature of the support will depend on the circumstances. Further, any action will require U.S. leadership since all these relationships are bilateral. There is no substitute for U.S. forces and presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aukus&quot;&gt;AUKUS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS is a defense collaboration between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that was initially announced in September 2021. A joint report followed from defense industry associations in the three countries. In March 2023, the three countries signed a trilateral agreement describing how AUKUS would be operationalized. The agreement aims to “boost defense capabilities, accelerate technological integration, and expand the industrial capacity of all three nations.” On December 2, 2023, the AUKUS defense ministers met, reaffirmed the three nations’ commitment to the program, and elaborated on implementation plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Any action will require U.S. leadership since all these relationships are bilateral. There is no substitute for U.S. forces and presence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS has two pillars. Pillar 1 will assist Australia in acquiring conventionally armed nuclear attack submarines (SSNs). Under the agreement, the United States will sell Australia three to five Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s. The United States will also base a submarine rotational force in western Australia as early as 2027. Starting in 2032, the United Kingdom and Australia will co-develop a new nuclear-powered submarine class to enter service in the late 2030s, with initial production in the UK and later production in Australia. The three nations will cooperate to build a stronger trilateral submarine industrial base. The additional submarine capacity will increase Australia’s ability to defend its sea routes from Chinese interference. The United Kingdom has recently signed contracts for £4 billion ($5 billion) to develop the new submarine design. In addition to submarine construction, Pillar 1 calls for rotating U.S. submarines to Australia’s west coast and enhanced basing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS Pillar 2 seeks to enhance cooperation in key technological and functional areas. Eight intragovernmental working groups coordinate Pillar 2 activities: undersea capabilities, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities, electronic warfare, innovation, and information sharing. The defense ministers identified six capability areas for cooperation (anti-submarine warfare, undersea vehicle launch and recovery, quantum positioning, navigation, and timing, and resilient and autonomous artificial intelligence. The defense ministers also specified a variety of processes and structures for coordinating capability development and conducting experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pillar 2 activities are expected to help fill the partnership’s capability gaps in the decades before Pillar 1’s SSN procurement activities take effect. A recent technology readiness experiment (dubbed T-REX 23-2) moved Pillar 2 forward by evaluating 11 advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement has received tremendous fanfare and has the potential for unprecedented military and industrial cooperation among the participants. The deal is particularly important to Australia, as AUKUS is one of the largest military projects the country has ever undertaken. However, as one U.S. official described it, AUKUS will remain a promise rather than a reality for many years. It has great future potential but involves modest steps in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-war-and-wargames-say-about-conflict-in-the-western-pacific&quot;&gt;What War and Wargames Say about Conflict in the Western Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three potential conflicts in the Western Pacific are particularly important to examine because of their plausibility, potential severity, and relevance to AUKUS commitments. The first is a full-scale conventional war between China and a U.S.-led coalition. The second is a blockade of Taiwan. The third is Chinese gray zone activities, particularly in the South China Sea. Collectively, these describe the broad set of military demands that would be put on the United States and its partners and that AUKUS needs to hedge against. Wargames and associated analyses can illuminate the nature of such conflicts and the military requirements that flow from them. A real war — the Russian invasion of Ukraine — provides additional insights. Many other potential conflicts, such as North Korean aggression, constitute serious threats but are less relevant to the AUKUS agreement and competition with China because the conflict would be relatively low-tech (except for missiles and nuclear weapons) and mainly on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-invasion-of-taiwan&quot;&gt;Chinese Invasion of Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in the first chapter, China has been unrelenting in its goal of uniting Taiwan with the mainland. A Chinese military invasion of Taiwan may not be the most likely course of action to accomplish this goal. However, given China’s rhetoric and military buildup, an invasion is plausible and the most dangerous Chinese course of action. Several Taiwan-focused wargames warrant consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSIS Wargame:&lt;/strong&gt; For the reasons described above, CSIS conducted a project that examined Taiwan invasion scenarios. The project developed a wargame and ran 25 iterations in a dozen scenarios. Because the wargame was based entirely on unclassified information, the project could describe the assumptions, mechanics, and results in detail. Several findings bear on requirements for future capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Submarines were highly lethal. Whereas surface ships had to pull back in the face of the Chinese anti-ship missile threat, submarines could push into the Chinese defensive bubble, often called the anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) zone or weapons engagement zone. Once inside the Taiwan Strait, they rapidly exhausted their inventories of missiles and torpedoes against the Chinese invasion fleet. Indeed, the project dubbed this the “happy time” for U.S. submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their ability to strike the Chinese center of gravity, the amphibious ships, made them particularly valuable. However, once submarines expended their munitions, they had to travel to either Sasebo or Guam to reload before returning to the fight. This conveyor belt — strike, return to base, reload, transit back to the war zone, strike again — was effective but slow. U.S. players always wanted more submarines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bombers were survivable and highly effective. They could be based outside of Chinese missile range, thus avoiding attack on the ground. Armed with long-range missiles, bombers could launch from outside of the Chinese air defense zone and strike ground and naval targets at relatively low risk.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;However, long-range anti-ship munitions were too few. The United States ran out of these munitions after just a few days. Their long range was critical, allowing U.S. aircraft to launch from outside of the range of Chinese air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;U.S. fighter/attack aircraft were most vulnerable on the ground. About 90 percent of U.S. and coalition aircraft losses occurred on the ground to Chinese missile strikes. The Chinese have enough long-range missiles to saturate U.S. bases several times over the course of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hypersonic missiles were valuable but niche weapons. They were extremely effective in striking high-value defended targets. However, their high cost limits inventories, so they lack the volume needed to counter the immense numbers of Chinese air and naval platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Surface ships were highly vulnerable to Chinese missile attacks. As long as China retained substantial long-range missile inventories, U.S. and coalition surface ships had to back off to the east of Guam. It was too dangerous for them to remain within range of Chinese anti-ship missiles. Once China’s missile inventories declined as they repeatedly struck land targets such as air bases, the surface ships could move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s surface ships and aircraft struggled to survive. These traditional capabilities are valuable in day-to-day operations to counter Chinese harassment and encroachment but are highly vulnerable to the massive and growing Chinese navy and air force in a major conflict. Most Taiwanese surface ships and aircraft were destroyed in the first few days. The balanced force structure that served Taiwan so well from 1949 needs re-examination, a discussion that is already taking place as Taiwanese national security literature considers a “porcupine strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAS Wargames:&lt;/strong&gt; The Center for New American Security (CNAS) has run several wargames on a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan. These wargames arrived at conclusions similar to those of the CSIS wargame, with several additional insights:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States has insufficient supporting forces. It also lacks enough access to partner or allied bases across the Indo-Pacific to sufficiently disperse its forces to survive initial attacks and blunt China’s initial strikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States needs a greater emphasis on conducting logistics in a contested environment so that it can sustain combat power beyond the first days or weeks of a war.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China is likely to engage in nuclear brinkmanship despite its stated “no first use” policy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan requires improved training for its armed forces, especially its reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taiwan is highly dependent on imports of critical supplies and should stockpile these resources in advance of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Several critical capabilities are needed, including long-range precision-guided weapons, undersea capabilities such as uncrewed underwater vessels (UUVs), and improved passive and active base defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAND Wargames:&lt;/strong&gt; RAND conducted a series of wargames focused especially on technologies that can be applied in the near term. Although the details have not been released and are apparently classified, some general insights are available. Some particularly useful capabilities were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Multi-domain decoys and smart sea mines, which can disrupt the adversary’s kill chain.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Real-time language translation, which can enhance situational awareness for allies while protecting friendly information.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Integrated warfighting networks, which can make better use of networked devices on the tactical edge.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-blockade-of-taiwan&quot;&gt;Chinese Blockade of Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commentators consider a Chinese blockade of Taiwan more likely than an invasion because such an approach is less violent and confrontational. Blockades are different from invasion scenarios because political and diplomatic aspects are often paramount, though military capabilities still have a key role. Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine analyses and wargames about blockades to see which military capabilities might be useful in countering a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Military Exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; In recent years, China has conducted regular exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan. Exercise Joint Sword in April 2023 was revealing. Chinese military commentators cited the effort to attain “information agility” whereby China would speed up the kill chain through a “system-of-systems” approach. China also conducted major military exercises in the seas around Taiwan in September 2023, which included practicing sustained carrier-based air operations that would be useful in enforcing a blockade on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSIS Emerging Wargame Results:&lt;/strong&gt; CSIS is beginning a series of wargames and analyses of a Chinese blockade of Taiwan as a follow-on to its First Battle of the Next War invasion analysis. Although this work is still in progress, several emerging insights are worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sea mines are especially attractive in blockades because of their covertness and persistence. China has many mines and the platforms to employ them. Its doctrine explicitly includes such use.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Missile attacks are part of a blockade strategy. Chinese exercises conducted before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Taiwan visit showed how China might use missiles to impose a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China will harass civilian shipping. Although cargo ships are large and imposing, they are risk averse and therefore susceptible to pressure unless provided with mechanisms for resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;China might attack civilian shipping. Cargo ships are highly survivable because of their large size but need protection and incentives to accept the risk of damage or loss.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Several capabilities are needed: sea mines and mine clearance, protection packages for merchant shipping, and missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAND Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2002 RAND study examined the implications of a blockade of Taiwan. Although the study focused mostly on the political and economic aspects of such an operation, it did note the likelihood of China employing swarming tactics. In such situations, China often uses nonmilitary platforms such as the China Coast Guard, Maritime Militia, or fishing vessels to crowd an adversary ship and prevent it from accomplishing its mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Studies:&lt;/strong&gt; In a study published by the China Maritime Studies Institute, former U.S. intelligence officer and East Asia expert Lonnie Henley describes how a blockade might unfold. He notes Taiwan’s maritime vulnerability due to the concentration of its major ports on Taiwan’s west coast, closest to Chinese power. He argues for enhancing mine clearance, developing concepts and technologies for blockade running and convoy operations, and degrading the Chinese integrated air defense system through electronic and kinetic methods.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A Carnegie-sponsored study by Sean Mirski examined the dynamics of a U.S. naval blockade of China. Nevertheless, the study identifies several capabilities that would be needed in the event of a Chinese blockade, particularly sea mines, mine clearance, and maritime domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A forthcoming CSIS study on Taiwan blockade scenarios raises the possibility of cyberattacks being part of a Chinese blockade operation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gray-zone-competition-in-the-south-china-sea&quot;&gt;Gray Zone Competition in the South China Sea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray zone competition refers to actions short of war that challenge U.S. interests, influence, or power in ways designed to avoid direct U.S. military responses. Although these activities could occur anywhere in the Pacific, the South China Sea is a region of particular attention because of Chinese ambitions, making it a flashpoint for conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, RAND conducted a wargame simulating Chinese gray zone coercion of Taiwan. Their findings highlight the conditions under which a conflict over Taiwan might begin and illuminate which capabilities would be useful to the United States and its allies and partners. Their conclusions include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gray zone coercion is relatively unlikely to escalate to full-blown war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States will consider escalating to military force if Taiwan faces an existential threat, such as a blockade or an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taiwan will not escalate without explicit U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States is more likely to intervene to support Taiwan if the island takes steps to defend itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Several capabilities are needed: air defense, maritime surveillance, and anti-harassment tools.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-real-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Real War in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is occurring in a different geography than would a war in the Western Pacific. In Ukraine, the ground domain dominates, whereas the air and maritime domains would dominate conflict in the Western Pacific. Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine provides a current example of high-intensity conflict between large and well-equipped adversaries and, therefore, is relevant to all future conflicts. Although it will be many years before the lessons learned from this conflict are fully examined and understood, several important insights relevant to a conflict in the Western Pacific can be discerned now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Inventories:&lt;/strong&gt; In the post-Cold War period, the United States and its allies assumed that future wars would have a short, high-intensity phase. If there were an extended stabilization phase, it would not put heavy demands on firepower, so inventories of weapons and munitions would not need to be extensive. However, the war in Ukraine has had a fundamentally different character. The continuing demands for weapons and munitions have strained U.S. and coalition inventories, limiting what they can send, as deliveries deplete stockpiles to levels that threaten other global commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Industrial Surge:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintaining full stockpiles of all systems for long wars is impossible because of the high cost. Industrial surge must be able to meet the demands of longer and more intensive wars. However, in the United States and elsewhere, most surge capabilities have been eliminated in the name of efficiency. Production levels were set to produce weapons and munitions efficiently at peacetime rates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Major and Evolving Role of Uncrewed Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian ground forces note the ubiquity of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) that spot targets for artillery attacks. “Kamikaze” UASs fly into targets, whether personnel or vehicles, acting as a tactical cruise missile. Uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) have attacked Russian ships and driven them from Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Centrality of Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukrainian forces have connected their diverse and expanding forces by using Starlink, a civilian system. They have thus avoided what might have been a major limitation on Ukrainian operations — an inability to communicate rapidly and reliably across geography, organizations, and domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Electronic Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; Communications are routinely jammed. GPS spoofers — widely anticipated for many years — are commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The influence of narrative:&lt;/strong&gt; Narrative shaping has been an essential tool for Ukraine to drive political support. It has dominated the information space by reaching out to experts and journalists, sending representatives — including the president — to other countries to make their argument, and ensuring that good news got out while bad news was restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;submarines&quot;&gt;Submarines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unobtainable Solution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of Chinese threats, the AUKUS agreement, and wargame results, a clear solution would be for the United States to build more submarines. Indeed, a strong submarine force is a feature of nearly every proposed fleet architecture, whether developed by government organizations or outside experts, and is the foundation of AUKUS. However, expanding the submarine fleet in the near or midterm is not possible because of constraints on the submarine industrial base. Indeed, the size of the submarine fleet will drop below the current level through the mid-2030s. Therefore, enhanced near- and midterm capabilities to meet a rising Chinese military challenge will need to come from elsewhere. This chapter lays out the strategic desirability of submarines, the difficulties in building more, and the future size of the submarine fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Support from Strategists:&lt;/strong&gt; Strategists like SSNs because the firepower and covertness of these platforms are useful in great power conflicts. Unlike surface ships, submarines can easily operate inside an adversary’s defensive bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 shows how support for increasing the submarine fleet — including SSNs and guided missile submarines (SSGNs) — has been strong across many different fleet architectures developed by the Navy, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and think tanks. The horizontal line shows the current level of the attack submarine fleet (FY 2024). The vertical bars show the proposed level in the different architectures, all of which are above the current inventory level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c3jRTk1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Target Inventory for Attack Submarines (SSNs and SSGNs) Compared with Current Fleet.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Fleet architectures as described by the DOD, Navy, and research organizations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Implementation Challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; The problem is getting to these higher goals. The obvious solution would be to build more submarines, but having two submarine construction programs operating simultaneously — for Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) and Virginia-class SSNs — puts pressure on the shipbuilding budget and the submarine industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the president’s proposed FY 2024 defense budget, building two SSNs and one SSBN will cost $16.1 billion in a Navy shipbuilding account that totals $29.5 billion for new construction. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that: “The three alternatives in the Navy’s 2024 plan would require average annual shipbuilding appropriations that were 31 percent to 40 percent more than the average over the past five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSBNs have the highest priority because of their strategic nuclear role. As Admiral Lisa Franchetti stated in her confirmation hearing, “CLB [the Columbia class] is the Navy’s number one acquisition priority, with no further margin for program delay. The Navy must fully fund CLB to meet U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) requirements for the first patrol no later than October 2030 to replace retiring Ohio-class SSBNs.” Because of this program’s high priority, it will be fully funded, including any cost growth. So far, the Columbia class has not shown large cost growth, but programs of that size and technical complexity often do, and the program has high schedule risk. In October 2022, the Navy estimated that there was a high probability that procurement costs would be greater than what the Navy previously forecast: 54 percent for the first Columbia-class boat (excluding costs for plans) and 49 percent for boats 2 through 12. Attack submarines will have to fight for the remaining shipbuilding funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, only two shipyards build submarines, General Dynamics’ Electric Boat Division (GD/EB) in Groton, CT, and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding (HII/NNS), in Newport News, VA. The Navy is investing $2.4 billion over the next five years to strengthen the submarine industrial base to handle both programs. The president has proposed another $3.4 billion in his October 2023 Ukraine/Israel supplemental. Nevertheless, the challenge for the industrial base — both shipyards and suppliers — is to ramp up production from one “regular” Virginia-class boat per year (the volume of work before FY 2011) to the equivalent of about five “regular” Virginia-class boats per year (the approximate volume of work represented by two Virginia Payload Module-equipped Virginia-class boats and one Columbia-class boat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUKUS agreement, by providing nuclear submarines and nuclear facilities to the Royal Australian Navy, will put additional pressure on the U.S. submarine industrial base even as it strengthens security in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Shrinking Fleet:&lt;/strong&gt; Figure 2 shows the size of the submarine fleet over time. The dotted horizontal line shows the level of the current fleet (FY 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solid line shows the current plan. In the near term, the size of the attack submarine fleet declines, bottoming out at 46 boats in FY 2030. This decline reflects the low production rates of the 1990s and 2000s, when the strategic focus was on regional conflicts, and the Navy often built only one submarine a year. The large inventory from the Cold War has kept the fleet size high for many years, but those Cold War submarines are now retiring in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate this trough, the Navy has extended the service life of some older Los Angeles-class submarines. There is unlikely much more that can be done using this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 also shows two alternative futures. One line extends the Navy’s base plan, which builds two SSNs in most years (solid line). Fleet size eventually recovers as new ships join the fleet, reaching the level of today’s submarine fleet in the late 2030s but never rising to the recommended level of most fleet architectures. This plan could change, as it does not incorporate the effects of the 2022 National Defense Strategy; that analysis is still undergoing review. Neither does it include the effects of the AUKUS agreement, which was signed after the projection was developed. Nevertheless, whatever plan emerges next year, the previously described limits on the submarine industrial base will constrain it in the near- and mid-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative (dashed line) assumes that the Navy builds three SSNs per year once production of the Columbia class ends and pressure on the industrial base eases. Under these circumstances, the submarine fleet reaches the target level of many proposed architectures in the late 2040s and the level of the most ambitious plans in the early 2050s. The obstacle to achieving this alternative, higher level of production would be finding the budget space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/odhjc6H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Projected Attack Submarine Fleet, FY 2023–FY 2053.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data from Long-Range Naval Inventory tables in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govexec.com/media/navy_2024_shipbuilding_plan.pdf&quot;&gt;Report to Congress on the Annual Long-Range Plan for Construction of Naval Vessels for Fiscal Year 2024 (Washington, DC: Department of Defense, March 2023)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to give priority to the Columbia-class program and AUKUS, the limits of the industrial base, and the aging of the existing fleet constrain what the Navy can do in the near and midterm to increase the size of the submarine fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, regional allies might help fill the gap, but numbers and capabilities are limited. Taiwan has four old submarines (30+ years), though it has begun construction on a modern class. Australia has six Collins-class submarines, but these are aging and based far from potential conflict areas. Japan has 22 excellent submarines but may not be involved and, if involved, might be unwilling to use its forces offensively. Beyond these countries, the analysis in Chapter 2 indicates that it is unlikely that other allies or partners would be willing to provide military forces to a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, regardless of what strategists may want, the submarine fleet will remain below desired levels for many decades. The challenge is to find other mechanisms to compete in the Western Pacific for the two decades until a larger submarine inventory becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Regardless of what strategists may want, the submarine fleet will remain below desired levels for many decades.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filling-the-gaps&quot;&gt;Filling the Gaps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What to Do until More Submarines Arrive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS offers a powerful mechanism for enhancing U.S. and partner security interests in the Western Pacific. A coalition submarine fleet with increased numbers, wider basing, and more diversified capabilities will enhance deterrence and strengthen warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since additional submarines will not be available for many years, the United States and its partners need to take other measures. Pillar 2 of AUKUS offers a mechanism with its focus on technological cooperation. Beyond AUKUS, the United States has many other relationships in the Western Pacific that would benefit from an expanded menu of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threats described in Chapter 2 and the wargame results described in Chapter 3 suggest several potentially useful capabilities, which are described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-existing-submarines-more-effective&quot;&gt;Making Existing Submarines More Effective&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the size of the submarine fleet will decline through the 2020s, there is a need to increase the effectiveness of the submarines that are available. Two items come up repeatedly in wargames and the warfighting literature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles:&lt;/strong&gt; The Navy is investigating a range of UUVs, from the very small to the very large. The Navy envisions UUVs being a force multiplier for their motherships, which will not decrease in numbers. Two kinds have promise for enhancing the effectiveness of existing submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the high end, there is the Orca, 50 tons and the size of a bus. The Orca, the only Extra-Large UUV (XLUUV) program, will initially provide a minelaying capability, with the platform deploying the planned Hammerhead mine. This mine would be tethered to the seabed and armed with an antisubmarine torpedo, similar to the Navy’s Cold War-era CAPTOR antisubmarine mine. Although six prototype Orcas are being built, they are still experimental and not a program of record.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Medium UUVs (MUUVs) are systems with a diameter larger than 10 inches but less than 21 inches, allowing torpedo tube deployment. The two primary MUUV missions are intelligence gathering (“Intelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment”) and mine countermeasures. By deploying from a submarine, they can respond rapidly to a tactical situation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A recent trilateral exercise by the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia — Technology Readiness Experimentation, or T-REX 23-2 — tested some of these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CSIS’s working group of outside experts noted that UUVs were attractive because of their stealth, but also that command and control underwater was extremely difficult. It represented a technological challenge that industry needs to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Submarine Maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; What matters ultimately is not how many submarines a fleet has but how many submarines it can deploy. U.S. submarine availability has been low because of maintenance backlogs. In recent years, availability has run about 60 percent; that figure is up to 64–67 percent now, and the Navy hopes to get it up to 80 percent. Extended shipyard maintenance periods for submarines contribute to this low availability rate. From FY 2015 to FY 2019, only 5 of 33 submarine maintenance periods were completed on time, with a total of 6,296 days (about 17 years) lost to maintenance delay. Across the fleet, the difference between 60 percent and 80 percent availability is 10 boats that should be sailing the seas but are instead sitting in shipyards. The budget supplemental proposed in October 2023 contains $3.4 billion for the submarine industrial base. This would help substantially, though it will take years before the fleet feels the effects of those funds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward rearming:&lt;/strong&gt; In wargames, submarines rapidly exhaust their munition inventories and must return to base to reload. Currently, those reload locations are limited to Guam and Yokosuka. The Navy is considering additional reload locations and could, for example, build more submarine tenders. Accelerating the reload cycle gets submarines get back into the fight more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bringing-more-forces-to-bear-more-effectively&quot;&gt;Bringing More Forces to Bear, More Effectively&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in Chapter 2, the United States has many allies and partners in the Western Pacific. The challenge is bringing these forces to bear, especially since there is no overarching alliance like NATO to establish joint structures and set standards. Instead, these must be established bilaterally. Measures to enhance cooperation include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coalition Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) Packages:&lt;/strong&gt; These systems are critical for creating a common operating picture across an entire coalition. However, every country has its own technologies and procedures. Therefore, systems that allow the U.S. C3I systems to link with those of an ally or partner would be enormously valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Such systems must be effective without multibillion-dollar acquisition programs, imposition of common standards, or years of training and exercises. Although all these approaches would be useful, they are likely unobtainable except with the closest allies because of the cost and need to exchange highly sensitive data. One example of an alternative approach would be a deployable package that could sit in an allied or partner command center. This would build on the fusion centers that already exist. However, many other approaches are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In considering solutions, the perfect is the enemy of the good. It would be better to have some simple systems in the hands of U.S. and allied forces now, given the immediacy of the threat, rather than wait for the perfect network solution in the distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group emphasized that these arrangements need to be made before war breaks out. Improvising joint C3I during a conflict takes time, misses warfighting opportunities, and weakens defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air and Maritime Domain Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; All three potential conflict scenarios — invasion, blockade, and gray zone competition — require excellent air and maritime domain awareness. The United States and its allies and partners need to know the location of potential adversaries’ forces, their own forces, and coalition forces. The latter can be challenging because allied and coalition forces do not always connect to friendly information systems. Low-tech solutions may, therefore, be a better option to bridge gaps in air/maritime domain awareness with some allies and partners. This requirement does not diminish as the intensity of conflict diminishes; it is as important for gray zone competition and blockades as it is for full-scale conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coalition Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Some allies, such as Australia and Japan, have highly trained forces; others struggle to attain adequate levels of training proficiency. All allies and the United States need training on how to work together. Analyses and wargames often gloss over “soft” factors such as training. The United States has recognized the need for training and education for decades, instituting a wide variety of training programs with allies. The availability of troops and units to conduct this training is frequently a constraint. Expanded contractor support could increase coalition training opportunities and thereby link military forces more closely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Contractors can supplement military personnel in meeting these training demands and have done so in the past. Indeed, contractors have been described as the fourth element of military force structure, along with active-duty troops, National Guard and reserves, and government civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor Logistics Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Many allies and partners struggle with obsolescent equipment and readiness challenges. All militaries must compete with the civilian sector for technically skilled personnel to maintain the equipment. Further, maintainers are often junior enlisted personnel who are essentially apprentices as they gain experience. As with training, one solution is to have contractors augment military personnel. Contractors often have substantial technical skills that can supplement military maintenance efforts, not just in peacetime but also in wartime. The U.S. experience in Iraq and Afghanistan was that contractors would stay at their posts in conflicts as long as they understood the risks beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operating-in-a-hostile-environment&quot;&gt;Operating in a Hostile Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been able to threaten adversary forces at increasing distances by building large missile forces, and it is not alone in this regard. Russia and Iran have similarly developed long-range capabilities. Although this environment is widely understood and appreciated in the United States, it will nevertheless be a shock for U.S. naval and air forces, which have operated in sanctuary for many decades. The following actions would enhance the ability to operate in this hostile environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aircraft Dispersion:&lt;/strong&gt; Wargaming indicates that aircraft are most vulnerable on the ground. For many years, the U.S. solution to airbase defense was interceptors. That is still an essential part of any strategy but is insufficient because of the potentially massive strikes that China can conduct. Therefore, another element of the strategy needs to be dispersal. The Air Force has recognized this with its agile combat employment doctrine. The doctrine seeks to “shift operations from centralized physical infrastructures to a network of smaller, dispersed locations that can complicate adversary planning and provide more options for joint force commanders.” Part of implementing the doctrine involves training personnel and conducting exercises. However, part requires creating the units and equipment needed to operate successfully from many more sites, some of which may be austere and lack the required supporting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aircraft Survivability:&lt;/strong&gt; The Air Force has made some investments in explosive ordinance demolition and runway repair, recognizing that air bases will be attacked. These initiatives should be continued. One aspect of aircraft survivability that the Air Force has not embraced is hardened shelters. Although the United States built many during the Cold War, it has not built any since. Yet, dispersal alone is insufficient because of the large number of aircraft requiring forward basing and the need to continue using large U.S. bases despite missile strikes. Without hardened shelters, any aircraft at these bases would be highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surface Ships’ Defensive Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Surface ships that want to operate west of Guam during a conflict with China need strong defensive capabilities. Indeed, any ship operating near a hostile shore needs strong and vigilant defenses, as the Russian cruiser Moskva learned to its sorrow. The Navy is aware of this and is constantly upgrading ship defensive systems. This project is never done, as adversaries continue to develop new attack capabilities that require new responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asymmetric Capabilities for Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwan’s need for asymmetric defenses has been widely discussed and needs no expansion here. This does not mean that Taiwan should retire all of its conventional capabilities. However, it does mean that asymmetric capabilities — land-based antiship missiles, land-based air defenses, sea mines, and missile boats — need greater priority because of their ability to survive in this increasingly hostile environment. This is often called a “porcupine” strategy and has been hotly debated in Taiwan. A more balanced force structure would also enhance deterrence by reducing the possibility of a debilitating Chinese first strike.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience against Cyberattacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber defenses are now well established as integral to modern warfare. These defenses need to be tended continuously like those in any other domain. The war in Ukraine has shown that robust cyber defenses are possible, particularly when developed in connection with commercial firms. These defenses cannot deflect all attacks but can protect friendly assets sufficiently so that cyberattacks do not have a major operational impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience against Electronic Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; The working group emphasized that China has powerful electronic warfare capabilities, and many wargames have speculated about what these capabilities might be able to do. This represents a level of threat that other post-Cold War adversaries have not possessed. Decades of operating in “electronic sanctuary” have created vulnerabilities in U.S. and allied forces even as electronic systems have greatly enhanced military capabilities. One vulnerability is the loss of communications. Such a loss would not be absolute because some mechanisms for communication will always be available. However, a generation of military officers has become accustomed to reliable voice, internet, chat rooms, and video and will find it difficult to operate in a severely degraded communications environment. Finding ways to harden communications, for example, by using wire and cable instead of airwaves, would cushion the force against electronic warfare shock.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Related to the loss of communications is the loss of the Global Positioning System (GPS). As with reliable communications, U.S. and partner forces have come to expect reliable GPS service for guiding munitions, ascertaining unit locations, and developing a common operating picture. Indeed, GPS is so ingrained into U.S. operations that loss of its capability would have second and third-order effects that are not fully understood. Alternatives to GPS, such as determining location through inertial navigation systems and even old-fashioned map reading, are available. However, the accuracy, precision, and low cost of GPS make adopting alternatives difficult despite the system’s widely recognized vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contested Logistics:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the German U-boats of World War II, no adversary has been able to interfere with U.S. logistics flow. That is changing. China can now disrupt flows within the second island chain and will soon be able to reach beyond that. Building logistics systems that can operate in a contested environment requires new technologies, platforms, and concepts. The Navy has begun such adaptation by closing the Red Hill depot and instead building a network of fuel distribution points, including on-call tankers. The military services are conducting wargames to understand what contested logistics mean operationally. However, programmatic efforts in this space have just begun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hedging-against-unconventional-threats&quot;&gt;Hedging against Unconventional Threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When thinking about threats, it is natural to mirror image, imagining that threats to U.S. forces are the same as threats to adversary forces. For many aspects of great power conflict, this is true. However, some challenges from adversaries lack strong U.S. counterparts, and these need careful consideration lest the United States be surprised. Such challenges include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countering Mines:&lt;/strong&gt; Periodically, a major article appears in military journals noting how sea mines have constituted the greatest threat to U.S. Navy ships since World War II and bemoaning the lack of preparation to deal with this well-documented threat. The United States could encounter mines in any future conflict, whether due to an invasion of Taiwan, a blockade, or gray zone competition. Countering mine warfare requires locating minefields, clearing lanes, and then keeping the lanes open. This, in turn, requires a spectrum of capabilities from mine reconnaissance to mine neutralization. In the past, the United States has developed a variety of imaginative approaches, from using sea mammals to spot mines to sailing sacrificial ships through minefields. Yet, U.S. countermine capabilities today remain weak.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countering Maritime Swarming:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese maritime swarming comes up repeatedly in wargames and analyses. The tactic seeks to defeat adversaries without kinetic attack. This low-level threat is not something the United States has had to deal with because of its powerful naval forces, but it is a day-to-day reality for many allies and partners in the Western Pacific. Technologies that inhibit swarming tactics without resorting to deadly force would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Efforts to counter piracy developed some non-kinetic approaches such as fire hoses, restricted shipboard access, and barbed wire. In a blockade or gray zone confrontation, these same systems could be used to counter attempts to board transiting vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Portable defensive packages might be placed on merchant ships to provide some protection. Such packages would include capabilities that are too expensive to place on every ship but inexpensive enough to be produced in large numbers and deployed on those ships that need it. Some examples include sonic systems, foams, water cannons, and dazzlers to discourage boarding parties. The aim is to increase survivability to the point where operations are viable, not to prevent all losses, which is an unattainable goal. This space is open for imaginative solutions, as major navies have historically been less susceptible to these challenges, and therefore, not thought deeply about them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The DOD’s Joint Nonlethal Weapons Program has developed a wide variety of nonlethal systems “to arm the Joint Force with the fullest range of capabilities in support of National Security objectives.” Many of the technologies developed by the task force have been used in combat. Expanding them to partner nations and commercial shippers would be new but could potentially provide significant leverage in a blockade or gray zone situation. Partner nations might find these capabilities easier to employ during gray zone or blockade confrontations because they are the ones being directly threatened. Commercial organizations might use these capabilities under the concept of self-defense, expanding what they have done to protect themselves against pirates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UASs to Harass the Harassers:&lt;/strong&gt; Building on the discussion above, small, shipborne UASs might help thwart harassment by Chinese ships, particularly nonmilitary vessels such as the China Coast Guard and Maritime Militia. By harassing the harassers, UASs could warn of impending danger and interfere with attacks by Chinese water cannons or “shouldering.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defending-against-all-manifestations-of-air-threats&quot;&gt;Defending against All Manifestations of Air Threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An area universally noted in discussions about future conflict is the need to counter a wide variety of air threats, from ballistic missiles, to cruise missiles, to UASs. Once the province of well-funded states, these capabilities are now obtainable by every nation. Indeed, even non-national groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas now field large rocket and cruise missile forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drives a demand for air defenses to protect populations, military forces, and the flow of goods. Missile defenses need not be 100 percent effective to have value. All defenses complicate an adversary’s planning. Such efforts could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile Defenses:&lt;/strong&gt; Regional U.S. ballistic missile defenses are relatively well developed since these threats have been around for a while, such as from North Korea, Iran, and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Cruise missile defenses have received considerable attention recently as more countries have obtained these missiles, and U.S. ground-based air defenses have atrophied. The CSIS Missile Defense Project has written extensively about these needs. Although many of these analyses have focused on U.S. homeland defense, many of the insights and systems described are applicable to overseas operations and other countries. Their 2023 report on the Russian missile offensive against Ukraine notes that U.S. missile defense systems have been largely successful in intercepting Russian missiles, that fixed air defense platforms are themselves highly vulnerable, and that passive defenses remain critical to mitigating missile threats. Their 2022 review of North American missile defense architecture argues that U.S. homeland cruise missile defenses have been neglected, leaving the United States vulnerable to non-nuclear attack and coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even hypersonic missiles can be countered. A pair of CSIS Missile Defense Program reports argue that, although hypersonic missiles are formidable weapons, they are not unbeatable. The United States can develop defenses, and these can be deployed overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter Uncrewed Aerial Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; The wars in Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas have highlighted the need to counter UASs with inexpensive systems. Systems designed for aircraft and cruise missile defense are too expensive. It makes little sense to shoot down a $20,000 kamikaze UAS with a million-dollar missile. Further, countering the swarms of cheap, often commercial reconnaissance UASs requires many systems to cover the entire length of the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This need is not a surprise, as the United States has been developing a wide variety of such systems for some time, including small-scale interceptor rockets, electronic warfare and jammers, and nets that capture adversary UASs. While some of these countermeasures involve complex technologies, others are simple since many Chinese UASs rely on simple radio links that can easily be jammed or overpowered. Many of these countermeasures have been sent to Ukraine. On the horizon is the possibility of directed energy weapons, which could rapidly attack multiple targets at low cost per shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the field is underdeveloped, and with UAS technology constantly evolving, a measure/countermeasure competition will play out for many years. Innovation and new systems will be needed constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group emphasized that systems to counter small and medium-sized UASs need to be integrated with front-line units because UASs are so widely proliferated. Creating specialized units is not sufficiently responsive except for dealing with the largest UASs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-offensively-even-when-on-the-defense&quot;&gt;Thinking Offensively, Even When on the Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the literature relating to the Western Pacific is about defense and coping with Chinese A2/AD capabilities. This is reasonable considering the threat environment. However, even in defensive situations, there are opportunities for the offense. Several technologies can facilitate these opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamming and Counter-C3I:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese reliance on “information agility” and “system-of-systems” operational concepts opens vulnerabilities. Without fully functioning C3I systems to coordinate and integrate, the disconnected parts will be less than the integrated whole. Thus, jamming activities could pay huge dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Surface Vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; USVs might provide a way to operate inside the Chinese defensive zone while minimizing risk to crewed surface ships. The Navy is investigating many such vessels, from the size of rowboats to the size of corvettes. All can extend the sensor range of crewed vessels. The additional standoff distance provides more warning of attack and longer-range targeting for offensive weapons. Larger USVs will likely incorporate weapons, thus increasing the magazine depth of the total fleet. The Navy is conducting many experiments in this area, not having settled on a particular architecture or set of programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group saw great potential here and noted that USV command and control was much easier than with UUVs because air is a better medium for communications than water. However, they cautioned against making the platforms multi-mission. That increased cost and complexity, removing one of their advantages over crewed systems. Instead, missions for both USVs and UASs (below) should be focused.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Like USVs, UASs offer the ability to extend sensor range and potentially be strike assets of their own, with the ability to penetrate A2/AD zones without risking crews. Unlike USVs and UUVs, the Navy has several programs of record, the MQ-25 Stingray and MQ-4 being the most relevant here. The MQ-25 program has particular potential. Its units are beginning production and will reach the fleet in 2026. Although currently configured as tankers, they have the potential to be strike assets on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypersonic Weapons:&lt;/strong&gt; Hypersonic weapons have become the iconic weapon of the new era, with close attention being paid to the technology’s relative development among the United States, China, and Russia. As noted earlier, the problem with hypersonic missiles is their high cost. Nevertheless, even low-inventory weapons can be hugely valuable. The ability of hypersonic weapons to strike distant, high-value, and well-defended targets holds at risk adversary assets that might otherwise be invulnerable or nearly so. Losing these assets, such as headquarters or major platforms, such as aircraft carriers, would disproportionately affect adversary capabilities and morale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standoff Sea Mines:&lt;/strong&gt; As previously noted, sea mines are enormously powerful weapons because of their latency and covertness. However, emplacing them can be a challenge, particularly for the United States, which abides by international rules and has relatively distant bases. Mines that need to be dropped from aircraft risk the survivability of the delivery platform. Mines that can glide some distance reduce this vulnerability. Thus, standoff mines have great potential. The United States has begun developing such a capability with the QuickStrike Extended Range mine, but there is much more that could be done given the increasing strength of Chinese and Russian air defenses. Indeed, sea mines and similar technologies — such as new kinds of mines, decoys, and different emplacement methods — are areas where creative solutions can add friction to Chinese military plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The working group recommended enhancing the sea mine capabilities of regional allies since they were already present at key locations and had the latitude to conduct mining in their territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-opportunities-for-cooperation&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Opportunities for Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foregoing lays out many areas of potential cooperation between nations and between the governments and their defense industry. All provide insight into the question of what might be done while waiting for the submarine fleet to expand. Some areas may prove more fruitful or easier to coordinate than others. Deciding which to pursue requires prototyping, experimentation, and field testing. That process needs to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only by beginning the forward movement can the assessment process illuminate challenges that inevitably occur. For example, export controls and restrictions on data sharing are emerging as key challenges to the technology coordination envisioned by AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, government decisions on promising technologies signal industry where it should focus its attention and resources. The defense industry in every country wants to produce products that the defense establishment requires, but these industries need pointers to ensure they are being responsive to government strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

While these ships support scientific and commercial objectives, they can also help China’s navy understand the maritime environment as it ventures into less familiar waters like the Indian Ocean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is undertaking sweeping efforts to transform its navy into a formidable “blue water” force capable of projecting power far beyond its shores. As the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) ventures into less familiar waters like the Indian Ocean, Beijing has sought to deepen its understanding of the maritime operating environment by studying water conditions, currents, and the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To survey the Earth’s oceans, China has developed the world’s largest fleet of civilian research vessels. While these ships support scientific and commercial objectives, they are also being used to advance Beijing’s strategic ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZEGClV6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese oceanographic surveys span the globe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Maritime activity data collected using the Windward Intelligence Platform reveals Chinese survey vessels have carried out hundreds of thousands of hours of operations globally over the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hidden Reach analyzed Chinese oceanographic missions since 2020 and identified 64 active research and survey vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s dual-use approach to oceanographic research raises questions about the nature of these activities. Many vessels that undertake missions for peaceful purposes are also capable of providing the PLA with critical data about the world’s oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of the 64 active vessels, over 80 percent have demonstrated suspect behavior or possess organizational links suggesting their involvement in advancing Beijing’s geopolitical agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s surveying operations have been heavily concentrated along its maritime periphery in the South China Sea and western Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But it has also set its sights on the Indian Ocean, an emerging arena of competition between Beijing and New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PLA can leverage the insights gained from these missions to enhance its knowledge of the dynamic undersea environment — a crucial precursor to confidently deploying naval forces abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring and mapping the world’s oceans is not unique to China. Dozens of countries have active oceanographic research programs, which contribute to global efforts to study climate change, marine life, geology, and the distribution of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also not alone in applying oceanographic research to support military needs. Yet the scale of China’s activities is immense, and the line between its civilian and military research is heavily blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s lack of transparency makes it challenging to discern the true nature of its survey operations, but three specific indicators shed light on which vessels may be supporting Beijing’s military and national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vessel-ownership-and-type&quot;&gt;Vessel Ownership and Type&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of China’s research vessels are owned and operated by state-affiliated organizations with close ties to the Chinese military. For example, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Chinese Academy of Sciences both operate research vessels and have signed cooperation agreements with the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some survey ships were in service with the PLA before entering civilian service. Hulls in the Xiang Yang Hong (向阳红) class, for example, were originally built for the Chinese navy but were later transferred to civilian authorities with ties to the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other ships are operated directly by the Chinese Coast Guard, which ultimately reports to the country’s Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese officials are not always quiet about the dual function of these ships. During the commissioning of the Shiyan 06 (实验-06), officials acknowledged the ship would “provide strong scientific and technological support for homeland security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-affiliated-port-visits&quot;&gt;Military-Affiliated Port Visits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese survey ships have a record of calling at port in military-affiliated facilities in China. This includes Sanya, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other ports known to host major contingents of PLA Navy warships and maritime militia vessels. Some have also visited China’s unlawfully constructed military outposts in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, some vessels have gone dark for hours or days while near PLA installations, a potential sign of intentional efforts to obscure activities there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;activities&quot;&gt;Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behavior at sea can also raise red flags. Repeated instances of “spoofing” (providing falsified identification information) or “going dark” (turning off automatic identification system signals for extended periods) are important warning signs. Data from Windward indicates these activities occur frequently — sometimes near foreign military facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other instances, China has deployed research vessels to strengthen its presence in geopolitical hotspots. Commercial and scientific research ships, such as those operated by the state-owned China Oilfield Services Limited (COSL), have played a major role in helping Beijing assert its claims of “indisputable sovereignty” over vast swaths of the contested South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ships have conducted survey operations within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of other countries without prior approval, which is prohibited under international law. These activities have sparked diplomatic spats, including a 2019 confrontation between an Indian warship and Chinese research vessel operating unauthorized in India’s EEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blurred boundaries between China’s oceanographic research ecosystem and its expansive national security apparatus bear the hallmarks of Beijing’s military-civil fusion (军民融合) strategy, which seeks to break down barriers between the country’s civilian and military scientific, technological, and economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s national economic blueprint, the 14th Five Year Plan, names deep sea exploration as one of its seven focus areas for scientific and technological research and calls for the development of “submarine scientific observation networks.” In 2021, the Ministry of Natural Resources laid out specific guidance on furthering the Five Year Plan, including linking ocean surveying to military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA personnel have written extensively on the need for a robust set of advanced deep-sea technologies to support undersea warfare, a domain where China considerably lags the U.S. military. The data collected by China’s civilian research fleet, which is outfitted with cutting-edge measuring and monitoring equipment, can help fill in major gaps in the PLA Navy’s undersea capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The connections between the Chinese military and civilian oceanographic research are often in plain sight. The PLA Navy Submarine Academy openly touts its frequent collaborations with China’s major maritime research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM) is the crown jewel in China’s oceanographic research technology ecosystem. It is located among a cluster of advanced research labs built near the submarine academy’s main campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partnerships have raised security concerns abroad. Texas A&amp;amp;M University terminated a research partnership with QNLM in 2022, citing “more than 200 instances of Foreign Talent Recruitment activity.” In the same year, the U.S. Department of Commerce added QNLM to its Entity List due to its involvement in supporting China’s military modernization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of China’s most extensive expeditions took place in 2019 and 2020, when the research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 06 traveled more than 10,000 kilometers over 110 days to survey vast swaths of the Indian Ocean. Scientists from Sri Lanka and Myanmar joined for parts of the ship’s expedition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Part of its mission involved releasing 12 advanced underwater gliders and deploying 15 profiling floats, which spent months collecting data on the area’s hydrological conditions. That data was then fed back to China via satellite transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These floats are part of an effort to build up a real-time ocean observation network of hundreds of devices spanning the “Two Oceans and One Sea” (两洋一海) region, a conceptualization of the Pacific and Indian Oceans and South China Sea put forward by Beijing as a focus area for maritime surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In another telling example, the seismic survey ship Hai Yang Shi You 760 completed a four-month ocean bed mapping mission in early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vessel is owned and operated by COSL, a subsidiary of the state-owned oil giant China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). During its mission, it followed an extensive “lawnmower” path within Bangladesh’s EEZ, indicating the vessel was exploring the seabed for oil and gas deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CNOOC ships and large-scale rigs have been routinely deployed to assert Beijing’s sovereignty claims in the highly contested South China Sea. In 2012, CNOOC’s chairman famously referred to the firm’s oil rigs as a “strategic weapon” supporting national interests. CNOOC’s ties to the PLA led the U.S. Treasury Department to add the firm to its Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no indication that the Hai Yang Shi You 760 operated within Bangladesh’s EEZ without official consent. Its repeated port calls at Chittagong suggest it received permission. Nonetheless, the seismic and bathymetric data collected during the survey could be of significant value to the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once the survey was complete, the Hai Yang Shi You 760 returned to its home port at Zhanjiang, just beside the headquarters of the PLA Navy’s South Sea Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DOVgfjh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;shiyan-06-实验-06&quot;&gt;SHIYAN 06 实验 06&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;More recently, in October 2023, the research vessel Shiyan 06 entered the eastern Indian Ocean bound for the Port of Colombo in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vessel is operated by the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, a research institute that has provided technical and logistical support for China’s militarization of the South China Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka initially demurred on China’s requests to dock the vessel at Colombo due to objections raised by India. Local researchers also expressed concern about their lack of access to the data gathered by Chinese expeditions. Colombo eventually relented, however, allowing the Shiyan 06 to dock for five days before it left to execute research surveys along the island’s west coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beijing’s interest in Sri Lanka goes well beyond scientific pursuits. China’s massive investments in ports and other infrastructure there have raised concerns — including from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) — that the PLA has likely considered setting up a military facility in the island nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese surveys in the Indian Ocean contribute to scientific and commercial efforts, the data collected on research missions has clear military value — especially to submarine operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent Chinese defense white paper highlights the need for the PLA to support “far seas protection and strategic projection.” The Indian Ocean is a pivotal region for the PLA as it pushes to extend its “strategic perimeter” (战略外线) farther from China’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underwater domain is critical to China’s interests in the Indian Ocean. Chinese submarines could be called on to support a wide range of missions, ranging from intelligence collection to nuclear deterrence patrols. In a crisis, Chinese attack submarines operating there could complicate attempts by U.S. or allied forces to interdict China’s supply lines or traverse the region to reach the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gcv8Uaf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This Hidden Reach Snapshot uses satellite imagery to reveal how China is quietly using submarine diplomacy to deepen its influence along the Bay of Bengal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding submarine operations, however, requires overcoming significant hurdles. China’s lack of a nearby military facility forces its submarines to navigate key chokepoints between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may seek to address this vulnerability. The U.S. DOD assesses that China has likely considered 18 countries as potential hosts for an additional overseas military facility. Of these, 11 ring the massive Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with a regional military facility, submarine operations remain highly complex — a fact that has been brought home to the PLA Navy through its own experiences and those of foreign navies. In 2014, a Chinese submarine operating near Hainan Island was nearly lost when it encountered an unexpected change in water density, causing the submarine to sink rapidly into an underwater trench. The PLA Navy awarded the captain and crew high honors for successfully averting disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safely navigating submarines requires thorough knowledge of complex undersea conditions. Changes in subsurface topography, currents, thermoclines, salinity, and other factors have major impacts on how submarines navigate their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilian oceanographic research helps to arm the PLA Navy with critical data, enhancing its capability to safely deploy in distant waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Eotzay0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA and its civilian surrogates are harvesting data from the world’s oceans. While scientific and commercial benefits may accrue from Chinese oceanographic research, these activities may also prove crucial for the PLA in expanding its operational reach and capabilities in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This expansion poses a significant challenge to key regional players like India, as well as to the United States and its allies. Beijing’s track record of defying international norms to serve its own interests further heightens the stakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of China’s erstwhile partners in the region have started to pull back from research collaboration with China. At India’s encouragement, Sri Lanka announced in January 2024 that it would implement a one-year pause on Chinese research vessels docking at its ports. The country’s foreign minister suggested the ban would allow Sri Lanka to develop its capacity to “participate in such research activities as equal partners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such efforts are critical to holding Beijing to account. Engagement with Chinese researchers should not be unnecessarily curtailed, but these collaborations should be handled equitably and transparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, countries can also work together to ensure that a heightened PLA presence in the Indian Ocean does not destabilize the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s cooperation is crucial, and New Delhi has already demonstrated a degree of willingness to engage with partners. Amid simmering tensions with China, India has supported maritime security efforts with members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China charts its course in the Indian Ocean, Washington and its partners should keep a close watch on Chinese actors and explore opportunities to cooperate as an effective ballast.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it may prove difficult for the West to effectively degrade Houthi capabilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 30 December the USS Gravely, an Arleigh-Burke-class destroyer, responded to a distress call from the Maersk Hangzhou along with the USS Laboon. The CENTCOM post on X noting the event states simply that Gravely shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs) in the process of responding. An ASBM is technically a significant maritime strike capability; the fact that a non-state actor is in possession of this kind of weapon, and is employing it with impunity, is of grave concern. The US and its partners have responded to these attacks – 25 in total between 19 November and 4 January – primarily with defensive methods. However, a 4 January statement from the White House promised “consequences” if the Houthis do not end their attacks. This article will examine the Houthis’ capabilities and targeting possibilities for Western partners to counter them, as well as the difficulties they might face in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-shelf-capabilities&quot;&gt;Top-Shelf Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Houthis are able to deploy a range of missiles, drones and uncrewed kamikaze boats. Theoretically, the most sophisticated weapon available to them is the Asef ASBM, which carries a 500 kg warhead and has a range of 400 km. It employs an electro-optical seeker for the terminal phase of its target engagement, and is believed to be based on the Iranian Kahlij Fars ASBM. The Houthis also have access to anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCMs) such as the Al-Mandeb 2, which appears to be a close copy of the C-802, a Chinese ASCM sold to Iran in the 1990s. It has a range of 120 km and a 165 kg warhead; Iran reverse-engineered the C-802 into a domestic variant known as Noor. The ASCMs are truck-launched and have been used by the Houthis to damage and attack multiple ships since 2016. The C-802 or Noor was also used by Hizbullah to damage the Israeli ship INS Hanit in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Al-Mandeb 2 and Asef represent just two of the anti-ship missiles available to the Houthis; they claim to have developed many more domestically. The US disputes this claim and has reiterated that Iran either provides the weapons, or is instrumental in enabling the Houthis to build them. In addition to their arsenal of anti-ship missiles, the Houthis are also able to employ uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as the Samad-2 and -3. The latter can travel more than 1,500 km with an explosive payload, and is equipped with a dorsal antenna which likely enables it to be remotely operated as it approaches its target, while possibly being controlled in its terminal phase by a nearby operator on a small boat or onshore (though some UAVs may be controlled using satellite communications). Furthermore, the Houthis have attempted to board and seize vessels, as well as attack them with suicide boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengths-and-weaknesses&quot;&gt;Strengths and Weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary strength of the Houthi missile arsenal is experience. The Saudi Air Force has been conducting strikes in Yemen since 2015, which means the Houthis have become adept at minimising the damage that they cause. In 2018, for example, they unveiled an underground missile launcher that was designed to conceal the launch site of ballistic missiles fired into Saudi Arabia. The Saudis were initially able to destroy much of the original Houthi missile arsenal in 2017, which was inherited from the Yemeni military. However, since then, the Houthis and Iran have developed and manufactured many more missiles and drones – 70 were fired into Saudi Arabia in March 2021 alone, with a total of 340 launches that year, despite 600 Coalition airstrikes per month. Not all of those airstrikes were targeted at the Houthi missile production infrastructure, but the number nevertheless serves to illustrate the group’s familiarity with Western air power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crucial weakness of the Houthis’ maritime strike capabilities is their lack of effective targeting infrastructure. A series of coastal radars were used in 2016 to coordinate attacks against UAE and US vessels in the Red Sea. However, three of them were subsequently destroyed by US strikes, and it is unlikely that the Houthis would use the same tactics again. Instead, it is believed that they are provided with intelligence from an Iranian surveillance ship, the MV Behshad. The Behshad is thought to be limited in its intelligence-gathering capabilities to signal intelligence (SIGINT) and observation of shipping movements. Its predecessor vessel, the Saviz, which was also a converted civilian cargo ship, carried a complement of fast boats which could be used to provide visual identification of target vessels as well as SIGINT. This, coupled with data UAVs and open source AIS tracking, can be used to triangulate the range and bearing of a target vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Securing shipping requires a disproportionately resource-intensive effort on the part of the defender relative to the attacker when the latter has the advantage of proximity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be sufficient to fire an ASCM in the direction of a vessel, while relying on its onboard seeker to identify a target in the terminal phase. This form of targeting would be less effective against warships, which can take evasive action and deploy countermeasures, but it is sufficient to enable strikes on commercial vessels. In principle, this should also be a viable means of targeting ASBMs, particularly as the altitudes that these missiles reach mean that their onboard sensors can cover very wide areas in the terminal phase. The challenge, however, is that ballistic missiles require a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle (MARV) to be accurate against moving targets. MARVs are inherently difficult to design and could not be easily moved from Iran, so it is not clear that Houthi ASBMs have them. This could explain the margins by which they appear to have missed their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-defence-and-coercion&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Defence and Coercion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major issue facing the Coalition is not the difficulty of intercepting Houthi missiles and UAVs per se, but rather the cost of doing so and the mismatch between tactical and strategic effectiveness. While vessels such as the USS Carney have proven highly capable, they have had to expend disproportionately expensive interceptors such as the SM-2 and ESSM in order to engage relatively cheap targets. Moreover, the challenges of replenishing vertical launch cells at sea mean that once a destroyer has expended its missile magazine, it must rotate to a friendly facility to reload. Aircraft such as the carrier-based F/A-18 can operate in a defensive role and can be reloaded more effectively, but this requires the persistent presence of a US aircraft carrier in the region when the demand signal from other theatres is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, securing shipping requires a disproportionately resource-intensive effort on the part of the defender relative to the attacker when the latter has the advantage of proximity. This was illustrated during previous challenges to freedom of navigation such as the 1980s Tanker War. Because of this, the Coalition may have to shift its approach from defence to coercion, as only a cessation of Houthi attacks is likely to mitigate the effects of increased insurance costs and lengthened shipping routes. The challenge will be identifying an appropriate approach, as the Coalition will have to balance the need to present the Houthis with a credible threat to compel a change in behaviour with preventing misperceptions by both the Houthis and their Iranian backers which could lead to a larger conflict. Faced with the rollback of Hamas in Gaza and the possibility of an Israeli attack on Hizbullah, the Iranians could misperceive an extensive strike campaign against the Houthis as being part of a broader effort to roll back their regional proxy network, and may react unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-possible-approaches&quot;&gt;Three Possible Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One approach, dubbed “turning the screw”, involves limited actions with the threat of more to come. This approach entails striking a target of marginal value, such as a missile launcher or a coastal radar, while withholding the option of further action to give the target an opportunity to comply. Though the Houthis have become adept at operating under conditions of adversary air superiority, countries such as the UAE have struck Houthi missile launchers in the past, and the US struck Houthi radars in 2016 in a similar effort. However, this approach cedes the option of escalation to the opponent, who may perceive limited action as evidence of irresolution and continue as if nothing had happened. This leaves the options of further strikes or backing down, and could mean sleepwalking into the large-scale conflagration one is trying to avoid. Should initial failure result in wider strikes to disable a larger number of launchers, this might prove indistinguishable from a full-scale bombing campaign to the Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach would be to present the Houthis and Iranians with the prospect of large-scale attacks on the Houthis’ military infrastructure, along with a privately communicated deadline for compliance. Posturing for action at scale while communicating the conditions for de-escalation can deliver effects, as it did during the 1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, but time is on the side of the opponent. Posturing the resources needed to act at scale can only be done for a limited period, and an opponent can always desist for a time and wait for aircraft carriers to rotate out before resuming attacks. However, such an approach could secure temporary relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Houthis are a persistent and determined opponent, and it is unlikely that they will halt their strikes simply because they are ineffective&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most viable coercive approach would likely involve direct attacks against a limited but valuable target set. The model here would be Operation Praying Mantis, in which the US Navy sank a portion of the Iranian fleet during the Tanker War, but desisted from carrying out strikes inland. The target set chosen was valuable enough to dispel any ambiguity about irresolution, but did not threaten the Iranians with the prospect of wider US attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any target set chosen must combine several characteristics. It should involve targets with concentrated value where sufficient damage can be inflicted with a minimal number of strikes. It should also involve targets related to the Houthi maritime strike capability and exclude assets that are not, in order to signal limited intent. The latter would include command and control nodes, as strikes on them could be viewed as the opening stages of a wider campaign. There are targets within Yemen which might meet this description. For example, the Houthis’ indigenous missile manufacturing capability might represent a target that can be struck on a limited basis. Though the Houthis import missile components, assembly is often done locally and thus requires some specialist equipment and personnel, with the latter being especially hard to replace. This comes with certain risks, as these facilities and the personnel who man them are in urban nodes such as Sanaa. Stockpiles of missiles represent another target, as requirements such as temperature-controlled storage limit an opponent’s capacity to distribute them. Though these storage sites are hardened and buried, they can be struck with some existing maritime strike capabilities such as the Tomahawk Block V. The boats which may be used to cue UAVs like the Samad could also be struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-sum&quot;&gt;In Sum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Houthis’ maritime strike capabilities are technically advanced but lack targeting sophistication. They therefore represent a manageable threat that can be countered with air defence assets in the region, providing that Iran does not improve target cuing for the Houthis. However, the Houthis are a persistent and determined opponent, and it is unlikely that they will halt their strikes simply because they are ineffective. This makes direct coercion to stop them more likely. The most effective course of action would involve strikes against limited but valuable target sets within the Houthi organisation. Doing so would impact the group’s ability to continue its missile strikes while minimising the risk of a wider regional conflict, thereby enabling the US and other navies to free up capacity for other strategic concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the paper addresses how the force design of the UK’s Royal Marines will need to evolve for the marines to be able to contribute to the amphibious capabilities of an alliance or a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that, rather than being a capability which is used to exploit sea control once a fleet has secured it, amphibious forces should represent a landward extension of the fleet. This is subtly different, as it involves closely integrating amphibious forces with two strictly naval functions: maritime strike; and efforts to secure sea control. Such a use of amphibious forces entails tactical specialisation, with a particular focus on closing a potential gap between bluewater navies and the joint force. However, as will be discussed, a tactical focus on enabling strikes need not limit the number of use cases for more specialised amphibious forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major feature of the future operating environment is likely to be adversaries with enhanced anti-access capabilities and longer-ranged fires ashore. For allied and coalition amphibious forces, this means that disembarked forces will need to be distributed more widely, and the shipping that supports them will have to operate from greater distances. While this challenge will be especially acute in contexts involving near-peer opponents, the proliferation of anti-access capabilities makes it a likely challenge in several contexts in which UK and allied amphibious forces may be deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that adapting to this emerging operating environment will be best achieved through a concept of operations that subsumes amphibious power projection under the naval functions of strike and sea control. Distributed amphibious forces have a key operational role to play in tackling the challenge of enhanced anti-access capabilities through converging long-range fires capabilities. While this approach, epitomised by the US Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations framework, is typically treated as synonymous with sea denial, it in fact has wider applicability. Having a mix of dispersed long-ranged fires, both afloat and ashore, and small groups of raiding forces, can present serious dilemmas to large opposing ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the combination of raiding and fires is not an exclusively amphibious solution, forces capable of manoeuvring both at sea and on land can compound the challenge for an opponent. In many contexts, including the narrow archipelagic seas of Europe, using amphibious forces in this way would force an opponent to survey an extended littoral space that encompasses mainland areas, the maritime domain and offshore islands. This would considerably increase the opponent’s ISR burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of functions on the maritime side of the littoral to which amphibious forces can also contribute, among them the exercise of sea control in politically sensitive conditions. This paper argues that amphibious operations should therefore be subsumed under two naval missions – strike and sea control – rather than being treated as a separate function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this rubric, the Royal Marines have the potential to act as an enabling force, both for strike-centric partners, and for both UK and allied naval forces. As a light raiding force, the marines can set the conditions for strike missions to be conducted on favourable terms. An emphasis on a lighter disembarked force should allow the maritime enablers upon which the commando force depends to evolve in ways that make them more multifunctional. Once a requirement to move heavy equipment is reduced, more emphasis can be placed on priorities such as the ability to carry sensors and strike munitions and achieving low observability. This can then enable tasks such as sea control, as well as archipelagic warfare on both sides of the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifting the emphasis of the Royal Marines towards the two priorities of strike and sea control implies tactical specialisation. But it does not necessarily imply a limitation of the operational and strategic roles that marines will play. Having a strike-centric concept of operations has demonstrable utility, both in contingencies in Europe and at expeditionary reach. It would involve narrowing the tactical roles and certifications of commandos, as well as a reduced emphasis on traditional light infantry functions. However, the size of the force and the changing operating environment mean that many of these functions are likely to be redundant in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging threats are making theatre entry for amphibious forces as it is presently conducted increasingly difficult and increasing the demand on the rest of the fleet and the wider joint force to provide protection to such forces where they do contribute. The risk facing amphibious forces, then, is that the value of amphibious insertion comes to be seen as being outweighed by its costs and risks. It is the argument of this paper that amphibious forces, including the Royal Marines, need not cede the littoral to shore-based anti-access/area denial capabilities. Such forces have the potential to add considerable value to allied deterrence. But to be able to do so in the future operating environment, they must integrate more closely with fleets, both in conceptual terms and in force design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is based on work conducted by the UK’s Royal Marines and supported in areas by RUSI to address how the marines must evolve in the future operating environment. Its function is to elaborate the rationale for changes underway, as well as to discuss the decisions which will need to be made as the force continues to evolve. The paper addresses two research questions that will be of importance to the Royal Marines as they continue their efforts at force transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can Western amphibious forces, in particular those within NATO, continue to contribute to deterrence and competition in contested environments across the spectrum of conflict?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will the Royal Marines, specifically, need to do to deliver value to an amphibious force generated by an alliance or coalition?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of contexts in which amphibious forces can be useful, including a range of missions other than war, the paper’s focus is on operations in environments where forces’ freedom of manoeuvre is contested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges that will be faced by amphibious forces in contested environments are common to all operating environments. The convergence of increasingly capable methods of sensor fusion and processing with the proliferation of long-range strike capabilities will make expeditionary forces vulnerable both at sea and on land. Both peer competitors and sub-peer challengers possess long-range strike capabilities that are becoming more cost effective and are proliferating as a result, along with – to varying degrees – the ability to cue them at reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While generating wide-area situational awareness at sea remains a complex task, the proliferation of sensors both military and commercial, coupled with developments in areas such as software-defined sensors and machine learning, will equip a growing range of actors with the ability to rapidly detect, classify and engage targets at sea. Movement inland will also become increasingly difficult. This has been illustrated in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. An evolving man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) threat adequately networked with longer-range radar can make airborne manoeuvre and assault – which previously helped to counteract the challenge of anti-access area denial (A2/AD) capabilities – increasingly risky. Once ashore, amphibious forces will have to contend with shorter-ranged fires, cruise and ballistic missiles, and attack from fixed-wing aircraft. The threat to amphibious lodgements is not new, but it will become increasingly multi-tiered, combining threats that fly at different altitudes with different profiles, making air defence increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, anti-access capabilities are likely to become more potent and, crucially, are no longer the preserve of a small subset of actors. Consider, for example, the Ukrainian army’s successful destruction of what were likely the forward elements of a Russian force near Odesa early in the conflict, or, in Yemen, the Houthi movement’s partially successful efforts to contest the anti-Houthi coalition’s freedom of movement at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, defensive countermeasures to the threats described above are emerging. For example, directed-energy weapons can enable the cost-effective intercept of certain types of munition. However, the incorporation of new modes of defence creates new requirements, both in relation to the size and power generation of platforms needed to defend an amphibious force, and for these platforms to be risked in forward positions. Moreover, the asymmetry of costs between missiles and vessels means that attackers enjoy more room for error and, in littoral areas, vessels can be struck by a range of both long- and short-ranged weapons, making it difficult to optimise against specific threats. Once ashore, concentrated force elements can be defended, but at increasingly high cost and for limited periods of time. While these challenges are not unique to littoral combat in every instance, the challenge of concentrating will be especially acute in the littoral context, given the vulnerability of a force when it is building up ashore, and the risks it faces if cut off from naval support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cumulatively, not only do these new threats make theatre entry increasingly difficult for amphibious forces, but they also increase the demand on the rest of the fleet and the wider joint force to provide protection. This will be an especially acute challenge when blue-water capabilities will have to operate at greater distances from coastlines and dedicate considerable effort to defending themselves and performing purely naval functions. The risk facing amphibious forces, then, is that the value of amphibious insertion comes to be seen as being outweighed by its costs and risks. Of course, there are a number of other roles that amphibious forces have come to play over the course of previous decades, but many of these do not depend on their amphibious roles per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for their specialism to continue delivering operational and strategic value, then, amphibious forces will need to adapt to this increasingly contested operating environment. This paper seeks to articulate an approach through which Western amphibious forces can continue to do so, in both alliance and coalition contexts. The paper’s key contention is that amphibious forces should act as an extension of the fleet, with their function being to enable two naval functions – strike and sea control. Rather than being a force projected by the fleet, amphibious forces should operate as an integral part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s proposition is that the amphibious forces most capable of supporting the fleet will be capable of delivering convergent effects from distributed positions. This requires lower force-to-space ratios, greater mobility on both sides of the littoral, and an emphasis on long-range fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 20th century, the primary mode of adaptation to increases in the range and lethality of weapons was to reduce force-to-space ratios. The most extreme example of this is non-state actors, who must contend with superior firepower and thus typically do not have force-to-space ratios over 10 fighters per square kilometre. Reducing these ratios, however, makes it difficult to concentrate forces for tactical effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way of addressing the challenge is for dispersed forces to coordinate long-range strikes. For example, infantry teams equipped with portable loitering munitions can concentrate fire to saturate specific high-value targets even where they are distributed over very broad frontages. Similarly, a system such as the US Marine Corps HIMARS can concentrate fire with munitions such as the 500 km-range precision-strike missile without being colocated. While the ability to bring a weight of fire upon opponents from dispersed positions is not a uniquely amphibious function, amphibious forces have two advantages in this field. First, their ability to operate both from land and from the maritime side of the littoral creates an expanded range of vectors from which amphibious forces can deliver fires. Integration with a maritime component command can also allow amphibious forces to draw on naval fires. Second, the relative mobility of amphibious forces can enable them to support fires with other functions, such as raiding at depths that other force elements cannot access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond strikes and raiding ashore, amphibious forces can also contribute to a range of maritime functions, including the exercise of sea control, and sea denial against adversary vessels in littoral waters. While amphibious forces already play a role in tasks such as interdiction and the generation of situational awareness, this role could be expanded if the force structure and capabilities of amphibious units were to make operating in close coordination with the fleet on both sides of the littoral into a core competency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proposal of this paper is that amphibious forces can become more survivable and lethal by adopting a strike-centric concept of operations that emphasises better integration with fleets. The paper further argues that the adaptations required to enable such an approach, including an emphasis on multifunctional surface manoeuvre craft rather than on dedicated connectors, can also allow marine units to better contribute to missions on the maritime side of the littoral – such as the exercise of sea control, for example. This concept of operations implies a degree of specialisation that does entail a cost in terms of multifunctionality. However, an approach based on optimisation within the fleet can make amphibious forces more relevant to the most consequential challenges that Western nations may face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues outlined here will be central to the force transformation decisions of all European marine forces over the next decade. A key question for the Royal Marines specifically will be how the force model upon which its Future Commando Force programme (FCF) is based can deliver greatest value in an Allied context. The size of the Royal Marines means that the force will need to be configured to work with Allies and coalition partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is composed of five chapters. Chapter I outlines the traditional contributions of amphibious forces and their relevance to current UK national priorities. Chapter II summarises the challenges posed to forces’ effective operation by the contemporary operating environment. Chapter III articulates the case for what the authors see as the major adaptations that amphibious forces will need to make to be effective in this environment: becoming more focused on a strike-led concept of operations; and achieving greater integration with naval forces. Chapters IV and V examine the implications for the Royal Marines’ force design and capability needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodologically, the paper is informed by a combination of a review of historical literature, operations analysis and insights from experimentation and exercises undertaken under the aegis of the Royal Marines’ FCF programme. An assessment of historical trends and patterns in the contemporary operating environment has been used to frame the paper’s discussion of how amphibious forces might contribute to the goals of a single state, alliance or coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-enduring-roles-of-amphibious-forces-and-their-application-to-uk-national-priorities&quot;&gt;I. The Enduring Roles of Amphibious Forces and Their Application to UK National Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has historically been a strong case to be made for both the operational manoeuvrability and the strategic flexibility that amphibious forces offer policymakers. However, for these forces to continue to be tactically relevant, they will need to equip and operate in ways that differ considerably from current practice. Amphibious forces have in the past played a range of roles both above and below the threshold of high-intensity conflict. Below the threshold of conflict, their primary roles have included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signalling.&lt;/strong&gt; Amphibious capabilities can play a role in deterrent signalling. By virtue of the visibility of their supporting vessels, they represent a visible diplomatic signal. However, amphibious forces are scalable – a portion of a force can be deployed ashore while the rest remains offshore, for example. They can also be withdrawn from a theatre as diplomatic circumstances dictate, meaning that their deployment need not represent a commitment that is difficult to reverse. Scalability is important, as a key dimension of deterrence is that it must be balanced against efforts to mitigate misperception – an opponent should be able to distinguish between a deterrent threat and preparations for an attack. Moreover, the coordination of military means with diplomacy also necessitates the ability to demonstrate that a threat can be withdrawn if an opponent complies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presence in a theatre.&lt;/strong&gt; Amphibious forces have the capacity to remain engaged in a theatre over extended periods without drawing on local basing to the same degree as other capabilities. They can also, by virtue of their mobility, engage with multiple actors within a given theatre. The tasks they can perform in this capacity range from HADR (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief) activity to engaging local partners in advise-and-assist missions. In this capacity, they can contribute both to diplomatic influence and to what might be described as “general deterrence”, which denotes efforts to shape perceptions of a state’s commitment to an area, rather than a specific threat to dissuade a specific action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In escalating crises and conflict, amphibious forces have historically played the following roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid reaction to contingencies that develop outside the Euro-Atlantic area.&lt;/strong&gt; Examples include the early deployments of the US Marine Corps in Lebanon by the Eisenhower administration in 1958 and the early deployment of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando into Kuwait in 1961 as part of Operation Vantage, a successful effort to forestall an Iraqi invasion. Early presence is often crucial, either for deterrence or, if deterrence fails, for setting the conditions for subsequent efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception and operational dislocation.&lt;/strong&gt; The presence of amphibious forces can force the diversion of an opponent’s resources across multiple fronts. We might consider how, historically, British forces embarked in the Downs tied down a considerable Napoleonic army or – for a more recent example – how the afloat presence of the 4th and 5 th Marine Expeditionary Brigades were used to unhinge Iraqi defences during the 1991 Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruption.&lt;/strong&gt; The actions of commando units during the Second World War stand out as a particularly notable example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing advanced bases or points of entry&lt;/strong&gt; for heavier forces to enter a theatre of combat – a role that became especially prominent for the US Marine Corps during the interwar years, and which may be one of the functions of the Marine Corps of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is a range of roles that marine units have played in both peacetime and conflict. Among these are tasks such as boarding and interdiction at sea, and the provision of niche capabilities such as riverine craft in support of joint activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of operations and the tactics used to achieve objectives will be impacted by technological change, a subject that will be explored in more depth in subsequent chapters. However, this paper’s contention is that this will not fundamentally alter the roles of amphibious units as described. For example, the disruption of an opponent’s rear area by amphibious units posturing offshore could, in some cases, be achieved by these units launching loitering munitions from positions on or near the coast, rather than through infantry raids. Indeed, this would be desirable in many cases, given the risks posed to landing forces by A2/AD. However, the logic of disruption that would underly such an action would remain unaltered. The most significant changes would be at the level of equipment and tactics, rather than the underlying logic of employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While forces’ versatility to play the full gamut of the roles described above is desirable, delivering on national and Alliance-level priorities does entail emphasising some functions over others. The priorities identified in this paper are understood within the context of the UK’s Integrated Review (IR) and the Integrated Review Refresh, which identify Russia as the most acute threat to British national security, while acknowledging the reality of systemic competition with China and enduring risks in areas such as the Strait of Hormuz. With the specific roles that a state prioritises most heavily for its amphibious forces determined by the context in which they operate, this discussion focuses primarily on the strategic concerns of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the UK’s priorities will not align completely with those of allies and partners, they do overlap to a significant degree with those of other nations within NATO, and the rank ordering of priorities in the IR is also broadly mirrored in NATO’s Strategic Concept. This makes them a useful baseline for discussing the contexts in which other Western amphibious forces might also be employed. To be sure, concepts for utilising amphibious forces will not always converge across nations (though for scenarios such as those that trigger NATO Article V, alliance-level planning will introduce some coherence). One of the aims of this paper is to articulate an idea of how the UK’s amphibious forces might be used that can plausibly be aligned with the local circumstances of partner amphibious forces, based on the capabilities they either possess, or are planning to procure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three scenarios attendant on the list of priorities that emerged from the IR to which amphibious forces can be particularly relevant, and which therefore deserve particular attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dislocation and disruption&lt;/strong&gt; in the context of a regional war or an escalating “war in sight” crisis within Europe involving NATO and Russia – a low probability but high-impact scenario. Though not a main line of effort, amphibious capabilities can provide a level of mobility at both the tactical and operational levels. This can compel the dispersion of adversary capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expeditionary power projection.&lt;/strong&gt; This function will be of particular salience to interstate competition beyond Europe. Such competition will include elements of direct conflict, albeit at comparatively low levels of intensity. The ability to commit a unit of force alongside partner force elements that represents a meaningful contribution, but which is small enough to reflect the political constraints inherent in expeditionary activity, is an important tool when attempting to balance deterrence and escalation control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling sea control&lt;/strong&gt; in the context of either sub-threshold competition or an escalating crisis. This role can be relevant to both the European context and to theatres such as Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not intended to be an exhaustive list of roles that amphibious forces can play. Rather, it outlines the contingencies where there appears to be an especially significant role that amphibious forces such as the Royal Marines can play in realising the aspirations set out in the IR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-crisis-or-conflict-in-europe&quot;&gt;A Crisis or Conflict in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, NATO’s deter and defend framework will depend in no small part on the ability to outmanoeuvre an opponent which, for all its deficiencies, has demonstrated an ability to sustain materiel and human attrition at a scale that NATO would struggle to match. Although bloodied by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russia is likely to reconstitute its forces over the medium term. Particularly when concentrated on a narrow front, the combination of Russia’s fires, its electronic warfare (EW) and air defences can pose a considerable challenge. Though Russia’s force is, in some respects, qualitatively degraded, the Russians have demonstrated the ability to combine smaller numbers of capable infantry with large numbers of more expendable forces in a force model that, while highly wasteful in both material and human terms, is effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At both the tactical and the operational level, the Concept for Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA) seeks to overcome the challenge of mass through a series of integrated plans. One likely consequence of developing integrated regional plans is to force the commitment of Russian capabilities on multiple fronts in a way that prevents them from being concentrated to effect. Efforts to exacerbate Russia’s traditional weaknesses in the maritime domain can contribute to this. The country remains vulnerable to operational dislocation along an extended maritime periphery – something illustrated in historical conflicts such as the Crimean War and more recently, in the 1980s, when the US Reagan administration’s maritime strategy envisioned the aggressive use of Allied naval and amphibious power in the High North and Soviet Far East to draw Soviet ground and air forces away from the central front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Russia can be faced with similar challenges on its northern flank, where the Alliance’s borders place key Russian facilities, such as Murmansk, within reach of long-range precision fires. This could exert an indirect influence on other parts of the Alliance’s eastern flank. In the context of an escalating crisis in a region such as the Baltic, the posturing of amphibious forces on NATO’s northern frontier, coordinated with activity by other force elements on other fronts as envisioned by the DDA, would impose multiple operational dilemmas on Russia. At a minimum, a decision to posture amphibious units this way would force the diversion of air assets, defensive SAM systems and some of Russia’s best assault troops from the VDV and 200th Arctic Brigade, which are largely responsible for cold-weather operations, from other theatres. The requirement to resource multiple fronts concurrently could contribute to the objective of denial by preventing Russian planners from believing that they can concentrate enough force on any one front to achieve meaningful strategic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the vanguard element of a larger force, the Royal Marines would not be the biggest element in any force engaged in such an operation – allowing the Alliance to signal deterrent, as opposed to offensive, intent. The marines could arrive and go emissions dark, leaving Russian planners guessing both their ultimate goals and whether or not they were the vanguard element of a larger force such as a US Marine Corps Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). Uncertainty about the Alliance’s force dispositions could impose considerable demands in terms of surveillance and conventional hedging. Notably, this was crucial to deterrence vis-á-vis the Soviet Union. Routine carrier deployments to the High North had limited effect until the exercise Ocean Venture, in which Soviet planners recognised they were not able to spot NATO carrier strike groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, an escalatory dimension to any such deployment near Russia’s nuclear bastions. However, an advantage of an amphibious vanguard component is that it would not pose an imminent threat to the Kola Peninsula (which hosts critical Russian naval and nuclear infrastructure) by itself, but could be the forward element of a force that could do so – it would be large enough to draw resources, but need not incur inadvertent escalation. Amphibious forces played a similar role in the context of NATO’s maritime strategy in the 1980s – though without the reach to be an operationally significant threat in their own right, as modern strike-enabled forces can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the diversion of Russian forces at the operational level, mobile forces can exacerbate Russian weaknesses with respect to dynamic targeting at the tactical level. As an example of this, we might consider the difficulty Russia had sinking Ukraine’s last warship, the Yuri Olefirenko, while the vessel was at sea. Though Russia’s targeting system can be formidable, it is at its most dangerous when many sensors can be concentrated on a narrow sector. Expanding the geography Russian forces must survey by conducting offensive manoeuvre from the littorals can place Russian forces at a disadvantage. Consider, for example, that the landmass of a nation such as Norway increases by 20% when islets and not only the mainland are included. Similarly, Estonia has 2,222 islands. Forces operating from offshore islands could disrupt the rear of a Russian advance using long-range precision fires, large numbers of containerised loitering munitions, or infantry raids inland. In theatres where narrow frontages can be saturated by adversary UAVs and ISR assets, exploiting this manoeuvre space can substantially expand the area an opponent must survey, and prevent an adversary system such as a Russian reconnaissance fire complex from operating as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expeditionary-power-projection&quot;&gt;Expeditionary Power Projection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area in which amphibious forces such as the Royal Marines would likely be expected to deliver value is expeditionary operations at reach. Such operations will, with some exceptions, be of a lower intensity than those within the NATO Area of Responsibility and will involve more limited political commitment. The unit of force likely to be committed by a nation such as the UK will, then, only be strategically effective in tandem with either a coalition or local partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alliance must hedge against the possibility that, much like the Cold War, contemporary interstate competition will occur short of open war at high intensity, because the risks of a direct large-scale war are too substantial for both sides. Though not as immediately consequential as a direct great power clash, the cumulative effects of persistent competition and conflict can be considerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, we might consider the risks to sea lines of communication (SLOCs) upon which both the inputs that sustain both the defence industry and Western trade in general depend. Many geographically crucial SLOCs, including Hormuz and the Bab el Mandeb, are flanked either by hostile powers such as Iran, or by fragile states in which internal instability can intersect with great power competition. Opponents such as Russia and Iran have proven capable of leveraging internecine conflicts in Libya, Syria and Yemen to good effect to create strategic bastions along key SLOCs, and develop leverage over regional actors such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. Not only does this pose a challenge to economically vital SLOCs, it can also threaten the flows of inputs such as microelectronics and explosive charges upon which European defence industries depend. The need to pre-empt further losses in key areas makes the ability to respond rapidly to an evolving crisis beyond Europe a priority, one which will indirectly impact the security of Europe itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional functions of amphibious forces can be of relevance in such contexts. The deployment of units can generate early presence to both signal intent and deter intervention by a rival third party. Once in theatre, amphibious forces can perform a number of functions, including supporting partner forces in seizing military objectives; and enabling theatre entry by heavier forces by securing sea ports of debarkation (SPODs), and conducting raids against A2/AD capabilities to secure theatre access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sea-control-missions-within-the-nato-area-of-responsibility-and-beyond&quot;&gt;Sea Control Missions Within the NATO Area of Responsibility and Beyond&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amphibious forces can contribute to efforts to secure sea control in several ways. First, they can provide the fleet with additional ISR capabilities, and the capability to interdict hostile shipping. In peacetime competition this function will be of particular importance against opponents who may conduct activities such as minelaying or maritime sabotage using auxiliary vessels, as it will be vital to prove that a given vessel was involved in malign activity. As cases such as US special forces’ seizure of the clandestine Iranian minelayer Iran Ajr illustrate, this requires vessels defended by armed crews to be seized, rather than sunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing especially novel about the use of capabilities such as auxiliary vessels for tasks such as minelaying and sabotage, the range of targets that can be affected by such activities is expanding, partly as a function of the growing reliance of nations on coastal and subsurface critical infrastructure. For example, while transoceanic cables have always been a chokepoint in global communications, their centrality has grown in line with states’ reliance on the internet. Moreover, the range of tools with which opponents can impact critical infrastructure is growing – a uncrewed underwater vessel (UUV) such as the Russian Harpsichord, for example, can be operated from a range of vessels to conduct either surveillance or sabotage. Crucially, the ability to prevent clandestine sabotage will be important not only to protect critical infrastructure, but also to prevent an opponent from conducting shaping operations in an area such as the Baltic Sea or the Strait of Hormuz, should a crisis in one of these sites escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to interdiction and boarding vessels, the capabilities that support marine forces can also support tasks such as generating situational awareness and preventing interdictions by hostile naval vessels. For example, we might consider how SOCOM (US Special Operations Command) used the Hercules and Wimbrown, two converted vessels used as sea bases, to counter Iranian small-boat swarms during the Iran–Iraq war. In the context of conflict in a region such as the Persian Gulf, amphibious forces can support sea control by generating situational awareness about threats to vessels at sea and conducting raids to eliminate anti-access threats to vessels at sea such as coastal defence cruise missiles. Amphibious capabilities should be considered for tasks of surveillance and presence, rather than simply insertion. Such usage better reflects the range of functions – including boarding – that these forces offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-a-new-operating-environment-the-need-for-change&quot;&gt;II. A New Operating Environment: The Need for Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For marine forces to achieve any of the functions discussed in Chapter I under current and likely future operating conditions will require a radical change to the way these forces are structured and, in particular, greater integration between them and blue-water assets. To an extent, this change is already underway across several Western militaries. What the scope and degree of integration between naval and amphibious forces remains, however, the subject of some debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-to-theatre-entry&quot;&gt;Challenges to Theatre Entry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent history, amphibious forces have been both the beneficiaries of sea control, and a means of exploiting it to strategic effect. Once a navy secured littoral waters, amphibious forces were inserted and typically benefited from support from the sea in the form of sustainment and air support. However, in many contemporary contexts, the fleet is likely to have to fight to enter a theatre and cannot loiter near hostile shores for long. This challenge will be especially acute against a peer competitor such as Russia, but will hold even against sub-peer opponents, as illustrated by events such as Ukraine’s sinking of the Russian flagship Moskva and the possession of anti-ship missile batteries by both the Houthis and Hizbullah. This is not to say that operating in a threat envelope is impossible – solutions exist for each challenge, including EW, shipboard air defences and a growing suite of counter-UAV measures. However, it will not always be possible for fleets to loiter offshore in support of marine forces for extended periods. Instead, until adversary sensors and effectors have been considerably degraded, amphibious forces will need to be able to both fight and deliver effects inland under the assumption that support from the fleet is intermittent, rather than persistent. If postured for deterrence by denial, amphibious forces will find themselves operating under these conditions for considerable periods – though in the later stages of a conflict they may enjoy more unfettered freedom of movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once forces are disembarked, amphibious forces’ lodgements ashore will be at considerable risk, and the operational pauses needed to build up capabilities will likely prove fatal. A range of capabilities, including tactical ballistic missiles, artillery UAVs and glider-equipped unguided bombs, such as the Russian FAB-500, launched from fixed-wing aircraft, will threaten disembarked forces. Of course the risk posed by operational pauses has long been a persistent feature of amphibious campaigns. But the diversification of air and missile threats will make protecting a lodgement even more difficult than it has been previously. Beyond Europe, the proliferation of strike capabilities would create a similar, though less sophisticated, set of challenges. The gulf between the types of capability needed to defeat peers and sub-peers is narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question for amphibious forces will be how to deliver tactical and operational effects when achieving the force-to-space ratios needed to do so is very difficult, and the mechanisms that support these forces ashore and afloat are held at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changing-coastal-geography&quot;&gt;Changing Coastal Geography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many environments in which expeditionary activity is likely to be conducted will also be shaped by another trend – the urbanisation of coastal areas. As of 2030, roughly 60% of the world’s population will live in cities, many of which will be coastal. Moreover, urban area coverage has outstripped population growth, implying that considerable stretches of many coastlines will be urbanised. As illustrated by the prominence of cities such as Aden, Marawi and Mocimboa da Praia in recent conflicts, battles within coastal conurbations will be a major feature of littoral combat. This is noteworthy because urban warfare often requires considerable amounts of manpower to hold ground, as well as the expenditure of small-arms ammunition at rates that exceed consumption in open terrain by several orders of magnitude. Such conditions will pose an especially acute challenge to size-restricted light expeditionary forces, and to Western nations that must balance the requirements of deterrence in theatres such as Europe with the need to project power. The challenge will be compounded by adversary efforts to shield key capabilities from the effects of Western airpower by using palliatives such as underground tunnels – something that can be seen in both urban terrain and in fortifications such as those Iran has constructed in the Tartus mountains. The basic challenge that expeditionary forces will face is finding a way to deliver policy imperatives such as providing value to local partners with comparatively small forces while operating in terrain that requires considerable commitments, in terms of munitions and manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resource-burdens-on-fleets&quot;&gt;Resource Burdens on Fleets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evolving nature of sub-threshold threats at sea will require greater levels of persistent presence. While this is a naval challenge, rather than one that applies specifically to marines, it has an indirect effect, both on tasks such as maritime boarding and on the availability of hulls from the wider fleet to support amphibious forces. To justify the dedication of naval vessels to support amphibious warfare, the conduct of amphibious operations must come to more fully embrace tasks that support sea control. Marines already support sea control through activities such as interdiction, but there are broader contributions to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the risk to amphibious forces in the emerging operating environment is threefold. First, they will face challenges in areas such as theatre entry and sustainment in likely combat environments. These challenges, while not unique to amphibious operations, will impose considerable burdens upon these forces. Second, they must be able to impact events in theatres such as urban environments that typically demand more manpower than expeditionary forces can expect to have at hand. The final risk is an organisational one – that the resource burden of inserting forces into a theatre and subsequently sustaining them exceeds the value they provide to the wider joint force, and to blue-water navies in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this paper describes ways that amphibious forces can address these challenges such that they can continue to contribute to Allied security in the ways that they historically have done. It also addresses the specific capability niches that the UK’s Commando Force can fill in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-new-approaches&quot;&gt;III. New Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous chapters have discussed the potential roles that amphibious forces can play in the context of UK and Allied national security objectives, and the operational impediments to their accomplishment. This chapter sets out the case for the paper’s key argument, that to retain their utility to the wider joint force, amphibious operations in contested environments should be subsumed under two doctrinal naval functions – strike and securing sea control. It also connects this argument to the strategic objectives outlined in Chapter I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges to amphibious power projection described in the previous chapter have been incipient for some time, and a variety of solutions have been proposed to mitigate them. Broadly speaking, these solutions may be grouped into three categories which, while not exhaustive, capture the major areas of focus with respect to operations in contested environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approaches that depend on distributing the force across a broad front, maintaining a high operational tempo and manoeuvring towards operational objectives, while bypassing adversary concentrations to the extent possible. This approach is captured by concepts such as the US Marine Corps’ Operational Manoeuvre from the Sea (OMFTS), but early traces of it can be seen in historical amphibious operations such as the Japanese assault on Malaya in the Second World War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strike-centric concepts that envision delivering convergent effects with distributed forces equipped with long-range fires. This is arguably a partial description of the primary focus of the US Marine Corps’ Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations framework, although the concept also embraces tasks such as supporting naval forces from offshore positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shift in focus towards raiding and unconventional operations in a Tier 2 special forces role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concepts such as the direct assault and seizure of ports, which are still seriously considered by many nations, including China, are excluded here on the grounds that direct assault to seize and hold heavily defended high-value targets is likely to entail a degree of attrition that no Western force will tolerate. For a contemporary example of a state operationalising such a concept, see, for example, the VDV’s assault on Hostomel airport in February 2022. While there are differences between amphibious and airborne assault, both rely to a considerable extent on airborne insertion. Amphibious forces might be better supported by airpower and naval support, but would still face the challenge of being a concentrated target against which a range of capabilities could be concentrated – much as the VDV was at Hostomel. The seizure and subsequent defence of SPODs may be an ultimate objective of amphibious insertion, but direct assault would seem an unlikely approach in most cases where credible resistance is likely to be encountered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the three approaches described articulates part of a potential solution to some of the challenges outlined in Chapter II. However, it is this paper’s contention that they are individually incomplete. High-tempo dispersed operations comparable to those envisioned under OMFTS can succeed in discovering, creating and exploiting weaknesses within an opponent’s defensive lines. The distribution of forces can deny an opponent an obvious point at which to concentrate defences, and can enable infiltration. Combined with longer-range means of theatre entry such as long-range surface connectors and vertical lift solutions, this can force an opponent to thin out defences and spread ISR capabilities over wider areas, thereby contributing to mitigating the risk from A2/AD capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the history of distributed assault suggests that avoiding strongpoints may not always be possible – meaning that a force needs to be capable of reducing those strongpoints it does encounter. This creates a trade-off – a force sufficiently large to overcome serious resistance has traditionally required things such as a headquarters and organic artillery and armour. This, however, undermines the principle of low force densities central to such concepts. Notably, this appears to be a challenge that the PLA’s marine corps is facing, with its combined arms battalions that operate on a model comparable to OMFTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of long-range precision fires in littoral areas including offshore islands, and amphibious vessels as envisioned under concepts such as Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations, can help resolve some of the trade-offs between lethality and dispersion. Long-range precision fires can allow a convergence of effect to be achieved by dispersed forces which, by virtue of operating offshore, do not face some of the challenges that manoeuvring inland entails. However, the challenge that such an approach would face is cross-regional applicability. Strike-centric forces distributed on offshore islands have obvious utility in a theatre such as the First Island Chain, where their main function is sea denial against an opponent such as the PLA Navy. But this approach has been challenged on the basis that there is applicability for strike-centric concepts to missions other than sea denial, particularly in theatres where many important targets are likely to be on the ground, and concealed within complex terrain-challenge sets that have historically necessitated combined arms approaches. These latter target sets have historically necessitated the ability to conduct a close fight with the opponent on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a special-forces-driven model can deliver value in a number of areas, including human intelligence and preparation of the battlefield. Additionally, functions such as raiding can limit some of the risks posed by A2/AD capabilities by limiting the size of forces inserted and their signatures. However, to be effective, raiding and other special forces activities must be integrated with a wider joint effort – they can rarely, if ever, deliver meaningful effects in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three broad approaches outlined above can be mutually reinforcing, rather than mutually exclusive. Distributed ranged fires capabilities positioned offshore on islands, amphibious vessels and auxiliaries can provide dispersed forces ashore with the fire support needed to eliminate concentrations of adversary forces, without these forces needing to be so large that they require an operational pause, headquarters and additional enablers. In turn, distributed forces ashore act both as an ISR screen for offshore fires and as a raiding force that compels adversary targets to move, unmask or concentrate for protection in ways that create vulnerabilities to offshore fires. Supported by offshore fires, comparatively light forces can also concentrate to perform tasks such as assaulting adversary strongpoints or defending SPODs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discussion illustrates that there is a symbiotic link between strike-centric concepts and manoeuvre inland from the sea. Thus, while amphibious power projection and maritime strike have historically been doctrinally separated, this paper argues that they should now converge. Such convergence can be of importance to blue-water navies, which presently face limitations in their offensive strike capacity relative to the number of potential missions they face both at sea and on land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key way that amphibious forces can be better integrated with core naval tasks is by generating presence and situational awareness at sea. Many of the enablers needed to underpin a strike-centric concept of power projection can – as will be discussed below – also enable marines to contribute capacity to sea control missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being viewed as a distinct maritime function, then, amphibious power projection should be subsumed under the rubric of strike and sea control – which would entail greater conceptual and functional integration with blue-water navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections will articulate the key lines of effort that will be needed in order to realise the conceptual framework that has been described thus far. Broadly speaking, there are three lines of operational effort: a focus on sea control, archipelagic operations, and the enabling of partner forces. Success in delivering these priorities will be determined by the ability of marines to both generate fires and help the fleet win superior situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fires&quot;&gt;Fires&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-range strike could be provided by ground-based fires distributed on the littoral, but could also be delivered directly from the sea if enabled by a shift in the design principles that underpin surface connectors and enabling vessels towards a model that emphasised strike. Specifically, we might consider vessels such as the Chinese Type-22 catamaran, which can launch C-802 cruise missiles, or the British-designed Bladerunner, which is used as a missile launcher and more recently an air defence platform by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Such vessels are comparable in size to both existing surface connectors and ones envisioned under future programmes, and even when equipped with missiles are generally cost effective (a Type-22, for example, costs $13 million). A shift in design philosophy from boats dedicated to moving marines ashore to more multifunctional vessels capable of operating on and striking from the maritime part of the littoral could significantly enhance the strike capabilities of marine units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent experiments have also demonstrated that systems such as HIMARS can be used from the decks of amphibious vessels. While risking dedicated shipping would likely be unacceptably hazardous, it might be more acceptable to launch containerised munitions from auxiliary vessels. As seen during conflicts such as the Falklands War, non-military shipping can be repurposed. Coupled with trends towards the containerisation of both munitions and communications nodes, this could enable auxiliary assets to be used as mobile fires platforms in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-dispersed-contact-layer&quot;&gt;A Dispersed Contact Layer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersed forward elements capable of tasks such as assessing an opponent’s pattern of life and identifying elusive targets, and of passing data to strike assets via shared datalinks and network protocols, can more easily cue in fires if these forces have the tools to generate situational awareness in forward positions. Forward elements can deepen situational awareness, both through technical means such as deploying UAVs, and by interacting with partner forces. As an example of the former method, we might consider how Russian forces have employed complexes of three short-ranged Orlan-10 UAVs equipped respectively with EW, optical/designator and communications relay payloads to stimulate Ukrainian SAM radars, degrade them and designate them for strikes by networked artillery and long-range missile units. Evidence from exercises such as Green Dagger has shown that such forces can also disrupt adversaries in ways that force them to concentrate capabilities to counter raiders, in so doing becoming vulnerable to offshore strike platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of a dispersed contact layer to enable counter scouting is not exclusive to maritime operations. However, it has a particular salience in this context because the ability to move along multiple axes on the littoral (either by land, by sea or through the air) creates an expanded set of avenues for disruption by amphibious force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;archipelagic-warfare&quot;&gt;Archipelagic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater integration of amphibious forces with UK and Allied fleets, particularly in missions in narrow seas such as the Baltic, necessitates a focus on operating within and from archipelagos. Narrow archipelagic waterways often possess distinctive climatic conditions. For example, in the case of the Baltic Sea, fog is a frequent feature of the environment on a year-round basis, complicating the use of some sensors, such as electro-optical sensors. Similarly, water temperatures relative to the air can cause either subrefraction of radar waves, limiting the range of radar, or super refraction, which makes radar more sensitive to clutter. Force concealment can leverage these conditions based on local circumstances. While it is never possible to defeat the full spectrum of sensors that an opponent can aggregate, making use of climatic features to limit the effectiveness of some sensors can simplify the task of overcoming others. For example, if radar is subject to subrefraction, cueing sensors with a narrower field of view, such as electro-optical or infrared sensors, becomes more difficult. Moreover, knowing that specific sensor types represent a primary threat vector because others will be compromised by the climate can provide the focus for efforts at tactical deception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archipelagic contexts tend to enable smaller vessels to hide within clutter, particularly in crowded waters such as the Baltic. The navies of Baltic states have historically relied upon this when preparing for sea denial missions against a stronger Russian navy, as has the Norwegian navy in the north. It is possible, given the comparative weakness of the Russian surface fleet, that assets such as missile boats built for sea denial can be repurposed for sea control or projection inland. If this is the case, Allied marine units can usefully integrate with littoral-focused navies – using their platforms as launch pads for activity and strike assets, while making them more lethal against ground targets by providing them with situational awareness inland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geography of archipelagic contexts also lends itself to the distribution of long-ranged precision fires, something which is central to concepts such as Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations. This dynamic can also be applicable in a European context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sea-control&quot;&gt;Sea Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, the requirement to support the gaining and exercise of sea control at sea will remain, but the relevance of marines to this task can grow. There will be a greater requirement for multifunctionality in areas such as surface connector design, since numbers of hulls have shrunk relative to historical force structures across Western navies (though this trend may be starting to reverse). Western navies will, for a time at least, operate with fewer hulls, even as they face a growing imperative to meet persistent challenges, including the use of auxiliary vessels by rivals for tasks such as challenging freedom of navigation and coercive signalling near critical infrastructure. There is no single solution to these challenges, but one dimension of a solution set would be to expand the capability of marine forces to provide sensor coverage and the ability to act at sea. Dedicated and auxiliary amphibious platforms have demonstrated the ability to cover wide areas using vertical lift capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than being an auxiliary role, this can be a core function. Teaming existing vertical lift assets with unmanned platforms that have greater endurance could enhance this potential for a single hull to generate both presence and wide area coverage. Moreover, a shift in the design principles that determine which types of surface platforms are launched from amphibious vessels, towards an emphasis on surface manoeuvre, as opposed to ship-to-shore movement of heavy equipment, can yield amphibious capabilities that provide wide area coverage and can thus support the fleet, rather than being specialised purely for insertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;local-force-partnering&quot;&gt;Local Force Partnering&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, many of the contexts in which the UK may wish to achieve strategic effects at expeditionary reach may be urban environments. Amphibious forces will therefore need to reconcile their often limited size with the need to support expeditionary missions that will necessarily involve an urban component. While amphibious forces will likely not have the mass to conduct urban assaults, they can fulfil niche roles within them. A strike-centric concept of operations can have relevance both in high-intensity scenarios and in lower intensity expeditionary activity in complex terrain. It is likely that, given the forces required for urban fighting, the latter form of activity will almost always be undertaken alongside a local partner – this has been the case not only in recent urban battles in which Western forces were involved, such as Mosul, but also in many of the battles fought by non-Western militaries at expeditionary reach. Examples of the latter include the UAE’s role in the Battle of Aden, and the Russian role in Aleppo. In such contexts, the challenge is not necessarily providing partners with infantry or munitions, which local partners often have, but rather with offering niche capabilities, including the precision-strike capabilities needed to engage elusive and buried high-value targets, reduce fortified positions and disperse concentrations of adversary forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of operating within complex terrain, however, mean that the use of strike capabilities will often require forces postured forward to build pattern-of-life assessments, cue in fires and directly engage targets that cannot readily be struck from offshore. Given that engagement opportunities will be intermittent, such operations will also require fires platforms that can remain in theatre on a more persistent basis than fast air assets. Finally, a network of relationships with likely local partner forces will need to be generated – something that can be facilitated by engagement in peacetime. The potential sensitivities involved in engaging some partners creates a role for special-forces-capable elements of an amphibious force, as these force elements offer policymakers somewhat more flexibility of deployment in theatre, relative to conventional units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-the-royal-marines-specialisation-and-force-design&quot;&gt;IV. The Royal Marines: Specialisation and Force Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having set out in the previous chapter ways in which forces can adapt to meet the challenges posed by the emerging operating environment, this chapter focuses on the particular role of the Royal Marines within the amphibious constructs described. Size and budget constraints are likely to mean that the marines will not be able to deliver the full spectrum of capabilities needed to enable a strike-centric concept of amphibious operations or operations in support of sea control at scale. However, the UK’s marines can perform niche roles within an allied amphibious construct centred on strike and sea control. At a smaller scale, it may also be possible for the Royal Marines to deliver strike and sea control on a self-contained basis for a time, to enable theatre entry by a heavier element of the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Western marine forces are developing capabilities that can support a strike-led approach to power projection from the littoral. The most notable example of this comes from the US Marine Corps, whose Force Design 2030 heavily emphasises long-range strike capabilities. Some European marine forces, such as the Swedish marines, also appear to be prioritising the ability to generate fires from littoral areas, through capabilities such as mortar boats equipped with NEMO mortar. Moreover, a number of European navies are optimised to operate in littoral spaces. Forces such as the Swedish and Finnish navies, which were built around smaller vessels such as the Hamina-class missile-equipped fast-attack craft and the Swedish Visby-class corvette, procured for the probably now redundant task of sea denial against the Russian fleet in the Baltic (which would likely not be survivable beyond the early stages of a conflict), could readily be repurposed to generate offensive fires from Baltic littorals using the same low-observable fast-attack craft and corvettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of missiles a vessel such as the Visby-class corvette can carry is limited (the Visby-class has capacity for eight RB-15 surface-to-surface missiles), it is worth noting that, cumulatively, the countries of the Baltic are poised to possess a considerable force of small combatant vessels, including 13 Visby- and Hamina-class vessels (and their successor classes) that can theoretically carry a collective throw weight of 72 RB-15 and Gabriel dual-use missiles. With the presence of the Swedish marines in the Baltic, and Poland due to purchase the dual-capable naval strike missile for its coastal defences, plus Germany, which intends to equip its sea battalion with a long-range strike capability, also in possession of the NSM, ground-based fires in this region, along with the maritime assets detailed above, represent a considerable locally available long-range strike capability, comparable in many ways to that fielded by an individual MEF. Surface manoeuvre craft supporting the Royal Marines that are capable of carrying strike capabilities such as long-range loitering munitions could augment this strike capability in the littorals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s successful use of Neptune Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles against high-value targets such as an S-400 and a Kilo-class submarine illustrates how such strike capabilities can pose a considerable threat to the limited number of operationally critical assets upon which a Russian ground force depends. Of course, cohering these capabilities into a single concept of operations in littoral spaces depends on Allied agreement – something that can be pursued through engagement, both bilaterally and through frameworks such as the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF). However, it is likely that the components of a distributed force capable of inland strike from the Baltic littorals exists in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exist, then, a number of prospective partners with whom the Royal Marines can interoperate to generate strike from littoral areas. The most important area that the Royal Marines can most readily support such forces within the confines of the model we describe is – should Allies accept it – by providing a forward-postured reconnaissance and raiding force that operates inland ahead of the offshore striking component. The function of such a force would not be to conduct raiding as an independent strategic function (as was the case during the Second World War), but rather to enable the strike capabilities held by Allies. They can achieve this in two ways: generate the situational awareness inland needed to enable strikes from the maritime vector; penalise the dispersion of adversary high-value targets through direct attack – in turn forcing the concentration of assets in ways that makes them vulnerable to strikes (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-the-fleet-to-out-scout-an-opponent&quot;&gt;Helping the Fleet to Out-Scout an Opponent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISR Gathering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-posture reconnaissance elements can complement wider efforts to generate situational awareness regarding complex target sets using capabilities such as UAVs, but they can also deliver awareness in ways that cannot be achieved from stand-off positions. For example, Israeli commandos routinely tapped the fibre optic cables underpinning Hizbullah’s firing positions in southern Lebanon – delivering access to a system that UAVs could not compromise. In Vietnam, the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group performed a similar function by placing sensors around the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In the context of a future battlefield that operates at machine speed, physically forward human operators can also play an important role in battle damage assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the inherent physical trade-offs involved in building ISR systems such as UAVs mean that they will often trade range for things such as sensor payload, except in the case of large and very expensive unmanned combat aerial vehicles. It is likely, then, that UAVs with sophisticated multispectral payloads will need to be launched at relative proximity to their targets – creating a role for forward-deployed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battle Damage Assessment and Counter Deception&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As methods of surveillance evolve, forward-positioned forces can also play an important role in the verification of target data, and course correction in the face of adversary deception. Surveillance enabled by computer vision can be confounded by data poisoning – the act of making AI misclassify an object by slightly modifying its physical appearance. Learning when this is occurring will require data to be gathered from within an opponent’s controlled areas by forces that can visually identify patterns of adversary deception. This is a role that “Tier 2” special forces – those certified as special forces for the purposes of special operations – can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;Command and Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dedicated shipping that supports forward deployed amphibious forces can play an important role as a command node. Though vessel size can be a vulnerability, it also underpins key functions. Considerable size and power generation is required, both to underpin the processing power needed to receive and translate multiple feeds, including those from forward-deployed elements, and to then distribute data across the force. A command vessel would need to loiter more than 400 km from hostile shores to avoid coastal defence cruise missiles such as the Russian P-800. It would, moreover, need protection against longer-ranged threats, such as bombers. However, it would still be less vulnerable than an immobile ground-based headquarters, which can be struck by a range of land-attack missiles, and which would not present opponents with a dynamic target. The risk to static command nodes has been illustrated by the effective use of Storm Shadow missiles against Russian command nodes in Ukraine. Maritime headquarters can – all other things being equal – co-locate more personnel and processing power at lower risk than can comparable ground-based headquarters, though they do not operate without risk. The relative proximity at which this shipping can operate – even when the need to avoid A2/AD capabilities is factored in – in addition to its size, mobility and organic protection, makes such shipping a useful node for the coordination of ISR and fires without requiring reach-back to C2 nodes in the homebase. In the medium to long term, improvements in processing power may enable resilient communications across self-forming networks of capabilities in littoral spaces, underpinned by systems such as those envisioned by DARPA’s DYNAMO and STITCHES programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;raiding&quot;&gt;Raiding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their ability to support the gathering of ISR data, raiding by distributed forces can also complicate adversary efforts at concealment. Historically, concealment has depended on cover and dispersion. However, dispersion makes a force vulnerable to raiding, while concentrating to overcome raiders makes forces vulnerable to strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While special forces operating in a reconnaissance and raiding function have sometimes struggled in contexts such as the 1991 Gulf War, there are some reasons to believe they might fare differently under emerging circumstances. First, light UAVs that can be transported by forward-positioned teams can considerably expand the area that any given team can survey and conduct attacks on. Secondly, a new generation of lightweight vehicles equipped with tactical strike capabilities can provide forward-deployed forces with a degree of survivability against well-armed opponents when they encounter them. For example, we might consider the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which is being equipped by SOCOM with a spike anti-tank guided missile. Third, open-architecture C4ISR processing systems such as the Royal Marines’ Project EVE can enable data from the wider joint force to be leveraged by forward-deployed elements through software integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while it should be assumed that forward-deployed forces will operate under information denial and with only intermittent access to wider joint force networks, all of the above mean that these forces will have a degree of situational awareness that exceeds that of similar forces deployed under comparable circumstances in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-future-force-design-for-the-royal-marines&quot;&gt;A Future Force Design for the Royal Marines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Marines is an organisation that has long viewed the ability to force-generate small units capable of operating with minimal support as a core competency. As such, it would be well suited to the roles outlined above. However, this would require a shift from the existing model of deploying commando companies. The core conclusion from internal work conducted by the Royal Marines and supported by external bodies (including experimentation, wargaming and exercises) is that a redesigned commando force built to operate as a forward screen for offshore strike elements would have, as its primary unit of force, a 12-person strike company. The order of battle of such a force would be structured as shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a force differs from the existing Royal Marine force design in that it implies a transition away from commando companies operating as aggregated light infantry units that can be treated as interoperable with their ground-based counterparts (as was the case in Korea and, more recently, in Afghanistan and Iraq). Divided into strike teams of 12 individuals, the proposed force has been tested over areas spanning 40 x 30 km – implying a force-to-space ratio comparable to the average insurgent force. Its organic vehicles, such as the MRZR, also reflect an emphasis on mobility over carrying capacity. This represents a considerable shift, which necessarily means deemphasising functions such as holding and patrolling ground, to enable the force to optimise for tasks such as strike and raiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enabling Strike&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model would see the Royal Marines often acting as a source of information to cue fires generated by partner forces or the wider joint force. To illustrate, wargaming has seen the Royal Marines operate ahead of a notional II MEF ground component comprised of two marine infantry battalions and two artillery batteries comprised of M777 and HIMARS units, along with NMESIS, which has both an anti-ship and a land attack capability. Alternatively, the marines could operate as the forward element of a littoral fires capability generated by JEF partners in a region such as the Baltic Sea. In each instance, the function of the force would be to enable and support strike-heavy partners, while deemphasising seizing or holding ground in most instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jXYFYOv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: The Organisation of an Individual Littoral Response Group, as Part of a Wider Littoral Strike Group.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the envisioned ground component has an impact on the maritime force supporting insertion and subsequent operations. The reduction of the size of individual strike teams has an indirect effect on methods of insertion. Smaller teams can be inserted using a range of mechanisms, including submersible craft. This potentially obviates challenges such as the threat of UAVs near contested shores. Moreover, a reduction in the amount of heavy equipment that needs to be moved from ship to shore can enable surface manoeuvre craft to be optimised to meet other demands, such as maintaining a low observable profile and carrying fires to support the disembarked force. This will be crucial given that the force will depend on surface manoeuvre craft (as well as on Allied fires) for much of its ability to generate lethality against concentrated targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Manoeuvre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different approach to surface manoeuvre that emphasised longer-ranged and more complex platforms than the connectors currently used could also see the marines generate their own organic fires from littoral spaces. In the same way that complex warships are increasingly being built with modularity at their core, surface manoeuvre platforms could be built to operate either as connectors, or as launch pads for artillery or loitering munitions or C-UAS (counter-uncrewed aerial systems) platforms, or else as hosts for EW decoys. As illustrated by Iran, which has placed a range of effectors such as SAM systems and anti-ship missiles on relatively cheap Bladerunner boats, this can be achieved at low cost. Uncrewed or optionally crewed solutions can also support such functions. The major trade-off here is between range and weight – relatively small vessels can carry both personnel and effectors comfortably but would struggle to move heavy vehicles. If the insertion requirement is for small teams of infantry and relatively light vehicles, this can allow for manoeuvre vessels with longer ranges and lower signatures, without creating unviable requirements in terms of size and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, there is a symbiotic link between transitioning to a distributed and strike-centric force ashore and supporting functions such as sea control on the maritime side of the littoral. To the extent that the force becomes more distributed, the surface craft that support it can be designed in ways that allow them to be more multifunctional, as they do not need to insert and then sustain an aggregated brigade and its enablers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-commando-force-model-in-practice&quot;&gt;The Commando Force Model in Practice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force design described above would see the marines shift from being a multifunctional force capable of acting as auxiliary light infantry to being a more specialised force which, while deployable in multiple contexts, would deliver value primarily by optimising for specific niche tactical roles. Lethality against high-value targets and the enablement of fires would supersede holding ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exists a body of empirical evidence drawn from exercises and wargaming to validate the force model described above. Royal Navy-led force development has included wargaming, live exercising, threat analysis and modelling, and studies of similar force models. Two deductions have emerged from this process. The first is that the commando force model, if equipped, organised and trained as proposed above, can achieve the range of tactical actions and operational effects that this paper calls for littoral forces to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One illustration of this comes from Exercise Green Dagger, in which UK commando forces operating against larger US Marine Corps formations in repeated large-scale exercises had a disruptive effect in excess of what one would expect from a battalion-sized force operating against brigade formations. 40 Commando was divided up into 12-person strike teams that operated ahead of a light defensive screen. The presence of distributed raiding strike teams of marines posed considerable challenges to the opposing US Marine commander, who could not distribute his forces without raising the risk of raiding, but was exposed to fires if he chose to concentrate to both better defend against raiding and to overrun a fairly light Royal Marine defensive screen. To be sure, 40 Commando was operating ahead of 7th Marine Regiment, and was reliant on the US Marine Corps’ organic fires capabilities, as well as support from US airpower. However, it is notable that a comparably equipped Marine Corps opposing force that was not enabled by a light raiding element struggled against one that was. This was due in no small part to the challenge that a combination of fires and raiding posed – dispersion created vulnerabilities against the latter, while concentration was punished by the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a considerable cognitive impact was observed, whereby brigade-level C2 structures were failing to choose positive courses of action, in terms of their tactical plan, because of a perceived threat from the commando force – a threat that was amplified beyond the physical reality. When the adversary force did concentrate against the Royal Marines, it became vulnerable to fires employed by the Marine Corps regiment with which the marines were partnered. Evidence from these exercises illustrates that the force can be disruptive and survivable, even early into the change programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niche Capabilities in the Urban Littoral&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the experimental evidence regarding the utility of distributed forces in holding up larger ground formations, there is also recent historical evidence to show that forces built around the imperatives of generating situational awareness and forcing adversaries into unmasking for engagement by longer-range strike can be useful in the urban littoral specifically. Urban battles such as those between Russia and Chechen rebels in Grozny (1991) and between the IDF and Palestinian insurgents in Jenin (2002) have illustrated the utility of small teams of infiltrators, as have more recent battles, such as Aden (2016), where the Houthi movement used small teams equipped with Kornet anti-tank guided missiles to good effect. Such forces are not a substitute for heavier forces, and there is a particular utility in being able to call on both armour and large numbers of infantry in urban environments. However, backed by long-range fires, small teams can disrupt adversary movement, and support the reduction of strongpoints. Offshore fire support can be of particular utility for the latter function, as also illustrated at Aden. Low-latency links between distributed teams and fire support from either offshore or disembarked forces can help obviate one of the challenges of providing air support in urban environments – the fact that generating target sets in complex terrain is time consuming and requires careful pattern-of-life analysis, and that air power cannot always be called to bear before circumstances have changed. In the urban littoral, relatively light forces supported by maritime fires can also perform tasks such as the defence of the SPODs that heavier forces need for theatre entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise: an emphasis on distribution with a view to enabling strike-centric operations can enable amphibious forces to be relevant to a range of tasks, from the disruption and attrition of ground formations, to the provision of niche capabilities to partner forces in expeditionary contexts that may involve urban littoral conflict. Moreover, adaptations that can enable dispersion and strike – chief among these being changes to the design philosophy of maritime enablers – can also allow marines to support tasks such as securing and exercising sea control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-more-specialised-force&quot;&gt;A More Specialised Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major consequence of the proposed force design is likely to be the optimisation of the commando force in a way that removes certain elements of multifunctionality from its force design. An emphasis on a light force with a limited logistics tail supported by manoeuvre craft, rather than by connectors per se, is likely to remove the force’s ability to aggregate as a more concentrated force to perform tasks such as replacing ground units in the line or conducting patrolling. Moreover, an emphasis on connectors that can support surface manoeuvre at reach and generating fires necessarily means design choices that deemphasise the movement of heavy vehicles. A vessel built to manoeuvre on the water and support fire missions will have a very different profile from one intended to move heavy vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the assumption that the marines would operate as a line unit is a product of an era in which the corps was roughly twice its current size. Moreover, at Alliance level, there has been a broader shift towards threat-based planning, and implicit in this is the optimisation of forces for specific functions. Finally, as discussed, in most likely contested environments, heavy assets may only be moved and sustained after threats to theatre entry have been overcome. At this juncture, their movement is likely to be less reliant on connectors, given that local SPODs and aerial ports of debarkation can be used, along with methods of insertion such as roll-on-roll-off craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to optimise for strike and sea control, along with existing Tier 2 special forces functions, will also likely mean that tasks such as fleet protection in home ports will need to be deemphasised. Notably, security functions are an area where autonomous capabilities can reduce the requirements for human operators in relatively short order, given that these functions are performed in safe home ports. Moreover, certifying marines for a wide range of competencies – a product of the era of counterinsurgency – will likely be impossible, especially if key competencies in areas such as working with autonomous platforms, supporting fires, and operating at sea in support of blue-water forces are to be adequately delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Marines will need to become a more specialised force to be able to deliver the concepts of operations described above. A specialised structure is more consistent with a threat-based planning framework than is the existing force structure. Moreover, given the size of the force, the choice between multifunctionality and specialisation is a notional one – the force cannot perform roles such as line replacement in any case, even if its personnel and structures could theoretically enable it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-the-royal-marines-capability-requirements&quot;&gt;V. The Royal Marines: Capability Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has sought to articulate the use cases for the Royal Marines in the context of a broader, strike-led, Alliance-level framework for amphibious power projection. This chapter sets out the capability requirements that emerge from the discussion above. At a minimum, a redesigned commando force would need to demonstrate progress towards the following six features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed model of tactical operations across the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increased range from point of launch of the system to target effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delivery of integrated effects at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient sustainment in high-threat contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integration of crewed/machine teaming and robotic and autonomous capabilities ashore and afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deception as a central planning consideration and a capability investment line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter discusses the design principles and attendant capability sets that can enable the force to deliver progress on achieving these features. The design principles represent the foundational priorities which, if delivered, will drive progress towards attaining the six features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;signature-management-and-resilient-communication&quot;&gt;Signature Management and Resilient Communication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delivery of integrated effects at lower levels will depend on signature management and a communications architecture that can support a distributed force drawing on non-organic enablers and fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While exercises such as Green DaggerGreen Dagger demonstrated the utility of distributed forces, a limitation in their evidence base is that they did not test the resilience of communications networks. With frequency jamming dictating with whom personnel can communicate at any given time – dependent on which EW assets an opponent is operating – the ability to communicate across multiple pathways takes on increased importance. Organisationally, this will require amphibious forces to be able to communicate across multiple component commands – if a commando unit is cut off from maritime forces, for example, it can still usefully contribute to the ISR screen of a ground component command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This C4ISR requirement brings the “dispersal dilemma” into focus. David Kilcullen has described the difficulty that comes from the need to avoid force concentration, as proximity builds a “targetable” entity. Applying a more distributed model that improves force survivability is inherently desirable, but the communication and information systems network capability that is needed to remain effective builds an electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) signature that offers targeting opportunities for an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of capabilities, this dilemma introduces two requirements. The first is the ability to rely on multiple redundant networks to deliver data across the force. Expendable bearers such as UAVs can represent one pathway towards this. Equally, as illustrated in Ukraine, a growing range of civilian satellite communications networks can be used by military units, and can remain active even in the face of concerted jamming efforts. Modes of communication such as tropospheric scatter can also be used for reach-back communications, albeit with limitations on the size of data packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging solutions, such as fully autonomous capability, that can operate without GPS and be fielded at the lowest tactical echelons, will form part of the answer, and feature as a force design principle. Other developments will assist in time, such as machine-learning-based systems that can identify targets from blurred images. If a single image of target quality takes 12 KB of data, machine learning enhancements will allow targets to be decided on the basis of very small data passage requirements. Of course, a behavioural shift away from a currently observed desire for full-motion video (FMV) is still required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commando Force programme’s ongoing technical response to the dispersal dilemma includes introducing low-signature mesh network systems and novel long-range bearer capability, alongside employment of high frequency radio and satellite communications where opportunities allow. The technical response will need, however, to be complemented by the application of recently lost techniques, such as minimising communication traffic, beyond reducing forces’ reliance on FMV. These behavioural adjustments will need to be matched by policy changes that enable targeting decisions to be devolved to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing at the edge is also likely to become increasingly important, especially as processing power enables more functions to be performed without the need for reach-back. Project EVE, designed by the Royal Navy’s Marworks team, is an example of a prospective solution here. It will enable data to be processed forward, set the computational capacity for unmanned (UXV) systems to be integrated and controlled when communications are challenged, and provide the battlespace-management platforms that enable the swift allocation of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distributed-logistics&quot;&gt;Distributed Logistics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will not only be imperative to distribute the force tactically, but also to create a logistical model ashore that is distributed. While offshore vessels can serve as concentrated logistical nodes, once moved ashore, resupply must be distributed over a wide area, both to prevent interdiction and to meet the requirements of a similarly distributed force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, logistic support to a distributed force, at greater range, within a higher threat environment, represents a considerable challenge. Trusted methodologies will need to evolve. Consider, for example, how predictable, linear, “frontline-pull” resupply places a significant constraint on the force, as it tends to drive concentration of assets/activity that is at odds with both the threat picture that has been described above, and viable solutions to it. These tensions were at play in the Falklands campaign: Julian Thomson’s logical desire to build out a beachhead before embarking on assault operations brought with it increased exposure to the Maritime Task Group that could not be accepted. Under emergent conditions in which air-based threats of the kind faced in the Falklands will be joined by short-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and UAVs, concentrated logistical marshalling points will not be survivable for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be imperative, therefore, to design logistic distribution for a distributed force, with fuel, power and ammunition as the foremost logistic concerns. One means of limiting logistical demands is by managing the logistical “pull” by making the force lighter – with heavier vehicles and assets such as the 105-mm light gun representing sources of demand that can be jettisoned. To the extent that the force is one that aims to disrupt a comparatively small number of high-value targets, as well as enable heavier strike elements, these capabilities become superfluous. Moreover, considerable striking power can be fitted on a comparatively small vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistical “push” can also be better managed. The Royal Marines are currently conceiving a more prediction-based “logistic-push” model, where supply needs are anticipated, and deposited for forces to collect at their time of choosing. This will rely on automated modelling and acceleration of uncrewed systems into service. In particular, low-cost UAVs capable of carrying large payloads over extended distances will be vital to making this model operational. Examples of cargo drones are already visible in civilian contexts and could be adapted to military requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages are that such models are likely to be more resource intensive, are open to compromise, and present non-kinetic targeting opportunities to adversary EW. However, the removal of concentrated logistical nodes nonetheless reduces the prospect of catastrophic failure. Instead, one might expect to see a steady loss rate in the face of adversary EW, which can be better mitigated than a single discontinuous event such as the destruction of a single concentrated hub. Some work on use of AI/autonomy proposes the rule that a push-driven model, in which the AI anticipates, is valuable in inverse proportion to the consequences of the AI being wrong. So, for resources such as food or fuel, which are not expendable, but are replaceable, it might be useful to do this on an anticipatory basis, while the movement of munitions will need to be more carefully considered depending on the risk of compromise, and may depend more heavily on surface manoeuvre platforms and collection at the coastline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see, therefore, that on both sides of the conflict threshold, the challenge of supporting a forward-deployed force is one that must be overcome, if amphibious forces are to be effectively optimised for the new operating environment. In routine operations, maintaining capability forward adds pressure to supply chains and contracting solutions. This cost growth might be offset through economies of scale, as partners (notably the US) look to develop stand-in concepts at greater mass. Another cost offset and operational benefit will be in the pressure that littoral forces at sea, positioned with warfighting stocks, takes off the “strategic outload” as a significant conflict breaks out. In this situation, the benefit of holding combined arms capability forward, and being able to sustain it until the joint supply chain is established, will bring opportunities, both to deny the adversary room to manoeuvre, and to project more combat power early in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobility-and-reach-on-both-sides-of-the-littoral&quot;&gt;Mobility and Reach on Both Sides of the Littoral&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distributed force that must deliver convergent effects will depend on reach. Many capabilities that provide reach, such as long-range fires or long endurance UAVs should, by virtue of their size, be drawn from the maritime portion of the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a critical capability underpinning the force described will be surface manoeuvre platforms (as opposed to ship-to-shore connectors), which have the size, versatility and low observability to act as either connectors, strike assets or C-UAS platforms. The aspiration for multirole surface craft – both troop and missile carrying – has previously been shown to have both defensive and offensive benefits. Such capabilities might offer a framework around which integrated coalition activity can be built in constrained geographies, such as the Baltic or Black seas. Moreover, greater ambiguity regarding the function a vessel is playing creates additional dilemmas for an opponent, even if the vessel is detected. This is unlike contemporary connectors, which can only be assault platforms, and which an opponent would likely detect. As noted, platforms such as the Chinese Type-22 low-observable missile catamaran and the Iranian Bladerunner boats already illustrate that potent strike and defensive capabilities can be incorporated onto relatively small vessels by nations with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key focus area for the FCF programme will be building modularity into future surface manoeuvre platforms as a design principle. This principle already underpins uncrewed solutions such as the US Navy’s planned medium uncrewed surface vessel (MUSV). The FCF programme’s own aspirations are for future surface manoeuvre platforms to have a reach of over 400 nautical miles. An increase in reach will enable manoeuvre platforms, along with other assets, such as vertical lift capabilities, to cover a larger area of the sea with the support of a mothership – enabling sea control missions to be more easily supported in a way that removes pressure from the blue-water navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the ability to find and strike at range allows the shipping from which force elements launch more options for maritime manoeuvre, specifically to position within protective umbrellas. Improved connector range presents not only the opportunity for more flexible ship positioning, but also the capacity to create more numerous attack profiles – for example from shore to shore, as well as from ship to shore. Needless to say, the increased size of such vessels as compared with traditional connectors would impose a requirement for size increases on host vessels such as the planned multirole support ship. However, the fact that the reach of these vessels enables motherships to operate at greater distances will, in turn, mitigate the effects of an increase in size in areas such as vulnerability to detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge of building a correct manoeuvre option extends to mobility options ashore – what is the vehicle mix? The UK Commando Force approach sees ISR, mobility and sustainment as part of both offensive capability and force protection. The force must prioritise mobility and a limited logistical burden over protection, unless circumstances make prioritising the latter absolutely necessary. Although recent fighting has illustrated the importance of protected mobility against indirect fires, the size of the elements of the envisioned force means that their primary means of survival is likely to be evading detection to the extent possible and being mobile enough to avoid being fixed when detected. Moreover, the envisioned concept of force employment would see the commando force employed before opponents could entrench and support positions with a large weight of fire. While there may be instances where protection is desired, particularly in lower-intensity conflicts, where sensitivity to casualties is likely to be higher, there is an inverse relationship between the force protection of the commando force’s vehicles and its aggregate lethality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integration of strike and vehicle systems, particularly smaller missile and indirect-fire systems, is an objective of UK development that will serve to increase platform lethality, while reducing the footprint of tactical elements. As noted above, the integration of systems such as NMESIS and SPIKE on platforms such as the joint light tactical vehicle is analogous, if not quite identical, to the solutions that might be pursued. This does not represent a new concept, therefore, but it is novel for light forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capabilities-underpinning-tactical-deception&quot;&gt;Capabilities Underpinning Tactical Deception&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of deception as a design principle do not need to be rehearsed in detail, except to identify that, as is the case for autonomous systems, difficult investment choices will need to be made if a viable capability suite is to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of tools that can enable deception against at least some of the sensors on which adversary concepts of operations depend. Through the use of capabilities such as expendable uncrewed assets acting as decoys, manoeuvre elements can hide within the noise of multiple false positives. Of course, it is precisely this challenge that multispectral sensing architectures are built to defeat, but the challenge of compromising these systems in littoral spaces can be simplified through the exploitation of climatic conditions. For example, climatic conditions can lend themselves, either to subrefraction, which limits the range of radar, or super refraction, which generates false positives (a challenge that can be exacerbated using decoys). Factors such as mist and smog can also pose a challenge for electro-optical sensors. The former is a challenge in theatres such as the Baltic Sea for much of the year, and the latter will become particularly prevalent as littoral spaces are increasingly urbanised. Urbanisation also has the effect of cluttering the electromagnetic spectrum. Of course, forces cannot expect to be safe from the full plethora of methods of detection, but it may be assumed that climatic conditions will confound at least some of them – meaning that the challenge is simplified, relative to that of countering those methods of detection that remain effective. Where radar can be compromised, this can be especially viable, given that many other modes of detection depend on radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of this, a primary focus for the commando force should be on uncrewed solutions that exacerbate the challenges of employing radar effectively in the littoral. This could include offboard active decoys on uncrewed surface vessels that are designed to mimic the radar returns of a surface manoeuvre platform or a larger vessel. Mimicking the visual appearance of platforms and the emissions and thermal signatures of fires platforms in littoral areas is likely to be another priority for forces, to protect both themselves and allied forces. There are a number of existing solutions in this area, including relatively primitive ones, comparable to those employed by Serbian forces against NATO in 1999. The key will be organisational experience, rather than new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final emerging area in which practices underpinning deception will likely need to evolve is in defeating classification, as distinct from detection. Insofar as detection is, at least to a degree, inevitable, to some extent the focus of deception should shift to defeating efforts to classify targets. For example, where opponents rely on modern methods of classification such as machine-learning-based algorithms, it may become more important to focus efforts on “poisoning” data in peacetime – altering the appearance of one’s forces to lead an opponent’s algorithm to draw incorrect correlations in ways that could confound wartime classification efforts. To some extent, this will be a joint force priority, but it is one to which marines can contribute over the course of peacetime activity, such as exercises that they know are being observed. A degree of knowledge regarding adversary algorithms will likely underpin many future approaches to deception. Generating this understanding is a task which will likely be performed at higher echelon, but to which bodies such as 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group could contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multispectral concealment will be a sine qua non for forces ashore. While the details of the specific solutions to multispectral camouflage being pursued by the commando force are not for public disclosure, the primary factor to note for future study is that the major limiting factor is cost, not capability. Thus, the further forward a force is to be placed, the smaller it must be, as viable solutions do not scale. This in turn will create considerable requirements for a small forward element to be able to survey and operate in a comparatively large area to generate value for the strike-centric forces that it is supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the organisational front, there is a pressing need for all militaries, not least those involved in littoral operations, to rediscover the criticality of deception to operational success. Indeed, there is a case for the integration action model to feature deception activity as a recognised element that must be orchestrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restructuring-organisational-practices&quot;&gt;Restructuring Organisational Practices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the paradigm shift in the deception arena that is needed to enable successful combat operations, this paper has highlighted how deterrence by denial may be enhanced through a partner force, if conducted as part of a coordinated campaign approach. There must be changes, however, if this benefit is to be realised. First, within Ministry of Defence (MoD), Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) and fleet scheduling, the shift to a campaign approach has yet to take place, and operational-level planning remains ad hoc. Alignment with US Marine Corps planning routines (orchestrated with an 18-month lead-in through their force synchronisation process) might offer a beneficial forcing function. This does not mean that planning agility is removed, rather that plans are constructed among partners, all of whom realise that national priorities might change what can be done, as their political masters react to events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the force, there will be changes to individual training as a new operational methodology and new technology is integrated. The primary tactical-level adjustment will come, however, in force-generation mechanisms. The UK commando force and other like-sized amphibious forces are not big enough to generate credible forward presence and maintain sequential, onshore force-generation pathways. However, force generation models that assume in-theatre development are not only possible, but deliver considerable value. Furthermore, this type of generation pathway opens the door to force development forming an element of national and Alliance statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, convergent development through programmes such as Fleet Operational Sea Training (FOST) played this role within NATO and served as both a force multiplier and a diplomatic benefit to the UK. This is something that navies have traditionally done well with their ship deployments, and it has gathered pace of late with deterrence efforts in Eastern Europe – but further development is possible. Consider, for example, how the UK, the US and Australia could form a core of littoral force development in the Indo-Pacific region around the development of Force Design 2030, and the move of the Australian Army to be more “amphibious” in its approach. UK commando forces would provide a valuable element in the force mix and would offer a catalysing presence, insofar as they are different but complementary enough to the equivalent forces of both countries. In the European theatre, they would offer the alliance-building function of a force that trains in the High North for a mission in which fires integration is predominant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To retain their utility in the contemporary operating environment, the Royal Marines will need to make significant change to the ways that they deploy, operate and sustain themselves. Key elements of this change will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A shift in emphasis from assault to manoeuvring to enable fires held by other elements of the force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The ability to achieve theatre insertion at reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Greater levels of dispersion once disembarked.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These adaptations require considerable adjustments to both capabilities and force models, which would see the ability to strike and raid emphasised at the expense of the light infantry functions that amphibious forces such as the marines have traditionally performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes imply a degree of ruthless specialisation in term of tactical competencies, if not overall functionality. If realised, however, this kind of change can enable the marines – and indeed other Western forces – to better utilise the advantages that maritime preponderance has historically conferred on them – the opportunity to make the political choice to engage in operations at reach, and the operational flexibility to impose multiple dilemmas on an opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has built on evidence from the Royal Marines’ experimentation, academic literature, and previous work conducted by RUSI and the marines to inform ongoing work on the FCF. As the commando force will often find itself operating alongside allies and coalition partners, the discussion has been situated within a broader analysis of the future of Western amphibious capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key finding of the paper is that the maritime forces of Western nations do not need to cede littoral spaces or resign themselves to a growing spatial gap between themselves and the wider joint force. While it is undeniable that challenges to littoral manoeuvre exist, these can be surmounted. To do so requires a radical rethinking, both of force design and of tactics, techniques and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, marine forces will need to be able to generate fires that can contribute to tasks such as suppression of enemy air defences, engaging adversary vessels and striking in the deep areas of the ground fight. The reforms being undertaken by both the US Marine Corps and some European amphibious forces represent a logical progression in this direction. To a great extent, littoral manoeuvre will involve manoeuvre by fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to use the capabilities being generated to effect against complex targets inland requires, however, the ability to survey adversary positions, conduct battle damage assessment and, where possible, force adversary units to concentrate in ways that make them vulnerable. These functions represent an area where lighter forces such as those envisioned in the FCF programme can play an important complementary role alongside heavier Allied assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light, rapidly deployable special operations forces with organic shipping can also support other competitive functions, including the exercise of sea control and early posturing during a crisis that occurs beyond NATO’s area of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, development of the Commando Force is geared towards building a capability that can inhabit the littoral contact layer, bringing increased ISR and strike options to the operational commander. Further, the UK’s political position in NATO, JEF and in the Indo-Pacific region, alongside the UK Commando Force’s relationship with key partners at the military level, sets the conditions for the force to play a vital integration function that enhances military options and the country’s deterrence posture. While the foundations have been set and progress is ongoing, achieving the benefits that this paper describes is by no means certain – both in terms of the MoD’s capacity to resource the transition, and the Royal Navy’s ability to implement a sufficiently rigorous and integrated programme of change. That said, the financial burden on the MoD is manageable, and the change programme, while very complex, is very much within the Royal Navy’s ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future efforts to build the commando force through a wargaming process that allows adaptation to be modelled and tested must include industry and address how changes to the force structure and techniques can be implemented. The lessons learned will help to drive an industrial strategy and determine the balance of investment choices to create more flexibility from production to frontlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such progress will require an acceleration of the rate of experimentation. There will be a need for national capacity to model, simulate, wargame and analyse at a tempo that supports force development that will hold relevance. How this might be achieved is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is intrinsic to the successful development of littoral forces, as well forces more widely, and it deserves attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s furious military response to the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October is about to enter its fourth month, and there are signs that it will not be the last. Early in the new year, Israel announced that it would withdraw some of its ground forces from Gaza, but rather than signalling an end to the war, this likely represents only a shift in Israel’s approach towards a slightly less intensive campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that Israel is unlikely to stop and declare victory until it can credibly claim to have reached its war aims: the removal of Hamas from power in Gaza, and the destruction of the group’s capacity to pose a military threat to Israel from the territory. Given the somewhat intangible nature of these goals, this may well require – at least from the perspective of the Israeli government – achieving some symbolic victories, including the killing of Hamas’s elusive senior leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Daif, who are widely thought to have been behind the 7 October attacks. How long it will take the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to track them down is anyone’s guess. Other questions, including how Israel intends to deal with an almost completely destroyed Gaza and a displaced and starving population after the war, are even more difficult to answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way this war could end, it has long been assumed, would be as the result of increased US pressure on Israel to wrap up the fighting, which would eventually culminate in Washington joining the increasingly global consensus to call for a ceasefire. The Biden administration’s rhetoric has changed gradually over the past three months, from an unconditional embrace of Israel and its right to strike back after 7 October to growing warnings about the long-term consequences of the mounting civilian death toll. But the president himself still seems reluctant to do more than to try – presumably – to exert influence on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in private. Moreover, it is also far from certain that Netanyahu would be particularly receptive to US pressure, at least in the short term, and especially in a presidential election year in which he might see an opportunity to extract as much as he can from across the US’s deeply polarised political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-iranianhouthi-challenge-in-the-red-sea&quot;&gt;The Iranian/Houthi Challenge in the Red Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war in Gaza continues, the risks of an expansion of the conflict will remain ever-present. At the beginning of 2024, the Red Sea and the Houthis in Yemen have moved into the spotlight in this regard. Through a combination of missile and drone attacks and hijackings, the group whose rebellion against the Yemeni government in 2014 triggered the war in Yemen that is still going on today and which has close ties to Iran has significantly disrupted traffic through one of the world’s most important shipping lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, backed by European allies like the UK, is leading the international response, and will likely do what it can to keep Israel from taking direct action against the Houthis. From Washington’s perspective, it is clearly preferable to treat the Houthi problem as one akin to that posed by piracy off the Somali coast in the 2000s, rather than to let the Yemeni militia claim to be part of a regional war against Israel and the West. Still, any military effort to remove the Houthi threat to international shipping through the Red Sea is liable to have unintended consequences and might reduce the chances of bringing the war in Yemen to a close in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenge of how to deal with Iran, including its nefarious influence across the Middle East and its nuclear programme, must once again be a top priority for policymakers everywhere&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, unless they are destroyed completely (a highly unlikely prospect), the Houthis – and with them their backers in Tehran – have already succeeded in shifting parts of the geopolitical landscape in the Middle East and beyond. From 2023/24 onwards, anyone with a stake in global shipping – that is, almost every economy in the world – will have to face the fact that Iran and its allies now hold at risk two of the world’s most important maritime chokepoints, the Strait of Hormuz and the Bab Al-Mandeb. In other words, the challenge of how to deal with Iran, including its nefarious influence across the Middle East and its nuclear programme, must once again be a top priority for policymakers everywhere, from Washington to capitals across Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-risk-of-a-hezbollahisrael-war-remains&quot;&gt;The Risk of a Hezbollah–Israel War Remains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But escalation risks loom large elsewhere too. Thus far, the much-feared escalation between Israel and Hezbollah has not happened. Violence across the Israeli-Lebanese border has reached its highest level since the 2006 conflict, but both Israel and Hezbollah have carefully avoided a full-scale war. This could change in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assassination of Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut on 2 January, widely attributed to Israel, should put everyone on notice. Israel may bet on Hezbollah’s – and its backer Iran’s – continued desire to keep most of its powder dry for some future confrontation. But brazen strikes on residential areas in Lebanon’s capital are precisely the kind of actions that are liable to increase the political pressure on Hezbollah, which likes to present itself as Lebanon’s protector, especially against its southern neighbour. (It must also be noted that the al-Arouri assassination highlights the possibility that Israel could make good on its threats to pursue Hamas leaders elsewhere in the Middle East – with obvious deleterious consequences for regional stability.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the risk of war between Israel and Hezbollah goes beyond the possibility of a tit-for-tat spiralling out of control. In October, fearing Hezbollah might follow Hamas’s example and try to invade northern Israel, the IDF evacuated dozens of towns and villages near the border (including Kiryat Shmona, a city of more than 20,000 residents). The Israeli government now faces the dilemma that it can hardly tell people to go back to their homes unless it can claim that their security situation has meaningfully changed. Israel insists that Hezbollah must at least comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and withdraw to the north of the Litani River – about 20 miles from the border with Israel – but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises the risk that Israel might eventually resort to using more force than it already does in its near-daily skirmishes with Hezbollah. Israeli leaders may convince themselves that they can achieve their objectives with a limited military campaign, but any operations by Israeli ground forces on Lebanese soil could well upend the restraint Hezbollah has shown to date and result in a war that could be hard to contain. At the very least, the front in such a war would likely extent beyond Lebanon to the Israeli-Syrian border, where Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups have long been expanding their positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-boiling-point-the-west-bank-and-israel&quot;&gt;Beyond Boiling Point: The West Bank and Israel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third area in which the war in Gaza is likely to contribute to existing instability, with potential consequences for the wider region, is the situation in the West Bank and Israeli domestic politics, which are closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2024, regional powers will likely seek to protect whatever they can of the de-escalatory trend of the past few years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although overshadowed by the death and destruction in Gaza, the West Bank has seen the highest levels of violence since the Second Intifada in the early 2000s. More than 450 Palestinians were killed in 2023 – most of them in IDF operations, some by extremist Israeli settlers; 28 Israelis, including 24 civilians, also died in the West Bank in 2023. The Palestinian Authority, which nominally controls at least part of the West Bank, is feckless and despised by the people it is meant to represent. Within the Israeli government, the territory falls under the purview of Netanyahu’s most right-wing allies, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom are committed to further settlement expansion and removing any prospect of a future Palestinian state. This, together with a Hamas’s aspirations to expand its influence in the West Bank, is a recipe for the eruption of a Third Intifada. But even if there is no escalation in 2024, the West Bank is likely to move to the centre of the reinflamed Israeli-Palestinian conflict once the war in Gaza ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key driver of developments in the West Bank will be Israeli domestic politics. Hamas’s 7 October attack brought Israel’s deeply polarised political landscape together, but the stark divisions clearly remain. On 1 January, the Israeli Supreme Court struck down the judicial reform the Netanyahu government had pushed through the Knesset in July in the face of massive public protests. The prime minister has been on the ropes politically since 7 October; with the worst breakdown of security in Israel’s history happening on his watch, his defeat in any upcoming election is widely regarded as almost certain. However, Netanyahu has been nothing if not a political survivor. His and his right-wing allies’ fight to stay in power will shape Israel – and what Israel does, including in Gaza, the West Bank and the wider region – throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-regional-order-in-tatters&quot;&gt;A Regional Order in Tatters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooming out to the regional level, 2024 in the Middle East will likely be defined – once again – by questions about the region’s future order. The Gaza war has upended what appeared to be the beginnings of a new arrangement in the region that was characterised by a collective pragmatic emphasis on de-escalation among regional powers. The Gulf Arab states, Iran, Turkey, Egypt and even Syria all appeared intent on finding ways to work together despite their differences; Israeli-Arab normalisation seemed to be progressing towards an eventual deal to formalise relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, regional powers will likely seek to protect whatever they can of the de-escalatory trend of the past few years. Their domestic socioeconomic development, the number one priority for most governments in the region – especially those in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, the region’s most influential Arab states – depends on maintaining at least a modicum of stability. However, as the events of the past three months have shown, their ability to prevent the region’s various complex conflicts – not only that in Israel–Palestine, but also those in Libya, Syria and Yemen – from exploding in their faces is very limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2023, the US stepped in. From the perspective of most of the US’s long-term Arab partners in the region, the Biden administration has given Israel too much leeway and been too uncritical of its response to the Hamas attack. But they were also relieved that the massive deployment of US military assets to the region after 7 October, aimed at deterring Iran and Hezbollah, helped to stave off an immediate widening of the conflict. Riyadh is also glad that the US is dealing with the Houthis’ disruption of traffic through the Red Sea, enabling the Kingdom itself to preserve its own fragile understanding with the group which it hopes can allow it to end its eight-year military intervention in Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Saudi Arabia and other regional states can be under no illusion that the US, regardless of who is elected president at the end of the year, ultimately does not want to regard the Middle East as one of its top priorities anymore. At the same time, the current crisis has shown that neither China, Russia nor any other contenders – real or imagined – to the status of centres of gravity in an emerging multipolar order have the ability or will to meaningfully support or manage regional security and stability. For the Middle East, 2024 will therefore be yet another unsettling year, in which governments will have to dedicate far more bandwidth than they would like to their region’s disorder and uncertain place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic trade tools, advanced technologies, and de-risking continue to feature prominently in evolving economic and national security agendas. The nexus of trade policy and national security has been particularly dynamic in the United States, which maintains one of the world’s most advanced trade tool kits for national security. Questions have emerged, however, about whether the use of these trade tools serves primarily as a national security instrument or whether their use is motivated primarily by a bid to protect domestic industry. As technology grows in foreign policy importance, the line between what is critical to national security versus what is critical to economic security is increasingly blurred. One technology increasingly under the security spotlight is lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-lidar&quot;&gt;Defining Lidar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Light detection and ranging, or lidar technology, is a dual-use technology, which means it has both civilian and military uses. Lidar uses laser pulses to hit objects and reflect back, calculating the position, size, and velocity of surrounding objects. These laser pulses occur at rates of millions of beams per second, creating a highly accurate and real-time 3D image of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar is widely used in commercial and scientific applications. In 2018, archeologists used lidar to scan the jungle along the border of Guatemala and Mexico, digitally removing the dense tree layer to reveal swaths of Mayan ruins. In “smart city” infrastructure programs, lidar collects data to improve road safety and support traffic management. Lidar is also critical in driverless cars. All major autonomous vehicle producers (with the exception of Tesla) use lidar as “3D eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lidar-and-us-national-security&quot;&gt;Lidar and U.S. National Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar also has myriad military applications. The integration of lidar into aerial vehicles like drones can enhance their autonomous capabilities, such as navigation and collision avoidance, improving their ability to navigate complex environments. Lidar can also map battlefields and gather reconnaissance, scouting for potential danger without risking soldiers’ lives to map the places satellites cannot see. Lidar can also assess buildings for structural damage, locate sea mines using bathymetric lidar (which passes through water), and estimate the effectiveness of weapons by evaluating atmospheric conditions. The U.S. Army is currently developing its own autonomous vehicles through a $49.9 million project with autonomous truck company Kodiak Robotics, which uses only U.S.-produced lidar for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-concerns&quot;&gt;Data Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One national security element of lidar that has garnered attention among U.S. policymakers is its potential to generate large swaths of data about urban environments and critical infrastructure. A 2016 Intel study revealed that autonomous vehicles could produce 4,000 gigabytes of data each day, underscoring the tremendous amounts of data they hoover up from surrounding environments. Lidar is used in almost all commercial autonomous vehicles currently tested and sold in the United States. Transmitting data to China could also lead to its access to perfect renderings of critical U.S. infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fears about data generation and gathering are likely exaggerated. Hesai, a major Chinese producer of lidar, has publicly stated that their products are closed systems, do not connect to the internet, and therefore cannot physically transfer data. Hesai has also stated that their lidar is not suitable for military use and is not sold to U.S. military end-users. A recent House Select Committee report on the need to “reset” U.S.-China economic relations has asked the Department of Commerce to investigate whether lidar produced by a foreign adversary poses a national security risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-lidar&quot;&gt;Chinese Lidar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, several Chinese ministries, including the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), identified lidar as a “strategic emerging industry.” This designation jumpstarted growth in state investment in the industry and was accompanied by additional support for sectors that use lidar, such as autonomous vehicles and smart city programs. Chinese companies have also been accused of stealing foreign intellectual property, resulting in patent infringement lawsuits from several U.S. companies. China also pursued “leapfrogging,” an effort to ensure that Chinese companies could jump to produce the most advanced technology and avoid having to fight for space in which foreign countries already dominate. A Chinese expert on intelligent vehicles suggested applying this agenda to lidar by focusing on solid-state lidar instead of the typical 360-degree lidar produced by U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;possible-military-connections&quot;&gt;Possible Military Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hesai is the largest Chinese lidar company by sales, capturing over 47 percent of global market share and 67 percent of the autonomous vehicle market. Hesai is reportedly tied to the Chinese military through the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), a state-owned dual-use electronics manufacturer that produces technology for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Hesai has denied these allegations. The House Select Committee letter to the executive branch also accuses Robosense, another major Chinese lidar manufacturer, of ties to the Harbin Institute of Technology, a military university. Huawei, long accused of having ties to the Chinese government, has also recently entered the lidar market. However, linkages between private companies and the Chinese government can be murky, and unsubstantiated conjecture can increase tensions without bolstering U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-security-considerations&quot;&gt;Economic Security Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lidar technology was originally developed in the United States, but the growth of Chinese firms has imperiled the long-term viability of the U.S. lidar sector. The United States maintains robust and well-utilized national security instruments to combat nonmarket economic practices that result in injury of U.S. firms. These include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974; Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962; and antidumping, countervailing, and Section 337 investigations under the Tariff Act of 1930.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of these statutes to specific cases is contingent upon a lengthy litigation and investigation process, in which identifying injury by a foreign government can be difficult. While lidar was originally developed and dominated by U.S. firms, the proliferation of lidar in domestic Chinese markets has brought costs down and created a more competitive market overall. There are obvious parallels to the electric vehicle market, in which China’s electric vehicle market has shrunk from 300 companies in 2021 to 50 firms today, far outpacing the number of U.S. peer competitors. The potentially bleak consequences of Chinese electric vehicles on European and U.S. firms are likely to result in enhanced protective measures and have already resulted in a European Commission anti-subsidy investigation. A similar dynamic is playing out in the lidar sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth of foreign lidar companies, even if driven by good faith competition, could potentially imperil the longevity of U.S. firms. Foreign domination of a U.S. sector potentially creates a “weaponized interdependence” scenario in which a foreign government can exercise chokepoints and cut off supplies. This risk is not theoretical. Lidar was added to a draft Chinese government export control list in December 2022, with an official announcement that certain types of lidar — specifically laser range finders — would be restricted on July 31, 2023, as part of a larger swath of controls on drones and drone equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-trade-and-investment-instruments&quot;&gt;U.S. Trade and Investment Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States maintains what is arguably the world’s most advanced trade and investment tool kit at the nexus of national security. Exercising some of these instruments to a fuller extent could better protect the U.S. lidar sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commerce-department-instruments&quot;&gt;Commerce Department Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) Entity List identifies and lists organizations believed to be acting against the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. The entities listed face presumptions of denial for export licenses for all items subject to export regulations, restricting access to sensitive U.S. technologies for national security and foreign policy reasons. Huawei, which now produces lidar products, is listed, as are CETC and the Harbin Institute, which are reported to have ties to Hesai and Robosense. No other Chinese lidar firms are included on the Entity List.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress have recently accused BIS of underutilizing its full authorities by permitting the outflow of certain technologies to China. Representative Michael McCaul (R-TX), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has accused the agency in a major 90-day review report of enabling “a virtually unrestricted flow of American technology to CCP-controlled companies, facilitating China’s rapid rise as a technological, economic, and military superpower.” BIS, on the other hand, maintains that permitting the outflow of technologies to China provides badly needed export revenue for U.S. firms, allowing them to redouble research and development efforts, thus enabling them to retain a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, the House Select Committee addressed a letter to Secretaries Raimondo, Yellen, and Austin calling for additional scrutiny over foreign lidar. The letter urged BIS to implement narrow controls on Field Programmable Gate Array chips, which are necessary for lidar and overwhelmingly produced by Xilinx Inc. and Altera Corporation in the United States. Current controls cover some of these chips but not those used in lidar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;treasury-department-instruments&quot;&gt;Treasury Department Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of the Treasury’s Non-SDN Chinese-Military Industrial Complex (NS-CMIC) List identifies entities that the U.S. government has determined are involved in the development or production of military equipment or materials for the PLA. The list is designed to prevent U.S. persons and entities from investing in or supporting companies that could contribute to advancing PLA military capabilities. The NS-CMIC List undergoes regular updates to reflect changes in China’s military industry. The overarching goal of the NS-CMIC is to impede China’s military-civil fusion strategy and overall modernization of the PLA. The list has also identified Chinese companies involved in the development of other advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, advanced semiconductors, and hypersonic weapons. Huawei and CETC are included on this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-department-instruments&quot;&gt;Defense Department Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense’s (DOD) Chinese Military Companies List, also known as the Section 1260H list, is a list of Chinese military companies that are “operating directly or indirectly in the United States.” The DOD began publishing this list in 2021 as required by an amendment to the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). It was intended to replace a previous list published by the DOD that identified communist Chinese military companies as instructed by Section 1237 of the 1999 NDAA. A major difference between the two lists is that 1260H list redefined what constituted military ties to capture companies that were a part of civil-military fusion, reflect the modern Chinese military chain of command, and narrow the scope of companies to identify risks more effectively. Under Executive Orders (EO) 13959 and 13974, then president Trump blocked U.S. persons from owning securities from companies on the Section 1237 list, a decision that was continued through President Biden’s own EO. Huawei and CETC were included in the earliest tranche of the 1260H list published in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investment-instruments&quot;&gt;Investment Instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the Biden administration issued an EO establishing an outbound investment notification regime covering chips, artificial intelligence, and quantum investments. The EO directs the Department of Treasury to require notification of certain transactions, while prohibiting certain higher-risk transactions. Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Bob Casey (D-PA) had included networked lasered scanning systems, a type of lidar, in the amendment to the 2024 NDAA via the Outbound Investment Transparency Act, although lidar was not included in the EO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) examines national security risks of foreign investment. A September 2022 EO expanded CFIUS’ ability to protect U.S. technology and more directly tied CFIUS objectives to preserving U.S. technological leadership and enhancing U.S. supply chain resilience in line with overall security objectives. Prior to the EO, CFIUS had approved Chinese acquisitions, reverse mergers, and investments in U.S. lidar companies but will likely face growing pressure to approach those transactions more critically. CFIUS is simultaneously facing calls to maintain openness where possible, particularly since it has reviewed a record number of filings, despite slowing foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tariff-remedies&quot;&gt;Tariff Remedies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act grants the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) the power to conduct investigations and measures to uphold U.S. rights under trade agreements, as well as to address specific foreign trade practices, including intellectual property violations, discriminatory taxation, unfair subsidies, currency manipulation, and illegal sourcing. Under presidential guidance, Section 301 authorizes the USTR to investigate and effectively counteract unfair trade practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 14, 2017, then president Trump called on the USTR to investigate China’s technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation practices under Section 301. This investigation identified four Chinese practices related to technology as unreasonable or discriminatory, specifically their technology transfer requirements, licensing restrictions, outbound investment regime, and theft of intellectual property. In March 2018, the USTR announced tariffs of 10 or 25 percent on a variety of Chinese products. One of the covered products was lidar, under HTS code 9015.80.20, which was then subject to a 25 percent tariff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if certain hard security aspects of lidar remain murky, it is critical that the U.S. government bolster efforts to support the domestic lidar industry and pursue preventive measures where possible. Policymakers should consider the following measures to support the U.S. lidar sector:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that the United States maintains a domestic supply of lidar.&lt;/strong&gt; Ensuring domestic supplies reduces the likelihood of a foreign actor weaponizing dependance on lidar. It also “de-risks” lidar use in military applications by ensuring that the provider is not an entity with foreign military ties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiate additional investigations into foreign lidar to determine data leakage risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Questions abound about the hard security risks of lidar, spanning data flows and 3D mapping of critical infrastructure. The Department of Commerce, in partnership with the End-User Review Committee, should conduct a review that would provide resources to more definitively identify data flow risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use export restrictions lightly.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike other critical technologies, it is difficult to claim that the United States maintains chokepoints over lidar since some Chinese products are superior in both quality and price. U.S. export controls could thus have a limited effect on certain Chinese lidar capabilities, while narrowing the market for U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in talent strategies and technology capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; It is critical that the U.S. government pursue “promote” policies in addition to “protect” policies. Relaxing immigration requirements to encourage more advanced STEM professionals to work in the United States should be a key priority, particularly as workforce woes become increasingly acute. Moreover, future talent gaps could ultimately decide the winners of the tech race.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider the application of emerging instruments to the lidar sector.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Congress demonstrated some enthusiasm for covering lidar under an outbound investment regime. Upon concluding an investigation, if it is determined that lidar does pose a national security threat, the United States should consider expanding the scope of an outbound investment regime to include lidar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced technologies are driving a new era of economic security in which national security and domestic economic interests are increasingly intertwined. The U.S. government should explore the full toolkit at its disposal to evaluate the possible risks of an overdependence on foreign lidar. Lidar will enable significant leaps forward in both civilian and military applications, underscoring the necessity of maintaining a U.S. supply that cannot be weaponized by a foreign actor, but protective trade measures are only part of the equation. Efforts to “run faster” will better enable the United States to map the geostrategic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第6日審訊。控方繼續開案陳詞，指國安法生效後，黎智英持續在專欄撰文及在 Twitter 發文，稱推行國安法會導致中國被國際圍堵，又表態支持美國推行《香港避風港法案》和《香港人自由和選擇法》。黎接受外媒採訪時稱：「我將會留在這裡直至最後一日⋯⋯直至我不能再留或我們陣營的人全部被捕或離去。」如果他離開會令自己蒙羞，也會令《蘋果日報》名譽受損。黎於2020年8月10日被拘捕，他獲釋後，《蘋果日報》隨即以頭版報導黎智英稱：「坐監都揀呢條路。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方國安法生效後-黎智英續撰文提制裁&quot;&gt;控方：國安法生效後 黎智英續撰文提制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續開案陳詞，指《國安法》生效之後，黎智英持續利用《蘋果日報》作為平台發布煽動文章，美化及鼓吹示威者的違法行為，又請求外國勢力向中港官員實施制裁。在2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日期間，《蘋果》發布了合共85篇煽動刊物，其中31篇含有請求外國勢力向中港官員實施制裁、封鎖或其他敵對措施的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中黎智英在專欄「成敗樂一笑」所撰寫的文章，涉及請求外國制裁的內容，包括：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《有種回力鏢……自插心臟》（2020年7月26日）：黎稱國安法生效後，會損害中國經濟及引來國際圍堵。黎又指美國會有強烈反制措施，以及制裁和懲罰。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《繼續打壓香港 還是以身報國？》（2020年9月27日）：黎形容國安法是中央殘暴和惡毒的手段去打壓香港人追求民主自由&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《台灣也要感謝黨》（2020年10月11日）：黎稱若日本、澳洲和西方國家向中國實施科技禁運及制裁，中國的經濟和科技發展將會停滯，而台灣能獲得好處，又指國家領導人習近平是自大及獨裁&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;《天下圍中 拜登騎虎難下》（2020年11月29日）：黎呼籲拜登政府不要採取「多邊主義」外交手段，若果拜登政府不繼續上一任總統特朗普的「對中國不妥協」政策，台灣的形勢將會惡化&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎被捕獲釋後-蘋果頭版報導坐監都揀呢條路&quot;&gt;控方：黎被捕獲釋後 蘋果頭版報導「坐監都揀呢條路」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於2020年8月10日被警方國安處拘捕，其後獲得警方擔保。8月13日，《蘋果日報》頭版報導黎智英稱：「坐監都揀呢條路」，並引述黎稱：「將來瞓喺監獄，whatever，我都係會揀呢條路。」報章另發布報導引述黎稱「手銬都不能侮辱我」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，黎於2020年12月還柙後，來監獄探訪的人包括張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、馮偉光、張志偉。《蘋果日報》仍繼續運作，而黎則繼續給予指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MRpnfLP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，楊清奇負責聯絡《蘋果》不同專欄作者，包括李怡，亦曾安排區家麟撰稿，而區的文章亦構成部份煽動內容。黎亦曾介紹日本籍的作者替《蘋果》撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱不會離開-否則令自己蒙羞&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱「不會離開」 否則令自己蒙羞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年7月1日接受《霍士新聞》（Fox News）訪問，提到香港或不再是金融中心（financial hub），當中譴責《國安法》和中共，又指會在香港留到最後一刻。庭上播放片段，黎提到《國安法》內文比最壞的想像更差，港人之間溝通要變得非常小心，又批評《國安法》凌駕立法會、取代法治和《基本法》，令做生意的人無法受到保障，難以維持香港的金融地位。被問到是否害怕被捕，黎指「我不擔心，因為我不能擔心，如果我擔心就不能做或講任何事情」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於會否離港，他則堅決表示不會：「我將會留在這裡直至最後一日（“I’m going to stay until the last day.”）⋯⋯直至我不能再留或我們陣營的人全部被捕或離去。不，我不能離開，如果我離開，我令自己蒙羞，我令《蘋果日報》名譽受損，我也損害民主運動的團結。（“Until I can’t stay or everybody in our camp is either arrested or gone. I can’t go away, if I go away, I disgrace myself, I discredit Apple Daily, I also undermine the solidarity of the democratic movement.”）」被問到他曾被捕數次，所涉罪名或能判終身監禁，黎指他不知道將會發生什麼，「但當政府不尊重法律，你不會知道紅線在哪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QVW9KWK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;播放片段期間，黎智英專注望向前方螢幕，一度輕輕搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎twitter發文支持美推行法案及制裁-獲特朗普讚勇敢受寵若驚&quot;&gt;控方：黎Twitter發文支持美推行法案及制裁 獲特朗普讚勇敢受寵若驚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦展示多則 Twitter 帖文。2020年7月15日，黎智英轉載美國駐港澳領事館關於民主派初選的聲明，黎標註（Tag）時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧及美國駐港澳領事館的 Twitter，感謝他們對香港人的支持，又稱國際間發聲及採取行動防範中共打壓自由，是前所未有的重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月17日，黎智英在 Twitter 發文指《香港避風港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act）和《香港人自由和選擇法》（Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act）是逆權運動的重要資源，向所有前美國政府及國務院職員致敬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“#HongKong #SafeHarborAct and #PeoplesFreedomandChoiceAct are good wherewithals to our resistance movement. Salute all former CGs and State Dept staff for caring about this place we call home.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月23日，黎智英 Twitter 發文指年輕人是爭取自由運動的中流砥柱，但他們危在旦夕，而英國推行BNO簽證新政策作為香港人的「救生艇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This is urgent and necessary. Our young people are the backbone of our freedom movement. They’re in the most danger. U.K. launches lifeboat for Hongkongers with focus on younger generation with new BN(O) visa.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日黎智英再發文，指美國應對尋求庇護的香港年輕人寬大，因他們為了爭取自由失去很多（“The US should be lenient for young #HKers seeking asylum. They suffered a lot fighting for #HongKong’s freedom.”），並轉載《蘋果》英文新聞，標題指《國安法》生效後，辦理移民美國的律師稱有關政治庇護的查詢驟增。（“Political asylum inquiries surge after national security law: US immigration lawyer”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月21日，黎智英 Twitter 引述《蘋果》報導指時任美國總統特朗普稱呼黎作勇敢的人，他感到受寵若驚，但他還未夠勇敢去對抗習近平，他只是為香港和台灣站出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“President @realDonaldTrump calls me a brave man. I am flattered. But I am not brave enough to stand against the whole world like #Xi. I only #StandWithHongKong #StandwithTaiwan” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年9月17日，黎智英 Twitter 稱，當美國等聯合一起實施制裁，中共同伙便會無處躲避，他們的資產亦無處可藏，並需為迫害香港人而承受後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When America and the rest of the free world are aligned and put in place the sanctions, CCP’s accomplices have nowhere to turn, and their assets have nowhere to hide. Their evil deeds persecuting of HKers will have consequences.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年12月1日，黎轉載《蘋果》英文新聞指林鄭因被美國制裁而家中堆放大量現金，黎稱拜登政府應令協助中共的人付上責任，制裁措施可挫他們的士氣，即使只為他們帶來少許不便，也是有效用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Biden administration should know that by making those abetting CCP repression personally accountable the measures can frustrate their morale of evil doing, thus will be effective even the measures may seem inconveniences in small ways.” — 黎智英 Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。警方國安處總警司李桂華則坐在律政司團隊後排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第6日審訊。控方續開案陳詞，就涉及李宇軒、陳梓華和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人的「串謀勾結外國勢力」控罪，控方指黎智英為主腦和金主，透過陳梓華作為「中間人」，向李宇軒和劉祖廸傳達指示，以「重光團隊（SWHK）」作平台，請求外國對中港實施制裁或敵對行動。當中黎智英曾在台灣向陳梓華和劉祖廸等人解釋其「支爆」計劃，並提出進行國際游說，令港府同意其議程、甚至推翻中共，李宇軒等人負責執行。而落實策略包括全球登報和眾籌；以「美國線」、「英國線」和「日本線」與當地政治人物接觸和聯繫，游說制裁中港；及發布制裁名單等。其中黎曾為全球登報墊支約500萬港元，並資助外國政治人物來港監察區選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方陳梓華經李柱銘認識黎智英助手指示李宇軒加入攬炒團隊&quot;&gt;控方：陳梓華經李柱銘認識黎智英助手、指示李宇軒加入「攬炒團隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今續讀出就黎智英與李宇軒等人，串謀勾結外國勢力罪行的開案陳詞。控方指稱，黎智英與李宇軒、陳梓華、Mark Simon、劉祖廸，及英國保守黨人權委員會委員裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）、日本眾議院議員菅野志櫻里、及英國金融家比爾布勞德（Bill Browder），串謀請求英、美、日及歐洲等國，對中港政府實施制裁或採取敵對行動，包括停止與香港的司法互助及或引渡協議、向香港停售武器、限制中港貿易，並以「重光團隊（Stand with Hong Kong Fight for Freedom，簡稱 SWHK）」作平台促進串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年6月反修例運動期間，陳梓華在 Telegram 群組「G20」得悉有示威者欲尋求黎智英資助進行「全球登報」，以尋求外國對中港政府施壓。陳其後嘗試透過李柱銘接觸黎智英，並獲介紹認識黎的助手 Mark Simon，Simon 轉告黎支持計劃，願預留500萬港元作廣告開支，事後需還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華遂聯絡群組成員之一的李宇軒，表示自己是黎智英的「中間人」，並要求李在G20峰會時組織全球登報，促使外國向港府施壓；陳並於2019年7月指示李加入「攬炒團隊」為核心成員，李和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸其後負責團隊運作，並透過陳接收黎智英和 Mark Simon 的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月，陳梓華首次與黎智英會面，同場還有李柱銘，飯局上黎智英指示陳透過 Mark Simon 接觸他，又着陳向激進示威者轉達訊息，指他們應採用較溫和的手段以爭取國際支持。同年8月，李宇軒和劉祖廸等人成立「重光團隊（SWHK）」，目的是請求外國制裁中港政府和介入警暴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英為主腦金主-陳梓華為中間人-李宇軒執行指示&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英為主腦、金主 陳梓華為中間人 李宇軒執行指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各人角色，控方指黎智英為主腦和金主，負責「最高指揮」；Mark Simon 是黎的代理人，直接向黎匯報和負責執行其指示，及審理財政援助的申請，黎本人會批核大額財政，Mark Simon 則負責較低金額。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳梓華是中間人，直接從黎智英或透過 Mark Simon 接收黎的指示，再傳達予李宇軒和劉祖廸，並與外媒聯絡放置廣告；李和劉則為團隊對外核心成員，按黎智英或 Mark Simon 經陳梓華的指示，指揮其他團隊成員，李並曾在眾籌前預付登報的費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而 SWHK 則自2019年8月起被用作平台實施串謀，透過社交媒體上的政治宣傳、發布文章、與外國政治人物或社運人士聯繫，請求外國對中港實施制裁、封鎖或其他敵對行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎在台與攬炒巴等會面談支爆-促制裁甚至推翻中共&quot;&gt;控方：黎在台與「攬炒巴」等會面談「支爆」 促制裁甚至推翻中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，2020年1月，黎智英指示 Mark Simon 安排與陳梓華、劉祖廸和一名林姓女示威者在其台灣陽明山寓所會面，會上黎解釋其「支爆」計劃，即透過造成中國行政及經濟動盪令中國政府倒台，並解釋國際游說的4個階段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（i）令外國知悉香港發生什麼事；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（ii）呼籲外國政府關注和譴責港府；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（iii）會見外國官員並將他們想法帶回香港；&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（iv）會見外國政治顧問，以影響其政府對華政策，促使對香港及中國實施制裁，令港府同意其議程，甚至推翻中共。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何俊仁和李永達其後亦加入該會面。此外，黎智英亦安排陳梓華、李宇軒和女示威者在台灣會見施明德，讓施分享抗爭的經驗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，各人其後討論如何執行黎的「支爆」計劃，當中陳梓華負責聯絡抗爭相關人士，李宇軒繼續國際游說及建立國際網絡，劉祖廸扮演精神領袖宣揚「攬炒」。至2020年5月，Mark Simon 與陳梓華會面重申4階段國際游說；黎智英於同年6月與陳會面，指示他繼續進行國際游說，又邀請陳到壹傳媒大樓會面，強調《蘋果日報》英文版的重要性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方李宇軒被捕後-mark-simon曾稱運作不受影響&quot;&gt;控方：李宇軒被捕後 Mark Simon曾稱運作不受影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，《國安法》生效後，陳梓華和 Mark Simon 繼續保持聯絡，而李宇軒於2020年8月被捕後，Simon 告知陳梓華 SWHK 的運作不會受影響，因他們有 Plan B，就是讓劉祖廸到美國演講宣揚「攬炒」理念，並繼續要求美國制裁中港政府。同年10月，陳梓華被以「協助罪犯罪」被捕並獲保釋，Simon 仍鼓勵他繼續國際游說，又稱會向他提供協助，包括安排他到美國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英指示李宇軒3次全球登報墊支約510萬&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英指示李宇軒3次全球登報、墊支約510萬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎智英等人採取不同策略勾結外國勢力，包括全球登報和眾籌、建立國際網絡、及發布文章、新聞稿和制裁報告等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就全球登報及眾籌，控方指，李宇軒在黎智英及 Mark Simon 經陳梓華指示下，於2019年6、7、8月分別組織3次全球登報，在美、加、英、日及台等多地報章刊登文章，呼籲譴責中國、香港政府和香港警察，並促請對中港實施制裁。其中加拿大《環球郵報》〈Stand With Hong Kong Until Dawn〉，提到望加政府承認香港警察犯下反人類罪行，實施制裁和禁向香港售武；美國《紐約時報》〈Catch Hong Kong As We Fall〉，則促美方停止賣彈藥予香港警察並通過《香港人權及民主法案》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為支付相關費用，李宇軒及陳梓華等人發起3次眾籌，分別籌得約700萬港元、30萬英鎊（約310萬港元）及183萬美元（約1,440萬港元），即共約2,450萬港元。控方並指黎智英透過 Mark Simon 提供財政支持，其中第一次登報開支約600萬港元，黎和 Simon 透過二人持有的公司 LAIS Hotel Properties Limited 及力高顧問，墊支156萬港元給至少5份報章；李宇軒其後在8月初將156萬港元轉帳到台灣的查德威有限公司償還黎，以避免黎的身分曝光。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 亦協助處理眾籌款項，就第二次全球登報，Mark Simon 將眾籌的約310萬港元，存入《蘋果日報》專欄作者 Jack Henry Hazlewood 的英國戶口，再轉帳給李宇軒。就第三次全球登報，Mark Simon 將眾籌資金存入其美國戶口，再存入他成立的信託基金「The Project Hong Kong Trust」，再透過基金將約320萬港元存入李宇軒戶口；LAIS Hotel 及力高亦向6份報章支付354萬港元，包括向《日本經濟新聞》支付約147萬港元。庭上展示 WhatsApp 訊息，Mark Simon 曾表示已獲歸還所有就國際廣告支付的款項（“all monies that were used for the international ad campaign are now back with us”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度問及，控方展示 Mark Simon 的 WhatsApp 訊息，是否依賴該些訊息的真實性，周天行回應視乎情況，指部分訊息有銀行紀錄支持。惟李運騰指即使如此，該些訊息仍屬「傳聞證供」，控方不能以此證明 Simon 訊息所說為真，周天行終稱只會用以證黎智英犯案時的心態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英資助辦展覽及組織選舉監察團轉讓公司予陳梓華作回報&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英資助辦展覽及組織選舉監察團、轉讓公司予陳梓華作回報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎智英亦為其他宣傳提供財政支持，包括2019年8月，Mark Simon 轉帳3萬元予陳梓華，由李予信協助籌辦報紙展覽；10月黎智英再轉帳14.41萬元予陳，組織其他報紙展覽和街站；11月 Mark Simon 轉帳50萬元予李宇軒組織「選舉監察團」，邀請外國政治人物來港監察區議會選舉。2020年1月，黎智英亦將一所在英屬維爾京群島註冊的公司「LACOCK」轉讓予陳梓華，包括股權、董事及銀行戶口的簽署人，作為陳提供協助的回報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，黎智英和 Mark Simon 亦透過陳梓華，批准李宇軒免費使用《蘋果日報》就鄧小平簽署《中英聯合聲明》的版權相片；《蘋果日報》亦在重要版面刊登第三次全球登報的詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，眾籌的資金同時用作 SWHK 營運開支及作國際游說工作，及邀請英國國會議員 Bob Seely 於2019年8月來港觀察反修例運動。而由於眾籌資金用畢，劉祖廸於2020年5月提出進行第4次眾籌，團隊於8月籌得170萬美元（約1,320萬港元），並存放在由 Mark Simon 設立和控制的「the Project Hong Kong Trust」，並按其指示將有關款項用於國際游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎指示分美英日3線-李宇軒向美議員展警彈藥游說警暴&quot;&gt;控方：黎指示分美、英、日3線 李宇軒向美議員展警彈藥游說警暴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了全球登報，控方亦指 SWHK 被用作平台以建立國際網絡爭取外國支持，及向中港施壓。在2019年10至11月，團隊資助香港大專學生在日內瓦、柏林、巴黎、倫敦及華盛頓會見外國政治人物，游說他們支持反修例示威；同年11月發起「選舉監察團」，邀請19名外國政治人物來港監察區議會選舉，期間李宇軒與 Lord Alton、Luke de Pulford、陳方安生和李柱銘會面，擴展網絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而為促進串謀，及在黎智英指示下，陳梓華、李宇軒及劉祖廸等人與美國、英國及日本的政治人物接觸和持續聯繫，並稱之為「美國線」、「英國線」與「日本線」。「美國線」方面，黎智英同意 Mark Simon 於2019年9月安排李宇軒與潛在美國總統參選人、參議員斯科特 Rick Scott、其助手 Scott Sciretta 及美國領事職員 Alan Brinker 會面，李透過展示277粒警方使用過的彈藥，就「警暴」進行游說，陳梓華並曾指示李宇軒隱藏「資助人（backers）」黎和 Simon 的身分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年12月，李宇軒到美國與「香港民主委員會」創辦人、朱耀明兒子朱牧民及美國參議員 Rick Scott、Todd Young 和 Ted Cruz 會面，陳梓華提醒李把握機會建立美國網絡並游說制裁中港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方陳方安生邀李宇軒與英領事等會面李協助ipac工作&quot;&gt;控方：陳方安生邀李宇軒與英領事等會面、李協助IPAC工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「英國線」方面，2019年12月，黎智英安排陳梓華於倫敦與「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯 Benedict Rogers 會面；同月在陳方安生邀請下，李宇軒參與時任英國駐港領事 Andrew Heyn 舉辦的飯局，席間除陳方安生外，李柱銘、郭榮鏗和莫乃光均有出席。至2020年1或2月，陳方安生再邀陳梓華和李宇軒在其辦公室會面，就對示威的看法交流意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年5月，英國保守黨人權委員會委員裴倫德向李宇軒提出，有意成立「對華政策跨國議會聯盟（IPAC）」，成員包括對中國採強硬立場的各國議員，以爭取落實制裁中港政府的政策。Mark Simon 指示 SWHK 應加入 IPAC，SWHK 遂於2020年6月在裴倫德招募下加入 IPAC 秘書處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年7月，李宇軒向裴倫德建議游說英、美、日、德國、西班牙、意大利等多個國家，停止與香港的司法互助或逃犯引渡協議；其後在黎智英和 Mark Simon 指示下，陳梓華建議李宇軒繼續協助 IPAC 的工作，負責網站編輯及發布文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方李宇軒向日議員交制裁草案協助翻譯推立法&quot;&gt;控方：李宇軒向日議員交制裁草案、協助翻譯推立法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「日本線」方面，李宇軒於2020年1月至4月，向3名日本眾議院議員提交有關「馬格尼茨基式」制裁的草案，並將 IPAC 的會議紀錄翻譯成日文，以協助菅野志櫻里推動《馬格尼茨基人權法案》立法。李又與裴倫德等人討論 SWHK 可如何協助 IPAC 和由日本議員組成的「對中政策相關國會議員聯盟（JPAC）」，其中 Bill Browder 和菅野志櫻里原擬會面討論該法案，但該視像會議終因李宇軒被捕而未成事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指，李宇軒在黎智英透過 Mark Simon 和陳梓華的指示下，執行和管理 SWHK 的事務，與外國政治人物建立網絡、進行國際游說，請求外國制裁中國；負責 SWHK 會計紀錄，批出團隊活動開支；亦負責編輯 SWHK 的網頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方swhk發布多篇文章籲制裁致函外國政府促停引渡協議&quot;&gt;控方：SWHK發布多篇文章籲制裁、致函外國政府促停引渡協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指，在黎智英及 Mark Simon 透過陳梓華指示下，李宇軒本人或透過 SWHK，發布一系列文章、新聞稿和制裁名單，以促請制裁。其中2019年12月，SWHK 發布一份與香港大專學界國際事務代表團制作，針對144名中港官員的制裁名單；2020年7月1日，SWHK 發布題為〈Darkness is descending on freedom and democracy in Hong Kong, a leading global campaigning organisation has warned〉的新聞稿，譴責《國安法》頒布，並呼籲英政府急切考慮對中國及香港實施馬格尼茨基式制裁、及撤銷與香港的引渡協議，並對中國國企如華為施加限制。同年7月17日，SWHK 致函捷克、愛爾蘭及葡萄牙政府，促請她們終止與香港的引渡協議，3封信於李的電腦搜得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7月期間，SWHK 亦多次在 Twitter 轉發外國政治人物的帖文，如轉發美國議員帖文，感謝他們投票通過《香港自治法案》；轉發 Bill Browder 帖文呼籲制裁中港官員；轉發美國白宮帖文，感謝美國取消香港「特別待遇」和對中國施加關稅；及轉發羅冠聰帖文，促請國際社會對前特首和選舉主任進行制裁等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SWHK亦曾於7至8月發布數篇文章，包括〈The destruction of the democratic process in Hong Kong〉，呼籲美國對中港進行制裁，並於2021年1月發布由數個海外組織聯署的聲明，促請美政府啟動「救生艇」政策及英國政府實施對中港制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱黎智英2013至2020年期間-向民主派課金逾9千萬元&quot;&gt;控方稱黎智英2013至2020年期間 向民主派課金逾9千萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就資金流向，控方指在2013年7月至2020年7月期間，黎智英共86次轉帳予 Mark Simon，款項達1億1,860萬元。其中9,326萬元再被分配給不同民主派人士及政黨。此外，黎智英於2019年10月18日指示 Mark Simon，將25,819.15元美金（即港幣約202,163.94元）捐給「香港監察」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;稅務局的資料顯示在2013至2020年期間，Mark Simon 報稱為壹傳媒動畫公司的職員，年薪為110至120萬元。在2020至2021年期間，Mark Simon 亦報稱為力高顧問有限公司的商業經理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒被捕後獲警方擔保-惟其後被內地水警截獲-終移交回港&quot;&gt;李宇軒被捕後獲警方擔保 惟其後被內地水警截獲 終移交回港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各被告的被捕情況，控方指，李宇軒於2020年8月10日被警方以「勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」、「無牌管有槍械或彈藥」、「藏有可作非法用途的工具」及「洗黑錢」罪拘捕。8月12日李獲警方擔保，惟須交出護照等旅遊證件及不得離港，並須於同年9月1日到警署報到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟8月23日李乘船非法闖入中國水域時被內地水警拘捕。至2021年3月22日，李從中國被移交至香港警方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華2021年2月還柙至今-劉祖廸和mark-simon於2020年離港&quot;&gt;陳梓華2021年2月還柙至今 劉祖廸和Mark Simon於2020年離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳梓華於2020年10月10日被警方以「協助罪犯」罪名拘捕，其後獲警方擔保。同年10至11月，Mark Simon 向陳說自己可能會因國安法罪名而被捕，但鼓勵陳繼續國際游說工作，Mark Simon 並向陳保證黎智英及他會提供一切協助，包括提供逃往美國的路線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2021年2月15日，陳再度被警方以「勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪拘捕，其後一直還柙至今。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於劉祖廸和 Mark Simon，則分別於2020年1月5日及4月18日經出境關口離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於2020年8月10日首次被捕。其後於9月1日，黎進行警誡錄影會面，警員向他展示部份專欄文章，他承認作者是自己。黎亦承認 Twitter 帳戶屬於他持有及使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方3法案通過立法-42名官員被制裁&quot;&gt;控方：3法案通過立法 42名官員被制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指，在涉案時段，外國推行不同法案及政策，以制裁中港官員、限制貿易和出入口，以及延長港人外國居留期限等。包括2019年6月13日，《香港人權及民主法案》（The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act）在美國眾議院審議，並於同年11月27日獲時任美國總統特朗普簽署立法。2020年6月30日，美國議員提出《香港避風港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act），相關立法程序仍在進行中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act）。法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治的中國及香港官員、機構或企業。同日，特朗普簽署《香港正常化總統行政命令》（President’s Executive Order 13936 on Hong Kong Normalization），暫緩或取消對香港的部份特別待遇，以及授權美政府實施制裁措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021年6月30日，美國有議員提出《香港人自由和選擇法》（Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act），要求為合資格的港人提供臨時庇護和難民身份，以及其他有關移居美國的措施，相關立法程序仍在進行中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月至2021年7月期間，美國向42名中央及香港特區政府官員實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月11日，美國政府宣布由同年9月25日起，從香港進口美國的產品須註明原產地是「中國」，而不能標示「香港」。2020年8月19日，美國國務院宣布終止與香港簽署的三項雙邊協議，包括逃犯的移交、被判刑人士的移交、豁免國際船運利得稅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，約於2020年11月9日，英國、愛爾蘭、澳洲、紐西蘭等9個國家分別暫緩與香港之間的逃犯移交協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，香港城市大學法律學院教授、梁美芬丈夫王貴國會以美國法律和國際經濟法的專家身份出庭作供，講述制裁及封鎖措施的法律效力，包括影響、後果及時效等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;下周一續審-料將讀出同意事實&quot;&gt;下周一續審 料將讀出同意事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方讀畢179頁的開案陳詞，表示原預計傳召60名證人，但可減至31人，並望減至30人以下。控方亦將讀出同意事實，但望法庭給予時間與辯方商討，以視乎可否同意更多事實。案件下周一（8日）續審，將讀出同意事實。&lt;/p&gt;

The trade war, the pandemic, growing technology competition, rising tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, and contrasting approaches to the Russia-Ukraine conflict have collectively fed a sense of fatalism that they were heading toward the outright economic decoupling and military conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit meeting between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping held in November near San Francisco, just in advance of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Week, was the culmination of a year-long process that calmed the waters. The two sides announced a range of deliverables on economic and security issues and tried to convey a sense that they could effectively manage their differences. Although the United States and China are still engaged in a comprehensive contest for power and over setting the global rules of the game, guardrails are gradually being created, and as a result, the likelihood of the most disastrous outcomes has receded. Moreover, even though the chances of a genuine thaw that resolves fundamental differences and leads to greater cooperation are low, there also are underappreciated sources of structural stability that could keep relations from further deteriorating in the coming years. Nevertheless, it will take active diplomacy and some good luck to keep ties from fraying in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surpassing-low-expectations&quot;&gt;Surpassing Low Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their four-hour meeting on the Filoli Estate in Woodside, California, both Biden and Xi appeared to stick to their original positions on technology and economic security, Taiwan, Ukraine, human rights, and several other issues. At the same time, they were able to produce a series of deliverables exceeding the expectations of most analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the readouts from the White House and People’s Republic of China (PRC) media (Xinhua, Caixin), it appears that, at a minimum, the two sides agreed to several actions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resume military-to-military dialogue through a variety of channels and on a number of specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Commit to accelerate efforts to expand renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions, including from methane and other greenhouse gases, in accordance with the joint statement issued at Sunnylands just before the bilateral meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Restore and expand cooperation on countering the production and trafficking of fentanyl and other narcotics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step up discussions to minimize risks related to artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Push for more direct flights between the two countries and expand people-to-people exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Begin consultations aimed at renewing the U.S.-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement, which is set to expire in late February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond specific actions, the two sides adjusted the tone of how they frame the relationship. The Biden administration’s readout said the two sides “are in competition,” dropping the previously ubiquitous adjective “strategic” from the characterization of ties. U.S. officials have continued to avoid using the “s” word in public statements. In place of the highly critical language about the United States and the Biden administration that have been dominant in the past few years, Chinese state media coverage has consistently highlighted the friendly and respectful nature of the meeting and has presented a hopeful vision for future ties. Chinese ambassador Xie Feng’s speech to the U.S.-China Business Council’s annual gala in mid-December is perhaps the best example of this major shift in tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;different-roads-to-san-francisco&quot;&gt;Different Roads to San Francisco&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and China both wanted the meeting to be successful, but their leaders arrived in San Francisco on very different trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden came in with the wind at his back. The U.S. economy has recovered; growth has regained momentum, while inflation has slowed. Although Congress seems locked in eternal battles internally and with the executive branch, it did adopt, in consultation with the administration, major pieces of legislation — the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the CHIPS and Science Act — that will provide a stronger foundation for the U.S. economy in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the United States’ relations with allies in Asia and Europe have improved dramatically in general and with respect to their approach toward China in particular. Analysis of the challenge China poses on economic and national security issues sounds increasingly similar whether one is in Tokyo, Berlin, Brussels, Washington, or other advanced market democracies. Closer alignment has been generated by China’s increasingly ambitious and distortionary industrial policies, the human rights situation in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, China’s close ties with Russia and its approach to Ukraine, instances of economic coercion by Beijing, and the worsening security situation in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and along the China-India border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrowing of differences reflects a greater willingness by the Biden administration, relative to its predecessor, to develop a foreign policy framework rooted in longtime alignments with allies, as well as a willingness to shift its own language and approach in a way that is more comfortable to friends in Europe and Asia. This certainly applies to the administration’s emphasis since the spring of 2023 that it is pursuing “de-risking,” not decoupling. At the same time, likeminded countries have become more willing to be openly critical of China and develop a range of policy responses, individually and together with others. This is most visible in the area of economic security, for example, with Japan’s Economic Security Promotion Act and the European Commission’s investigation into subsidies for China’s electric vehicle (EV) sector. Although there are still significant frictions — U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum, different approaches to data security and privacy, and disagreement over how to reform the World Trade Organization (WTO) — the dramatic reduction in differences between Washington and its allies is the more important trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Xi, by contrast, came in facing substantial domestic and international headwinds as a result of his changing policies at home and abroad. China’s zero-Covid policies, which initially were successful in 2020 and 2021, proved to be a failure in 2022 in the face of the Omicron variant. Lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere generated widespread anger, and the sudden removal of restrictions in late 2022 in the face of protests left many Chinese people feeling abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic front has brought a long string of bad news: the extended crackdown on the private tech sector, the imposition of a range of national security–oriented laws, the shrinking of the workforce and graying of the population, the property market’s woes, and growing restrictions on access to Western markets and technology. China’s economy may meet its official economic growth target for 2023 of around five percent, but the recovery has been far slower than expected, and the sense of inevitable continued economic success has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s record abroad has been equally problematic. Tensions with the United States, growing frictions in the Taiwan Strait, and alignment with Russia have brought the United States and its allies together. Access to Western technology and markets has been constrained, and global supply chains are gradually reducing their disproportionate reliance on China. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has attracted criticism for failed projects that have added to the debt load of developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of problems at home and abroad has led to a crisis of confidence among Chinese citizens, who have become far less certain about their individual and collective futures than at any time in the last three decades. Xi Jinping himself may exude self-confidence and believe that the “East is rising and the West is declining,” but he has not persuaded his populace of this prediction. Hence, Xi needs to stabilize relations with the United States and the West more generally, not only for foreign policy reasons but to rebuild confidence at home, which is central to generating growth and maintaining social stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why China’s bark has been bigger than its bite. Xi attended the APEC summit and held the bilateral meeting with Biden despite the fact that Washington made essentially no concessions to get Xi to California. In the months leading up to APEC, the administration issued an executive order on outbound investment, stepped up export controls on the semiconductor industry, and held firm in not inviting Hong Kong chief executive John Lee to the APEC leaders’ meeting. Beijing has sent signals of potential penalties through its investigation into a few consulting firms and by placing several minerals on its export control list, but it has not pulled the trigger on any of these yet, fearful that doing so would accelerate the decoupling it still hopes to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-stability&quot;&gt;Sources of Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s problems at home and abroad have left the impression that his conciliatory moves are tactical gestures that will be only temporary and fade away once China’s economy rebounds and domestic confidence in his leadership is restored or will disappear suddenly if Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s current vice president and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, wins Taiwan’s presidential election in mid-January and China is compelled to react with dramatic moves. Such concerns are entirely reasonable, but observers should appreciate that the sources of recent tempering of stresses are rooted in three structural characteristics of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credible military deterrents that the United States and China both maintain against the other form the first source of stability. China’s relative power has risen dramatically in recent years, and the United States and others take as credible Chinese threats to use force in the Taiwan Strait if Taiwan were to cross any of Beijing’s red lines. Conversely, the U.S. credibility to provide defensive support to Taiwan and its allies has been strengthened through the development of the Quad and AUKUS, improved bilateral relations with countries around China’s periphery, and its support to Ukraine. Equally important, although there are “green” and “blue” wings in Taiwan’s political spectrum regarding their ideal preferences for cross-strait outcomes, in the context of realistic constraints, the vast majority of the population — and the political parties — are one or another shade of turquoise. In sum, the astronomical costs of an outbreak of hostilities have created a widely shared preference in favor of maintaining the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, although U.S.-China bilateral trade and investment ties have stagnated, the two countries are still embedded in an extensive web of complex interdependence across all aspects of their economies and broader societies, which extends to countries around the world. Interconnectivity has created certain vulnerabilities, such as overdependence for critical goods and the potential transfer of dual-use technologies, but it also has created extensive economic and national security benefits that raise the costs of conflict and the value of continued interaction to both sides. Understandably, neither side is keen to abandon such ties. The fact that other countries are deeply connected to the United States and China further raises the costs to Washington and Beijing from taking precipitous actions. Interdependence is no panacea, but it is a structural feature shaping the choices of all parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the resumption of regular people-to-people ties, track 2 dialogues, and official consultations, in the wake of their collapse due to the Covid-19 pandemic, provides another set of stabilizers. Washington and Beijing have established roughly a dozen working groups on a wide range of topics, and the two governments now have normal interactions at the cabinet and working levels. So far there has been one recent congressional delegation, in October 2023, and there likely will be more in 2024. Communication does not necessarily generate momentum for extensive cooperation, but it provides pathways for reducing misunderstanding about policies and broader developments in both countries and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead-to-2024&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead to 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new normal of what could be called “competition without conflict” does not presage a return to the era of engagement, but the United States and China deserve credit for reducing the chances of the worst negative tail risks, including outright decoupling and military conflict. That said, the short-term incentives and long-term structural features of relations guarantee absolutely nothing. Maintaining momentum in 2024 will require a series of steps on the domestic, bilateral, and multilateral fronts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most urgently, every effort must be taken to avoid an escalation of tensions and outright conflict in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. The outcome of the Taiwan election is in doubt, but there should be no doubt that all sides need to act with prudence once the results are announced, and that extraordinary vigilance will be needed through the inauguration of Taiwan’s next leader in May and their first few months in office. Equally complex will be finding a way to defuse tensions involving China and the Philippines around Second Thomas Shoal in the face of Beijing’s increasingly aggressive moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, with the creation of new channels for dialogue, the United States and China need to move forward with consultations on all fronts, including on trade, technology, artificial intelligence, climate, and security issues. Given the previous dearth of communication, discussion itself will be valuable, but before long it will be reasonable to expect the two sides to refine their agenda in each working group and gradually shift from consultations to negotiations that deliver substantive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be equally important for the Biden administration to expand and deepen consultations and coordination with allies in Europe and Asia on China policy. General agreement about de-risking needs to be accompanied by more concrete alignment or harmonization with regard to the implementation of economic security in a range of sectors (semiconductors, EVs, and critical minerals being the most urgent), rules related to the digital economy, carrying out commitments from the latest UN Climate Change Conference (COP28), and how to resuscitate the WTO and keep the global trading system from collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Biden administration needs to further develop the architecture of its China policy. The administration deserves credit for putting meat on the bones of its three-pronged strategy of “invest, align and compete,” enunciating the goal of de-risking while maintaining extensive economic ties, and resuming extensive dialogue. It can build on this progress by clarifying the goals of its China policy. This begins by further articulating how the United States aims to strengthen and reform the rules-based international order and then, on that basis, how relations with China should be managed in light of those broader goals. Equally important is to begin an evaluation of the effectiveness of its approach across a range of areas. For example, what are the right metrics to measure progress with regard to advancement of American technology innovation, reduced overdependence on China, and the imposition of security-based restrictions on Chinese industry? That will then offer a foundation for judging whether U.S. policy is making progress, having unintended consequences, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, in 2024 the Biden administration needs to take steps to institutionalize the various elements of its China policy. Doing so could mean making measurable progress and having a less volatile year than many foresee, which would make its approach less vulnerable to criticism from Beijing, other countries, and other domestic perspectives. The last source of disagreement is particularly important given that China policy undoubtedly will be a central topic of discussion in the lead-up to the United States’ congressional and presidential elections in November.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方：黎智英籲下屬勿針對特朗普 指示Mark Simon邀彭斯和蓬佩奧訂閱英文版&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mLxOlOK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第5日審訊。控方繼續開案陳詞，指黎智英在美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 的建議下，指示下屬設立蘋果英文版，目的是爭取外國人的支持，以尋求外力向中央及香港政府實施制裁。黎又指示國際組同事不要針對特朗普，因蘋果靠特朗普政府的支持「保命」。當黃之鋒表示不認同蘋果發起的「一人一信救香港」行動，黎則向陳沛敏表示不同意黃，現時任何有助於香港的方法都應該採用，因已沒有其他方法對付中共。控方又指黎於2020年5月開設了個人 Twitter 帳戶，以圖增加影響力打「國際線」，列出黎智英所追蹤的外國政治人物及機構，遭法官質疑控方想反映什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英fcc演講獲蘋果報導-另指示下屬訪問彭定康&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英FCC演講獲蘋果報導 另指示下屬訪問彭定康&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨日開案陳詞提到，黎智英對《蘋果日報》的日常運作有完全的控制權，他會給予指示其他同案被告，是串謀犯罪的「主腦」。控方今天繼續開案陳詞，就發布煽動刊物罪，控方指2019年4月，黎智英指示張劍虹訪問「銅鑼灣書店」前店長林榮基，希望報導能有效地引發市民上街反送中。黎智英亦吩咐張想想如何推動更多人參與遊行，並向張轉發訊息，顯示黎早前請求「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers 聯絡前港督彭定康，採訪其對反送中的評論，後來相關報導於2019年4月28日刊出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年5月21日，黎智英在外國記者協會場合發表演講，後來《蘋果日報》報導演講內容，題為〈送中惡法 黎智英：修例後香港玩完 FCC演講斥林鄭非常邪惡〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方反送中運動開始後-蘋果報導及黎智英專欄文章煽動對政府仇恨&quot;&gt;控方：反送中運動開始後 蘋果報導及黎智英專欄文章煽動對政府仇恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年6月9日的反修例大遊行標誌著「社會騷動」的開始。雖然政府其後宣布暫緩以至撤回修例草案，但暴力示威浪潮持續。在這社會背景下，《蘋果日報》發布不同內容，包括針對中央政府及香港特區政府的煽動性陳述、呼籲市民參與示威、宣揚對警察的憎恨、提倡透過非法、暴力及「攬炒」手段來對抗中央及特區政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方列出31篇從2019年6月15日至2020年1月26日期間發布的文章，指稱它們具煽動性：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈和變勇 「是政權，逼我進化」〉：控方指稱文章意圖激起市民對中央政府及香港特區政府的憎恨&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈天下制裁集會 今勢逼爆遮打〉：控方引述內容「2020年才過了不足20天，林鄭月娥政府已經急不及待要『推動』逆權運動另一浪高潮。民政事務專員擅離職守架空區議會、警察喬裝市民濫捕公眾場所拍照少年、監警會借故延遲提交報告……種種事端都有意無意為刻下看似已緩和的民怨重新撥火。民間集會團隊呼籲港人今日再集結，向國際社會展示民意，冀求各國政府向迫害港人的香港官員與警察落實制裁措施。」控方指稱文章意圖激起市民對中央政府及香港特區政府的憎恨&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈社會專題：自己手足自己救〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚 全民勇武／三罷〉：文章提到「隊名『層龍，對抗警察是家常便飯，有人試過被警棍打穿頭，亦有人遭橡膠子彈爆頭險死，但他們明白不是每個人都有這種勇氣。」控方指文章意圖引起對警方的仇恨&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈港鐵大搜捕 釀元朗恐襲2.0 速龍無差別毆打市民〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;廣告〈誰殺死他她他和她……〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;廣告〈一次過變黑又得 逐漸變黑又得 黑晒！〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈攬炒巴×G20 團隊 眾籌1,400萬連登13國賣廣告 推爆警暴〉：控方指稱文章意圖提倡透過非法、暴力及「攬炒」手段來對抗中央及特區政府&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，從2019年6月15日至2020年1月16日，黎智英透過其個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」發表評論文章，旨在煽動市民對中央、特區政府和警察的仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈我們堅持下去，才有希望〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈反極權 台灣更不用怕〉：控方引文「中共可怕的地方是，把人當成是純綷被物質驅使的動物，而不是有靈性和精神面貌的人。」、「在中共金錢萬能的思維世界裡，自由如糞土，人民只是極權機器中的螺絲，最後只會令他們在這資訊開放的時代無地自容。」&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈2020 和勇繼續一起撐下去〉：黎在文中稱2020年元旦與李柱銘及何俊仁參與遊行，途中見到有一名年約14至15歲的少女大叫「黑警死全家」、「香港差佬，X你老母」。黎向何說：「有這樣的後生，我哋冇得輸。」黎續指，不知道「裝修」滙豐銀行的，是否「我們的勇武手足」，但打爆中國人壽店舖玻璃的兩名黑衣人便十分可疑，現場有人質疑二人是喬裝警員。&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈捍道德抗極權 全球人人有責〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月2日，黎智英指示陳沛敏報導示威者七一佔領立法會事件，以引起市民對年輕示威者的同情和支持。同年7月19日，黎智英向陳沛敏轉述 Benedict Rogers 的要求，轉述美國眾議員 Ted Yoho 有意投稿。同年10月，黎智英與美國眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）會面後，黎要求陳訪問她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方疫情爆發後-蘋果持續煽動&quot;&gt;控方：疫情爆發後 蘋果持續煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月底開始，新冠肺炎在香港爆發，令示威活動暫時沉寂，但《蘋果日報》持續發布內容，針對中央政府及香港特區政府的煽動性陳述、宣揚對警察的憎恨，以及提倡透過非法及暴力的手段來對抗中央及特區政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;〈擬用反恐例 控爆炸品案 鄧炳強學新疆鐵腕壓抗爭〉：控方指內容有意煽動對警察的仇恨，以及提倡使用不守法及暴力手段。&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指黎智英5篇專欄文章含煽動內容：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈現代人不是西方文明機制外生存的動物〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈武漢瘟疫 中共喪鐘〉：「肺炎疫情在中共維穩大前提下，謊言泛濫真相模糊，層層官僚架構層層謊言重疊，肺炎災情有多深重，就是中共也不知道。謊言治國不講誠信難服眾，習帝靠的是極權操控，絕對扼殺人民資訊自由，把人民變成盲從的羊群，管治便乾脆脷落。」、「習帝的極權控制了所有資訊，連拍電影現在也找不到題材了。」、「人民噤聲，政府霸道，惡毒病菌肆虐橫行，受苦的最後是人民。」&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈我們最光輝的時刻〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈專橫暴政打壓 我們氣魄不滅〉：「今日我們明知有事，中共打到嚟必然大清算大清洗，清算不聽話的人，清洗英國殖民地遺留下來保護港人自由的法治和機制，把香港人變成任由習帝擺佈的奴才，因此我們會繼續起來抗爭到底，希望趁習帝內外危機四伏，和慘遭武漢肺炎瘟疫人命摧殘和經濟淪陷後，各國尤其美國向中國責難及局部制裁，迫使中共不敢太明目張膽，暫時克制對香港的迫害」&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;〈無賴在摧毀香港法治〉&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方在美國國務院前資深顧問建議下-黎智英指示設蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;控方：在美國國務院前資深顧問建議下 黎智英指示設蘋果英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2020年5月，有傳媒報導人大打算在香港實施《國安法》，其時黎智英已開始從事針對中央的敵對活動，支持或提出請求外國勢力向中央及特區政府實施制裁或封鎖。早於同年4月，美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 電郵向黎智英提議設英文版，黎智英便指示下屬設立《蘋果日報》英文版，以尋求外力向中央及香港政府實施制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與 Christian Whiton 之間的對話，後者在2020年4月17日指設立《蘋果日報》英文版在政治上有好處。4月19日，Mark Simon 向黎指英文版原意是好，但可能不符成本效益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;群組對話顯示黎稱不需做平衡報導-指示應集中保衛香港的聲音&quot;&gt;群組對話顯示黎稱不需做平衡報導 指示應集中「保衛香港的聲音」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年5月10日，黎智英創立 WhatsApp 群組「English news」，其他成員包括張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、馮偉光及張志偉。他們其後討論英文版的運作方式，黎提出請求美國政治領袖去訂閱，以得到他們的支持（“By enlisting foreign leaders to subscribe to us is enlisting their support.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎強調不需全面地向外國人展示香港的不同政治派別，只需要聚焦在「蘋果日報觀點，即黃營的一般觀點」。（“We only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side.”) 黎又指不需要做平衡報導，因保衛香港的聲音需要被世界聽見。（“We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”）直至黎智英被拘捕之前，該群組一直有持續運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指示mark-simon邀請彭斯和蓬佩奧等人訂閱蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;黎智英指示Mark Simon邀請彭斯和蓬佩奧等人訂閱蘋果英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英亦與 Mark Simon 討論，黎指引入英文版可吸引美國人及其他外國人支持，遂指示 Mark Simon 協助宣傳，以及邀請時任美國副總統彭斯和時任國務卿蓬佩奧訂閱。黎其後表示聽聞有一些撰稿人不想再替《南華早報》寫文章，提議可邀請他們供稿予蘋果英文版，籲 Mark Simon 聯絡南華早報前總編輯 Mark Clifford 商討。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後指出，英文版除了讓支持反修例運動的美國人有方法訂閱蘋果之外，若果彭斯（Mike Pence）、蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）和共和黨參議員 Marco Rubio 等外國官員都訂閱的話，可在政治上保護到蘋果，因蘋果現時是中聯辦的針對目標，而外國支持是黎的關注點。黎決定英文版每天發布約10至12篇報導、專題和評論文章，另加8至10篇關於中國內地的文章，目標對象是美國讀者，希望打破《南華早報》的壟斷。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Jimmy Lai is a Champion of Freedom &amp;amp; I was honored to welcome him to the White House in 2019. Today, he sits in prison for his support of Democracy in Hong Kong &amp;amp; @VoCommunism rightly awarded him their Highest Honor for his Courageous Commitment to Freedom. God Bless Jimmy Lai.🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/oU69TSkex2 — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) June 11, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英亦向張劍虹提議在英文版加入台灣的報導，以吸引美國人的注意。張回覆：「老闆，一定需要的，中美大戰，台灣重要，必須要加的，謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方列黎智英twitter追蹤名單-官質疑可反映什麼&quot;&gt;控方列黎智英Twitter追蹤名單 官質疑可反映什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指在大約同一時間，黎於2020年5月開設了個人 Twitter 帳戶，以圖增加影響力打「國際線」。帖文不時標示美國、英國、日本及台灣的政治人物，與他們互相交流。而李兆富（Simon Lee）則負責管理黎的 Twitter 帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方列出黎智英 Twitter 帳戶追蹤的多名外國政治人物，包括時任美國副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧、Natan Sharansky、台灣領導人蔡英文、「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers、「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」創辦人兼執行董事 Luke de Pulford、「Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong. 重光團隊」、對華政策跨國議會聯盟、前香港大專學界國際事務代表團發言人邵嵐、美國國會及行政當局中國委員會、美國眾議院外交委員會、美軍前副參謀長 Jack Keane、美國參議員 Ted Cruz、《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，控方列出黎追蹤的帳戶是想顯示什麼？控方代表周天行則指名單可顯示到黎的「聯繫」，李官指「聯繫」的意思可以很廣闊。周天行指可反映黎與上述人士在 Twitter 上有交流，以及犯案時的心思意念（state of mind），即黎是知悉自己在做什麼，並且有相關意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾指示蘋果員工不要針對特朗普-因蘋果靠其支保命&quot;&gt;黎智英曾指示蘋果員工不要針對特朗普 因蘋果靠其支「保命」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年5月25日，《蘋果》發布一篇文章題為〈打國際線 蘋果英文版免費試睇〉，內容表示香港的人權被中共侵犯，英文版可供國際的朋友認識香港的狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英宣傳英文版時提及，多人訂閱不但可提供經濟上的支持，亦可保護《蘋果》免受政治打壓。黎智英又指示國際組同事「不要跟紐約時報及CNN針對川普，我們蘋果卻要靠川普政府支持保命」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月16日，《蘋果》發布彭定康支持訂閱的宣傳短片，題為「彭定康拍片撐新聞自由：每日一蘋果全為你好」。黎智英其後指示張劍虹安排《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」，呼籲香港人寫信給時任美國總統特朗普，並提供書信範本及步驟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃之鋒對「一人一信救香港」持不同意見，並在社交媒體稱「冇理由叫人哋國家嘅總統SaveHK」。陳沛敏把相關帖文 WhatsApp 發送給黎，黎則回應他不同意黃的觀點，現時任何有助於香港的方法都應該採用，雖然他知道很多人不同意「一人一信救香港」行動，包括李柱銘，但唯一出路就是要勇敢起來，因已沒有其他方法對付中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方國安法生效後-黎智英在網上直播對談節目談制裁&quot;&gt;控方：國安法生效後 黎智英在網上直播對談節目談制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當《國安法》於2020年6月30日晚上11時生效，《蘋果》隨即發布一篇題為〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺 泛民7.1繼續抗爭〉的新聞報導，實體報紙亦夾附一張海報，寫有「Fight For Freedom 為自由抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時《蘋果》製作了新的網上直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，首次播出時間為7月9日，題為「Live Q&amp;amp;A with Jimmy Lai」，黎在節目中表示以後會每週播放，並對《國安法》作出批評。之後的集數則邀請不同人士與黎智英對談，包括南華早報及英文虎報前總編輯 Mark Clifford、前港督彭定康 Chris Patten、Benedict Rogers、Jack Keane、前美國外交官 Raymond Burghardt、美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz、Natan Sharansky、美國記者兼時評作家 Nicholas Kristof 等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方列舉黎智英在節目中的言論，並在庭上播放影片。黎以英語形容《國安法》生效後香港會「玩完」，若果美國取消香港特殊地位的話，意味關上中國通向世界的窗口，中國會更易接受美國的要求，因此黎支持美國取消香港特殊地位，因在國安法下特殊地位變得無意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，歐洲國家應與美國聯合一起對付中國，制裁措施可以拖慢中國的通訊科技和晶片科技發展和研究，影響「華為」手機和中端科技（CTE）等企業。屆時台灣將會成為亞洲的科技樞紐，而中國則會逐漸衰退，最終使習近平讓步及立場軟化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎智英被捕後繼續辦節目-稱有機會被起訴勾結-籲海外人士繼續發聲&quot;&gt;控方指黎智英被捕後繼續辦節目 稱有機會被起訴勾結 籲海外人士繼續發聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年8月10日首次被拘捕，即使如此，黎在同月13日繼續舉行直播節目，並在 Twitter 稱「the show has to go on」。黎又在其後的節目中稱自己被捕一事顯示香港人正面對一個怎樣的政權，並批評香港政府隨意拘捕及是極權，猶如「俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在另一集節目，黎智英與 Benedict Rogers 對談時提到，他自己有機會被控告「勾結外國勢力」，所以海外人士的聲音變得重要，呼籲 Benedict Rogers 繼續堅持他的工作，並感謝他所做的工作，又形容國際社會是香港人的「救星」（savior）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月13日的節目中，前港督彭定康指中共是香港自由民主的威脅，如果想中國改變的話，要持續為香港勇敢走出來。有觀眾問國際社會可以做什麼，黎智英表示，民主派聲音將在立法會消失，意味國際社會可能再也聽不到香港的聲音，「香港可以講係喺窒息之中」，所以新聞很重要，可以令世界繼續留意香港並為香港發聲，「如果世界忘記咗我哋，就會好大鑊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在另一次節目中強調，不可以向中國認輸，而他現時與不同外國人士交流，面對被起訴「勾結外國勢力」的風險，但他必須堅持及繼續手上的工作。黎又提到，很多人崇拜他，使他肩負很多責任，一方面感到責任重大，另一方面感到振奮，因他有這樣的身位去做如此美妙的工作（wonderful thing），沒有放棄的理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱特朗普較難以捉摸-於中國而言比拜登更危險&quot;&gt;黎智英稱特朗普較難以捉摸 於中國而言比拜登更「危險」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在其後的集數中指，制裁不會帶來最大的破壞，最大的破壞是中美對立局面導致開戰，若果中美之間開戰的話，會帶來不確定性，最終沒有人敢來中國投資。不過黎指，若果美國與亞洲國家愈走愈近，最後孤立中國的話，便會削弱中國應對戰爭的力量，所以他認為未來中美不會開戰。另一個黎認為不會開戰的原因，是若果開戰的話，外國將不會運送石油給中國，而中國並未準備好開戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有聽眾問到海外人士在美國大選應怎樣做，黎智英則指對中國來說，特朗普（Donald Trump）比拜登（Joe Biden）更「危險」，因特朗普比較難以捉摸，認為他當選是很重要。黎在一集與彭定康對談時表示，對於拜登採取「多邊主義」外交手法並不抱希望，因各個國家對中國採取不同做法，導致削弱整體立場，籲拜登對中國強硬，又鼓勵海外人士游說外國官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦呼籲美國更多連繫太平洋亞洲，因他們是未來最大的經濟市場。就台灣局勢，黎形容美國是台灣的「國防後盾」（security backbone），無可避免地會提升軍事和經濟支援予台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方將繼續開案陳詞及播放「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。&lt;/p&gt;

Poring through the numerous senior-level engagements and outcome documents, the relationship largely remains in the “agenda-setting mode”. However, as indicated by the types of engagements and frequency — one can expect concrete outcomes soon. Notably, China remains a driving imperative behind U.S.-India strategic and commercial relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there were several tangible steps marking important shifts in U.S.-India relations. I have outlined five big events from the past year and underscored their larger implications. Additionally, I have also linked the work produced by the CSIS India Chair on the five subjects to provide additional detail. The events are not chronological but rather in the order of significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L6R77xc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GE Engine Deal, June 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited announced an agreement to co-produce the F-414 engine for India’s domestic “Tejas” light fighter. The two governments first announced plans to work towards co-production of jet engines in January 2015, but discussions soon died off.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; This agreement underscores growing U.S. trust in India, based on shared security concerns. Helping India improve defense production will also reduce India’s continued reliance on Russian-made defense equipment. This agreement also shows that ideas which may have failed a decade ago can be successfully revisited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dropping WTO Disputes, June 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington in June, the two governments agreed to drop six outstanding disputes before the World Trade Organization. The seventh and final dispute was dropped during President Biden’s visit to India in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; Trade policy remains one of the weakest areas of bilateral government engagement. While the two sides have made some progress in discussions over areas of strategically significant trade, general trade concerns fester. Utilizing leader-level summits to end disputes might be an “overkill,” but it shows growing recognition from both nations that improving commercial ties is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the relationship. However, as I noted in an earlier piece, despite the significance of the measures, a comprehensive framework akin to the Australian government’s 2018 India Economic Strategy would be momentous for bilateral commercial relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined Maritime Force Bahrain, November 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; While the American and Indian militaries regularly conduct exercises, there is a dearth of practical military cooperation. That changed at the India-U.S. 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in November, in Delhi when India announced it would join the 28-member “Combined Maritime Forces” naval partnership based in Bahrain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; India’s membership of the CMF provides a new, regularized venue for U.S.-India interoperability training. We may soon witness more regular joint security missions in the Gulf to counter piracy, smuggling, and other illicit operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York Assassination Attempt Indictment, November 2023:&lt;/strong&gt; As the year was nearing its close, U.S.-India relations were shook with the unsealing of an indictment in the Southern District of New York. The indictment alleged a plot outlining an Indian intelligence officer’s involvement in the attempted assassination of a Sikh separatist who is an American citizen. As this case moves ahead, there will likely be other closely watched moments that could alter the trajectory of U.S.-India ties&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; American policy circles are already replete with critics of India’s recent record in areas like religious tolerance and human rights. While the Biden Administration has chosen — so far — to press ahead on cooperation, the assassination attempt further strengthens these critics and raises fundamental questions about the depth of our “shared values.” As noted by my colleague Katherine Hadda, the United States’ approach to focus on a specific Indian official rather than implicating the entire government is pragmatic. Most likely, reasonable action from India in response to these allegations will suffice to maintain the relationship’s momentum. However, the event adds uncertainty to the relationship. Other steps by the Modi government that shrink the civil society space can further move these currents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steep Drop in FDI:&lt;/strong&gt; Media reports of significant investments by foreign technology firms into India engenders the feeling that “Make in India,” paired with increased trade pressure on China, has finally started to build momentum. However, the government of India’s own data proves otherwise. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monthly Bulletin data, India saw a 27 percent year-on-year drop in 12-month foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow (new equity) and a 43 percent drop in FDI inflow from the mid-2021 peak. World Bank data shows manufacturing stuck at around 13 percent of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). One major potential investor, Foxconn, dropped its massive $20 billion chip venture with Vedanta this summer. However, there are some “green shoots” that foreign investment might finally be shifting back towards India — including a healthy $6.5 billion new equity inflow in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Significance:&lt;/em&gt; There are a multitude of reasons that the FDI into India has declined. First, there has been a significant slowdown in new reforms during the Modi government’s second term, as indicated by our own “India Reforms Scorecard.” Second, too few state governments are aggressively pursuing foreign investment. Third, regulatory shifts occur quite often. Finally, dozens of sectors still have foreign investment restrictions including both sectoral FDI caps as well as stringent operational regulations that only apply to foreign companies. U.S.-India cooperation on boosting Indian manufacturing will be mutually advantageous. For instance, my colleague Raymond Vickery, notes that the signing of the U.S.-India Memorandum of Understanding on Semiconductor Supply Chain and Innovation will allow the two countries to the identify complementary competencies, and prevent unrequited competition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming year is replete with promises and pitfalls. National elections in both India and the United States could trigger shifts in foreign policy and economic policymaking. New revelations related to the attempted murder case in New York may provide new fuel to the relationship’s critics. Additionally, the United States’ and India’s differing approaches to the elections in Bangladesh will underscore geostrategic divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we can expect the several workstreams outlined above to bear fruit. Senior-level engagements provide action-forcing events — with great urgency over time as China increases its dangerous activities across the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the words of the author Karl Schroeder, “Foresight is not about predicting the future, it’s about minimizing surprise”. We may not know every significant in 2024 that will influence the relationship, but the high level of dialogue between the United States and Indian governments is reason for cautious optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第4日審訊。3名《國安法》指定法官上月裁定煽動刊物罪無逾時檢控後，黎今早庭上答辯，否認3項控罪。之後控方讀出開案陳詞，指黎智英是本案「主腦」，對《蘋果日報》的運作有完全的控制權，他曾指示下屬開設英文版，以圖尋求外國制裁中國及香港特區官員。控方又指黎在《國安法》生效之前，已開始與不同的外國官員及非政府組織人士聯絡、會面，尋求實施制裁、封鎖及敵對行動，至今共有42名中國及香港特區官員被制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;76歲的黎智英身穿白色恤衫、藍色西裝褸，由數名懲教人員帶往被告欄應訊，他面帶笑容、神情愉悅地與妻子及兒女打招呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認一項發布煽動刊物及兩項串謀勾結外國勢力罪-另一項勾結外力罪則存檔法庭&quot;&gt;黎否認一項發布煽動刊物及兩項串謀勾結外國勢力罪 另一項勾結外力罪則存檔法庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在上月開審首天，辯方爭議串謀煽動刊物罪逾時檢控，3名《國安法》指定法官聽畢控辯雙方陳詞後，裁定法庭在檢控期限屆滿10日之前收到控方通知擬加控罪，所以認為不存在逾時檢控的情況，因此駁回辯方申請，換言之控方就煽動刊物罪的檢控仍然有效。今天辯方向法庭申請釐清相關裁決，指稱控罪時段應縮短至10日，即2021年6月14至24日，惟3名法官認為辯方是提出新理據並意圖重啟爭議，最終拒絕申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;接著4名被告在庭上答辯。黎智英否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物罪」及一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司派出一名代表，該人士代表3間公司同樣否認上述兩罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。他另面對的一項「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，控方則申請存檔於法庭，獲法庭批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方形容黎為激進的政治人物-是案中主腦&quot;&gt;控方形容黎為「激進的政治人物」 是案中主腦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作開案陳詞，指本案關於一名「激進的政治人物」，激起市民對中央及特區政府的憎恨，以及勾結外國勢力以對中國及香港特區實施制裁、封鎖及敵對行動，危害國家安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英是3項控罪的主腦，並與政治倡議團體「Stand with Hong Kong, Fight for Freedom」一同串謀犯案。在案發時期，《蘋果日報》一共發布了161篇具煽動性文章，其中31篇在2020年7月1日《國安法》實施之後發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱，早在《國安法》於2020年7月生效之前，黎智英已開始支持或提出請求外國勢力向中央及特區政府實施制裁或封鎖。據《蘋果日報》報導，黎智英於2019年7月與時任美國副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧及美國參議員等人會面，討論《逃犯條例》修訂，當黎被問到美國可以做什麼時，黎曾提出制裁中國及香港官員，讓他們知道有何後果。控方指，上述顯示《蘋果日報》被利用作為平台提倡制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎智英與多名外籍人士聯絡-導致42名中港官員受制裁&quot;&gt;控方指黎智英與多名外籍人士聯絡 導致42名中港官員受制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，從2020年7月1日《國安法》實施起，至2021年2月15日陳梓華被拘捕，黎與 Mark Simon 和陳梓華等人一同串謀勾結外國勢力。控方在庭上屏幕展示人物關係圖，其中 Mark Simon 是黎智英的私人助理，二人均在 WhatsApp 群組「DC Dems」及 Signal 群組「Jimmy Mark」。其他涉案人士包括前美國陸軍上將 Jack Keane、前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz、前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）、「香港監察」創辦人 Benedict Rogers 及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」行政總監 Luke de Pulford 等，控方指部份人加入上述兩個通訊群組，亦會與黎智英「一對一」聯絡及電郵。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，事實上不同的制裁措施的確有實施，至今共有42名中國及香港特區官員被制裁，審訊期間將會傳召香港城市大學法律學院教授王貴國就此作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指擬傳召4名前蘋果高層出庭作供-其中3名為同案被告&quot;&gt;控方指擬傳召4名前蘋果高層出庭作供 其中3名為同案被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就煽動刊物和涉及蘋果高層的串謀勾結外國勢力罪，控方將會依賴同案被告張劍虹、陳沛敏、楊清奇，以及未被起訴的前營運總監兼行政總裁周達權的證供，以證明串謀犯罪協議的存在，以及相關串謀協議乃源自黎智英的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方邀請法庭考慮相關串謀是持續性的，亦邀請法庭考慮黎智英在2020年5月開設了個人 Twitter 帳戶，作為顯示意圖的「外顯行為（Overt act）」。此外，控方依賴22篇黎智英個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」的評論文章、一段訪問影片，以及24段網上直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」影片，題為「Live Q&amp;amp;A with Jimmy Lai」。控方亦會依賴黎智英接受外國傳媒訪問及 Twitter 帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎智英指示開設英文版-以圖尋求外力制裁&quot;&gt;控方：黎智英指示開設英文版 以圖尋求外力制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，《蘋果日報》於1995年1月根據《本地報刊註冊條例》註冊，直至2021年6月24日停運之前，《蘋果日報》一直是香港廣泛流通的報紙，無論實體報紙還是網站均有影響力。《蘋果》亦開設社交媒體包括 Facebook、Twitter 和 YouTube 。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月25日，黎智英指示《蘋果》開設英文版，以圖尋求外力向中央及香港政府實施制裁，並發布了一篇文章題為「打國際線 蘋果英文版免費試睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方提及社長與總編輯等各人角色-黎智英對蘋果運作有完全控制權&quot;&gt;控方提及社長與總編輯等各人角色 黎智英對《蘋果》運作有「完全控制權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就各人在案中角色，控方指黎智英為串謀犯罪的主腦，對《蘋果日報》的運作有完全的控制權，他會向編輯發出指示以執行日常運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹於案發時為《蘋果日報》社長，負責公司的整體運作，以及報紙的出版及發行。陳沛敏則是副社長，是實體報紙日常運作的決策人，亦撰寫評論文章，刊於專欄「堆填生活」。羅偉光是《蘋果日報》的總編輯，負責編輯工作及擔任《蘋果》網上平台的決策人。而林文宗是執行總編輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮偉光是英文版網站的編輯，並會以筆名「盧峯」撰寫評論文章。楊清奇是《蘋果日報》的主筆，負責撰寫社論，以及尋找適合的時評作者供稿。楊自己亦以筆名「李平」撰寫評論文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英作為「飯盒會」的主席，平日會與陳沛敏、張劍虹、羅偉光、林文宗及楊清奇一同討論《蘋果日報》及其網上平台的編採方向。黎亦撰寫評論文章，刊於其專欄「成敗樂一笑」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指simon-lee於海外管理黎的twitter帳戶&quot;&gt;控方指Simon Lee於海外管理黎的Twitter帳戶&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於利世民（Simon Lee）則負責管理黎智英的Twitter 帳戶，黎的帳戶於2020年5月發布首則帖文，但《國安法》生效後，利已經停止管理黎的帳戶，直至他離港後再次恢復相關工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周達權案發時則為《蘋果日報》的營運總監，亦是壹傳媒管理服務有限公司的財務總裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師 Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。警方國安處總警司李桂華則坐在律政司團隊後排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第4日審訊。控方早上開始作開案陳詞，指黎智英掌控《蘋果日報》的運作，為案中主腦，並且在《國安法》實施之前便著手聯絡外國官員。下午控方在庭上展示時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西 Twitter 截圖，顯示黎於2019年10月曾聯同民主黨創黨主席李柱銘一同見面。庭上播放多段黎智英接受採訪的片段，他提及香港反修例是「最後一戰」，非常需要「外國勢力」的支持，以改變中國乃至世界，又促請美國向中國實施制裁，「我相信特朗普是一個守信用的人」。控方亦展示黎與蘋果副社長陳沛敏的對話，二人曾討論制裁名單，並提及「賣港賊」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方籲法庭考慮社會騷亂背景-蘋果頭版籲上街&quot;&gt;控方籲法庭考慮社會騷亂背景 蘋果頭版籲上街&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方邀請法庭採取司法認知（judicial notice），自2019年6月反修例運動開始，本港處於社會動亂及暴力事件頻繁發生的時期。在這段期間，《蘋果日報》刊登了題為《黎智英：倘修例傳媒冇得做》的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而在政府宣布暫緩修訂後，報紙頭版題為「惡法擬暫緩但不撤、遊行前夕、林鄭緩兵、明天照上街」。同年7月1日更有示威者闖入立法會大樓。政府其後於2019年9月4日宣布撤回修訂條例草案，報紙頭版則以「Freedom Summer」作為英語標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方庭上播片-稱黎智英多次與外國官員會面接受外媒訪問-談及制裁&quot;&gt;控方庭上播片 稱黎智英多次與外國官員會面、接受外媒訪問 談及制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在《國安法》實施前，黎智英已多次與外國官員會談、接受外國媒體訪問以及在美國報紙撰寫文章。控方展示黎與美國、英國及台灣連繫的時間表，時間由2016年開始至2020年。控方亦在庭上播放8段黎智英與外國官員會談、接受外國或台灣媒體訪問的片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著簡述黎智英與外國官員等人的關係。於2019年7月9日，《蘋果》刊登文章《蓬佩奧晤黎智英》。同月，黎會見美國國家安全顧問博爾頓。黎其後在何俊仁主持的網台節目《細說中南海》擔任嘉賓。《蘋果》網站報導黎在節目中的言論，包括：「黑社會文化就是要讓人恐懼、用暴力打低對方，跟共產黨如出一轍」，又指控中央政府管治下的社會是「恐懼社會」而不是「自由社會」。對於721白衣人襲擊事件，黎亦表示：「今次恐襲必須交由國際機構如聯合國或英美等國家，作公開的獨立調查。」他其後稱：「反送中行動發展至今，越來越需要國際支持」，報導提及「（黎）早前與美國國務卿會面時，對方問他：『美國可以怎樣做？』」，黎認為美國可以實施制裁，令中國官員可以知道後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當美國在2019年8月開始提出《香港人權及民主法案》時，黎智英與香港民主委員會一同呼籲美國支持，並對香港及中國政府實施制裁。控方庭上展示時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）的 Twitter 截圖，顯示2019年10月與黎智英和民主黨創黨主席李柱銘等人會面。影片顯示同年10月25日，黎與李柱銘出席時任美國副總統彭斯的專題演講，黎發言指，以人道方式解決香港問題是貿易戰的重要考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上展示黎智英與陳沛敏對話截圖-討論賣港賊制裁名單&quot;&gt;庭上展示黎智英與陳沛敏對話截圖 討論「賣港賊」制裁名單&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於2019年10月及2020年3月，黎指示員工取消公司的「飯盒會」，因他需要出席由 Mark Simon 所安排的美國參議員會面。控方亦展示雙方合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月，《壹傳媒》前副社長陳沛敏告知黎智英，政府或會提出《國安法》。黎及後於 Twitter 發文，附有一張政協委員手持「支持國安立法 護航一國兩制」橫額的圖片，並在帖文寫道：「美國政府是否應該將他們納入制裁名單？」，同時標籤「#MagnitskyAct （馬格尼茨基法）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方庭上展示黎智英與蘋果副社長陳沛敏之間的 WhatsApp 對話內容，當中顯示二人討論制裁名單，提及「賣港賊」字眼。黎智英又向陳提及，希望警察為他們所犯的罪行付上代價。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎智英與楊清奇之間的通訊對話內容，顯示楊向黎報告再有多兩名作者可供稿給《蘋果日報》英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎形容香港在新冷戰前線-籲美國以行動支持-包括派人來港&quot;&gt;黎形容香港在「新冷戰」前線 籲美國以行動支持 包括派人來港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年7月，黎智英與時任美國副總統彭斯及其他資深參議員會面。控方又展示 WhatsApp 對話截圖，顯示同年3月李柱銘和陳方安生與彭斯見面後，黎向李表示現在似乎是在美國華盛頓游說的好時機，因現時氣氛「反中」和支持抗爭，美國兩黨對中國的敵對行動是顯而易見的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，黎智英於2019年7月曾與「保衛民主基金會」的資深副主席 Johnathan Schanzer 進行現場對談。黎強調反修例是「最後一戰」，而香港人的反抗是道德力量的戰爭，又指美國政府是道德權威，其支持是有力量的武器，因此香港極需要美國支持，否則香港缺乏持續反抗的能力。黎形容「新冷戰」是關乎價值的鬥爭，而香港正在「前線」，他最後指，美國不能只說不做，同時亦要以行動支持香港人，包括派人員來港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指有效方法是凍結中國官員戶口&quot;&gt;黎指有效方法是凍結中國官員戶口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與 Mark Simon 之間的對話截圖，2019年7月 Mark Simon 轉述時任美國國務院高級顧問 Mary Kissel 的要求，指屆時黎與副總統彭斯會面時，可提出建議美國可就香港局勢採取什麼行動，包括制裁的時機及對象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The arrest of @JimmyLaiApple in Hong Kong is deeply offensive &amp;amp; an affront to freedom loving people around the world.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英另在 Signal 中向 Mark Simon 指，經深思熟慮後認為美國應該取消香港特殊地位，因為若美國與中國脫鉤，當香港這個唯一出路都關上後，便會逼使中國滿足美國的要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英亦於2020年3月至7月與 Mark Simon 以電郵通訊，並提及最有效的方法是凍結中國官員的戶口，他們就會感到害怕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎於台灣節目稱外國支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去&quot;&gt;黎於台灣節目稱：外國支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎於2020年4月接受英國《金融時報》（Financial Times）訪問，談及唯一能阻止中國及拯救香港的就是國際力量。另於同年5月，黎接受台灣 YouTube 頻道《Yahoo TV 一起看》的節目「鄉民來衝康」訪問，他表示：「我很想美國影響我們⋯⋯我很想英國影響我們⋯⋯我很想外國影響我們⋯⋯他們的支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去的⋯⋯外國的勢力是現在我們非常需要⋯⋯讓我們撐下去的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎多次接受英美媒體訪問-表示相信特朗普守信用會制裁中國&quot;&gt;黎多次接受英美媒體訪問 表示：相信特朗普守信用、會制裁中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於2020年5月，黎智英接受美國媒體《福斯財經》（Fox Business）訪問，他其後在 Twitter 轉載有關片段。他在訪問中提到：「是時候改變中國，這樣才能改變世界⋯⋯除非中國改變，否則我們不會有和平。」他亦指美國可採用很多途徑逼使中國改變，包括凍結中國的戶口及其於美國的金錢，同時停止出口科技及電子產品到中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同月，黎接受美國《彭博》（Bloomberg）訪問，他建議美國總統特朗普向中國實施制裁，並引述特朗普稱若北京確實在香港實行《國安法》並摧毀法律，他會認真採取行動。黎接着指：「我相信特朗普是一個守信用的人，因此希望他會向中國實施制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦接受《BBC》訪問，再次促請特朗普對中國實施制裁，並解釋一旦《國安法》實施，將會是香港的「末日」，因未能保護在港商人，而香港亦不再是國際金融中心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎籲撤銷中港官員子女在外地的學生簽證&quot;&gt;黎籲撤銷中港官員子女在外地的學生簽證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於2020年5月，黎撰寫文章表示：「我的 Twitter 帖文是否真的威脅到中國的國家安全？」他在文中呼籲，撤銷中國及香港政府官員子女在外地的學生簽證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦接受美國節目《Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson》的訪問，他指需要美國協助制裁中國，而本港的特別貿易待遇不應被撤銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎表示若實施制裁-有機會即使立國安法也不會執行&quot;&gt;黎表示若實施制裁 有機會即使立《國安法》也不會執行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年6月，黎智英接受《RFA 自由亞洲粵語》的訪問，他表示：「點都要抗爭，希望我哋有機會係美國、甚至歐洲其他國家支持下，我哋能夠保住法治同自由。」他又指：「而家中國處境唔係我哋覺得咁穩定⋯⋯李克強同習近平已經反晒面，你就知道佢哋下面嘅權鬥去到乜嘢地步」、「好緊要係外國盡量畀中國嘅壓力、制裁⋯⋯將中國專橫嘅做法阻擋住」。他認為外國若實施制裁，「有機會《國安法》就算立咗都唔會執行，或者執行都會將佢 water down（沖淡），唔會做到咁辣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰文指引渡惡法令大陸法律凌駕香港司法-並籲人參與遊行&quot;&gt;黎撰文指引渡惡法令大陸法律凌駕香港司法 並籲人參與遊行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎撰寫的文章方面，他在其專欄「成敗樂一笑」發表題為「請站出來保住最後防線」的文章，內容包括：「『引渡惡法』的作用，就像恐怖分子襲擊產生『可用性級聯』的效果，讓香港市民都被籠罩在恐慌的順民意識下，讓大陸無法無天的法律凌駕香港的司法制度。」他有提到：「修訂《逃犯條例》就是要摧毀『一國兩制』這個習帝的眼中釘⋯⋯『引渡惡法』就是讓中央的魔爪撕破《基本法》和一國兩制的最後防線。」他於文末呼籲：「請你們相信群眾的力量，加入今天反惡法的示威遊行吧！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一文章題為《諗移民定諗遊行》，內文指：『「逃犯條例」還可以隨時拉你鎖你，多神奇的權力，多神聖的地圖啊！」、「若我們人多勢眾站出來遊行⋯⋯」及「我們會去到盡，堅決抗爭到底的事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎另在文章《為自己和下一代 阻擋香港沉淪》表示：「你要跟中共講法律，你從火星來的嗎？」、「修訂逃犯條例就是奪去香港的法治，拿住大陸那套陽光司法在港任拉任鎖肆虐橫行」、「香港無形中成為了集中營」、「若我們今天還有機會行出來發聲，卻袖手旁觀」。他最後呼籲：「請看前一步，六月九號花三小時，為自己和下一代留下阻擋公義沉淪的足跡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎要求將陳方安生與美國副總統彭斯會面的消息散播&quot;&gt;黎要求將陳方安生與美國副總統彭斯會面的消息散播&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，黎於2019年3月通知《蘋果日報》的社長張劍虹，要求將陳方安生與副總統彭斯會面的消息散播開去，於是翌日的報紙以《彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權 學者：高規格接待向京施壓》為頭版標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年4月，黎指示副社長陳沛敏訪問「銅鑼灣書店」前店長林榮基，翌日的報紙題為《送中例殺埋身 林榮基流亡台灣 臨別呼籲 守護香港明日上街》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方開案陳詞未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英否認一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物罪」及一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司派出一名代表，該人士代表3間公司同樣否認上述兩罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪。他另面對的一項「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，控方則申請存檔於法庭，獲法庭批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one fact that sums up the gap between the promises that Kyiv’s European partners have made to Ukraine and the reality. In March 2023, the EU made the historic decision to deliver a million artillery shells to Ukraine within 12 months. But the number that has actually been sent is closer to 300,000. For all the rhetorical commitments to support Ukraine’s defence against Russia’s invasion “for as long as it takes”, Europe has largely failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price of this complacency is already being paid in Ukrainian blood. According to the armed forces of Ukraine, over the summer of 2023, Ukraine was firing up to 7,000 artillery shells a day and managed to degrade Russia’s logistics and artillery to the point where Russia was firing about 5,000 rounds a day. Today, the Ukrainians are struggling to fire 2,000 rounds daily, while Russian artillery is reaching about 10,000. Artillery isn’t everything, but the disparity speaks to Ukraine’s relative shortage of materiel, evident in other areas such as the number of drones it can field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is likely to be able to fire about 5m rounds at Ukraine in 2024, based on its mobilised defence production, supply from Iran and North Korea, and remaining stocks. Despite the flippant observation – often made by European officials – that Russia’s economy is the same size as that of Italy, the Kremlin is producing more shells than all of Nato. Meanwhile, Ukraine is unlikely to see any significant increase in supply for some months. This will cede the initiative to the Russians. The Kremlin believes it can win by 2026, and so Putin is in no mood to negotiate or back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not have to be like this. Earlier this month, the Estonian Ministry of Defence published a white paper detailing the levels of military equipment required to make Ukraine’s defence sustainable and for it to pursue the liberation of the occupied territories by 2025. The Estonians costed the requirements, showing they were well within the bounds of possibility. The issue is not money, but competence in delivery. If the steps to implement these measures are not taken, Ukraine will lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring Russia’s defeat in Ukraine is feasible, but it requires some important steps. First, Ukraine will need a steady supply of weapons to be able to blunt Russian attacks over the first half of 2024. This will require plenty of US support, but also increasing supply from European Nato members, whose backing will be critical as the US election looms in November. Many of the munitions provided since the beginning of the war were purchased from the international market or drawn from stockpiles, and investment in European production has been slow. But as stocks run out, sustaining Ukraine’s war effort depends critically on increasing Europe’s manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is essential that Ukraine corrects the mistakes that led to its failed counteroffensive in 2023. Improving the training of its troops must be the top priority. During the second world war, British forces considered 22 weeks of infantry training the minimum before a soldier was ready to join a unit, where they would then carry out collective training as part of a battalion. Ukrainian troops are lucky to get five weeks of training, while collective training is rarely carried out above the scale of the company. European Nato must expand and extend the training support provided in order to give Ukrainian units a wider tactical repertoire, and more importantly expand the scale at which the army can command and synchronise operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistent inflation and economic shocks, like the disruption to global shipping from Houthi missile attacks in the Bab al-Mandab, mean that among European countries, making a long-term economic commitment to Ukraine will be a domestic political challenge. But that is to ignore its potential upsides. Investment in defence production, rather than relying on purchases from abroad, comes with significant levels of domestic industrial investment and with the potential for expenditure to be recovered through increased tax receipts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are good security reasons to invest in domestic production, too. A failure to do so now could leave European leaders needing to deter a fully mobilised Russia without stockpiles or the capacity to replenish them. Meanwhile, a simultaneous escalation in the Indo-Pacific in 2025 could cause the US to shift a range of critical military capabilities – aerial refuelling, logistics, air defences – to deter China, leaving Europe significantly exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the immediate future is one of several months of hard fighting without critical resources, while endeavouring to regenerate the combat power that was expended over 2023. But Europe can determine what the second half of 2024 and indeed 2025 will look like. This is a war that can be won. The recent successful strike on the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk in harbour, protected by layers of Russian defences, shows how Ukraine can make effective use of the equipment that it is supplied with.

  &lt;li&gt;官裁煽動刊物罪非逾時檢控 去信法庭「提出告發」未等黎智英上庭 已屬啟動程序&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第3日審訊。就辯方所提出的串謀煽動刊物罪逾時檢控爭議，3名《國安法》指定法官作出裁決，指法庭在檢控期限屆滿10日之前收到控方通知擬加控罪，所以認為不存在逾時檢控的情況，因此駁回辯方申請，換言之控方就煽動刊物罪的檢控仍然有效。案件押後至明年1月2日續審，屆時黎將庭上答辯，之後控方將讀出開案陳詞。押後期間黎繼續還柙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;76歲的黎智英由3名懲教人員帶往被告欄應訊，近日氣溫降至只有10度或以下，黎亦穿上深藍色厚褸，並戴上灰色頸巾。他透過耳機聽取判決時表現平靜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱煽動刊物控罪逾時檢控期限應由串謀首天起計帶上法庭加控才算啟動檢控&quot;&gt;黎智英稱煽動刊物控罪逾時檢控：期限應由串謀首天起計、帶上法庭加控才算啟動檢控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英尚未正式就各項控罪答辯，在審訊首天，控辯雙方先處理法律爭議。黎的法律代表、資深大律師彭耀鴻指「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪逾時檢控，法庭無權處理。3名《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰及李素蘭頒下書面裁決，駁回辯方申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據判詞，黎智英在2021年12月13日被控3項罪名，包括兩項《國安法》控罪及一項串謀妨礙司法公正罪。控方在同日去信西九法院，表示有意申請新增「煽動刊物」控罪，而西九法院裁判官翌日收悉信件及相關文件，副本亦送達黎的法律代表。至12月28日的提訊日，控方申請加控，而黎的代表律師並未有提出反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指檢控期限應由串謀犯罪首日起計算6個月，即2019年10月1日便屆滿；即使辯方接受檢控期限由串謀犯罪的最後一天起計6個月，控方也需要在2021年12月24日或之前提出檢控，可是黎智英在12月28日才被帶上法庭加控，超出了期限4日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則稱「串謀」屬持續的罪行，被告在2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日《蘋果日報》結束營運期間，持續發布逾160篇煽動刊物，可視為同一犯罪計劃，檢控期限應由「串謀」結束當天、而非被告首次犯法起計。此外，控方稱他們於2021年12月13日向法庭表示有意加控，已屬「開始」檢控，故控方檢控並無逾時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;判決檢控期限應由最後一日起計算&quot;&gt;判決：檢控期限應由最後一日起計算&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，不接受辯方稱檢控期限由首天串謀起計，因為控方現時指控黎不只一次串謀犯罪，與一次性的串謀罪行並不相同，所以被告完成首天串謀犯罪之後，串謀協議仍然存在（still be very much alive），直至串謀完結當天，控罪並不會「過時」（stale）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，只要控方有足夠證據證明有一個串謀協議貫穿整個控罪時段，那麼檢控期限便應由串謀的最後一天才開始計算，不會對被告帶來不公。就本案而言，法官裁定檢控期限應由2021年6月24日起計6個月，因此於2021年12月24日才屆滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官條文引入提出檢控是為統一字眼-原意非改變條文內容&quot;&gt;官：條文引入「提出」檢控是為統一字眼 原意非改變條文內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《刑事罪行》條例第11(1)條規定，煽動控罪的檢控，「只可於犯罪後6個月內開始進行。」第11(2)條亦規定，未經律政司司長書面同意，不得就煽動控罪提出檢控。沒有爭議條文目的是要確保相關檢控及時，而不會起訴「過時」的罪行。上述兩項條文首次寫進煽動罪條例以及生效是1938年9月2日。至1972年12月31日，煽動罪條例合併入《刑事罪行條例》，經修訂後成為第11(1)及(2)條，而「提出檢控」中的「提出（instituted）」此時首次出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，從上述過程可以推論，立法機關之所以在《刑事罪行條例》中引入「提出（instituted）」一詞，原意是對於所有需要首席檢察官（Attorney General）同意而檢控的罪行統一用字，而不是有意改變條文內容。直至1997年香港主權移交，條文中的「首席檢察官」修訂為「律政司司長」，除此之外便沒有任何其他修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官當控方提出告發檢控程序便算開始&quot;&gt;官：當控方「提出告發」檢控程序便算開始&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，沒有爭議「煽動罪」是可公訴的罪行（indictable offence），受《裁判官條例》第三部管轄，考慮《裁判官條例》第8及27條有關「申訴」或「告發」的字眼，法官認為不論在公訴程序或簡易程序中，當控方「提出告發（laying of an information）」，檢控程序便算是開始，而毋須等到被告人出庭應訊或帶上法庭才算開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《裁判官條例》第2條的定義，「告發（information）」意思包括「控告」。而第75(1)條規定「任何指稱有人犯了可公訴罪行的申訴或告發，均須以書面提出，並須載有或包含有指稱已犯罪行的陳述，以及為提供有關該項罪行性質的合理資料的所需詳情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案而言，法官認為西九法院裁判官在2021年12月14日收妥控方的信件、控罪詳情及相關文件後，毫無疑問地已充份地構成「提出告發」，符合第75(1)條的要求。而控方一旦提出了告發，便毋須做額外功夫，檢控程序已算是啟動。（“The information once so laid, no more was required of the prosecutor and the prosecution had ‘begun’.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方提出告發後，裁判官可以發出拘捕令把被告人帶上法庭，或簽發傳票要求被告人自行到庭應訊，不論是哪一種的上庭方式，它們只是為了被告能被帶到裁判官席前的程序，是法庭的事務，與控方無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，雖然《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)及(2)條分別使用「開始（begun）」及「提出（instituted）」，字眼不同，但是兩者均指向相同的東西。判決又提到，兩項條文目的是保障被告人，若果立法機關有意賦予兩詞不同意思，理應提供兩詞各自的釋義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;倘被告留院或不在港-致未能及時檢控-法官不接受辯方稱不應受審&quot;&gt;倘被告留院或不在港 致未能及時檢控 法官不接受辯方稱不應受審&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決又指，辯方堅稱只有當被告人上庭應訊及面對控罪時，檢控程序才算啟動，會導致令人驚訝（surprising）的結果。法官曾在庭上問及，若然被告人留院、不在香港或潛逃，以致未能趕及在檢控期限之內上庭應訊呢？辯方則回答在如此情況下，被告人便不應就控罪受審，因他未能在檢控期限屆滿之前上庭。法官表示不接受辯方說法，因這不是立法原意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D33tRay.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判決指，第11(1)及(2)條處理檢控程序的不同範疇，第11(2)條從控方角度出發，即提出告發者，並聚焦檢控須經律政司司長同意，以免濫用程序；第11(1)條則從法庭作為接收告發者的角度出發，以確保控方乃及時檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;總括而言，法官認為西九法庭於2021年12月14日，即檢控期限10日之前，已收妥控方通知及有關煽動控罪的資料，故此檢控並沒有超出期限，遂駁回辯方的申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告為：黎智英（76歲）、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師Marc Corlett、關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及李峰琦。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。警方國安處總警司李桂華則坐在律政司團隊後排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案8名被告：前行政總裁張劍虹、前總編輯羅偉光、前副社長陳沛敏、前執行總編輯林文宗、前英文主筆馮偉光、前主筆楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華，早前已承認「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，現正還柙，等待黎智英審訊完畢後判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia, as a country which borders Russia and has ambitions to join the EU, is in a difficult geopolitical situation. The raft of sanctions that the EU and allies have imposed on Russia therefore raises serious questions for Tbilisi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an EU candidate country, Georgia is expected to align with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which includes the numerous restrictive measures imposed on Russia. However, with 20% of its territory – Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali region or South Ossetia – under Russian occupation, Georgia faces the challenge of striking a balance. On the one hand, it has sympathy and solidarity with Ukraine given the Russian occupation. On the other, it wants to avoid actions that lead to further Russian aggression against Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI, in collaboration with the Regional Institute of Security Studies (RISS), hosted a series of roundtable discussions in Tbilisi with Georgian authorities and representatives from the private sector and civil society. The aim of these discussions was to obtain insights into Georgia’s position on the international sanctions against Russia and the current Georgian efforts, within their national jurisdiction, to prevent circumvention and evasion. This engagement is part of the European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;georgias-approach-to-financial-sanctions-against-russia&quot;&gt;Georgia’s Approach to Financial Sanctions Against Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 25 February 2022, the government of Georgia announced its decision not to implement international sanctions against Russia. However, in reality, Tbilisi’s approach to sanctions is far more complex. Alignment with the EU’s CFSP is important for Georgia’s EU candidacy status and the country’s connections to global markets and correspondent banking relations effectively mandate compliance with these restrictions. Under these conditions, without the introduction of any new laws in Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) instructed the country’s financial sector to comply with the sanctions imposed by the US, the EU and the UK. To support compliance in the sector, the NBG has a dedicated anti-money laundering (AML) department that is liaising with banks on sanctions and conducts inspections in relation to sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the NBG highlighted that businesses in Georgia have boosted their resources dedicated to sanctions and are increasingly adopting programmes to check and identify sanctions issues. The NBG representative noted that they are aware of the complex rules and licences related to the monitoring of goods and services under restrictions, as well the cost of compliance for the private sector. Although businesses seek support from the NBG, Georgia’s central bank faces the challenge of responding to questions about foreign sanctions regimes over which it has no control, and no insight beyond what is on the relevant sanctions coalition websites. For this reason, the NBG intends to guide the private sector in the right direction but informs financial institutions that they must assess their own risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from Georgia’s Banking Association expressed its satisfaction with the performance of the banking sector on sanctions, due to the effectiveness of AML and sanctions procedures that the industry has in place. However, the participant noted that several banks operating in Georgia are part of regional banking groups in countries that are not implementing sanctions, such as Turkey, Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan. This creates risk. The Banking Association representative added that the services of VISA and Mastercard credit cards of Russian banks in Georgia had been suspended to comply with international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Bank of Georgia (BOG) also described its limited risk appetite for customers from Russia and transactions related to the country – these are now subject to enhanced due diligence procedures. The BOG, one of the main banks in Georgia with 2.5 million customers, is listed on the London Stock Exchange, so it is under the supervision of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and therefore is required to comply with UK (and wider international) sanctions against Russia. The BOG currently has two co-directors – one for general financial crime issues and another oversees the sanctions programmes – in its compliance department, as well as 80 employees in the “second line of defence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the number of suspicious transaction reports in Georgia has increased. Participants explained that the financial sector has expanded its criteria of high-risk activities to include: international transactions; transactions in US dollars; high-net-worth individuals; and jurisdictions under suspicion of facilitating sanctions evasion, among others. Georgia has taken significant steps to mitigate risks of breaching international sanctions, for example, the Tbilisi City Hall terminated the almost $50 million-contract for 44 subway cars for the Tbilisi Metro, that was agreed with the EU-sanctioned Russian company Metrovagonmash. However, private sector representatives noted that while businesses will not trade with a company that raises clear red flags, the emerging challenge is around companies that pose “yellow flags”. To ensure compliance in Georgia, correspondent banks now ask Georgian banks about their transaction monitoring systems, their automated alerts systems, the percentage of false alerts generated, the number of transactions rejected, and the resources allocated to effectively check these procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;when-sanctions-come-home-the-case-of-otar-partskhaladze&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;When Sanctions Come Home: The Case of Otar Partskhaladze&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As many participants in the workshops noted, the topic of Russia sanctions is highly politicised. Nothing illustrates this more than the case of Georgian citizen, businessman and former prosecutor Otar Partskhaladze, who was sanctioned by the US in September 2023.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Partskhaladze and two companies of which he owned a majority were sanctioned for allegedly facilitating malign Russian influence in Georgia led by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), and personally profiting from his FSB connection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2023, in line with a change in the law that had been criticised by the IMF and other experts as damaging the NBG’s independence, a new governor was appointed. Following the designation of Partskhaladze, the newly appointed governor, Natia Turnava, issued an executive order that required a local court order before the assets of a Georgian national could be frozen under international sanctions. This overturned the NBG’s previous position that banks should implement Russia sanctions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Among other implications of this decision, the IMF suspended its programme for Georgia over its concerns for the independence of the central bank.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Georgia’s financial sector has, in effect, complied with international sanctions, trade with Russia has continued to increase. This poses numerous challenges to tackling circumvention through Georgia. The following section looks more closely at the state of trade restrictions in Georgia and the related insights provided by participants at the workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade-restrictions-between-georgia-and-russia&quot;&gt;Trade Restrictions Between Georgia and Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is Georgia’s third-largest trade partner, with 11.1% of Georgian exports going to Russia. Georgia has clearly stated that it will not implement trade sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Georgian authorities emphasised that Georgia is one of the main partners of the EU and the US in the region. While the combined EU market is Georgia’s main trade partner, the share is gradually decreasing. Georgian businesses understand the importance of the EU market and are motivated to increase their trade relations, but they require support from the EU to promote investment in the country to support trade decoupling from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised that the complexity of monitoring supply chains makes it futile for international partners to tackle circumvention unilaterally. Georgian authorities stressed the resources they are allocating to supporting international partners, prioritising the list of 45 high-priority items, and they find discussions on secondary sanctions frustrating. To facilitate compliance, authorities also highlighted their interest in obtaining consolidated sanctions lists from the international coalition, given the costs of monitoring all the lists independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to participating authorities, since the beginning, Georgia conveyed to international partners that it would support their aims of preventing circumvention. Authorities noted that half of their capacity is currently focused on sanctions implementation, identifying banned EU goods bound for Russia and the parties involved in their trade. They also noted that the closure of trade borders with the EU via the Baltic states has led to a notable displacement of trade transit through Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One side-effect of the introduction of international sanctions on Russia is that Georgia has become a regional re-export hub for used cars from the EU and the US. Both Brussels and Washington have demanded Georgia cease this trade with Russia. In August 2023, Georgia agreed to introduce this ban on the re-export of Western cars to Russia. However, participants at the workshop explained that this action has simply created another layer in the circumvention route. Georgia remains part of the supply chain, but cars are now first transported to Kazakhstan and are likely re-exported again to Russia, despite efforts to identify the real end-user. A further complication is the export of the spare car parts, given their dual-use nature. For their export, Customs requires official letters from manufactures on where these parts are going and how they will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, participants highlighted the circumvention challenge Georgia faces as a trading partner with the Eurasian Economic Union, a mechanism that Russia is increasingly using to obfuscate the destination of trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgian authorities were concerned that the focus of sanctions discussions is dominated by financial integrity, neglecting the key role played by trade integrity, particularly when considering Georgia’s geographic location. Trade integrity requires a combination of export control capacity and trade transparency, which demands good customs communication channels between exporting and importing countries and capacity to monitor the supply chains. This system depends on the reporting information provided by the private sector, but businesses do not have the capacity to identify everything related to sanctions and thus information is incomplete. This is particularly true in the non-financial sector, which participants described as notably less experienced in sanctions implementation. Representatives from the private sector explained that while no meetings have been arranged with authorities to support sanctions implementation, a good cross-sector relationship exists whereby businesses can approach authorities to receive guidance and training when required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve its domestic controls, Georgia has received technical and capacity-building training from EU member states. The Ministry of Finance reported that as of 8 November 2023, Georgia had stopped 2,970 containers and denied 1,683 applications from companies to conduct operations related to goods and services subject to restrictions. As a small jurisdiction, the Georgian authorities see these numbers as a sign of success. However, they raised frustrations with the time it takes the EU or the US to respond to queries about trucks stopped at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgian authorities at the roundtable also share the concern expressed by international partners regarding the involvement of Russia’s Federal Security Service (the FSB) in establishing front companies in third countries. Investigations into FSB-facilitated circumvention schemes are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of land-based exports from Georgia to Russia – which some participants suggested might be complicated by the development of a north–south trade corridor between Iran and Russia – continues to attract international attention. However, Georgian authorities pointed to an overlooked yet significant challenge that they face: monitoring maritime transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenges-of-maritime-trade&quot;&gt;The Challenges of Maritime Trade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitoring land-based trade is a complex and resource-consuming effort for Georgia. Detecting banned goods transported in trucks at the border with Russia and identifying the real end-user of the products is a challenging task. Alongside this task, Georgia also has access to the Black Sea and monitoring maritime trade entering and leaving its ports presents significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia’s Maritime Transport Agency is monitoring vessels and their cargo to prevent the circumvention of international sanctions. Representatives from the agency described the challenge that the small six-hour vessel inspection window poses. Authorities must operate within this period, and delays in obtaining the necessary answers from the beneficial owners of vessels can be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative of the Maritime Transport Agency explained that, between August and September 2022, several companies wanted to re-flag their vessels with the Georgian flag, but they were identified to be Russian so Georgia denied their requests. Still, a major challenge the Agency faces in this regard is the presence of vessels with flags from non-cooperative jurisdictions. Georgian authorities try to communicate with the reported beneficial owners in these jurisdictions – notably British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean – but often fail to establish contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia also faces a unique challenge on maritime trade through the ports of Russian-occupied Abkhazia. Georgia monitors trade through these ports but has no control over this activity. Georgian authorities track vessels in Abkhazia that involve suspicious beneficial owners and offshore jurisdictions and shares these reports with international partners. Authorities described how the vessels that Georgia tracks from Russia to Abkhazia go to Turkish ports to obfuscate their origin. By visiting Turkish ports, they can obtain the necessary papers to then access EU ports and thus circumvent sanctions. Georgian authorities expressed their dissatisfaction with the scarce support received from the EU and the US on this concern, a view consistent with their wider frustration on support received for implementing trade-related sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-russian-inflows-of-people-and-money-into-georgia&quot;&gt;Impact of Russian Inflows (of People and Money) into Georgia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final point emerged from the workshop on the unique challenge of geography and the resulting incoming flows of Russian citizens and investment. Participants noted that Georgia gets economic benefits from the increasing numbers of Russian citizens coming into the country and opening businesses. Tourism from Russian nationals has increased, and new Russian-owned businesses have opened in the country, notably in the IT industry. But participants also agreed that this presents security risks for Georgia. Real estate market prices in Georgia have doubled and participants described the IT industry as posing particular risks in terms of sanctions, given that these services are banned in the EU and US but can now operate from Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while these booming economic sectors generate wealth in the country, participants were concerned about the negative impact their sudden departure would have on Georgia’s economy should they leave immediately the war is over. Moreover, participants added that these new businesses are competing with existing Georgian businesses, with resulting impacts on business opportunities and/or recruitment. One interesting observation related to Russian tourism is that Russian nationals are setting up tourist guides that Georgian authorities fear may be spreading pro-Russian propaganda as part of their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is a visibly divisive topic in Georgia, which, participants assert, is fuelled by mis/disinformation. Pro-Russian media pushes a narrative on the ineffectiveness of sanctions on the Russian economy and their negative impact on the sanctioning country’s population, while opposing media focuses on the scandal, noted earlier in this report, around the former prosecutor. Georgian media also focuses on how Georgia is economically dependent on trade with Russia and the aforementioned Russian inflows. These dependencies are made more acute by the lack of EU trade growth. Participants disagreed with these views and added that economic ties with Russia are not critical to Georgia’s economic security, having survived a direct war with Russia, although participants did share their concerns over Russia’s influence on Georgia’s critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Georgian government chose not to implement sanctions against Russia and the lack of a relevant national law has provided an opportunity for it to make some questionable decisions (such as the case of Partskhaladze and the NBG). However, the insights provided by both public and private sector participants at the recent workshops reflect the solid efforts of the Georgian authorities to prevent circumvention and evasion from happening through its jurisdiction. In doing so, Georgian authorities face similar challenges to those found across EU member states. Participants agreed on the following list of recommendations to improve Georgia’s ability to support relevant elements of the international sanctions regime against Russia by tackling circumvention:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a dedicated government sanctions unit.&lt;/strong&gt; While several departments and agencies consider sanctions, Georgia’s response would benefit from greater coordination that could be achieved by establishing a national sanctions coordination unit that can draw on relevant expertise from across the public and private sectors. This unit could also highlight where new legislation is needed to ensure the integrity of EU sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote trade transparency.&lt;/strong&gt; Integrity and transparency are essential in trade. This must be supported by the quality and accessibility of data regarding beneficial ownership, as well as the availability of information-sharing channels to ensure a robust framework and facilitate investigations to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue providing international support to Georgia.&lt;/strong&gt; Georgian authorities appear committed to preventing the circumvention of international sanctions but, as in all jurisdictions implementing sanctions, the country requires substantial technical assistance support from international partners. The EU and its allies must ensure they provide sufficient and timely support to Georgia’s anti-circumvention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplify bureaucratic impediments for Georgia’s trade with the EU.&lt;/strong&gt; Georgian economic operators should see the EU as an accessible market. Entering and initiating trade with the EU should not be a complicated process. Facilitating smooth trade between the two jurisdictions will see Georgia’s trade shift from Russia towards the EU. As a share, trade with Russia is currently increasing and trade with the EU is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in EU/US–Georgia trade relations.&lt;/strong&gt; If Georgia is expected to further decouple from Russia, the EU and the US should encourage their businesses to invest in Georgia and expand trade links with the country. Participants explained that Georgian businesses understand that Russia is not a reliable partner, but if they are to reduce trade with Russia, they need to identify a sustainable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop discussions highlighted the challenges Georgia faces from both a trade and security perspective when considering the implementation of sanctions on Russia. While there is support for sanctions across the public and private sectors, Georgia clearly needs greater support in managing the related trade and security risks. The EU and allies must show that they understand Georgia’s security predicament. Russia’s intention to hold a referendum to annex the occupied territories in Georgia – as it did in Ukraine – can be reactivated any time, creating a sense of vulnerability in Georgia. Georgia is a strategic partner for the West in the region and thus its national interests, particularly related to trade, should be taken into consideration to foster heightened commitment to the implementation of sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指黎智英持續串謀、無逾時檢控 官周五頒判決&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eOV0D6a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，踏入審訊第2天。黎智英一方昨爭議控方加控煽動罪屬逾時檢控，法庭無權處理，辯方今補充指，煽動罪設6個月的檢控時限是平衡公眾利益，以盡快制止煽動刊物發布，強調控方應及時檢控。控方則指，串謀屬持續的罪行，被告在案發兩年間持續發布逾160篇煽動刊物，可視為同一犯罪計劃，檢控期限應由串謀結束當天、而非被告首次犯法起計；而控方向法庭表示有意加控已屬「開始」檢控，故控方檢控並無逾時。法官聽畢陳詞後，押至本周五就法律爭議頒下裁決，料控方同日將不會讀出開案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿淺藍色恤衫、灰色西裝褸的黎智英，今步入法庭時向旁聽席微笑揮手和點頭，其妻子和兩名子女也有到庭，女兒向黎飛吻，黎亦微笑回以飛吻。有旁聽人士高呼「撐住！頂住！」，司法機構職員及保安人員立即阻止稱：「保持安靜！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨爭議，控方前年加控黎智英串謀刊印煽動刊物罪時，已超出煽動罪6個月的檢控時限，法庭無司法管轄權審理；亦認為就《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條列明煽動罪檢控「只可於犯罪後6個月內開始進行」，當中「開始（begun）」一詞是立法時特意選用，只有在控方把被告帶上法庭加控才算「開始」進行檢控，而控方於2021年12月13日去信通知法庭有意加控，並不算「開始」檢控，控方仍然超出檢控時限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方檢控時限為確保盡快制止煽動作為平衡公眾利益-無對控方不公&quot;&gt;辯方：檢控時限為確保盡快制止煽動作為、平衡公眾利益 無對控方不公&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻今重申，控方單單去信法庭「提出告發（laying any information）」並不算是「開始」檢控，解釋煽動條例立法時確保需保障基本權利，因此設有嚴格的6個月檢控時限，亦列明須律政司司長的同意才能提出檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭亦認為，檢控時限無對控方造成不公，指當有人發布煽動刊物，為了公眾利益，應盡快檢控來制止刊物發布，並讓公眾知悉哪些刊物不應發布；而若控方認為煽動罪不足以反映刑責，望以串謀罪檢控，亦可於6個月的時限內進行。彭強調，控方應及時檢控，不能什麼也不做，等到數年後才因時限已過、無法以煽動罪檢控，而改用串謀罪檢控；又指檢控時限雖或令一些人逃過法網，但相關「不公」是條文所固有，立法者制定時已平衡公眾利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表3間《蘋果日報》相關公司的大律師王國豪，採納彭的陳詞，同意3間公司被帶上法庭加控才算「開始」檢控，並補充3間公司於2022年2月10日才被正式加控串謀發布煽動刊物罪，比黎智英遲兩個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方被告持續串謀分開檢控屬荒謬&quot;&gt;控方：被告持續串謀、分開檢控屬「荒謬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就辯方主張檢控時限應由被告首次完成犯罪、即2019年4月1日發布首篇煽動刊物起計算，副刑事檢控專員周天行回應，串謀是持續的罪行（continuing offence），而本案串謀協議歷時多於兩年，被告並非僅在案發首天發布一篇煽動刊物，而是於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日《蘋果日報》結束營運期間，持續發布逾160篇煽動刊物，因此檢控時限應由串謀最後一天、即6月24日起計算。而本案所涉行為性質相似、互相關聯，故可被視為同一個犯罪計劃（criminal enterprise）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周又指，即使只是發布一篇煽動刊物，但若能持續被公眾瀏覽，串謀時期亦應由刊物首次出現至其下架為止；並認為辯方稱應分開檢控每項串謀行為的說法荒謬，直言會令案件變得支離破碎（fragmented），無法反映整體罪行的嚴重性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方法庭收到提控已屬開始檢控若須親帶上庭令控罪難實行&quot;&gt;控方：法庭收到提控已屬「開始」檢控、若須親帶上庭令控罪難實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而對辯方爭議將黎智英帶上法庭加控才算「開始」進行檢控，周天行則認為法庭收到有關控罪的告發（laying information），即控方於12月13日去信法庭指有意加控，已算是「開始」檢控，解釋《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條中的「開始」，與《裁判官條例》第26條的「提出告發」，用字不同但意思一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《裁判官條例》第26條，無規定時效的罪行須於6個月內「作出申訴或提出告發」。惟法官李運騰指，《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條正規定了煽動罪的檢控時限，因此第26條不適用；又指制訂第11(1)條時，第26條已存在，若兩項條文效果一樣，為何還有需要制訂第11(1)條？又指控方詮釋會令第11(1)條變得多餘。周天行同意兩條法例字眼不一，但認為只是字眼上的改變，實際意思是一樣；並指若須將被告帶上法庭才算「開始」檢控，會令控罪難以實行（impracticable），因被告或潛逃和無法聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;周五頒判決-料不會同日讀出開案陳詞&quot;&gt;周五頒判決 料不會同日讀出開案陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻回應時重申，《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條比《裁判官條例》第26條較遲制訂，若「開始」檢控等同「提出告發」，則會令《刑事罪行條例》第11(1)條變得毫無用處，故兩者必然有分別。彭亦重申檢控時限應由被告首次犯罪起計。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雙方陳詞完畢，法官杜麗冰表示需時考慮，將於周五（22日）頒下裁決，並認為不會在當天讀出開案陳詞。法官李運騰亦補充，控方開案陳詞或受裁決結果影響，不方便於當天開始讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於中午1時由俗稱「鐵甲威龍」的囚車送走，警方電單車及私家車護送囚車離開，現場亦有反恐特勤隊警員持槍戒備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今早西九龍法院外警力較昨日稍微減少，但仍有至少60名警員在場戒備，每輛進入法院的汽車同樣須接受檢查，有部分車主及乘客須下車及打開車尾箱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5rDxVOG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，記者欲於法院大樓地下採訪排隊市民時，遭掛上司法機構證件的職員阻止，指今早獲指示該處不得進行採訪。記者追問下，職員稱會邀請「新聞官」向記者解釋，其後3名警民關係科警員到場，向記者指相關安排是法院的「house rule（場地規則）」、是管理的政策，要「尊重返」，又指警方本身無權入法院執法，但被司法機構職員邀請入內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;司法機構新聞主任到場了解後，向記者澄清法院並無相關「house rule」，純粹誤會，又指職員是擔心擾亂秩序，故溝通上「多咗啲」、「誤會咗」，記者可與人聊天採訪，只是不得進行拍攝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊不設陪審團，由《國安法》指定法官杜麗冰、李運騰和李素蘭審理。黎的律師團隊包括資深大律師彭耀鴻和大律師關文渭、黃雅斌、董皓哲及Marc Corlett。3間蘋果日報公司清盤人由大律師王國豪代表。控方由副刑事檢控專員周天行、署理助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤、高級檢控官吳加悅及陳穎琛等代表。警方國安處總警司李桂華則坐在律政司團隊後排。&lt;/p&gt;

Despite its current limitations, NATO is the primary actor capable of deterring and preventing hybrid attacks on its allies and has expedited its approach to CUI protection by establishing new organizations to that aim. At the 2023 NATO Vilnius summit, allies agreed to establish the Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Underwater Infrastructure within NATO’s Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM), which focuses on preparing for, deterring, and defending against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics. To help NATO planners and staff at the new center conceptualize and prioritize their efforts, this issue brief provides immediate and long-term recommendations to set the new center up for success.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO is not prepared to defend its allies’ critical undersea infrastructure (CUI) from increasingly prevalent Russian hybrid tactics. The recent Balticconnector pipeline incident highlighted the risk of deliberate damage to CUI across Europe. It follows last year’s Nord Stream pipeline explosions, among other incidents, and bears the hallmarks of sabotage. Europe’s expansive and growing network of undersea infrastructure will remain vulnerable to attacks aimed at disrupting transatlantic cohesion and economic activity, undermining Western support for Ukraine, and shaping potential future military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threats to undersea infrastructure are not new. In 2016 U.S. vice admiral James Foggo and Alarik Fritz warned of a “fourth battle of the Atlantic,” which included threats to “underwater infrastructure — such as oil rigs and telecommunications cables.” In 2017 the UK chief of the defence staff went public with previously classified Russian threats to undersea cables that posed a “new risk to our way of life,” while member of the UK Parliament Rishi Sunak (now UK prime minister) demanded enhanced protection of undersea data cables. Yet the Nord Stream incident has catalyzed a new focus in Europe on CUI resilience, including national, multinational, and institutional efforts through NATO and the European Union. Notably, this included the launch of a new NATO Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure at the Vilnius summit in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue brief examines NATO’s role in protecting CUI in more detail. It proceeds in four parts: It begins by assessing the threat “seascape” for CUI in northern Europe, including how the threat might evolve and how Europe has responded so far. The paper then turns to NATO’s approach to date, summarizing the key NATO initiatives related to CUI protection. The third part looks in more detail at the challenge of protecting CUI, proposing a basic framework to help understand the vast problem space. The final section draws on this framework to develop several immediate and longer-term recommendations to help planners in NATO’s new center prioritize their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-threats-to-undersea-infrastructure-in-northern-europe&quot;&gt;THE EVOLUTION OF THREATS TO UNDERSEA INFRASTRUCTURE IN NORTHERN EUROPE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has radically altered the threat landscape across Europe, particularly in the north. As the alliance remains focused on supporting Ukraine and shoring up its eastern flank, Sweden’s and Finland’s membership bids will provide new opportunities to deter Russian aggression in the Baltic and Arctic regions. But recent examples of CUI interference highlight vulnerabilities that will not be easily remedied. The sabotage of two Nord Stream pipelines off the Danish island of Bornholm in September 2022 forced European governments to grapple with their limited ability to deter and defend against hybrid tactics in the undersea domain. Recent damage to the Balticconnector gas pipeline and a data cable between Finland and Estonia in October 2023 from a ship’s anchor is suspected as being deliberate, although attribution has not yet been declared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the main focus of critical maritime infrastructure debates has shifted from emphasis on terrorism and cyber threats toward the increasing frequency and efficacy of hybrid tactics. The aim of hybrid tactics is to cause significant damage to an adversary while operating below the threshold of detection, attribution, and response — and in so doing blur the conceptual lines between conflict and peace. The issue is compounded in the maritime realm by several conceptual and practical challenges, mainly related to poor definitions highly dependent on moral or political choices, a unique geophysical space, and the multitude of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian hybrid tactics represent the most pressing threat to CUI in northern Europe. Russia’s war against Ukraine has debilitated its ground forces and strained its military industrial base. Experts estimate it will take the Kremlin five to ten years to reconstitute its military. Meanwhile, however, Russia’s power projection capabilities in northern Europe — through naval, air, and missile bases in Kaliningrad and its Northern Fleet of submarines on the Kola Peninsula — have scarcely been depleted. In fact, while the Russian navy is underfunded and a large part of its fleet comprises Soviet legacy platforms, its underwater capacity continues to grow. In particular, Russia’s submarine program remains a priority amid other military budget cuts, exemplified by the Kremlin’s authorization of 13 new nuclear and conventional submarines since 2014. In broader terms, Russia’s ability to target critical infrastructure short of war and impose economic costs to deter external intervention in regional conflicts is an important component to Moscow’s doctrine and thinking on escalation management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even in the absence of a broader Russia-NATO conflict, hybrid tactics have been a staple in the Kremlin’s toolbox in Europe for years. As the Kremlin views itself in perpetual conflict with the West, hybrid tactics are instrumental to challenging NATO without resorting to conventional military means. Russia has likely targeted critical infrastructure throughout Europe at an increased frequency since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the undersea domain, Russia appears committed to mapping and threatening European energy and communications infrastructure, particularly strategically important Norwegian gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nord Stream attacks resulted in a flurry of initiatives to bolster Europe’s CUI. The European Union has updated its maritime strategy to better address evolving threats and adopted an expanded directive on CUI resilience, and the EU-NATO Task Force on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure was launched in January and reported its findings in June. The EU Hybrid Toolbox, including the Hybrid Fusion Cell and new Hybrid Rapid Response Teams, support member states and NATO to detect, deter, and respond to threats. More recently, the 10-nation Joint Expeditionary Force ( JEF) agreed to focus on protecting CUI in its new vision and deployed a maritime task force in response to the Balticconnector incident to deter further attacks. Bilateral examples include the recent UK-Norway strategic partnership on undersea threats. Many nations have also expanded their ability to monitor and protect undersea infrastructure: France recently announced a new seabed warfare strategy and investments in ocean floor defense, and the United Kingdom has set up a Centre for Seabed Mapping and earmarked two new Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance (MROS) vessels to serve primarily as subsea protection ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;protecting-critical-undersea-infrastructure-a-new-focus-for-nato&quot;&gt;PROTECTING CRITICAL UNDERSEA INFRASTRUCTURE: A NEW FOCUS FOR NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many stakeholders have increased their efforts to protect CUI, NATO remains the lead actor when it comes to deterring and preventing conventional and hybrid attacks on allies. NATO’s role in protecting CUI is grounded in its founding principles, such as Articles 2 and 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which call for the strengthening of free institutions, economic collaboration, and growing resilience to attack. At the 2023 Vilnius summit, allies reiterated that hybrid operations against the alliance could meet the threshold of armed attack and trigger Article 5, NATO’s collective defense guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-value-of-nato&quot;&gt;THE VALUE OF NATO&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the functioning of allied civil society and the prosperity of member states depends on the extensive network of CUI across the Euro-Atlantic. NATO is critical to its protection for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Russia — the primary threat — has the intent and capability, and it maximizes its opportunity to threaten allied CUI across NATO’s area of operational responsibility. Moreover, the destruction, disruption, or tapping of CUI could be the precursor to conflict through attempting to sever military and government communications. Second, the protection of CUI is part of NATO’s defense and deterrence posture across the Euro-Atlantic. As hybrid attacks on CUI may meet the threshold for armed attack, NATO must be heavily invested in their protection to ensure it can act decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, CUI spans NATO’s entire area of operational responsibility, so maintaining seamless situational awareness across the whole network is a challenge far too large for individual nations. Fourth, the challenge of protecting CUI will increasingly rely on technological solutions, and NATO possesses the financial heft and mechanisms to develop and scale these. Finally, there are complex political, legal, and technical considerations for the effective protection of CUI, and seams between national permissions and restrictions can create frictions best managed at the NATO level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-approach&quot;&gt;NATO’S APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has been both proactive and reactive to CUI threats. In broad terms, NATO protects CUI in three ways. First, all of NATO’s forces contribute to the alliance’s Defence and Deterrence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA), which coheres all activity by region and domain. Many capabilities that contribute to CUI protection also contribute to wider deterrence activities, including standing naval and mine countermeasures groups and CUI-focused exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, NATO assets detect threats through intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities and space and cyber assets to gain and maintain situational awareness. Moreover, NATO can develop and scale new technologies to increase detection coverage, such as the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) pilot challenges, which include a focus on energy resilience and sensing and surveillance. The alliance’s new Digital Ocean Concept was endorsed in October 2023 to increase collective visibility of oceans, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the creation of a global scale network of sensors, from sea bed to space, to better predict, identify, classify and combat threats. It envisages maritime domain awareness, subsea sensors, unmanned surface vessels, drones and satellites, and exploits AI [artificial intelligence], big data, and autonomous systems, alongside conventional assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, NATO has a range of response options once an incident or attack occurs, including counter hybrid support teams, the NATO Response Force (NRF) and Very High Readiness Task Force (VJTF), and ad hoc force deployments, such as the enhanced maritime patrol and mine hunter deployments in the Baltic Sea. National missions and regional frameworks outside of NATO command structures can also bolster deterrence against threats to CUI, including the JEF and the aforementioned EU initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: European Institutions Relevant for Protecting CUI.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ compilation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-new-centers&quot;&gt;NATO’S NEW CENTERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to recent incidents in the Baltic Sea, NATO has expedited its approach to CUI protection by establishing two new organizations. In February 2023 the Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell was created at NATO headquarters. The rationale was to coordinate allied activity; bring military and civilian stakeholders together by facilitating engagement with private industry, which owns much of the infrastructure; and better protect CUI through jointly detecting and responding to threats. This new cell will be instrumental in building coordination across all the organizations, policies, and capabilities identified in Table 1 both within and external to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, at the July 2023 Vilnius summit, allies agreed to establish the Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Underwater Infrastructure within NATO’s Allied Maritime Command (MARCOM). This new center focuses on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies . . . to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics by state and non-state actors. . . . NATO stands ready to support Allies if and when requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center arrives at a crucial time for NATO as both new threats to CUI and new initiatives to deal with them proliferate across the alliance and beyond. To help NATO planners and staff at the new center conceptualize and prioritize their efforts, the next section considers in more detail the problem of protecting CUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-threats-to-critical-undersea-infrastructure-a-conceptual-framework&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING THREATS TO CRITICAL UNDERSEA INFRASTRUCTURE: A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section develops a basic framework for thinking about protecting CUI. The purpose is to help NATO planners — particularly those in the new center — to understand the vast problem space and prioritize some initial efforts over others. The following section draws on this framework to develop several recommendations. The four elements of the framework for protecting CUI are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure type:&lt;/strong&gt; What counts as CUI? Which parts are most critical or most vulnerable?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat type:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the main threats to undersea CUI?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt; What is NATO’s role in protecting CUI?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geography:&lt;/strong&gt; Where should limited resources be prioritized and focused across the Euro-Atlantic area?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-infrastructure-type&quot;&gt;1. INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime infrastructure is vital to basic societal functions such as trade, food and energy supplies, security and defense, communications, transport, tourism, and environmental management. The most important infrastructure is usually considered “critical,” meaning without it, society could not function for long. But critical infrastructure differs between nations given that some economies depend on fishing or tourism while others rely more on maritime trade, energy infrastructure, or data cables. What counts as CUI, therefore, is often more of a political decision than a technical one. There is no one-size-fits-all definition: it depends on the nation and region in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime infrastructure is often categorized by sector. One classification system lists five types: transport, energy, communication, fishing, and marine ecosystems. Of these, four have substantial elements of underwater infrastructure. Above-water transport is often precluded, while commercial submersibles — such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) used in pipeline maintenance — are considered part of the energy infrastructure they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime infrastructure security policies traditionally focus on maritime transport (e.g., ports) and energy (e.g., gas and oil infrastructure) over other types. However, the infrastructure picture is changing rapidly. Undersea cable projects have proliferated in recent years, while offshore renewable energy technologies like wind and tidal systems will increase to help nations meet global carbon emissions targets. Future proliferation of AUVs — driven by new oil and gas exploration, military applications, reduced manufacturing costs, and improvements in AI and automation technology — could present both new types of CUI under the category of transport and new threats. As the recent NATO-EU task force on critical infrastructure summarizes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These challenges are compounded for undersea energy infrastructure, which is extensive and more difficult to survey and protect. Moreover, the network of undersea energy infrastructure in the Euro-Atlantic area is expected to grow as offshore energy platforms become more numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, fishing and marine ecosystems are increasingly important to some nations as fishing stocks decrease and marine habitats are degraded by pollution and the effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond rapid change, there are several challenges associated with coordinating CUI protection, including interdependence, the physical characteristics of the subsea domain, and the complex, transnational nature of undersea infrastructure. Meanwhile, fishing and marine ecosystems are increasingly important to some nations as fishing stocks decrease and marine habitats are degraded by pollution and the effects of climate change. This suggests a key challenge for NATO will be prioritizing between CUI sectors, which are critical to different NATO allies. This assessment will be driven to some extent by the next element of the framework: the threat picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-threat&quot;&gt;2. THREAT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most definitions of critical infrastructure depend on how vital it is to the functioning of society, in practice governments tend to designate infrastructure as critical if it is vulnerable to harm. While pipeline sabotage has driven the headlines, the range of threats to CUI is much broader. The threat picture has also changed in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime security threats have been driven by the rise of terrorism, international piracy, human trafficking, and the “blue economy,” defined by the World Bank as “the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and ocean ecosystem health.” Protection of maritime and undersea infrastructure has typically focused on physical attacks from terrorism and blue crime (i.e., transnational organized crime at sea). However, the threat environment has changed markedly over the last decade — and drastically since 2022. After invading Ukraine, Russia became “the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security,” according to NATO’s new Strategic Concept — a threat that includes the ability to “target our civilian and military infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s new concept also points to hybrid threats to critical infrastructure and reaffirms their inclusion under Article 5. The maritime domain has been viewed as particularly vulnerable to hybrid threats. Attacks on underwater infrastructure have been a particular concern. Recent events appear to confirm these fears, with several incidents such as the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in the Baltic Sea or severed subsea cables near Svalbard that appear to follow the hybrid playbook of deniable attacks on undersea infrastructure. These incidents highlight the difficulty of dealing with ambiguous hybrid threats, which are difficult to distinguish from accidental damage. For example, around 70 percent of undersea cable faults are caused by fishing vessels or ship anchors, alongside natural causes or even shark bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid aggressors can also use the cover of fishing, private, or research vessels, which are difficult to track. The rapid proliferation of AUVs will exacerbate the problem. Specialized vessels for the task also exist, such as Russia’s dedicated fleet of submarines, designed for infrastructure sabotage and manned by the Russian navy and the Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research (GUGI). Research vessels operated by GUGI are suspected of mapping networks of undersea infrastructure across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all these reasons, many assessments suggest a new era of hybrid threats is emerging and poses “a particular challenge” to protecting undersea infrastructure. As the NATO-EU task force puts it, “The seabed is a field of growing strategic importance, due to increasing reliance on undersea infrastructure and the particular challenges in protecting it from hybrid threats and physical damage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-tasks&quot;&gt;3. TASKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element of the framework comprises the tasks and missions NATO may have to carry out to protect CUI. The most important role, short of war, is deterrence, which holds the promise of avoiding armed attacks altogether. Beyond deterrence, military forces perform a wide range of roles relevant to protecting CUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is counterpiracy. During Operation Ocean Shield — NATO’s contribution to international efforts to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa during 2008–16 — the role of NATO forces spanned surveillance, interdiction, escort, and deterrence. Cooperation with international bodies and the private sector was also vital to mission success, which contributed to the cessation of attacks after 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another relevant example is protecting national infrastructure. The U.S. National Infrastructure Protection Plan outlines threats to national infrastructure and a framework of missions to protect them. These are divided into two tasks: counterthreat missions and preparedness missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counterthreat missions identify and counter threats and hazards: identify, deter, detect, disrupt, and prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preparedness missions reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate the consequences of damage: prevent, protect, mitigate, respond, recover.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, several existing frameworks for countering hybrid threats may be applied to protecting CUI. NATO’s strategy is to “prepare, deter, defend,” while the European Union’s approach is based on “awareness, resilience, and response.” Another framework is proposed by the 14-nation Multinational Capability Development Campaign (MCDC): “detect, deter, and respond.” This framework is used to examine NATO’s role in protecting CUI regarding all three functions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;detect&quot;&gt;DETECT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering any threat requires first detecting and identifying it. Detection is even more important for hybrid threats, which rely on deniability or ambiguity to delay, complicate, or prevent reprisal. However, the variety and complexity of hybrid threats make detection challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For protecting CUI, the main focus is on enhancing maritime domain awareness (MDA). MDA systems are “one of the core solutions in maritime security” but are focused on civil transport, fishing, and leisure. To rectify this, a 2018 report by CSIS advocates a renewed focus on undersea MDA to combat hybrid threats. Specific recommendations include establishing dedicated analytic centers (with teams focused on hybrid threats), training courses, a common classified data picture, and an operational framework that integrates surface and subsurface sensors. Another recent analysis recommends closing gaps in the surveillance of small boats, leisure craft, and underwater vehicles through “investments in new underwater sensors and drones which can enhance the overall picture of the domain.” The recent EU-NATO Task Force also recommends enhancing “maritime situational awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One detection challenge is that malign activity often appears, by design, as an accident, whereas some suspected attacks could actually be accidents (most damage to cables and pipelines is accidental). This means NATO does not have the luxury of ignoring apparent accidents. Here, a conceptual distinction between monitoring (known threats) and discovering (new, unknown threats) can help establish situational awareness and distinguish signal from noise in the realm of detection. This task is also well suited to advances in AI and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deter&quot;&gt;DETER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring hybrid threats to CUI is difficult but not impossible. The most promising strategy is deterrence by denial, which reduces the prospects of successful attack by hardening the target and strengthening resilience to damage. Denial in this context comprises two functions: prevention and resilience (see Figure 3). Preventing attacks is part of NATO’s core business and is achieved through a combination of detection (see above) and physical presence. For example, NATO’s Cold War deterrence strategy of basing substantial “shield forces” in central Europe was designed to physically prevent a Soviet attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience measures are designed to help CUI systems withstand or quickly recover from any damage sustained. Much of this amounts to good practice in the design and management of critical infrastructure systems. Such measures are therefore generally low cost and less reliant on detecting threats; best practices for resilience are based on understanding and mitigating one’s own vulnerabilities, regardless of whether they have been targeted. This is why resilience measures have become foundational to counter hybrid strategies. However, resilience building is a long-term strategy that will take years to deliver given the vast size and complexity of Euro-Atlantic CUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;respond&quot;&gt;RESPOND&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, resilience is not a strategy on its own; deterrence by punishment also has a role. When it comes to punishing low-level aggression, celerity beats severity most of the time, putting a premium on credible response options that can be deployed quickly and reliably. These measures may not threaten vital interests but merely assure an aggressor will always face some costs for threatening CUI, however minor. This means simple measures such as enhanced presence or surveillance around key sites can work to deliver what has been referred to as “deterrence by detection.” More creative measures also play a role, such as attribution disclosure, legal interventions, or targeted sanctions (e.g., against implicated vessels, companies, or individuals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That credible responses are required suggests the utility of a preapproved playbook to counter hybrid threats to CUI. Too often such measures are ad hoc or post hoc, or not sufficiently tailored to the specific demands of protecting CUI. If military forces are part of the response (e.g., to provide surveillance or bolster presence), then a forward, flexible posture is required to ensure force elements are in the area of responsibility or held at high readiness to deploy to quickly generate effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that given the limited resources of allies, any increase in demand to protect CUI will likely require trade-offs with other tasks and missions. Any contribution to protecting CUI is important but not all-important. NATO’s unique role — and the focus of the strategic concept — remains deterring armed attack above the threshold of war, not protecting against all forms of hybrid aggression. Protecting CUI should therefore not be overemphasized in NATO’s overall posture or capability development at the expense of conventional deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-geography&quot;&gt;4. GEOGRAPHY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element of the framework is geography. NATO is named after an ocean: the North Atlantic. But the alliance’s undersea infrastructure picture is more complex. NATO’s maritime areas of responsibility comprise the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High North region (including the Norwegian Sea, Greenland Sea, Barents Sea, and Arctic Ocean)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Baltic Sea&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Atlantic (including the North Sea, Irish Sea, English Channel, and Bay of Biscay)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mediterranean Sea (east and west)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black Sea&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Pacific Ocean&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within these areas, the seascape of undersea infrastructure is extensive and complex. Figures 1–2 show the extent of underwater energy infrastructure (Figure 1) and subsea data cables (Figure 2) across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While data cables are uniformly spread across the Euro-Atlantic area, the picture is different for energy infrastructure, which is concentrated in northern Europe — namely the North Atlantic (North Sea) and High North (Norwegian Sea). This supply is critical to Europe: in the second quarter of 2023, the European Union imported 44.3 percent of its natural gas (in gaseous state) from Norway and 17.8 percent from the United Kingdom. That 16.5 percent was from Algeria (through three subsea Mediterranean pipelines) also shows the importance of energy infrastructure in southern Europe. This could increase in the future with new projects (such as the EastMed pipeline) and new gas field discoveries as Europe diversifies away from Russian supply. Offshore wind energy infrastructure (along with subsea electrical cables) is also concentrated in northern Europe but present in significant amounts across Europe. Such infrastructure is also expanding quickly: under the European Green Deal, for example, offshore wind energy will expand over 25 times by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any judgment about prioritizing NATO’s efforts to protect CUI in one region cannot rely on the density of infrastructure alone because all undersea infrastructure is proportionately important to each ally. In addition to including the views of all allies, any assessment must combine geography with the other elements of the framework. This task is explored in the final section of this brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-winning-the-fourth-battle-of-the-atlantic&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS: WINNING THE FOURTH BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff at NATO’s new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Underwater Infrastructure do not have the luxury of pondering future threats. NATO’s CUI is under attack right now. This situation may worsen as Russia tries to undermine Western support for Ukraine and cheaper, more advanced AUVs enable a wider range of actors to pose a threat. As Foggo, the former commander of the U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Allied Joint Force Command Naples, puts it: “the fourth battle of the Atlantic is underway.” Like its predecessors, this battle is “a struggle between Russian forces that probe for weakness, and US and NATO anti-submarine warfare (ASW) forces that protect and deter. Just like in the Cold War, the stakes are high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and its new center must therefore act quickly. The final section provides a series of recommendations for NATO planners to conceptualize and prioritize their efforts in the coming years. The recommendations comprise two parts. The first is a general assessment of initial priorities for protecting CUI based on the four-part framework developed above. The second builds on this broad assessment to propose more specific and immediate actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;general-assessment-of-initial-priorities-for-protecting-cui&quot;&gt;GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF INITIAL PRIORITIES FOR PROTECTING CUI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section presents a general indicative assessment of NATO’s role in protecting CUI based on the framework discussed in Figure 3. The shaded area suggests where NATO’s initial focus should be for protecting CUI. This assessment is discussed in more detail below, starting with the prioritization criteria for each element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infrastructure Type&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea infrastructure may be prioritized for protection by considering the criticality to NATO allies and vulnerability to different threats. Doing so suggests NATO focus on protecting energy and communications infrastructure — the most critical infrastructure to many NATO allies, whose developed economies depend on either importing or exporting energy and transmitting data. Such infrastructure is also the most vulnerable to attack, as recent attacks on pipelines and undersea cables have demonstrated. If further prioritization is required, it should be driven by an analysis of resilience of energy infrastructure compared to data cables: although both are vital and vulnerable, some systems are more resilient and easier to reconfigure in the event of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to remember undersea infrastructure is much broader than pipelines and cables. Many NATO allies depend on fishing, the health of their marine ecosystems, and maritime security in the broadest sense. The rapid growth of AUVs may transform the transport sector, introducing new types of CUI and new threats. Most importantly, NATO’s approach to protecting CUI will need to incorporate the preferences of all allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threats may be prioritized by considering the likelihood and consequences of an attack. With this in mind, NATO should focus on hybrid or gray zone threats to CUI, as these are the most likely threats in the near term. At the same time, the most dangerous threat to NATO allies remains the threat of armed attack on CUI as a prelude to aggression or during conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrorism targeted at CUI remains a risk, and blue crime is ever present. But other bodies should take the lead (e.g., national police and coast guards, multinational maritime security frameworks), with NATO providing support only where necessary, as with combating large-scale piracy. NATO can contribute to awareness of accidental damage through MDA and crisis response to natural damage and disaster, but these tasks should not drive alliance force structure or posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Task&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of NATO assets in protecting CUI may be prioritized by considering the importance of relevant tasks and their role in NATO’s Strategic Concept. Deterrence and defense is the alliance’s core task. Deterring armed aggression is NATO’s raison d’être and remains its most important task. However, NATO’s capacity to do this is dependent on its general deterrence posture and is not related to the specific problem of protecting CUI — so it is not considered a primary focus here (see Figure 3). Within the context of protecting CUI, NATO should focus on three primary tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detect:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO should focus on detecting threats to CUI, as detection is the foundation of deterrence and critical for removing the cloak of ambiguity around hybrid threats. Detection can be strengthened through enhanced MDA in priority regions. This may require increasing the persistent presence of forces and assets that can contribute to MDA in the maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deter by denial:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO should also focus on strengthening deterrence by denial by improving the defenses that can prevent attacks in the first place. This may also require strengthening the persistent presence of allied forces in regions of concern to protect key sites, reassure vulnerable allies, and deter aggressors. Wider resilience measures can also strengthen denial, but these are judged to be a lower priority for NATO because much of this infrastructure is owned and operated by civilian enterprises, not amenable to military solutions, and already subject to extensive efforts by other actors more suited to boosting public and private sector resilience — such as the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deter by punishment:&lt;/strong&gt; Responses to imminent threats or attacks should prioritize speed and reliability over severity. In the context of deterring low-end hybrid threats (rather than high-end conventional threats) to CUI, this suggests the utility of maritime forces that are forward based in priority regions — or at least persistently present or rapidly deployable (i.e., held at high readiness). More broadly, existing NATO units such as countering hybrid threat teams also have a role to play in immediate incident response and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, although this assessment is focused on protecting allied CUI against hybrid threats, this should not unduly warp NATO’s force posture. Any trade-offs in posture, capability, or readiness to deal with hybrid threats should not come at the expense of the credibility of NATO’s ability to deal with — and thereby deter — armed aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Region&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all subregions within the Euro-Atlantic area are equal when it comes to protecting CUI. The extent of regional energy infrastructure, proximity to advanced Russian undersea capabilities, and track record of recent incidents (attacks and infrastructure mapping) suggest NATO should focus initially on the Baltic, North Atlantic, and High North regions. At the same time, NATO cannot afford to ignore other regions that are critical to allies and where Russian forces and other threats (such as terrorism and blue crime) are known to operate, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-recommendations&quot;&gt;SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general assessment above, combined with the previous discussion of the four framework elements, suggests several more recommendations for NATO’s role in protecting CUI. These are divided into two parts: immediate actions that the new NATO center should implement quickly and longer-term approaches that are equally important but may take more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immediate Recommendations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a new Standing NATO Maritime Group (SNMG) focused on protecting CUI.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO’s four standing maritime groups are in high operational demand and none are focused on protecting CUI. Considering the growing threat, NATO should consider establishing an “SNMG3” to focus on protecting CUI in northern Europe, focused on the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Norwegian Sea (the areas of highest CUI density). The JEF task group that is currently deployed is a good example but only temporary. The capabilities of the group should include submarines, anti-submarine warfare, maritime surveillance, and seabed mapping, with contributions from allies who specialize in this domain. The group would play a vital role in organizing and delivering the functions of detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks on CUI in priority regions described in this report.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commission a CUI vulnerability triage.&lt;/strong&gt; Any approach to enhancing resilience starts with a vulnerability assessment. An initial triage assessment of criticality versus vulnerability to a range of threats can help MARCOM and NATO direct limited resources to protecting and defending those assets most at risk. The initial assessment presented here forms a starting point, but NATO’s own assessment must consider all forms of infrastructure, threats, regions, and the preferences of all allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a fused MDA picture.&lt;/strong&gt; A critical step in transforming MDA to improve detection and identification of threats to CUI will be fusing the existing intelligence picture across nations, the private and public sectors, and multinational and maritime domains (e.g., air, sea, subsea, space, and cyber). Assessing the highest-priority infrastructure and threats can help identify which ISR capabilities and combinations not currently available to MARCOM are necessary to rapidly attribute malign activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produce regular CUI threat assessments.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO already produces maritime threat assessments for governments and the commercial sector that focus on threats such as terrorism — for example, through the NATO Maritime Shipping Centre (MSC). These should either be expanded to include threats to CUI or be dedicated assessments that focus on nontraditional hybrid threats to CUI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarify the role of NATO’s Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell.&lt;/strong&gt; The cell is based in NATO headquarters, but its wide remit — which includes industry and civil-military engagement, best practice, and technology — and senior leadership may overlap with the new MARCOM center. The coordination cell could perform the role the MSC did during Ocean Shield of protecting CUI, which will be even more important given CUI is mostly owned and operated by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement a CUI exercise program.&lt;/strong&gt; Exercises are a vital part of NATO’s deterrence and reassurance efforts and have been stepped up over the last year. Yet CUI exercises have been limited and focused on technology. A wider CUI exercise program using existing assets would deliver wider effects to deter adversaries and reassure allies and industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update NATO’s maritime strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO’s maritime strategy is over 12 years old, does not mention Russia or China, and mentions undersea infrastructure only in passing. It needs updating to reflect the new threat environment and NATO’s new Strategic Concept — including a focus on protecting CUI. The new center should have a lead role in producing a new strategy — or at least a “Protecting CUI” annex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longer-Term Recommendations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a NATO CUI resilience strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Building on the vulnerability assessment, a longer-term effort that the new center could lead is developing a NATO CUI resilience strategy. This would meet NATO’s Strengthened Resilience Commitment and could inform (and be informed by) a NATO resilience planning process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a NATO CUI preparedness goal.&lt;/strong&gt; As part of a strengthened approach to CUI resilience, allies could commit to a NATO CUI preparedness goal to bolster national and pan-NATO approaches to preparing for attacks on CUI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a risk management approach.&lt;/strong&gt; The sheer variety of threats to CUI and the number of potential targets require an approach that prioritizes and manages risk. Even better than a risk-centric strategy would be an uncertainty-centric approach that seeks robustness against a range of unknowable threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a CUI attack response playbook.&lt;/strong&gt; Effective deterrence against CUI attacks requires a credible and reliable set of measures to respond to threats or attacks on CUI. A counter-CUI playbook of military (and nonmilitary) response options would help. This playbook could also be the basis of a robust exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt a framework nation approach to regional CUI protection.&lt;/strong&gt; A regional framework nation approach to protecting CUI could help tailor CUI protection to the differing concerns of regional allies. One example is the JEF, newly focused on protecting northern Europe’s CUI. Whatever the framework, any regional approach to protecting CUI should be directed by the alliance’s DDA concept, NATO’s guiding framework for all operations short of war, and align with new regional plans agreed at the Vilnius summit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英爭議串謀發布煽動刊物罪逾時檢控、涉新聞自由應寬鬆詮釋法例&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N3aORzf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（18日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）開審。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻，爭議控方前年加控串謀刊印煽動刊物罪時，超出了檢控時限4日，法庭沒有司法管轄權處理；又指本案涉及新聞自由等基本權利，應以較寬鬆的尺度詮釋法例，但對於控方應較嚴謹。至於控方指在檢控期限未屆滿前，曾去信通知法庭「有意」申請新增控罪，辯方則認為直至控方把黎智英帶上法庭加控，才算正式就該罪開始進行檢控。辯方明天將繼續陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已還柙逾3年的黎智英，今身穿淺藍色恤衫、灰色西裝褸，被4名懲教人員帶進被告欄。黎身形明顯消瘦，但精神不俗，向旁聽席的家屬揮手、點頭，又微笑豎起拇指，天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君亦有站起身向黎揮手。黎於審訊期間戴上耳機輔助聆聽，神情專注，休庭時與女兒多次互相飛吻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告為：黎智英（76歲）、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;媒體報導稱黎申請海外證人作供被拒-法官澄清沒有收到相關申請&quot;&gt;媒體報導稱黎申請海外證人作供被拒 法官澄清沒有收到相關申請&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官杜麗冰指，有見本地傳媒上周報導稱法庭拒絕被告申請海外證人以視像形式作供，特此澄清《刑事訴訟程序條例》規定，海外證人如要作供，須在案件交付至高院後42日之內提出申請，但本案並無任何人申請海外證人作供，也沒有任何申請要求延長42日期限。代表黎的資深大律師彭耀鴻及代表3間蘋果公司的大律師王國豪在庭上確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方爭議煽動刊物罪超出檢控時限-法庭無司法管轄權處理&quot;&gt;辯方爭議煽動刊物罪超出檢控時限 法庭無司法管轄權處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英就控罪答辯之前，其代表資深大律師彭耀鴻先就「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪逾時檢控提出爭議。控方案情指稱黎智英與其他被告於2019年4月1日起，一同串謀發布煽動刊物，該串謀直至2021年6月24日《蘋果日報》停運為止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭指，根據《刑事罪行條例》第11條，煽動控罪的檢控「只可於犯罪後6個月內開始進行」；而據《刑事罪行條例》第159D條，對於依據協議而犯下的串謀罪行，若果提出檢控的時限已經屆滿，便不能就該串謀罪行「提出法律程序」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續指，若果由串謀的首天2019年4月1日起計，檢控時限是同年10月1日；若法庭不接納，由最後一天2021年6月24日起計算，控方的檢控時限亦是同年12月24日。然而黎在12月28日的法庭聆訊上才被正式加控「煽動刊物」罪，已逾時4日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭指，逾時檢控的問題關乎法庭是否有司法管轄權處理控罪，若果超過檢控時限，法庭便沒有司法管轄權處理「煽動刊物」控罪，且本案涉及新聞自由等基本權利，應以較寬鬆的尺度詮釋法例，但對於控方應較嚴謹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官質疑串謀屬持續-辯方指不能以此避過檢控時限&quot;&gt;法官質疑串謀屬持續 辯方指不能以此避過檢控時限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問及，若果串謀並非一次性，而是持續一系列的串謀呢？彭耀鴻回應，若果串謀罪行只是一次性，檢控時限便須由作出串謀的首天起開始計算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦指，本案被告是持續干犯一連串的罪行，若控方分成多項控罪提控，並如辯方所指運用相同的檢控時限，或會出現較早干犯的控罪超出檢控時限、而較遲干犯的控罪則在時限之內檢控的情況；又質疑後來加入串謀者便不能被控。彭耀鴻同意，但強調控方可分開檢控，亦須及時檢控，不能以串謀來繞過檢控時限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰又問及，若被告人不在香港，但在海外導致煽動刊物在香港發布，控方便未能趕在檢控限期內將他帶上法庭提控。彭耀鴻則指，同樣的檢控期限依然適用，被告人依然受到條例所規定的時限保護。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方帶上法庭加控始算開始進行檢控-控方仍違檢控時限&quot;&gt;辯方：帶上法庭加控始算開始進行檢控 控方仍違檢控時限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就控方於2021年12月13日曾去信法庭表示「有意」申請新增煽動刊物罪、黎智英於翌日獲悉，彭耀鴻認為控方當時並未將黎帶上法庭正式加控，至12月28日才正式加控，故即使採納12月24日為檢控期限，仍然超出檢控時限4天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭解釋，《刑事罪行條例》第11條列明煽動罪須於6個月內「開始進行（begun）」檢控，是立法時特意選用的字眼，強調直至控方把黎智英帶上法庭加控，才算「開始進行」檢控，而非如控方據《裁判官條例》第26條所指，於12月13日去信表示有意加控，「作出申訴或提出告發（making any complaint or laying any information）」，便可視為已「開始進行」檢控。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《裁判官條例》第26條，若罪行無規定作出申訴或提出告發的時效，則「申訴或告發」須於6個月內作出或提出。彭認為，只有很少罪行會訂明檢控時限，若《刑事罪行條例》第11條已為煽動罪訂明檢控時限，則將兩條法例的字眼理解為同一意思，會令《刑事罪行條例》第11條變得完全多餘，故「開始進行」檢控必定指「作出申訴或提出告發」以外的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明續審，彭耀鴻將繼續陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

Most importantly, they are difficult to detect — defeating them will require elevated sensors, on aircraft or satellites, to track them at range.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;As the Department of Defense begins to deploy a space-based sensor constellation, Getting on Track unpacks the design tradeoffs involved and key pitfalls to avoid. Using advanced simulation tools, the authors underscore the necessity of diversifying satellite orbits, designing constellations for early, persistent coverage, and retaining requirements for fire-control-capable sensors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A new, elevated sensor architecture is required to detect, identify, and track a spectrum of maneuvering missile threats with sufficient quality to support missile defense fire control. These threats combine high speeds, unpredictable, non-ballistic trajectories, and large raid sizes to stress legacy defense designs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The future of missile defense and missile defeat will be contingent on the development, characteristics, and fielding timeline of this architecture. One cannot defend against what one cannot see.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a perfect sensor architecture design. Designing an elevated sensor architecture is rather an exercise in tradeoffs. Given this multiplicity of trades, architecture design is as much an art as a science. The application of this art to specific designs reflects various institutional and policy assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unpacking these tradeoffs and assumptions — making them explicit — can help policymakers, budgeteers, and system architects, and better inform the public discussion related to missile tracking and missile defense. Doing so is the purpose of this report. This report does not advocate a particular architecture, but instead elaborates these tradeoffs, identifies principles to inform future architectures, and highlights temptations to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No single orbit or domain represents an optimal approach for missile defense sensing. Low (LEO), medium (MEO), geosynchronous (GEO), and highly elliptical orbits (HEO) each contribute varied advantages for coverage, schedule, cost, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proliferating space sensors in LEO is one way to improve resilience, assuming large numbers and low-cost replacement. It is not the only way. Reliance on a single orbital regime, or on any single approach to resilience, invites disruption. LEO constellations can be degraded by area- or domain-wide effects, including electronic attack, nuclear or radiological means, and the intentional generation of debris.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense’s recently updated plan to deploy a mixed-orbit missile tracking constellation is thus a welcome step for enhancing resilience. Sensor architectures should complicate adversary targeting by leveraging the unique benefits and drawbacks of multiple orbits and domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deployment phasing of a sensor architecture is as critical as its final delivery date. Choices over orbital configurations not only affect final sensor coverage but how coverage develops over time. Sensor constellations optimized purely for coverage efficiencies do not necessarily generate persistent coverage until most elements are deployed. For nearer-term coverage, especially for the lower latitudes relevant to the Indo-Pacific and other theaters, policymakers should be attentive to the pacing of sensor fielding, not only the final product — graceful deployment as well as graceful degradation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While a space-based sensor architecture is necessary for global missile tracking coverage, a suborbital underlay of airborne sensors could improve point or regional coverage, hedge against schedule or capability gaps of orbiting sensors, and enhance overall system-level survivability. Airborne sensors offer unique detection modalities and could support persistent, localized coverage unbounded by the predictability and rigidity of orbital mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sensor fusion is a major and underappreciated source of schedule risk. Delays in developing sensor fusion software and infrastructure contributed significantly to past space program cost and schedule overruns. Further steps are needed to prioritize command and control and fusion algorithm development for larger satellite constellations and multiple sensor types.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fire control-quality tracking must be a fundamental requirement for the emergent elevated sensing architecture. The technical requirements for fire control tracks are relative measures, contingent on the performance of other elements in the missile defense kill chain. Less stringent track data requirements would require interceptors with costlier, more capable seekers or more ability to maneuver to compensate for positional uncertainties. Conversely, more accurate sensor data would both improve the performance of existing systems and ease design requirements for future interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infrared sensor performance is a function of the target’s signature and the sensor’s resolution, sensitivity, and field of view. Both wide- and medium-field-of-view sensors share promise for fire control-quality tracking. In recent years, Congress has prudently scrutinized and sustained efforts to deploy fire control sensors, including the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), which is slated to transfer from the Missile Defense Agency to the Space Force around 2026. Whatever the sensor configuration and type, it is imperative that fire control efforts cross the valley of death and deploy at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Many of the technologies and programs to realize an elevated sensor architecture are in place, but a disciplined acquisition and systems engineering authority will be needed to align its many components. Policymakers must exert oversight to ensure schedule discipline, orbital and systems diversity, and continued attention to missile defense fire control requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Acquiring this new elevated sensor architecture will be an exercise in avoiding certain temptations. These include temptations to optimize global coverage efficiencies at the expense of schedule and resilience, to consolidate assets into a single orbital regime, and to abdicate fire control requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-elevated-sensing-imperative&quot;&gt;The Elevated Sensing Imperative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this new missile age, adversaries and allies alike are acquiring a broad spectrum of standoff capabilities. New and emerging categories of weapons include hypersonic glide vehicles, scramjet cruise missiles, maneuvering reentry vehicles, and orbital bombardment systems. These and other advanced missiles have become “weapons of choice” for competitors, who are conceiving new means to evade legacy missile defenses and hold critical assets at risk. The sophistication, diversity, and number of missile threats continue to advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere have confirmed the centrality of missile strike and the corresponding need for missile defense. As part of a comprehensive approach, active missile defenses have become foundational to broad deterrence and defense goals. Today’s missile defense capabilities, however, are coming under increasing stress. Today’s spectrum of threats leverage high speeds, unpredictable maneuvers, and different trajectories to exploit gaps and seams in legacy missile defenses. New classes of hypersonic missiles, for instance, threaten to underfly the radar horizons of surface-based radars, leaving insufficient time for a defender to react (Figure 1). One cannot defend against what one cannot see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contending with these threats will require specific attention to modernizing the sensor architecture. The missile defense enterprise requires elevated sensors to detect, identify, and track them before and after launch. Compared to surface-based sensors, those on satellites or aircraft offer longer lines of sight for tracking hypersonic and other advanced missile systems. As such, the 2022 Missile Defense Review noted that space-based sensing will be “critical to any future integrated sensor network.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevated sensing has thus become an acquisition priority for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Through its component Space Development Agency (SDA) and Space Systems Command (SSC), the U.S. Space Force has invested billions to acquire space-based sensors for missile warning and tracking (Figure 3). The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), meanwhile, is prototyping space sensors for missile defense fire control — the process of guiding interceptors to an incoming threat (Figure 2). These and other stakeholders have advanced different visions for the future sensor architecture. The question now is how to reconcile and implement these visions, and on what timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elevated-sensing-missions&quot;&gt;Elevated Sensing Missions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD is developing satellite constellations to perform multiple sensing missions, including missile warning, missile tracking, and fire control (Table 1). These lines of effort include the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) and Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking (RMW/MT) satellite constellations, which will recapitalize existing missile warning capabilities and track hypersonic and advanced missile threats throughout their trajectory, from birth to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While significant work on next-generation missile warning satellites continues, such efforts are not discussed here in detail. This report is instead focused on efforts to develop space-based missile tracking capabilities, especially for fire control — activities traditionally performed with ground- and sea-based radars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9oEcYdk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Missile Defense Space Assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Missile Defense Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States currently relies on the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites to provide global missile warning — persistent notification of missile launches in support of strategic nuclear deterrence and other defense and intelligence missions. As contributors to the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infrared Architecture (BOA), SBIRS and other sensors support the Missile Defense System (MDS) by providing early missile tracking data to cue its broader network of sensors. This initial detection sets the missile defense targeting process in motion, cueing a sophisticated network of ground and maritime radars to determine the positions, trajectories, and signatures of ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As incoming missiles continue to fly, the MDS synthesizes sensor measurement data into three-dimensional “tracks”: estimations of the missile’s position and trajectory. Different sensors deliver track information at different quality levels, with different degrees of latency and positional uncertainty, for different numbers of threat objects. These tracks must then be fused together into a single, trusted picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to know that some number of missiles have been launched and that they are headed in a general direction. It is another to know how many, where they will be at a given moment, and thus how to defeat them. Using sufficiently accurate tracking data, a missile defense system can develop a fire control solution, determining when to launch one or more interceptors, what trajectory the interceptors should travel, and other considerations for engaging the targets. “Fire control-quality” tracks are those with the position and time accuracy sufficient for a missile defense system to generate an intercept solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n02uRIk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Elevated Sensing Missions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical requirements for fire control-quality tracks are relative measures, contingent on the performance of other elements in the missile defense kill chain. Less stringent track data requirements would require interceptors with costlier, more capable seekers or more ability to maneuver to compensate for positional uncertainties. Conversely, more accurate sensor data would both improve the performance of existing systems and ease design requirements for future interceptors. General James Dickinson, commander of U.S. Space Command, recently noted that fire control-quality tracking “is going to determine the success or failure of whatever weapon system you’re employing to defeat that threat.” Realizing it is therefore “exceptionally important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the functions of future missile defense engagements will remain similar to those of the past, the characteristics of several new classes of missile threats will impose new requirements for the sensing architecture. Surface-based tracking of new and emergent maneuvering missile threats remains both useful and necessary for the spectrum of missile threats, but it is insufficient for some of the newer types. Earth’s geometry limits surface-based radar from detecting and engaging lower-flying targets, including hypersonic weapons. Given these new threats, missile defenses require elevated sensors for the missile tracking mission, and to do so with more highly detailed, lower-latency trajectory estimations to support the fire control mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Fire control-quality” tracks are those with the position and time accuracy sufficient for a missile defense system to generate an intercept solution.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving this vision will carry enormous challenges. The effective employment of fire control quality tracks will require new processing, networking, and sensor fusion capabilities to synthesize missile tracks and compute fire control solutions. Precise tracking furthermore demands attention to a wide variety of new threat signatures, the presence of background clutter, future countermeasures, and other challenges. Addressing these problems will be difficult, but it must be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements for the future elevated sensor architecture are tightly coupled with every other aspect of the missile defense kill chain. Sensor design requirements drive interceptor design requirements — the schedule for one affects the schedule for the other. Sensor capability may therefore be compared to a locomotive that pulls other missile defense capabilities forward. In the words of Frank Turner, technical director of the Space Development Agency, “Schedule is king. The train is going to leave the station on time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“In carrying out the analysis of candidate fire control architectures, the Secretary of the Air Force shall ensure that the Director of the Space Warfighting Analysis Center of the Space Force, at a minimum, maintains the requirements needed for the missile defense command and control, battle management, and communications system to pass the needed quality data within the timelines needed for current and planned interceptor systems to support engagements of ballistic and hypersonic threats.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unpacking-the-tradeoffs-art-and-science&quot;&gt;Unpacking the Tradeoffs: Art and Science&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a perfect sensor architecture design. Designing an elevated sensor architecture is rather an exercise in tradeoffs. There are, for instance, a multiplicity of trades among orbital altitudes and inclinations, sensor phenomenologies, and other variables. Assumptions about future threats to the architecture influence final design configurations and standards for survivability and resilience. Decisions about schedule, or when certain capabilities are necessary, likewise affect technical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this multiplicity of trades, architecture design is as much an art as a science. The application of this art in specific force designs reflects institutional and policy assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These system- and architecture-wide tradeoffs have been all too implicit in the public conversation about sensor architecture acquisition, presenting an oversight challenge. The number of considerations makes it difficult to define clear metrics for success, a challenge made more complex by the number of stakeholders involved and continual revisions made to their architectures. Clearer goalposts are needed to understand, align, and implement an acquisition strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unpacking these tradeoffs and assumptions — making them explicit — can help policymakers, budgeteers, and systems architects, and better inform the public discussion related to missile tracking and missile defense. Doing so is the purpose of this report. This report does not advocate a particular architecture but instead elaborates these tradeoffs, describes ongoing acquisition efforts, and identifies policy temptations to avoid. From these, three principles become relevant to the acquisition of a future architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given this multiplicity of trades, architecture design is as much an art as a science.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One principle is that &lt;strong&gt;an elevated sensor architecture should be diversified across multiple orbits and domains.&lt;/strong&gt; Technological advancements in commercial space have generated enthusiasm for proliferated, commoditized low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations. Surviving a peer threat, however, will demand more. Proliferating space sensors in LEO is one way to improve resilience, assuming large numbers and low-cost replacement. It is not the only way. Reliance on a single orbital regime, or on any single approach to resilience, invites disruption. LEO constellations can be degraded by area- or domain-wide effects, including electronic attack, nuclear or radiological means, and the intentional generation of debris. For further altitude diversification, a suborbital underlay of airborne sensors could improve point or regional coverage, hedge against schedule or capability gaps of orbiting sensors, and enhance overall system-level survivability. As tempting as it may be to consolidate acquisition efforts to one orbital domain, a multi-orbit and multi-domain architecture is likely to be more survivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another principle is that &lt;strong&gt;an elevated sensor architecture should deploy gracefully.&lt;/strong&gt; The deployment phasing of a new sensor architecture is as critical as its final delivery date. Some constellation designs do not generate persistent coverage until nearly all elements are deployed. For nearer-term coverage, especially for the lower latitudes of the Indo-Pacific, policymakers should be attentive to the pacing of sensor fielding, not only the final product — graceful deployment as well as graceful degradation. Lower-inclined orbits or airborne assets may be useful for early coverage of critical areas. Sensor fusion is another major and underappreciated source of schedule risk. More must be done to accelerate development of software and ground systems to knit these pieces together. Schedule is king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;an elevated sensor architecture must deliver fire control-quality tracking to support active missile defense.&lt;/strong&gt; Requirements for data quality should be developed in close connection with the characteristics and limitations of interceptors or other effectors. While much attention has been paid to developing elevated missile warning and missile tracking capabilities, Congress has prudently scrutinized and sustained efforts to deploy fire control sensors. Whether through the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), its derivatives, or some future wide-field-of-view sensor, it is necessary to accelerate and scale a fire control sensor network for the missile defense mission. In recent years, SDA has taken valuable additional steps to incorporate fire control sensors in its proliferated constellation. It is worth considering how to sustain this momentum and achieve fire control capability in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modeling-the-problem&quot;&gt;Modeling the Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s analysis is informed in large part by internal modeling and simulation conducted by the CSIS Missile Defense Project (MDP). The research team used ANSYS/AGI’s Systems Toolkit (STK) and Iroquois Systems/Lockheed Martin’s SMARTSet tools to model key tradeoffs in constellation design. Many of the images included resulted from optimization studies involving nearly a million simulations and numerous days of computing time. To speed this process, MDP acquired and assembled dedicated hardware to accelerate computing tasks. Further details on modeling and methodology are described in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team modeled constellation and sensor design tradeoffs in STK’s synthetic environment. To visualize the infrared signatures pictured in the report, MDP leveraged the STK Electro-optical Infrared (EOIR) simulation module, creating a scenario (Figure 4) to investigate hypersonic tracking challenges. To construct the scene, the team created original 3D models of notional hypersonic weapons (Figures 5 and 7) and imported and processed National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) infrared terrain data (Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MDP performed optimization studies to assess how different constellation designs could impact sensor coverage. The research team conducted basic assessments of altitude, coverage, and custody against hypersonic targets using SMARTSet and performed more detailed analyses with STK’s Analyzer tool, which can automatically test and evaluate design possibilities. Many of these analyses revolved around constellation designs and their impact on sensor coverage; these are pictured throughout the report. The number of potential designs evaluated encompassed nearly one million simulation runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies are useful for describing the tradeoffs at play in acquiring an elevated sensor architecture. It is a low-fidelity modeling effort, and intentionally so — meant to illustrate high-level principles rather than prescribe specific designs. Scenarios were constructed to be generalizable and reproducible, and to demonstrate the relationship between changing sensor fields of view, inclinations, altitudes, and other variables. The constellations and sensors described herein are not presented as recommendations. They are meant to inform the conversation and draw out unexamined assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sensor-tradeoffs&quot;&gt;Sensor Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any discussion of design tradeoffs must begin with the sensors themselves. Constellation designs for missile tracking are constrained by the performance of their sensors, which must be able to distinguish the signatures of hypersonic and ballistic weapons and resolve their positions accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although many approaches are possible, the United States has historically addressed the space-based missile sensing problem with infrared sensors, which passively detect the thermal signatures of threat missiles. Infrared and other electro-optical sensors can meet the demanding size, weight, and power requirements of space-based platforms and have continued to improve in resolution, sensitivity, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these technologies are mature, missile tracking and fire control with infrared sensors is more challenging than missile warning. Today’s geosynchronous missile warning sensors can detect the large, hot exhaust plumes of missiles as they launch but cannot provide detailed tracking information after this initial boost phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future missile tracking and fire control sensors must be capable of tracking hypersonic weapon signatures beyond the boost phase, where their infrared signatures diminish (Figure 8). Distinguishing a hypersonic heat signature against the Earth’s background has been likened to tracking “a slightly brighter candle in a sea of candles,” requiring extensive testing to validate.&lt;/p&gt;

Given the sensor’s resolution, the missile is too dim to visually distinguish from surrounding objects (top). Detecting them requires computational processing, in this case by compositing multiple frames and computing the motion of pixels (center). An enlarged crop of the false-color image at center emphasizes the extracted hypersonic signature (bottom). Further details are available in the appendix.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensors-field-of-view-and-architecture&quot;&gt;Sensors, Field of View, and Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other factors affect the number and configuration of sensor platforms in an architecture. By flying lower than hypersonic and ballistic weapons, air-based sensors offer advantageous views of hot hypersonic weapons against cold space backdrops — but lack the extended sightlines of space-based sensors. Space sensor constellations, meanwhile, must be carefully optimized for a variety of factors, including solar exclusion (viewing angles where sunlight overwhelms the sensor), orbital dynamics, and other variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An infrared sensor architecture must also be sized to ensure coverage by two sensors at once. Unlike with radar, a single infrared imaging sensor cannot resolve a target’s position in three dimensions. Two sensors — simultaneously viewing the target — are needed to triangulate a three-dimensional track of a missile’s altitude, position, and heading (Figure 12). Stereo (two-sensor) or greater tracking is a baseline requirement for infrared sensor constellations. Additional redundancy may be needed to account for survivability constraints, maintenance downtime, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most critically, each sensor’s FOR can affect the number of satellites necessary for a space-based sensing constellation. Sensors with a wide FOR can view a wider area of Earth’s surface, either by pivoting across a wide swath or by possessing a wide-angle optic (Figure 13). Even relatively minor changes in FOR can have considerable effects on coverage footprint and, consequently, the number of required satellites (Figure 14). For instance, a given 91-satellite constellation at 1,000 km can provide persistent global coverage with a 120-degree FOR but cannot do so with 110-degree or 100-degree FORs (Figures 16 and 17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Hq8Fqmt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 13: Satellite Field of Regard.&lt;/strong&gt; The three satellites visualized are in low Earth orbit (1,000 km) and have total sensor fields of regard of 100, 110, and 118 degrees, respectively. At this altitude, the curvature of the Earth limits increases in line of sight beyond 120 degrees. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HJGaQFZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting wider FORs reduces the number of satellites needed for coverage, but doing so imposes additional requirements on the sensor itself. For fixed sensors, increasing sensor FOR requires an increase in the sensor field of view (FOV), the angle of view immediately viewable by the sensor. In other words, fixed-sensor FOR and FOV are identical. The Space Development Agency’s Tracking Layer satellites leverage fixed sensors — its Tranche 0 satellites are required to possess a FOR/FOV of 70 to 110 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sensor’s FOR can be larger than its FOV if it is mechanically pointed (slewed) to view a wider area. This approach is technically mature and was leveraged in past efforts, such as in the Precision Tracking Space System and SBIRS missile-warning satellites (Figure 19). Mechanical slewing allows a narrower-FOV sensor to offer a large possible coverage — or access — footprint at the cost of mechanical complexity and challenges in managing vibration, pointing error, and slewing time. As these sensors cannot view every part of their FOR at once, they introduce additional considerations for tracking large numbers of targets in various regions: on which targets to view, in what order, and how rapidly to revisit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tradeoffs — between fixed and slewing, wide and narrow — are important because changes in sensor FOV affect detection performance. Holding all factors equal, increasing a sensor’s FOV will increase its pixel footprint, as each pixel on the sensor’s focal plane array (FPA) corresponds to a wider swath of the Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qz7StYi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 15: Pixel Footprint, Field of View, and Sensitivity Tradeoffs.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger pixel footprints, in turn, make it more challenging to track missile targets (Figure 14). Because hypersonic signatures are smaller than most sensor pixel footprints, their location becomes more difficult to distinguish as the pixel footprint expands (Figure 15). Moreover, larger pixel footprints increasingly “dilute” the brightness of the hypersonic signature with the signature of the surrounding terrain. The problem is akin to detecting a cup of boiling water poured into a swimming pool; a smaller pixel footprint is akin to detecting that same cup poured into a bucket. Holding all else equal, FOV influences performance and drives design decisions between slewed and fixed sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/M0mKxjL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 16: Field of Regard and Coverage: 100-, 110-, and 120-Degree Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; These three-dimensional views illustrate the stereo sensor coverage of a 91-satellite, 1,000 km altitude constellation. Stereo coverage, the minimum necessary, is depicted in yellow; red areas represent simultaneous coverage by eight or more satellites.

&lt;p&gt;Sensors with either narrower FOVs or more pixels can minimize these pixel footprints, thereby improving detection performance. Developments in wide-field-of-view (WFOV) sensors have been driven by developments in large-format FPAs with higher pixel counts: infrared sensors with 4,000 pixel-by-4,000 pixel (4K), 6K, 8K, or higher resolutions (Figure 18). Space Systems Command’s testbed geosynchronous WFOV satellite, for instance, leverages a large-format FPA with a 4K resolution. Early Tranche 0 technical requirements call for fixed sensors with an objective FOV of roughly 110 degrees and a pixel footprint of under 1.5 km, necessitating large FPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infrared sensor industry has continued to develop larger FPA formats, which allow the use of wider FOVs without performance compromise. But there may be some missions where WFOV, fixed-sensor approaches are challenging. The Missile Defense Agency’s HBTSS satellites, for instance, will use a mechanically slewed medium-FOV (MFOV) sensor to shrink pixel footprints and allow fine-grained, fire control-quality missile tracking. Choices between fixed WFOV and slewing MFOV sensors are dependent on the availability, maturity, and cost of these large-format FPAs. In the near term, smaller-format FPAs are available at larger quantities and lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size and performance of a constellation thus depends on these interlocking choices: between fixed and slewing sensors, sensor FOV, FPA format, and other factors. Maximizing sensor FOR allows a designer to minimize the satellites necessary for coverage. Doing so demands fixed sensors with wider fields of view or slewing sensors with narrower ones. System architects must balance a complex set of variables, each of which influences nearly every other aspect of the system (Figure 20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-sensor-types&quot;&gt;Alternative Sensor Types&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrared sensors are not the only means of tracking missiles from space. Hypersonic weapons emit unique signatures that can be exploited. Alternative sensor modalities, including hyperspectral and radiofrequency sensors, might therefore play important roles. A future sensor architecture could leverage multiple sensor types to track hypersonic and other advanced missile threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperspectral or ultraviolet sensors, capable of viewing alternative bands of light, could be relevant for detecting hypersonic weapons’ novel signatures. In hypersonic flight, an object’s surface reacts with high-temperature airflow to release a wake of ions, gases, particles, and other chemical byproducts. These byproducts and their signatures might be detectable in infrared and alternative spectra (Figure 22). As with hypersonic defense, “the same characteristics that make hypersonic weapons attractive present the defender with new failure modes to exploit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Infrared sensors are not the only means of tracking missiles from space.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radiofrequency sensors might offer further utility. Radar offers many advantages: its principles are well understood, it can propagate through complex weather conditions, and it can instantaneously gather target velocity data. Radars have become increasingly sophisticated and efficient; emerging multistatic and multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) radar technologies might offer additional utilities to the space-based hypersonic tracking problem. In addition to active methods, it may be possible to passively intercept radio emissions from data-linked missiles. The 2022 Missile Defense Review notably stated that global and persistent “space-based . . . radar . . . systems will be critical to any future integrated sensor network.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6FZzfOC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 22: Booster Plume Signatures and Hypersonic Plasma.&lt;/strong&gt; Solid rocket boosters used to launch hypersonic weapons generate detectable infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) signatures. The simulated plume signature (top) represents a broad range of physical phenomena, including the hot gas flow from the booster, external hypersonic airflow, the combusted gas and alumina particles from the burning motor, and the phase change of alumina particles. A hypersonic weapon in its glide phase encounters similarly complex interactions, generating novel wake signatures. Plasmas generated around the hypersonic weapon surface, for instance, react with gas products and particles burned off the vehicle surface (bottom). The bottom image represents plasma formation around a Mach 16, 50 km altitude hypersonic shape. Source: Iain D. Boyd, H.T. Sears Memorial Professor and Director of Center for National Security Initiatives, University of Colorado, Boulder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, infrared and other types of electro-optical sensors have continued to improve. Infrared focal plane arrays, sensor readouts, and their cooling systems have become increasingly reliable and affordable; new developments might allow simplified configurations that do not require cryogenic cooling. Furthermore, the maturation of large-format infrared FPAs are allowing increases in FOV without corresponding resolution losses (Figure 21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is scoped to the infrared sensors being acquired today. But hypersonic weapons present novel signatures, enabling new approaches to detection and tracking. Provided that sensor fusion challenges can be resolved, a future architecture should integrate advancements in infrared FPAs, multispectral and radiofrequency sensors, and other means. Combining these multiple types will allow greater persistence and capability if one type is degraded, whether from environmental conditions, enemy deception, or other means of signature reduction. While it may be possible to evade one part of the electromagnetic spectrum, it is harder to evade several of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orbital-tradeoffs&quot;&gt;Orbital Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensor performance influences the number of assets necessary to provide coverage, but there are other tradeoffs to consider. “No absolute rules” govern the design of an optimal constellation. It is possible to track hypersonic weapons from many orbits given the correct selection of sensor payloads. At the same time, better design points exist for meeting current and future threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter reviews relevant orbits for missile sensing and identifies how they could be mixed to generate efficiencies. Basic changes in altitude and domain can impact every other aspect of performance. A more resilient constellation should mix orbits and domains in ways that maximize the advantages of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;low-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Low Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marked advances in space launch and satellite manufacturing have made low Earth orbits (LEO) increasingly popular for deploying satellite constellations. Legacy satellite programs often struggled with a “vicious circle between high reliability and high costs.” High unit costs incentivized the use of expensive components to prevent failure, and the use of expensive components contributed to high unit cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent declines in launch cost have enabled a paradigm shift in constellation design (Figure 23). Commercial actors have broken vicious cost-reliability cycles by embracing rapid replenishment over exquisite designs. As it becomes more affordable to place satellites in orbit, it becomes possible to proliferate larger numbers of satellites, which in turn enables economies of scale in satellite manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9lX9jcx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;

A bubble’s size corresponds to the number of successful orbital launches achieved by that vehicle as of December 31, 2019. Source: CSIS Aerospace Security Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift has made LEO orbits increasingly popular for commercial applications. Of the over 6,700 satellites in orbit, over 80 percent now operate in the LEO regime, where their proximity to Earth suits them for high-resolution remote sensing and low-latency communications. This philosophy — a proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) architecture — has informed recent approaches to national defense space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EFFECTS OF PROXIMITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematics of proximity operate in favor of LEO satellite constellations. At LEO altitudes — between 400 and 2,000 km above Earth — even smaller sensors can provide high-resolution imagery of Earth’s surface. Further distances demand larger apertures; aperture limits the maximum resolution attainable by an infrared sensor (Figure 24). Holding other parameters constant, a sensor placed in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) requires an aperture several times larger to attain comparable resolution to one orbiting at 500 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optical apertures are a significant driver of satellite cost. Smaller apertures are less costly to manufacture and can reduce the structural mass needed to ensure the vehicle withstands harsh shocks during launch. In turn, a reduction in satellite mass allows for lighter reaction wheels to orient the vehicle, lighter motors for keeping it in orbit, and correspondingly lower launch costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0552np1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;

Left: A view of the target with a notional extremely large aperture. Center: 60 cm aperture (center), and with 30 cm aperture (right). Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximity of LEO also presents several drawbacks. At these distances, the perceived motion between satellite, target, and background becomes more pronounced. This relative motion can introduce motion blur to the target picture. Sensors that take longer to collect light are more sensitive and more susceptible to motion blurring as the weapon and background move across the frame (Figure 25). Shorter collection (“integration”) times, meanwhile, can more effectively “freeze” fast-moving objects, but with a cost to sensitivity and detection range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9Dpghby.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 25: Motion Blur and Jitter Effects.&lt;/strong&gt; A static hypersonic weapon-sized target, imaged from low Earth orbit, with a 35 cm aperture, appears as a blurred point source for an infrared sensor (left). Center: The same target displays motion streaking when accounting for sensor integration time: in this case, for 10 milliseconds (center). This streak becomes blurred when accounting for additional sensor vibration and jitter (right). Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitigating blur and jitter in infrared sensors involves a careful balancing act. Doing so requires FPAs with high sensitivities, readout circuits and image processors with higher data throughput, and algorithms tailored for target signatures with high relative motion. While feasible to overcome, the problem can be made easier by incorporating sensors in higher orbits or leveraging alternative phenomenologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closeness of LEO satellites also limits their coverage. Compared to satellites at higher altitudes, they possess shorter horizon-limited lines of sight and persist for less time over a given point on Earth’s surface (Figure 26). More satellites will be needed to ensure that two are continuously overhead. While it is possible to achieve infrequent coverage with a small number of satellites, it takes significant numbers to make that coverage persistent (Figures 27 and 28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related consideration for LEO constellation design and cost is the higher replenishment rates required over their life cycle. Drag from the upper reaches of Earth’s atmosphere slows satellites in orbit, requiring more propulsion to maintain their station. At 600 km, the natural lifespan of a generic satellite orbit is approximately 15 years, but this falls dramatically to under one year at 400 km (Table 2). The Space Development Agency (SDA)’s Tracking Layer Tranche 0 satellites, for instance, have requirements for minimum operational lifetimes of four to five years, rather than the decades possible at higher orbits (Figure 29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RDeKMcF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image30&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Approximate Orbital Lifespan (King-Hele) of 0.01m2/kg Object with Average Solar Activity.&lt;/strong&gt; Low Earth orbit lifespans differ significantly, especially at lower altitudes, with different propulsion and station-keeping systems, satellite size, density, drag, and solar activity levels.

&lt;p&gt;Building a high replenishment cadence into a constellation’s life cycle is not entirely a disadvantage. The higher replenishment cadence of LEO constellations enables alternative philosophies to constellation design and the space industrial base. There is less need to overengineer for reliability, for instance, if a satellite’s lifespan is capped at five years. The consistent need for replenishment creates consistent demand for satellite production, keeping production lines hot, enabling economies of scale, and building a resilient defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xlFQGEG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image31&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 29: Space Development Agency Planned Constellation Life Cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; The number of satellites in orbit does not remain constant because as more are launched, others degrade. Satellites launched in FY 2024, for instance, begin to deorbit in FY 2029, causing fluctuations in the total figures. Further launches in FY 2029 and FY 2031 both expand and replenish the planned low Earth orbit constellation. Source: Space Development Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High replenishment rates also permit new technologies to be “spiraled in” as older satellites deorbit. Long-lived satellites are often constructed with excess capability to ensure their relevance decades in the future; shorter-lived satellites can be designed as minimum viable products, intended for replacement as technologies and requirements evolve. Increased costs — in launching more satellites and more frequently replenishing them — must be balanced against the savings associated with agile development, manufacturing at scale, and lower relative launch costs compared to higher orbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SYSTEMIC THREATS TO PROLIFERATED LOW EARTH ORBIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological advancements in commercial space have generated enthusiasm for pLEO constellations. In 2019, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin established SDA for the express purpose of acquiring such constellations. In recent years, pLEO has become the watchword of space sensor acquisition. It embraces the notion that quantity has a quality all its own, with resilience achieved through numerical proliferation, measured both by the number of satellites currently deployed and those that could be reconstituted. An effective pLEO architecture promises to invert the cost asymmetries of traditional counterspace operations; the potential to make it more costly to destroy LEO satellites than to launch them has informed the emphasis on pLEO in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversary counterspace capabilities, however, should not be underestimated. A pLEO architecture provides resilience to certain kinds of counterspace threats but not others (Figure 30). Indeed, putting all one’s eggs in the LEO basket may incur risks: vulnerability to systemic threats that affect the entire orbital regime. “We don’t want to become so dependent or so vulnerable, potentially, in the pLEO,” General James Dickinson of U.S. Space Command has warned, “as opposed to having a diversification, where you have capabilities and different orbital regimes [to] rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bmZdG83.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 30: Counterspace Threats.&lt;/strong&gt; Direct-ascent anti-satellite, co-orbital, and ground site attacks all can be difficult to scale against increasingly proliferated constellation designs. Nuclear effects and cyberattacks could paralyze large segments of proliferated constellations at once. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These systemic threats — threats that exploit a failure mode common to the entire architecture — merit further consideration. Cyberattacks against a constellation’s control systems or nuclear detonations in space could disable many satellites at once. The growing density of space debris in LEO is an additional cause for concern, and one that is increasingly difficult to mitigate. Even if the cost of individual kinetic anti-satellite (ASAT) attacks exceeds the cost of launching additional LEO satellites, the debris generated from these engagements could make those orbits challenging to reconstitute. It is simpler to proliferate and reconstitute in LEO, but also potentially simpler to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Putting all one’s eggs in the LEO basket may incur risks: vulnerability to systemic threats that affect the entire orbital regime.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks remain a persistent area threat for any distributed architecture, whether in LEO, medium Earth orbit (MEO), GEO, or highly elliptical orbit (HEO). Software to orchestrate so many satellites at once — for orbital maintenance, collision avoidance, data transport, and tasking — presents a large attack surface for potential intrusions. While difficult to characterize, cyberattacks represent a critical area threat and a major risk category for all national security satellite architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less discussed are the area threats posed by nuclear explosions in space or at high altitudes (Figure 31). Nuclear explosions cause many immediate damaging effects: the pulse of thermal, x-ray, and other radiation can damage nearby satellites and blind their sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An even greater concern, however, is nuclear pumping, a phenomenon where nuclear radiation lingers in the LEO environment (Figure 32). In LEO, Earth’s geomagnetic field would contain many of the charged particles emitted by a nuclear explosion; instead of radiating outward, these particles could spiral around the globe and damage large numbers of satellites. A 2002 Ballistic Missile Defense Organization analysis assessed that “a precursor high altitude nuclear burst could do significant damage to satellites,” with “pumped-up Van Allen belts [posing] a concern for satellite longevity” and “not well understood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radiation left in these belts could make it challenging to maintain and reconstitute a pLEO constellation. Indeed, while it is less costly to proliferate and reconstitute LEO constellations, more attention must be paid to these systemic threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LYvPV4j.png&quot; alt=&quot;image33&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third concern is the increasing population of satellites and debris in LEO. The growing popularity of these orbits have made it challenging to avoid collisions (Figure 33). Between December 2022 and May 2023, satellites in the commercial Starlink constellation performed over 25,000 collision-avoidance maneuvers, representing roughly half of the number of Starlink maneuvers since 2019. These debris fields could densify after a large-scale attack. Debris generated in just three ASAT missile tests account for 15 percent of tracked debris in LEO. While Starlink satellites orbit lower than planned national security LEO constellations, it is emblematic of a larger problem: growing debris fields could threaten future operations, forcing collision-avoidance maneuvers that consume fuel and disrupt coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These systemic threats could be difficult to attribute or deter. Cyberattacks generate attribution challenges that complicate potential responses. Intentional debris generation can be deniable: a debris field, generated by a foreign kinetic ASAT test, could be justified as a peacetime operation but be as disruptive to operations as a direct, unambiguous attack. Adversaries might even detonate a nuclear device over their own territory under the pretense of a test. Chinese scientific organizations have reportedly begun to reassess similar options to counter U.S. satellite constellations. Despite the damage their effects could cause, these deniable, systemic threats challenge the United States’ ability to devise a proportional response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/30PrKUT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore useful to examine other orbital regimes, including MEO and airborne domains, which could complement LEO’s advantages and help mitigate these vulnerabilities. A survivable sensor constellation would likely incorporate assets in multiple orbits, reducing the impact of such area-wide attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;medium-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Medium Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placing satellites in higher orbits can offer coverage and survivability advantages not achievable from LEO alone. Operating at higher altitudes allows each satellite to view a larger swath of Earth’s surface, reducing the numbers necessary for global coverage (Figures 34 and 35). MEO, a family of orbits between 2,000 and 35,999 km from Earth’s surface, offers several attractive design points for satellite constellations. By moving a satellite’s orbit from 1,000 to 10,000 km, for example, a satellite’s detection footprint against low-flying hypersonic targets is roughly quadrupled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IvlwUlg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image36&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 34: Satellites Needed for Geometric, Two-Satellite Global Coverage.&lt;/strong&gt; This graphic illustrates the relationship between altitude and the theoretical minimum number of satellites required for stereo coverage. Operational constellations would require considerably greater numbers of satellites at every altitude when considering sensor field of regard, solar exclusion, maintenance, and power factors. Geometric coverage minimums were derived from CSIS parametric analysis. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These substantial gains in viewable area, and the slower relative motion of these satellites across Earth’s surface, have made these orbits useful for navigational satellites, where large numbers must be in view at once. The Global Positioning System (GPS), with roughly 31 satellites in a 20,000 km orbit, allows for every point on Earth to be reachable by four or more satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MP3C6ic.png&quot; alt=&quot;image37&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEO satellites represent only a small fraction of satellites currently in orbit. This is because of the high radiation levels in the MEO environment. Earth’s geomagnetic field traps high-energy particles from the Sun and other sources, creating several belts of elevated radiation. In some scenarios, dosages in this regime can exceed 50 rad daily, a dosage equivalent to roughly 16 abdominal CT scans. This harsh operating regime introduces challenges for constellation designers. While MEO represents a large set of possible orbits, most MEO constellations operate in a smaller number of “sweet spot” altitudes and inclinations, such as at 10,000 km, where radiation is lowest (Figure 36).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KBLqXEp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image38&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 36: Radiation Fluxes on Orbit.&lt;/strong&gt; Representative orbits at 1,000 km (LEO), 10,000 km (MEO), 20,000 km (MEO), and 36,000 km (GEO). The highest fluxes are indicated by red coloration. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project with data from NASA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without hardening, these fluxes can significantly degrade a satellite’s subsystems. The interaction of solar winds and free ions in this environment can charge spacecraft components and cause unintended electrical interference. High-energy particles can degrade coatings and solar panels on the spacecraft surface and damage electronics and detector arrays within a spacecraft (Figure 37). These issues remain a concern for national security satellite constellations; unexpected radiation levels impacted availability of satellites in the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS), for instance, which orbited at high LEO altitudes of roughly 1,350 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iWIpReL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image39&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 37: Effects of Increased Solar Radiation on Satellite Imaging Sensor.&lt;/strong&gt; False-color image of the Sun taken by solar probe before (left) and (after) a solar radiation spike on October 28 and 29, 2003. Radiation can cause additional noise and false pixels to appear on imaging sensors, requiring specialized packaging and software to mitigate. Source: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, radiation can disrupt a satellite’s control circuitry. Computer processors and memory degrade over time with exposure to radiation. In addition to this total-dose-induced damage, they are susceptible to single-event effects, where charged particles strike a logic gate or memory cell and change its state from one to zero (“bit flip”) or prevent it from switching altogether (“stuck bit”). These in turn can cause malfunctions or permanent damage. Mitigating this often requires dedicated circuitry and software to correct errors or specialized, radiation-hardened circuits, which are typically slower and more costly than commercial equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While challenging, these environments confer some survivability benefits. Their greater distance, relative to LEO, places them out of reach of some lower-tier ASAT weapons; attacking MEO assets with a direct-ascent weapon, for instance, would take a significantly larger missile and a substantially longer time. While still vulnerable to prompt nuclear effects, the MEO environment faces relatively less of a nuclear-pumping challenge — moreover, as MEO satellites must already be hardened to withstand elevated radiation, those costs can be amortized for mitigating nuclear effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative sparsity of the MEO environment, finally, can be conducive to monitoring co-orbital ASAT threats. Co-orbital weapons, placed into similar orbits as MEO satellites, are a common approach to kinetically attacking MEO and further orbits. With roughly 3 percent of spacecraft orbiting in MEO, it may be relatively easier to observe, distinguish, and counter suspicious behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geosynchronous-and-highly-elliptical-orbits&quot;&gt;Geosynchronous and Highly Elliptical Orbits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geosynchronous orbits, at roughly 36,000 km from Earth, require even fewer satellites to achieve persistent coverage. At this distance, satellites orbiting the equator stay effectively stationary over a fixed point on Earth’s surface, orbiting at the same rate as Earth turns. No other orbit can provide a similar level of persistence — at the cost of placing satellites at an extreme distance. Current and forthcoming missile warning satellites, including SBIRS and Next Gen OPIR, occupy these orbits, where persistent coverage is achievable with only a small number of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OKN1P9t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image40&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 38: Depiction of the SBIRS and DSP Architecture.&lt;/strong&gt; The Space Based Infrared System incorporates geosynchronous and highly elliptical polar satellites. GEO satellites offer latitudinal and longitudinal persistence by orbiting at the same rate that the Earth rotates. To maintain this persistence, the orbits must be close to the equator. A pair of polar satellites, meanwhile, can offer persistent coverage of at least one satellite over the poles. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellites in highly elliptical orbits offer similar advantages, offering persistent, staring coverage near Earth’s poles. In such orbits, satellites come within several hundred kilometers of Earth before swinging far into space, often tens of thousands of kilometers away. As a HEO satellite approaches the highest point in its orbit — the apogee — its velocity slows, allowing it to “hang” over a specific region for longer than the time spent at the lowest point, the perigee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minimum of two HEO satellites is necessary to provide continuous coverage of Earth’s high-latitude regions. When combined with equatorial GEO satellites, which offer persistence at most lower latitudes, only a few satellites become needed to provide whole-Earth coverage. The SBIRS missile warning constellation, for example, includes six GEO satellites to provide coverage of most latitudes, and two highly elliptical polar satellites to maintain custody of the North Pole and upper Northern Hemisphere (Figures 38 and 39).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D5hdEAx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image41&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 39: SBIRS-HEO Sensor View of a Boosting Rocket.&lt;/strong&gt; Image degraded for declassification. Source: U.S. Air Force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extreme distances of these constellations introduce novel operational considerations. Much larger apertures are needed to image targets at high resolution. As such, it becomes challenging to perform more detailed sensing missions, including midcourse and boost-phase tracking. Radio signals and light can take up to 220 milliseconds to reach the sensor of a satellite in GEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch costs for the requisite geostationary transfer orbits, moreover, are often double to triple the price of launches to LEO. GEO and polar satellites, designed with fuel to travel from such transfer orbits to their final positions, take longer to place on orbit, and often require larger structures. While fewer satellites are needed for coverage, each unit can become costly to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems in these higher orbits, however, can be more difficult to target with some ASAT weapons. It is expensive to acquire direct-ascent missiles capable of targeting systems in GEO; competitors have instead developed sophisticated co-orbital weapons capable of hiding and persisting in geosynchronous orbits. While the popularity of geosynchronous orbits makes it simpler to conceal co-orbital weapons systems, HEO systems, with their high speeds and fewer numbers, may be harder to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;airborne-architectures&quot;&gt;Airborne Architectures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the conversation about elevated sensors has thus far revolved around space-based platforms. This emphasis is understandable and indeed necessary for achieving persistent, global coverage. But airborne platforms may also have a role to play. The United States could risk a gap in capability if space constellations do not come online as scheduled or if other problems develop. Several factors counsel an exploration of airborne sensors for missile tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne sensor platforms are mature and, despite their smaller coverage footprints, could generate persistent sensing capability in ways that spacecraft cannot, particularly for specific defended locations, such as the National Capital Region, Okinawa, or Guam. While limited to regional applications, airborne sensors could serve an interim system, backfilling coverage while a space constellation is deployed. Additionally, airborne sensors might serve as an underlay for space sensors, increasing coverage density in these critical regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OPPORTUNISM OR PERSISTENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to conceptualize an airborne underlay: as an opportunistic, occasional capability, and as a persistent architecture. Several aircraft in service possess a residual capability to detect and track ballistic missiles opportunistically. In Desert Storm, for example, Air Force F-15s could occasionally detect Scud missile launches during their strike missions but lacked the weapons to engage them or the endurance to patrol for extended periods of time. More recently, in 2012, an F-35 was able to detect a NASA space launch in its initial phases using onboard infrared sensors at distances of up to 1,481 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tIWLcRJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image42&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 40: NASA ATREX Flight Even.&lt;/strong&gt; Footage from the F-35 AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System infrared sensor. During the test, an F-35 tracked several multi-stage rockets with its radar and infrared sensors. Source: Northrop Grumman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opportunistic approach might integrate these existing platforms into the Missile Defense System (MDS). Fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-35, have already demonstrated the ability to communicate fire control-quality tracking information to surface-based missile defenses (Figure 40). While such capabilities cannot persistently cover a defended region and may be called for other mission areas, more could be done to develop the doctrine and datalinks to weave existing sensor assets into the MDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more robust approach would be to incorporate a persistent airborne underlay for defending critical locations such as Guam. The systems needed for this mission would require long endurances and would ideally fly at higher altitudes than fighter aircraft, allowing for further lines of sight. Such aircraft, equipped with longer-range sensors, would maintain fixed orbits — or combat air patrols (CAPs) — over a position, with enough aircraft in inventory to maintain one or more aloft at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jO21eBb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 41: Multispectral Target System.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Missile Defense Agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such elements have been a recurring feature of boost-phase missile defense designs but are relevant to many other missions, including hypersonic missile defense. Relevant airborne missile-tracking capabilities have already been demonstrated. Between 2015 and 2017, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) used a pair of multispectral-sensor-equipped MQ-9 uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) to track ballistic and cruise missiles (Figure 41). Flying at a 12.8 km altitude, the pair of aircraft tracked intermediate- and medium-range ballistic missiles from over 1,000 km away. An orbit of modestly persistent sensor aircraft — drones, high-altitude balloons, or others — could contribute to the defense of regional assets in concert with a space sensor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SIZING A CONSTELLATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with space architectures, designing a persistent airborne sensor layer is an inexact art with few absolute rules. Designers must reconcile the number of aircraft required, their individual cost and performance, the locations of possible CAPs, and the bases where aircraft are stored and maintained to construct a viable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these considerations, an aircraft’s operating altitude is especially critical. Higher-flying systems can offer further viewing horizons against low-flying targets and other sensing and survivability advantages. Hypersonic weapons flying at 20 km will enter a 15 km-altitude aircraft’s line of sight at 950 km — roughly 65 percent farther than a ground-based sensor (Figure 42). Moreover, high altitudes offer clearer atmospheric conditions for optical transmission, potentially easing the employment of infrared and other electro-optical sensors. Aircraft flying at altitudes above 10 km may also be difficult to engage with lower-tier surface-to-air missiles, offering survivability advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CTiGXhk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image44&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 42: Detection Ranges of Surface and Airborne Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Surface-based sensors (left) cannot detect low-flying targets at longer distances. Elevating the sensor altitude from sea level to a 15 km-altitude aircraft (right) allows for substantially increased viewable distance. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An equally important consideration is aircraft endurance. Long-endurance aircraft are critical to minimize the fleet size and other associated costs needed to maintain a CAP. High-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) aircraft, such as the RQ-4, and medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) aircraft, such as the MQ-9B, can offer endurances of over 24 hours, increasing the time spent on station or reducing requirements for aerial refueling. Prior analyses have estimated that roughly 3 to 4 MQ-9B aircraft could maintain a persistent CAP, with a force-level quantity of up to 17, including spares, needed to maintain three continuous CAPs for up to 270 days per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleet size requirements are also affected by the location of airbases relative to CAP locations. The further the CAP is from an airbase, the longer each aircraft must spend transiting to the patrol region, reducing the fuel available to be on station. Transit time can dramatically increase the numbers required to maintain persistent coverage, holding other factors equal. Achieving the smallest fleet possible will require permissive basing and overflight requirements to minimize the flyout distances needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;finding-the-right-mix&quot;&gt;Finding the Right Mix&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense is currently moving toward a multi-orbit architecture in LEO, MEO, GEO, and HEO. These developments acknowledge how efficiencies in some orbits offset inefficiencies in another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEO constellations benefit from proliferation and economies of scale but suffer challenges with persistence, orbital lifespan, and relative motion. MEO constellations offer more coverage and persistence but require potentially costlier satellites with larger apertures and radiation-hardened subsystems. GEO and HEO satellites provide unique coverage characteristics, requiring few satellites to selectively cover a given pole or longitude, but generate high unit costs and stringent reliability requirements. Airborne sensors can generate persistence unbounded by spacecraft orbital mechanics but have smaller detection footprints and require appropriate basing locations to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models depicted herein highlight these tradeoffs and the possible benefits of leveraging hybrid architectures — constellations with multiple orbital altitudes. LEO constellations in efficient, highly inclined orbits, for example, tend to under-cover areas near the equator, including critical parts of the Indo-Pacific region. MEO assets, orbiting about the equator, could usefully complement these configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constellation designed for equatorial and mid-latitude coverage, by contrast, might be supplemented with HEO assets that could selectively cover the poles. A combination of assets in different orbital bands, with their different levels of relative motion and viewing angles, might ease the challenge of tracking hypersonic and ballistic targets, whose thermal signatures vary significantly based on background and sensor viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configurations combining multiple orbital altitudes can add resilience and scale without dramatically increasing the number of orbital planes necessary. These models are illustrative: they do not depict ideal constellation designs, nor do they depict the redundancies needed for survivability. They rather demonstrate how orbits could be mixed to cover priority regions more efficiently. As acknowledged by Michael Griffin, former undersecretary of defense for research and engineering and a leading proponent of proliferated low Earth orbit constellations, an effective architecture should be “as widely distributed [as possible] over many choices of orbital regimes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADDRESSING LEO INDO-PACIFIC COVERAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-inclination LEO constellation optimized for global coverage will produce the least coverage in latitudes near the equator. These latitudes, however, are most relevant for the Indo-Pacific theater. It is often more costly to add additional orbital planes (rings) than it is to add more satellites to a given orbital plane, as this requires separate launches to take place. One approach to enhance coverage of these latitudes could be to add a single equatorial orbital plane with eight satellites, at MEO (10,000 km) (Figure 43).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LGPt5oi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image45&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second illustrative design, with 36 LEO satellites and a single, 8-satellite MEO plane, puts this principle in sharper relief (Figure 44). MEO satellites are used exclusively to provide coverage to mid-latitudes, while a highly inclined LEO constellation provides persistent coverage of the higher latitudes and poles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SELECTIVE POLAR COVERAGE WITH HIGHLY ELLIPTICAL ORBIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HEO satellites offer the unique ability to selectively cover a single pole; as most threats transit the Northern Hemisphere, it allows constellation designs that do not “waste” coverage. A constellation of four HEO satellites can provide persistent stereo coverage of the polar regions, useful for missile warning. A mixed constellation of eight MEO satellites in an equatorial orbit and four HEO satellites illustrates this selective coverage capability (Figure 45).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid constellations can combine their coverage hotspots to increase emphasis on critical regions. A LEO constellation with lower inclinations can provide dense coverage of the Indo-Pacific region, while a smaller constellation of MEO and HEO assets can provide an additional layer of resilience and selective emphasis on the poles (Figure 46). Meanwhile, a dense constellation, combining a polar-region-heavy LEO constellation and an Indo-Pacific-weighted MEO constellation, achieves robust, uniform coverage with 165 satellites (Figure 47).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;schedule-tradeoffs&quot;&gt;Schedule Tradeoffs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No single orbit presents an ideal set of launch costs, satellite configurations, and coverage for missile tracking and fire control. A sensor architecture design must optimize a large collection of intersecting variables, including sensor field of regard (FOR), altitude, inclination, and satellite unit cost, among others. Most attention has been paid to optimizing these elements to minimize the number of satellites needed for coverage, but there are other goals to consider. An architecture must also be optimized to meet useful schedules and to phase capability in ways relevant to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Program schedule and capability phasing should receive more consideration in current acquisition efforts. Choices over orbital configurations not only affect final sensor coverage but how coverage develops over time. Two constellation designs that eventually produce identical coverage may not necessarily generate capability along the same timelines (Figure 48).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, capability may not come online in smooth or continuous increments. Many low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation designs, for instance, leverage multiple orbital planes with high inclinations — inclinations close to the poles — to provide regional and later, global coverage. These designs are optimized to minimize the number of satellites necessary for coverage and do not provide persistent coverage of lower latitudes until all orbital planes are deployed (Figures 49, 50, and 51). Notably, the Space Development Agency (SDA)’s early Tranche 0 and Tranche 1 LEO constellations are configured with high-inclination orbits. The cost of these high inclinations to capability phasing is not always made explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l2Ej1v9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image50&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 48: Alternative Capability Phasing.&lt;/strong&gt; Two space-based architectures (“A” and “B”) may deliver identical capability when completed but phase this capability on different timelines. Architecture B generates partial capability later but full capability earlier. These tradeoffs should be considered when contemplating two otherwise identical architectures. They should also impact considerations for secondary constellations or airborne underlays to fill gaps in capability phasing. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Choices over orbital configurations not only affect final sensor coverage but how coverage develops over time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the structure of a constellation has implications for program schedule. LEO constellations of high-inclination satellites are efficient for generating global coverage with the fewest satellites. Other architectures, however, might generate persistent regional coverage sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been said about the need for resilience against attack, or what is called “graceful degradation.” Less attention has been given to optimizing for “graceful deployment.” A constellation optimized purely for coverage efficiencies may well deliver capability unevenly, with relevant, persistent coverage only arriving near completion. Such a glidepath is arguably in tension with the incremental, spiral-development-focused philosophy of proliferated low Earth orbit constellation deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

These tradeoffs ease with higher altitudes, including in MEO. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This LEO constellation of 36 satellites cannot offer persistent coverage until more orbital planes are added. Persistent equatorial coverage only emerges after the number of satellites is more than tripled. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the need to mitigate technical and security risks to a future constellation, capability phasing is a critical consideration for program-level risk. It is impossible to predict future supply chain bottlenecks, changes in budgetary priorities, or other factors that could hobble a constellation’s deployment. As such, architecture designs should be resilient to the risk of premature budget reductions or cancellation. Some constellation designs will not generate persistent coverage of meaningful regions should deployment be canceled halfway (Figure 52). It thus becomes crucial to consider which designs would offer meaningful coverage even when partially deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constellation optimized for graceful deployment may entail the selection of alternative configurations and may require more satellites to achieve coverage. Such costs are nevertheless worth considering (Figure 52). A constellation optimized solely for long-term efficiencies incurs short-term risks. In addition to programmatic risks, they can tempt adversaries to accelerate the development of countermeasures, knowing that capability will only arrive at once at a single future maturation point. Partial capability can and should arrive earlier. Multiple avenues — lower-inclination orbits, regional airborne sensors, and others — exist for realizing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r5QlqNx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image54&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 52: Combining Constellations.&lt;/strong&gt; Realizing global geometric coverage in two steps (right, center) can entail more satellites (40+26) than a constellation optimized for global coverage (49) (left). Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One avenue to graceful deployment could involve separating constellation deployment into multiple steps. For example, a LEO constellation could be designed as a hybrid architecture, deploying a low-inclination set of 70 satellites for regional coverage (Figure 53) before expanding to global coverage with a second set of 36 highly inclined sensors (Figure 54). While this could entail more satellites than higher-inclination alternatives, it delivers increments of coverage in two steps, achieving regional coverage much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yrR67It.png&quot; alt=&quot;image55&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 53: Combining Low- and High-Inclination Constellations: Regional Coverage.&lt;/strong&gt; A low-inclination constellation of 70 LEO satellites achieves persistent regional coverage; with the addition of 36 satellites (Figure 54), coverage can be expanded to a global scale, in two steps. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method may be to deploy underlays, such as aircraft-based sensors, to backfill capability until a space constellation is deployed. Regardless of approach, there are many possible levers for smoothing capability deployment. Careful selection of phased constellations, or the deployment of airborne underlays and other assets, could produce coverage of relevant areas in shorter increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schedule and capability phasing deserve to be key factors in assessing this trade space. Recent requests presented by SDA imply increased attention to these problems. In a recent solicitation for new Tracking Layer LEO satellites, for instance, SDA requested potential solutions for constellations including mixes of higher and lower inclinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A design that deploys gracefully could offer useful capability even when incomplete. One that does not deploy gracefully will not deliver such benefits, despite any promise of future numerical efficiencies. If a geopolitical crisis occurs in the late 2020s, the United States will have to fight with the space sensor constellation that is fielded, not the complete architecture planned in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-architecture&quot;&gt;An Emerging Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These many sensor, orbital, and schedule tradeoffs are at play in the Department of Defense (DoD)’s ongoing space sensor acquisition effort. This chapter reviews the envisioned missions, programs, and budgets of the forthcoming architecture and considers what questions remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fiscal year (FY) 2023, the DoD invested nearly $5 billion into acquiring overhead sensors for missile warning, tracking, and fire control (Figure 55). These efforts have been partly centralized under the Space Force organizational structure, with multiple programs of record underway for low (LEO), medium (MEO), geosynchronous (GEO), and highly elliptical (HEO) orbit sensor layers (Table 3). Under its Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) initiative, the Space Force will deploy two GEO (Next Generation GEO) and two HEO (Next Generation Polar) satellites, supplementing its Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) constellation for missile warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second effort, designated Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking (RMW/MT), will incorporate a constellation of nine or more MEO satellites (RMW/MT-MEO) and a larger constellation of LEO satellites (RMW/MT-LEO) to perform both missile warning and missile tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CUeP7As.png&quot; alt=&quot;image57&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the RMW/MT-LEO program, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has developed a prototype sensor, the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), capable of furnishing the “highly sensitive, low-latency, high quality of service” data needed for the more demanding missile defense fire control mission. The program will launch two prototype LEO satellites in late 2023, after which “responsibility for HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to the US Space Force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For FY 2024, the Space Force requested $2.6 billion for Next Generation OPIR, including $720 million for Next Generation GEO, $1 billion for Next Generation Polar, $661 million for associated ground systems, $191 million for modernization initiatives, and $31 million for integration. Additionally, it requested $2.2 billion for RMW/MT, including $1.2 billion for its LEO constellation, $538 million for its MEO constellation, and $506 million for its associated ground systems. For HBTSS, MDA requested $69 million, with minimal funding planned after FY 2026 when program responsibility is transferred to the Space Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These newer investments represent a welcome shift in resources. In FY 2023, funding for missile warning, represented by the Next Generation OPIR portfolio, dwarfed investments in missile tracking, represented by RMW/MT (Figure 56). The DoD’s FY 2024 budget request, by contrast, dramatically expands investments in the LEO and MEO constellations needed for missile tracking while cutting Next Generation GEO, reducing its planned satellite purchases from three to two. With its cancellation of the seventh and eighth SBIRS and the third Next Generation OPIR satellites, the Space Force is pivoting away from an approach centered around geosynchronous missile warning satellites to one dominated by large constellations of missile tracking satellites in LEO and MEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-generation-opir&quot;&gt;Next Generation OPIR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next Generation OPIR, including its Next Generation GEO and Polar components, formerly represented the largest segment of the DoD’s space sensing portfolio (Figure 57). Beyond recapitalizing space-based missile warning, whose associated SBIRS and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites entered service decades ago, these satellites will offer enhanced capabilities, tracking dimmer targets over wider areas. Combined with SBIRS, these satellites will be capable of detecting the hot plumes of missile launches, cueing relevant sensors, and informing national command authorities. They will supply data to critical interfaces, including the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Overhead Persistent Infrared Architecture (BOA) and Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment (ITW/AA), a U.S. strategic nuclear warning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2018 and 2021, the Space Force awarded $7.8 billion in contracts for the development and production of three Next Generation GEO satellites, with initial launches scheduled for 2025. Following a reorientation of priorities in late 2022, the Space Force plans to cut one Next Generation GEO satellite, launching the first in FY 2025 and the second in FY 2027. In FY 2024, the Space Force requested $719 million for the program, a considerable reduction from the $1.7 billion requested in FY 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of two Next Generation Polar satellites, meanwhile, is scheduled for launch by FY 2028. These satellites, orbiting at higher inclinations, would provide continuous coverage of the Northern Hemisphere and North Pole, supplementing the two SBIRS-HEO satellites presently in orbit. The Space Force requested $1 billion for the program in FY 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These satellites will pass sensor data to users through a new set of ground infrastructure, funded at $582 million in FY 2023. The Next Generation OPIR Ground component will incorporate the Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE), a system of software, ground terminals, and computers for mission management, data processing, telemetry, and command and control. Various components of FORGE are expected to come online through the late 2020s, with development for Next Generation GEO and Polar continuing through FY 2028. These efforts come in parallel with the Space Force’s Enterprise Ground System (EGS), a broader modernization of the organization’s ground systems software, and the Next Generation OPIR Interim Operations (NIO), a backup program to prevent FORGE delays from impacting Next Generation GEO launch schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilient-missile-warningmissile-tracking--low-earth-orbit-proliferated-warfighter-space-architecture&quot;&gt;Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking – Low Earth Orbit (Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RMW/MT program consolidates past efforts to develop a large constellation of LEO satellites and a smaller constellation of MEO satellites for missile tracking (Figure 58). As of 2023, this constellation would combine up to “135 LEO and 16 Space Force-developed MEO satellites working in concert through an integrated ground solution.” In 2023, Space Systems Command (SSC) was designated as the “lead end-to-end systems integrator” for the constellation. DoD then created a combined program office with SSC, the Space Development Agency (SDA), and MDA. It is likely that the architecture’s final configuration will change as prototype systems enter orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RMW/MT’s LEO component consists of SDA’s Tracking Layer constellation, which aims to launch successive phases, called “tranches,” of LEO sensor satellites in two-year increments. The acquisition philosophy for the Tracking Layer apparently differs from past military space efforts; it is intended to demonstrate capability on commercial timelines and exploit commercial components and design philosophies, rather than fitting a traditional requirements generation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDA plans to acquire the Tracking Layer and a larger constellation of LEO communications and sensing satellites, the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA; formerly the National Defense Space Architecture, or NDSA), using this approach. The PWSA constellation will initially include four tranches of LEO satellites, labeled Tranches 0, 1, 2, and 3. Tranche 0 will include 20 Transport Layer satellites and eight Tracking Layer satellites, which host wide-field-of-view (WFOV) infrared sensors and orbit approximately 1,000 km from Earth (Figure 59). SDA launched the first 10 of its Tranche 0 satellites in April 2023, and the second launch concluded in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plans to develop the Tracking Layer have shifted as Space Force and SDA budgets and priorities evolve. A second tranche, Tranche 1, is scheduled to launch in 2025 and would include 39 satellites (35 tracking, 4 fire control) orbiting at 1,000 km in five polar orbital planes (Figure 60). When combined with the Tranche 0 Tracking Layer, these satellites would offer a “kernel” of global coverage to warfighters by late 2025. The constellation initially consisted of four orbital planes with seven Tracking Layer satellites each; a $250 million congressional add, approved in 2023, added a fifth plane “to increase global Missile Warning and Missile Tracking coverage in support of combatant commands to include INDOPACOM.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional tranches would launch in 2027 and beyond. Tranche 2 would add 54 or more satellites (48 tracking, 6 fire control) to provide “global, persistent” missile warning and missile tracking while demonstrating a limited fire control capability (Figures 61, 62, and 63). Unlike prior tranches, it would deploy three orbital planes to a higher inclination and three orbital planes to a lower inclination suited for Indo-Pacific regional coverage. Each plane would have nine satellites; eight with WFOV missile warning/missile tracking sensors and one with a missile defense-focused “Fire Control quality sensor.” The first plane would enter orbit in April 2027, and deployment would conclude by November 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tranche 3 and beyond would increase the PWSA Tracking Layer’s density past 135 assets and incorporate newer satellite technologies. Given the intended five-year orbital lifespan of each satellite, these would expand upon and replace earlier tranches, enabling another set of technology insertions. While SDA has already defined requirements for earlier tranches, the eventual configuration of additions beyond Tranche 3 may vary considerably as satellites are put on orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilient-missile-warningmissile-tracking--medium-earth-orbit&quot;&gt;Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking – Medium Earth Orbit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an initial push and pull between LEO- or MEO-only approaches, the Space Force has embarked on efforts to deploy a mixed constellation of LEO and MEO missile tracking satellites. The second leg of this mixed constellation, RMW/MT-MEO, will complement the LEO Tracking Layer with additional satellites in MEO. This attention to MEO represents an important philosophical shift toward hybrid architectures, with MEO particularly useful for assuring coverage of lower latitudes (Figures 44 and 45).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In FY 2023, the Space Force expanded an exploratory effort to prototype MEO tracking satellites, MEO Track Custody (MTC), into a full-scale acquisition program integrated with the RMW/MT constellation. RMW/MT-MEO would acquire nine or more MEO satellites, at two orbital altitudes, to “pivot the Department of the Air Force’s (DAF) legacy missile warning force design to a more resilient multi-orbit approach.” In FY 2023, Congress appropriated $409 million toward the program — more than double the $139 million budget request. In FY 2024, the Space Force requested $538 million to support the accelerated MEO effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VDzEIGd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image67&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 64: SSC MEO Roadmap.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Space Systems Command.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like SDA’s successive “tranches,” SSC will deploy MEO capabilities in a series of increments called “epochs.” Epoch 1, deploying in late 2026, will include satellites at two altitudes: a plane of six vehicles at a lower orbital altitude and three at a higher one. Successive epochs will likely include 18 or more satellites, with a possible total of 34 to 44 satellites when complete. By the launch of Epoch 3, the constellation will reportedly deliver persistent missile tracking coverage. These MEO satellites will leverage research performed under the earlier MTC effort, which by May 2021 had awarded early contracts for digital satellite prototypes. Program design review for one Epoch 1 satellite concluded in July 2023, and critical design review completed in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift toward a LEO/MEO mixed constellation in FY 2024 follows significant congressional scrutiny. In July 2022, the House Armed Services Committee directed the chief of space operations to brief the committee on including “free, fair, and open competition within [the Space Force’s] acquisition plan” by January 2023. Following a $130 million congressional plus-up, the program office also moved to add the “third plane of Epoch 1 spacecraft . . . add[ing] additional acceleration funds in FY 2024 to . . . aggressively pursue additional Epoch 1 capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hypersonic-and-ballistic-tracking-space-sensor&quot;&gt;Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these several programs, HBTSS represents the DoD’s current effort to enable the fire control-quality tracking mission. HBTSS occupies a critical function in the forthcoming sensor ecosystem, aimed at providing the high-fidelity, low-latency tracking information needed to guide missile defense interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDA currently retains acquisition authority for HBTSS prototyping. Under the current timeline, MDA will prototype and launch a medium-field-of-view sensor to demonstrate fire control-quality tracking of hypersonic weapons. MDA began prototyping the sensor in 2018 and intends to launch two HBTSS-equipped satellite testbeds into orbit in late 2023 or early 2024. Following on-orbit test activities, “responsibility for HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to the US Space Force and the MDA will continue the development of the next generation of space-based fire control sensors for missile defense.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prototypes will be placed in orbits intended to “track test events in the INDOPACOM region” and would likely leverage a commercially supplied chassis, or bus, to host the HBTSS sensor. In 2021, Congress directed MDA to “achieve full operational employment” of the system by December 2023. On-orbit test activities are scheduled to continue through 2025, including support for Aegis and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) intercept tests in 2024 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear, however, how many HBTSS or HBTSS-derived payloads will eventually be fitted to SDA’s Tracking Layer constellation. While MDA requested $68 million for the program in FY 2023, funding is expected to decline after demonstration activities conclude and responsibility for fire control transfers to SSC and SDA. Following this transition, SDA aims to launch four HBTSS-derived sensor payloads as part of its Tranche 1 activities and an additional six fire control sensors in Tranche 2. Further developmental spirals, the priority accorded to the hypersonic defense mission, and SDA’s responsibilities for supporting missile defense, however, have not yet been publicly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-alignment&quot;&gt;Seeking Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent developments have been promising. The DoD has increasingly pivoted from an exclusively pLEO design to a mixed-orbit architecture with complementary LEO and MEO components. In contrast with earlier tranches, SDA’s Tranche 2 will now include assets at lower inclinations suited for earlier Indo-Pacific-region coverage. Moreover, the Space Force has signaled further investments in deploying fire control sensors on orbit, both in SDA Tranches 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions nevertheless remain over the configuration, schedule, and mission of the forthcoming architecture. It remains uncertain how effectively MDA fire control efforts will transition to SDA’s architecture and how the planned numbers of fire control satellites in PWSA support requirements for hypersonic defense. While Tranche 2 plans include three orbital planes at lower inclinations, it is uncertain how this could be expanded to assure persistent Indo-Pacific stereo coverage. Other questions — over what mix of LEO and MEO assets is optimal, how to phase deployments to cover the Indo-Pacific, what software is necessary to fuse information from so many sensors, and how to align ground systems acquisition with the fielding of satellites — are not yet resolved. The DoD has reached substantial technical milestones and pioneered innovative approaches to acquiring these systems. As one analyst has remarked, however, “there seems to be a lack of consensus on how quickly, and in what manner,” to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-temptations&quot;&gt;Three Temptations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, senior leaders have expressed the need to accelerate the fielding of sensors for hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. Doing so will require optimizing an entire system of systems — effectors; sensors; command, control, and communications systems; and the software that weaves them together. The greater challenge is not in constructing these individual parts but in aligning their deployment to deliver capability on relevant timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing the necessary architecture will require attention to potential policy temptations and pitfalls. Policymakers may face temptations to abdicate the fire control mission, overoptimize for numerical efficiencies, or consolidate to single orbital regimes in the pursuit of savings and simplicity. Succumbing to these temptations would come at the cost of speed and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;temptation-to-abdicate&quot;&gt;Temptation to Abdicate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One temptation to avoid is to abdicate the missile defense fire control mission. While technically challenging, fire control-quality tracking is needed for hypersonic missile defense. As responsibility for fire control transfers from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to the Space Force, it could be tempting to postpone or deemphasize these difficult requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, fire control should not be redefined as a reach goal. Combatant commands central to missile defense, including U.S. Space Command, have recognized the necessity of fire control and “strongly endorsed continuing work on systems such as . . . the MDA’s Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor.” Congress, moreover, had funded the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) and repeatedly kept it within MDA explicitly to ensure schedule discipline and applicability to missile defense. Whether or not HBTSS represents the eventual solution, fire control requirements should remain a defining feature of sensor architecture design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing fire control requirements will be difficult but not impossible. “The ability to detect and track dim targets in a cluttered background . . . with the sensitivity necessary to support the [counter-] hypersonic kill chain” requires considerable investment to achieve. The mission demands low latencies and small pixel footprints, achievable either through dedicated medium-field-of-view (MFOV) systems cued by wide-field-of-view (WFOV) tracking sensors or high-resolution, fire control-capable WFOV sensors, pending the supply of larger-format focal planes. An ideal constellation might feature both, with responsive WFOV fire control sensors and an additional MFOV layer for tracking challenging targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fire control should not be redefined as a reach goal.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDA’s commitments to deploying fire control sensors represent an important step in the right direction. Despite earlier uncertainties over their prioritization, recent plans suggest that SDA will deploy six fire control sensors in the Tranche 2 constellation, after MDA’s two-satellite HBTSS demonstration activities conclude. The relation of Tranche 2 fire control sensors to HBTSS remains publicly unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of fire control tracking satellites planned, however, remains inadequate for providing persistent coverage, and the glidepath to transition from an HBTSS-based approach to a future fire control system appears uncertain. The six SDA fire control satellites planned to launch in 2027, for instance, will be valuable for demonstrating capability but insufficient for achieving persistent Indo-Pacific coverage. It is worth considering whether these efforts could be expanded; additional satellites at these inclinations could generate persistent coverage of the Indo-Pacific. Additional mid-inclination satellites would bolster deterrent capability in a critical period, coinciding with Beijing’s timeline to develop a Taiwan invasion capability by 2027. Even if such threats are delayed, these additional satellites could be held in reserve to reconstitute constellations as they deorbit or come under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers are right to question if the current approach is enough to support fire control for hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. While the Space Force has committed to “the development and demonstration of space technologies to deliver Missile Warning, Missile Tracking, and Missile Defense (MW/MT/MD) capabilities including advanced missile tracking and fire control,” it must go further to operationalize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the previous, near-complete focus on proliferated low Earth orbit (LEO) sensors is worth reconsideration. Space Force efforts to explore fire control tracking from medium Earth orbit (MEO) sensors merit further study and potential acceleration. As discussed above, the MEO regime offers useful survivability, coverage, and schedule benefits, and deploying a MEO-based fire control layer could add useful resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 65: Valleys of Death in Defense Acquisition.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Department of Defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transfer of fire control tracking sensor programs from MDA to SDA represents an exercise in institutional trust. It will also be a test of recognizing the central relation between space and the future missile defense enterprise. Continued oversight will be essential, to ensure both that this transition effectively takes place and that fire control capability is achieved on schedule and at the necessary scale. It will require clear, high-level commitments from Pentagon leadership to allow these capabilities to cross the valley of death (Figure 65).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;temptation-to-overoptimize&quot;&gt;Temptation to Overoptimize&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second set of policy temptations threatens deployment schedules. Fielding new technologies requires experimentation. It is difficult to fully characterize sensor performance without placing them on orbit; spiral development approaches, such as those employed by SDA, can enable the continual experimentation needed to refine these systems. Even when operationalized, an architecture should continue to evolve. A mantra from the Aegis community is to “build a little, test a little, learn a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experimentation must be connected to results. The future architecture must prioritize coverage of the lower latitudes for the Indo-Pacific region. This is not only a matter of scaling constellation sizes but of selecting a design that addresses priority regions earlier. It may be tempting to continue experimenting: to deploy endless technology demonstrations to design constellations optimized for global coverage on an ever-longer timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three means to resist this temptation include designing constellations for graceful deployment, leveraging airborne underlays, and accelerating ground and data infrastructure development. The treasure obligated for these development efforts could be in vain if capability arrives late to need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEPLOY GRACEFULLY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment phasing should define every requirement in a potential constellation. The forthcoming sensor architecture must prioritize persistent coverage of the Indo-Pacific region first and do so sooner. Amid theoretical debates over orbital planes, satellites, and coverage, it is important to ask when an architecture could generate persistent coverage of relevant regions, and when this might expand to global coverage. As emphasized previously, even if the final capabilities of two designs are identical, the way these capabilities phase in — how they deploy gracefully and which regions receive denser coverage — can differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These considerations should impact the orbital design of forthcoming constellations. High-inclination configurations, optimized for maximizing coverage efficiencies once fully populated, may generate minimal relevant coverage when only partially populated. The recent nods to lower-inclination orbits in Tranche 2 are an important step to moderate polar over-coverage. It is worth asking if it is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AN AIRBORNE UNDERLAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, it will be crucial to examine alternatives for accelerating Indo-Pacific sensor coverage. A high-inclination LEO constellation will not generate persistent regional coverage for some time. But the immediate future fight is likely to be a regional fight (Figure 66). Airborne sensors might be useful for nearer-term regional tracking capability, defending critical assets including Okinawa or Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;frank-turner-technical-director-space-development-agency&quot;&gt;Frank Turner, Technical Director, Space Development Agency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Schedule is king. The train is going to leave the station on time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such approaches have been shown to be operationally viable. Architectures based on uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) have already been proposed for persistent, regional boost-phase missile defense missions, leveraging similar sensors needed for hypersonic tracking. MDA has previously demonstrated infrared missile tracking sensors on UAS, successfully tracking ballistic missiles in flight. In 2016 and 2021, the Navy and Army successfully integrated fighter-derived tracking information into missile defense tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD has already begun to use decommissioned RQ-4 drones to track hypersonic systems in flight tests. There is an even larger stock of existing UAS, slated for divestment, which could be leveraged. Many pieces of the puzzle are already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, advances in airborne platform endurance, networking, stealth, and autonomy could enable alternative designs. Opportunistic missile tracking could be invigorated by multimission platforms tightly linked to missile defense fire control networks. New domain awareness systems could allow asset placements closer to suspected missile launch sites. Significant investments in lighter-than-air and ultra-long-endurance aircraft, combined with declines in infrared sensor size, weight, and power, could allow a proliferated architecture of smaller, lighter, and cheaper airborne sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne systems offer different characteristics — flexibility, proximity, and survivability — to backstop and enhance a space-based missile tracking architecture. Introducing opportunistic or persistent airborne sensors increases the complexity of the missile defense problem for an adversary, forcing them to consider multiple domains from which their missiles could be tracked and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JZTNXyP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image70&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 67: Airborne Sensors near Guam.&lt;/strong&gt; A notional laydown of airborne sensors defending Guam, involving two surface-based sensor assets and three long-endurance UAS — two in a combat air patrol, and one transiting to replenish the orbit. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, these architectures are not without their limitations. Their comparatively low altitudes constrain their lines of sight compared to spacecraft and, like space architectures, would require fleets of multiple systems to achieve persistence. They are not invulnerable — both aircraft and their airbases can be attacked by aircraft, missiles, and drones if placed close enough to threat regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the DoD races ahead with space sensor acquisition, it is worth considering the roles airborne sensors might play in accelerating capability delivery to the Indo-Pacific (Figure 67). Persistent airborne sensors might relax schedule pressure on space systems and allow for designs that phase capability later. More critically, a diversity of assets in space and in the air — in different orbits and with different mixes of penetrating capability and persistence — generates more dilemmas for adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;REDUCING INTEGRATION RISKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phasing capability earlier also demands more attention to the systems that allow them to interoperate. A constellation design will live and die by its data transport and integration. If history is any indication, the delivery of software and ground systems will be difficult, costly, and late. “What you don’t want to have,” General James Dickinson of U.S. Space Command warns, “is where you have outdated ground stations that can’t leverage the new capabilities on orbit.” The development of these systems was a substantial contributor to the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) program’s early cost and schedule overruns; it is likely that ground system development, especially related to sensor fusion, will only mature after satellites have reached orbit. Both Congress and the DoD have roles to play in mitigating this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fusing sensor outputs from air and space platforms in multiple orbital bands is no easy undertaking. Efforts to develop common ground systems for the forthcoming Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) and Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking (RMW/MT) constellations, for example, face considerable technical and schedule risk. A viable sensor fusion solution must correlate information from multiple sensors with different look angles, latencies, and uncertainties associated with their sensor returns to form a track. While some portion of this processing can be done on board satellites — “on the edge” — significant track correlation and fusion will likely initially take place on the ground (Figure 68).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A constellation design will live and die by its data transport and integration.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, the DoD plans to manage the ground operations for RMW/MT through a combined program office including Space Systems Command (SSC), which will acquire the MEO component; SDA, which will acquire the Tracking Layer; and MDA, which retains considerable equities through HBTSS and the Missile Defense System (MDS). The ground components for each system are under development by different contractors and must interface with satellites from many vendors. Their software must correctly interface with the Next Generation OPIR Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE) infrastructure and be compliant with the broader Space Force Enterprise Ground System (EGS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still in its initial iterations, RMW/MT and Next Generation OPIR constellations will leverage different data formats, requiring “translation” on the ground to be interoperable. The RMW/MT ground segment itself involves separate infrastructure for the LEO Tracking Layer, MEO constellation, and HBTSS, which come online on different timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timelines for acquiring these translation capabilities will be tight. FORGE itself is expected to come online no earlier than 2025. A more comprehensive ability to command and control multiple types of satellites with a single protocol, EGS, is required to enter service before 2028. Responsibility for ensuring an integrated space architecture — such as by mandating common data standards and software development practices — has been dispersed across multiple program elements and offices. Despite clear road maps for launching large volumes of new satellites, no comprehensive plans have been publicized for fusing their large volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD has only recently begun algorithm development to fuse two-dimensional sensor tracks from OPIR satellites. While it has demonstrated the performance of its sensors on the ground, sensor track fusion remains a substantial software challenge. As deployment of the Tranche 0 satellite constellation continues, the DoD must ensure that the sensor fusion approaches it leverages are scalable to larger quantities of satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rppd0Jr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image71&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 68: Data Transport Pathways.&lt;/strong&gt; Data transport, fusion, and integration will be as important to space-based missile tracking as the sensors themselves. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be imperative to get ahead of these integration problems. How many hops must the data take between sensors, ground stations, and other data processing nodes? How long might each hop take? Which nodes will process the tracking data, which will fuse them, and which will deliver the finalized track to an effector? The various types and orbits of satellites being purchased should output common data formats that are usable across various ground assets. Moreover, the DoD should take steps to mitigate cases where fusion-related program elements lack clear organizational ownership — a substantial contributor to past schedule overruns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of the threat, and the pace of ongoing launch schedules, is too fast to accommodate any potential delays in sensor fusion and ground system development. Moreover, the DoD cannot settle for uncertain assurances that, someday, satellites in different orbits and with different datalinks could be integrated down the road. It will not be enough to continually experiment with fusion approaches once the satellites reach orbit. To deploy a diverse, proliferated constellation, it is essential for the ground systems and software to arrive on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;temptation-to-consolidate&quot;&gt;Temptation to Consolidate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the future sensor architecture must be designed for conflict: it must be capable of surviving and reconstituting in highly contested environments. Achieving this will require an orbitally diverse constellation design that forces adversaries to develop many types of countermeasures. Policymakers should resist temptations to consolidate the sensor architecture into a single orbital regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-orbit capabilities are not duplicative. An architecture in multiple orbits and altitudes can generate unique efficiencies in coverage unachievable with single-altitude architectures — especially for the Indo-Pacific region. Moreover, it will be critical to deploy diverse orbits to ensure resilience against growing counterspace threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid future programmatic and budgetary pressures, it may be tempting to consolidate a sensor architecture to a single set of orbits in the low, medium, geosynchronous, or highly elliptical domains. In the past, the DoD has overly consolidated certain capabilities in a single orbital domain, such as GEO. That practice should not be repeated. The DoD’s pivot toward a multi-altitude sensor architecture is an important step in resisting this temptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What we’re finding is that resilience has no end state.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orbital diversity has become especially critical in view of the growing counterspace threat. Adversaries recognize the importance of space sensor architectures and are rapidly advancing their counterspace capabilities. In the past five years, they have conducted over 70 counterspace and anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon tests, developmental demonstrations, and deployments (Figure 69). They are developing kinetic direct-ascent and co-orbital ASAT weapons, non-kinetic dazzlers, jammers, and cyberweapons, and have magnified natural threats to satellites, generating space debris through weapons testing. The increasing complexity of these threatens to outpace the United States’ acquisition of satellite constellations. This should be a central consideration not only in the construction of satellites, but in the design of an architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EabU1NB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image72&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different orbital regimes are vulnerable to different threat profiles. The LEO environment is easier to threaten but also easier to proliferate and reconstitute. MEO offers coverage and distance but with harsh radiation environments and challenging unit economics. GEO, meanwhile, is increasingly populated with adversary co-orbital capabilities but benefit from both distance and potential defensive capabilities — making them far from “juicy targets.” HEO regimes incorporate few assets but can be challenging to covertly engage with co-orbital weapons. No specific constellation design represents an ideal survivability profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survivable constellation should therefore seek to multiply adversary dilemmas, forcing them to attack multiple orbital layers with multiple, costly means of attack. Assuring coverage will demand the use of air and space assets, the reconstitution of constellations under attack, and carefully planned defensive operations (Figure 70). It should leverage multiple approaches to resilience (Table 4). It is not merely a matter of proliferating sensors, but of doing so in ways that introduce additional targeting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Rl7Bxjk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image73&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: Approaches to Resilience.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project with data from the Department of Defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different orbits are suited to different resilience pathways. Constellations optimized for smaller numbers of assets — in GEO, for instance — benefit from resilience approaches that protect individual assets: advanced radiation hardening and error-correcting circuitry; larger fuel loads or refueling systems to perform evasive maneuvers; and signature reduction, chaff, and decoy systems. While some protection methods, such as the deployment of defensive “bodyguard” satellites, are costly, they can introduce novel operational considerations for an adversary. But it is unaffordable to ensure a resilient architecture through asset-level protection alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These approaches should be combined with constellations that leverage different resilience philosophies. Several proposed LEO constellations leverage proliferation to ensure survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/si6JWLH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image74&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 70: Mission Assurance Contributors.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project with data from the Department of Defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dramatic drops in the cost of space launch have made it feasible to rapidly proliferate and reconstitute satellites — and to do so more cheaply than they can be shot down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proliferation strategies are attractive for their potential to complicate adversary targeting and introduce new technology increments rapidly. Such satellites could be constructed to minimize unit cost, with lower reliability thresholds, commercial-grade electronics, and shorter orbital lifespans, to be replenished frequently with upgraded systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic threats, however, challenge efforts to achieve resilience through proliferation. A sustained counterspace campaign would likely generate large quantities of debris in crowded LEO orbits. Nuclear explosions in space could deny large swathes of the LEO environment. Cyberattacks remain an omnipresent area threat, both for proliferated and exquisite architectures. The threat posed by these area effects makes it more urgent to embrace multiple resilience strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing the number of orbital regimes in the sensor architecture can enhance system-level resilience. Leveraging multiple orbital regimes complicates an adversary’s ability to exploit failure modes common to that orbit. LEO constellations benefit from large numbers, but their proximity to Earth makes them vulnerable to aforementioned area threats. MEO, GEO, and HEO constellations, meanwhile, might involve fewer assets with less provision for replenishment but are more difficult to engage with some directed-energy and direct-ascent weapons and potentially more economical to harden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More critically, a multi-orbit architecture can complicate adversary mission planning. Adversaries facing such an architecture would encounter challenges in synchronizing attacks. A direct-ascent or co-orbital attack on MEO or GEO assets may take substantially longer to execute compared to attacks on LEO. If attacks were launched simultaneously, the earlier disruption to LEO layers would give warning time for MEO and higher satellites to employ defensive maneuvers or other measures. If attacks were phased to strike multiple orbits at once, the long transit time of co-orbital weapons or missiles in GEO or HEO would offer warning time for defensive measures in MEO or LEO. A diverse architecture both creates targeting dilemmas and complicates tactical surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;michael-griffin-under-secretary-of-defense-for-research-and-engineering-2018&quot;&gt;Michael Griffin, Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, 2018&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to be in any one orbit. . . . I want us to be as widely distributed over as many choices of orbital regimes as we can effectively use, because I want to pose the adversary such a difficult problem that they’ll choose not to fight it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future sensor architecture cannot be a monoculture. Wartime scenarios are likely to include targeted attacks on individual satellites and area threats that threaten many. An architecture reliant on a single orbit and optimized for a single resilience philosophy will be simpler for adversaries to counter than a multi-layer approach, which presents dramatically different vulnerabilities. The increasing importance of space sensing makes it imperative to avoid so-called “common mode failures.” A future missile tracking constellation cannot only be proliferated, it must leverage a diversity of sensors to complicate adversary targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;staying-on-track&quot;&gt;Staying on Track&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missiles are no longer niche weapons, they are weapons of choice. They have become “foundational to our adversaries’ way of war, and missile defense has become foundational to integrated deterrence and the defense of the nation.” The creation of a new elevated sensor architecture will be similarly foundational to the future missile defense enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 40 years, seven successive presidential administrations have expressed support, at least on paper, for fielding a space sensor layer capable of providing not just missile warning but also high-quality tracking capabilities necessary to support the missile defense mission. To date, none has yet done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is now beginning to change. Substantial strides have been made toward a robust space sensing capability. That past vision has never been closer to realization than it is today. Breakthroughs in space launch, networking, and sensing technologies have created opportunities for realizing a robust elevated sensor architecture. Substantial institutional attention is now being paid across the U.S. national security enterprise, with significant investments to match. Recent emphasis on acquiring proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) constellations was a good start, but contending with near peers will require much more. As emphasized by Assistant Secretary of Defense John Plumb, “Resilience is kind of a never-ending quest.” To achieve robust capability and mission assurance, the future sensor architecture must orbit in multiple altitudes and domains, prioritize designs that deploy sooner, and provide denser coverage of latitudes for the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The necessary policy, programs, and institutions are in place. What is needed now is the oversight, resourcing, and systems engineering authority to make the future architecture resilient, timely, and capable. To be resilient, the future architecture must be orbitally diverse. To be timely, it must deploy capability with an eye to graceful deployment and to prioritizing lower-latitude coverage. Finally, it must deliver the quality of data necessary for missile defense — fire control-quality tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This long-awaited elevated sensor architecture will be achieved. When it is, its uses will extend well beyond missile warning, missile defense, and missile defeat. Indications, warnings, and attributions from these assets will bring clarity to decisionmakers in crisis situations and better inform and protect servicemembers in the field. Just as the Global Positioning System (GPS) has had countless commercial applications and the Defense Support Program missile warning constellations have benefited wildfire detection, new missions and use cases will emerge for these elevated sensors as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications of space becoming a warfighting domain will not be fully understood for some time. It is, however, already clear that elevated sensing is critical for air and missile defense. As the number of exotic space threats continues to multiply, there is a risk of neglecting the seemingly pedestrian air and missile threats below. As tempting as it may be to deprioritize the missile defense mission, the requirement for fire control-quality tracking must not be abdicated. It must stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report used Systems Toolkit (STK), SMARTSet, and other simulation and visualization tools to inform its analysis. The modeling performed is notional and intended to illustrate concepts and tradeoffs involved with sensor architecture design. To better highlight these, the team constrained the parameters being investigated in its analysis. The design of an operational architecture would involve higher-fidelity modeling for cost, maintenance interval, solar activity, hardening, launch schedules and missile design, conjunction, link budgets, and many other parameters. In brief, these models are demonstrative, not prescriptive. They are not reference architectures but exhibits for the design tradeoffs involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensor-level-analysis&quot;&gt;Sensor-Level Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team performed infrared sensor and signature analysis using STK’s Electro-optical Infrared (EOIR) module. Infrared background data was imported from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) gridded data sets and processed with Python and NASA Panoply software. The team modeled a notional hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) (Figure 4) with Autodesk Fusion 360 and applied temperature maps to vehicle surfaces in Blender, using open-source surface temperature estimates. These assets were then placed into the STK simulation environment (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracking hypersonic signatures is challenging because hypersonic weapons are not often the brightest objects in the scene. These weapons often appear as a single, slightly brighter pixel in a 4,000-by-4,000 pixel, wide-field-of-view (WFOV) image; while detectable by machine, these raw images are difficult to interpret with the naked eye. The infrared images furnished in this report are specifically scoped and processed to make these challenges visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 10 illustrates challenges associated with isolating hypersonic signatures from background clutter. The series of images are derived from STK’s EOIR simulation suite and picture an HGV as seen from a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite orbiting at 1000 km. The raw image (left) represents a “crop” of a potential WFOV sensor, with a resolution of 256-by-256 pixels and a per-pixel FOV of 450 microradians. The simulated sensor operates in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) band, with a wavelength of between 3.5 and 5 microns. The band selected is illustrative; various bands in the short- and mid-wave regions present different advantages. Radiometric features, including noise equivalent irradiance, were minimized to the degree the HGV could be distinguished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first image depicts the raw output of this sensor. Unlike with bright plumes in the boost phase, the pixel containing the hypersonic weapon is dim — it is not among the brightest in the scene and cannot be distinguished with the naked eye. The brightness difference caused by the hypersonic weapon cannot easily be resolved by observing a single frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualizing the signature instead requires analysis of several frames with the hypersonic weapon in motion. By estimating the movement of each pixel across the frame, it is possible to filter the hypersonic weapon’s motion from other objects in the scene. The second image depicts the motion vectors of each pixel over 20 successive image frames, processed with the OpenCV library’s Farneback optical flow algorithm. The false-color image encodes the optical flow vector of each pixel with a separate color, depicting a color variation for the pixel containing the moving hypersonic weapon. The third image displays an enlarged version of this false-color image, with contrast adjustments applied to make the HGV pixel more visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resultant images are illustrative and do not depict operationally sensitive features of hypersonic tracking systems. An operational system would offer substantially greater performance headroom. Moreover, atmospheric conditions can substantially change the signature of a vehicle; these were left to the standard atmospheric and cloud models included with STK EOIR. Finally, the simulations did not use high-fidelity maps of the hypersonic vehicle’s surface temperatures. A real hypersonic weapon would have significant temperature gradients across its surface and generate a wake of superheated gas and plasma with unique infrared emissivity characteristics. A weapons engineering process would include these detailed parameters, but these are not necessary to illustrate the principles discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 7 illustrates the thermal gradient on a hypersonic weapon’s surface. To make these characteristics visible to the reader, the HGV was imaged from an uncrewed aerial system (UAS) placed approximately 80 km away with a 256-pixel focal plane array (FPA), 35 cm aperture, and a tight, 0.01-degree total FOV. This is not representative of an operational system but best illustrates the concept being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Figure 25 is constructed to illustrate the effects of motion blur and sensor jitter. The sensor FPA is 256 pixels, with an 0.001-degree FOV, placing the HGV signature in the center of the image. The FPA has an integration time of 10 milliseconds and the final image includes this signature with an added 0.005mrad jitter. Figure 24 uses apertures of various sizes from geosynchronous orbits to illustrate how aperture affects sensor resolution. Again, sensor resolution and immediate field of view (IFOV) are left to generic parameters intended to highlight the impact of aperture size. The largest aperture is set to an arbitrarily large diameter of 10 m, while the two successive apertures, 60 cm and 30 cm, show the progression in resolution with smaller, more realistic diameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;constellation-level-analysis&quot;&gt;Constellation-Level Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team also used STK to assess satellite constellation design tradeoffs. Constellation designs illustrated in the report were similarly selected to highlight design principles — inclination, orbital altitude, sensor FOV, and orbital configurations — and their impact on sensor coverage. Specifically, the report displays constellation designs evaluated for their two-satellite (stereo) coverage, which is necessary for missile tracking and fire control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several visualizations directly depict real-life constellation designs. Figure 38 leverages data from the Space Force’s catalog of tracked space objects to define the orbits of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites. The coverage figures depict the maximum coverage footprints possible from each satellite. The latest and final SBIRS satellite, SBIRS GEO-6, was not included in this visualization. Similarly, Figures 59, 60, 61, 62, and 63 depict the Tranche 0, 1, and 2 constellation designs being contemplated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other visualizations contain notional constellation designs produced through optimization studies. The project team leveraged various approaches to find configurations that minimized the number of satellites needed for stereo coverage of a given area. These studies also produced configurations of near-minimum constellation designs inspired by numbers publicly given for forthcoming constellations (Figure 27) (Tracking Layer, RMW/MT-MEO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These optimization studies draw from the considerable literature written on the subject. Many of the configurations investigated in these studies were Walker or modified Walker configurations with different parameters on inter-plane spacing. Walker constellations are a family of constellation designs that distribute satellites in equally spaced, equally inclined circular orbits. Such a design is attractive to mission designers because of the stability of their geometry: the forces that perturb satellite orbits (such as those associated with atmospheric drag, the non-uniform nature of Earth’s gravitational field, and the Sun and Moon’s gravity, among others) affect all satellites in the constellation approximately equally. This symmetric design allows satellite operators to plan similar station-keeping maneuvers for all satellites in the system, giving them approximately equal operational lifetimes. Walker configurations are common among operational position, navigation, and timing (PNT) satellite constellations, such as the European Space Agency’s Galileo satellite system. Other satellite constellations, such as the U.S. Space Force’s Global Positioning System (GPS) or Iridium Communication’s constellation, use adaptations of the Walker constellation design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker constellations can be described by six parameters: semi-major axis, the number of orbital planes, the number of satellites per plane, the relative phasing between satellites in adjacent planes, the spacing between planes, and the planes’ inclination. For circular orbits — which have an eccentricity of zero — the constellation can also be described by the orbiting altitudes of its satellites, which stays constant over the course of the satellites’ orbital period. The coverage of such a constellation is also affected by a seventh, eighth, and ninth parameter: the field of regard (FOR) of the sensor on board, requirements for stereo or greater coverage, and solar exclusion, which defines angles where a sensor’s view is degraded by the light of the Sun in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These parameters must be tuned to minimize the number of satellites needed for persistent stereo coverage: coverage by two or more satellites at once, at every point in time, in the relevant region of analysis. The study team primarily analyzed coverage of a global region and a smaller, Indo-Pacific-focused region between 15 degrees South and 55 degrees North latitude (Figure 66). To preserve the generalizability of the study, these analyses assumed a maximum possible FOR for each satellite constellation; higher-fidelity details of detection and characterization challenges are not addressed; and the results presented in the following two sections correspond only to line-of-sight coverage analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate possible designs, the research team leveraged STK’s Analyzer module to test millions of possible configurations for coverage. This analysis began with the construction of simplified, non-representative designs for every orbital altitude to exemplify the altitude trades at play (Figure 34).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To construct this relationship, the study team used STK Analyzer’s Design of Experiments (DOE) tool to explore an entire swath of design possibilities. The model was simplified to assess simplified stereo coverage to minimize the computation time needed, with no constraints on solar exclusion. More detailed assessments, including constraints on sensor FOR, solar exclusion, and other factors, were performed for the other constellations visualized in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOE tool parametrically defines a series of Walker Delta constellations by systematically combining ranges of orbital altitudes, numbers of orbital planes, numbers of satellites per plane, and inclinations, evaluating their suitability for stereo coverage using user-determined “Coverage Definitions” and “Figures of Merit.” This study relied on a global coverage definition consisting of a grid of points, spaced by six degrees, positioned 20 km above the Earth’s surface. Under these definitions, coverage can be evaluated at each of the points in the coverage grid, which are separated from one another by six degrees in both latitude and longitude space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These studies defined successful stereo coverage by constellations’ ability to minimize average stereo coverage gap time to zero. That is, the number of seconds over a one-day study period — during which any point in the coverage region is observed by fewer than two satellites in the constellation — cannot be greater than zero. When satellite constellations achieve continuous stereo coverage for a particular region, this figure of merit requirement is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each orbital altitude between 500 and 36,000 km, the team evaluated hundreds of thousands of permutations of Walker Delta constellations. Although many different constellation architectures satisfied the figure of merit requirement — as many overpopulated satellite constellations offer much denser coverage than what is required — only two constellations per altitude met this study’s definition for optimality: one that offers continuous stereo coverage while minimizing the total number of satellites in the system, and one that offers continuous stereo coverage while minimizing the total number of orbital planes in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;image75&quot; /&gt;https://i.imgur.com/ZzOuARE.png
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 71: Solar Exclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; As with handheld cameras, a space-based infrared camera angled close enough to the sun will encounter washout and flaring effects. This can inhibit the detection of dim targets. Source: CSIS Missile Defense Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimal constellations were identified algorithmically by first sorting the list of Walker Delta constellation permutations for each altitude by average stereo coverage gap times and removing those with non-zero times. This step eliminates those constellation architectures that fail to satisfy the figure of merit requirement. Next, the minimum total number of satellites and minimum total number of orbital planes of the remaining constellation architectures should be identified and noted. To identify the optimal constellation — minimizing the total number of satellites — the architectures with more than the minimum total number of satellites should be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, there is more than one constellation architecture in the filtered list that offers the minimum total number of satellites. To select a singular, unique architecture, the list was filtered to include only those architectures that also use the minimum number of orbital planes. This is because multiple launches are generally needed to populate multiple orbital planes. All else being equal, a constellation of many planes with fewer satellites per plane is more costly than a constellation of fewer planes with more satellites in each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where needed, the list of remaining constellation architectures was sorted by inclination, and the design with the lowest inclination was labeled as most optimal, as less-inclined orbits generally correspond to lower launch costs. The process for identifying constellations that minimized the number of orbital planes is similar to the process described for minimizing the total number of satellites, but the list of architectures that satisfy the figure of merit requirement should first be filtered to only include those with the minimum number of orbital planes, then again filtered to only include those with the minimum number of total satellites — a reversal of the previously described order of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resultant constellation configurations, and the total numbers of satellites they represent, were graphed using the Python Plotly library. The resultant figure (Figure 34) illustrates the results of this optimization study conducted for every altitude between 500 and 36,000 km at 50 km increments. The study team applied a minor smoothing function to interpolate between these increments and highlight the underlying relationship between altitude and the number of satellites required for coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An operational constellation configuration, however, must account for more detailed constraints on performance. Each satellite in a constellation can be assumed to encounter some time where their sensors may be unavailable, either during calibration or during periods where the Sun is sufficiently close to the sensor background (solar exclusion) (Figure 71). These can considerably increase the number of satellites required to develop a constellation design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, reference constellations, including Figures 16, 17, 27, 28, 35, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 51, 52, 53, and 54, are optimized with constraints on solar exclusion. The total FOR of each sensor was modeled to provide the maximum footprint attainable. LEO reference constellations, all modeled at 1,000 km altitude, were conservatively modeled with a 30-degree solar exclusion parameter. MEO constellations, at 7,000 and 10,000 km altitudes, were modeled with a 16-degree solar exclusion parameter. This adds a 30-degree angle outside the sensor FOR where the presence of the Sun would inhibit sensor function. These figures are intentionally arbitrary and not reflective of operational systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The larger number of parameters required different approaches for discovering optimal designs. Testing every possible configuration, as with the DOE studies informing Figure 34, required over 800,000 simulation runs to analyze. To discover designs for reference constellations, the research team leveraged STK Analyzer’s built-in genetic optimization suite to find minimum possible designs. The use of the NGSA-II optimization algorithm reflects common practice in other constellation optimization studies. Using NGSA-II, STK Analyzer could automatically explore and test possible combinations of inclination, planes, satellites per plane, and other parameters, measuring their resultant impacts on coverage. This approach minimized the number of simulation runs needed to discover the frontier of possible optimal configurations. Of these, the study team manually selected configurations that minimized the number of orbital planes necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of more detailed optimization studies formed the basis for several of the satellite configurations and mixes presented. The LEO orbital plane included in Figures 46, 51, 52, 53, and 54 represent the results of optimization studies performed for smaller coverage regions, of both the polar region above 55 degrees latitude and a regional, Indo-Pacific-focused band between -15 and 55 degrees latitude. Other configurations, such as Figure 28, demonstrate the significantly larger numbers of satellites needed when the per-satellite FOR is reduced. Combinations of “optimal” coverage layers were then devised from the basis of these studies. While these configurations do not represent the optimal configuration of an operational architecture, they demonstrate constellation designs that could reasonably exemplify the orbital tradeoffs at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

The authors assess the likelihood of North Korea selling its missile and nuclear technology onwards, and the kinds of technology that may be for sale and to whom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The September 2023 meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un raised concerns over the possibility that Pyongyang may supply Moscow with arms to support its war of aggression in Ukraine. Subsequent reports of North Korean transfers of ammunition to Russia and unconfirmed intelligence of suspected ballistic missiles transfers solidified those concerns. While the fact of Russia – host to one of the world’s most capable military–industrial complexes – turning to North Korea for arms was shocking, it did not come as a surprise to those familiar with the latter’s long history of arms trading and missile proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has exported missile technology since the 1980s and has, on several occasions, also transferred technology directly relevant to the development of nuclear weapons. Despite the introduction since 2006 of a progressively extensive sanctions regime against North Korea and its proliferation activity by the UN Security Council (UNSC), North Korean exports of missile and nuclear technology have persisted. Considering developments in North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities in recent years, the range of technologies that Pyongyang may be able to offer potential customers has also expanded. These technological advances, combined with the expansion of the UNSC sanctions regime over the past two decades, as well as other recent developments – like North Korea’s apparently expanding military collaboration with Russia, Moscow’s increasing disregard for UN sanctions, and North Korea’s reopening after the Covid-19 pandemic – make a reassessment of North Korea’s missile and nuclear exports timely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on existing literature on North Korea’s missile and nuclear proliferation, supplementing it with expert interviews and leveraging the emergence of new information and cases related to North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities and transfers over the past decade. The authors consider the potential for future missile and nuclear sales by Pyongyang, asking: how likely is North Korea to sell its missile and nuclear technology onwards, what technology may be for sale, and to whom? With a growing technological offering and a continuing need to generate hard currency, incentives for North Korea to sell its missile, nuclear and dual-use technologies to foreign customers persist. As well as North Korea’s more novel technologies potentially being for sale, Pyongyang’s technological progress may also have created surpluses of older technology which it may be looking to sell off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite clear supply-side drivers, there are a range of restraining factors that are likely to prevent an all-out onward proliferation bonanza emanating from North Korea. A variety of factors have whittled down the potential markets for these technologies, while the restrictive sanctions landscape and unprecedented monitoring of the Korean peninsula have also worked to reduce opportunities for sales and increase the risks posed by interdiction. North Korean concerns over the possibility of its more advanced capabilities falling into adversary hands, thus potentially putting its own deterrent at risk, are also likely to temper its willingness to export such capabilities, despite the potentially high price tag that could be attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing geopolitical landscape resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may, however, open new opportunities for North Korea. Russia’s willingness to engage in military trade with North Korea could give other countries the green light to accept North Korean arms, missiles and perhaps even nuclear technology. There remains a real risk of a broader collapse of the UNSC sanctions regime and the resurgence of North Korea’s arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the analysis of North Korea’s expanded technological offering, reduced customer base and other factors affecting export decisions – and the clear need to pay attention to the issue – this paper presents 10 recommendations to help in countering North Korean missile and nuclear technology proliferation. These recommendations are organised in two categories, which attempt to address the supply side of the problem – deterring, dissuading and encouraging North Korea to refrain from engaging in onward proliferation – as well as demand-side factors – by trying to reduce North Korea’s customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un travelled by armoured train to Russia’s far east to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kim’s visits to the Vostochny Cosmodrome and a fighter jet factory in Komsomolsk-on-Amur further raised existing concerns that the two countries were seeking to exchange military technology. Indeed, recent research has confirmed that hundreds of shipping containers, likely carrying ammunition, have been moved from North Korea to Russian military bases since the leaders’ meeting. The meeting was preceded two months earlier by the visit of Russian and Chinese delegations to North Korea to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War armistice, with officials from Moscow led by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Russia and North Korea – both countries under extensive international sanctions and with acute military equipment needs – put on a strikingly united front. Notably, Shoigu was treated to a defence exhibition featuring many of North Korea’s newest weapons systems – including UAVs, short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and even ICBMs. In November 2023, South Korean intelligence publicly shared its suspicions – otherwise unconfirmed – that North Korea may have already sent SRBMs to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang has long been an exporter of missile and nuclear technology; this has included exports of Nodong medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) to Iran and Pakistan in the 1990s, Scud SRBMs to a range of customers (largely in the Middle East) through the 1980s and 1990s, as well as nuclear reactor technology to Syria, and uranium hexafluoride gas to Libya in the early 2000s through the proliferation network run by Pakistani nuclear scientist AQ Khan (Boxes 1 and 2 summarise North Korea’s historical trade).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s exhibition of missiles to Shoigu is far from the only indicator that Pyongyang remains open for business to countries looking to procure missile and even nuclear technology. Reporting by the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718 Committee Panel of Experts (PoE) has noted that Pyongyang has engaged in missile cooperation with Iran and Syria as recently as 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 2020 documentary film of unclear veracity entitled The Mole also showed an actor – playing the part of a private arms dealer – venturing to Pyongyang undercover in 2017 and being offered a wide range of short- and even intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). While most of the handful of known nuclear technology transfers by North Korea date back two decades, the last publicly known case of North Korea offering nuclear-weapons-relevant materials on the open market – in that instance, the isotope lithium-6 – was uncovered just six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has engaged in these transfers despite an expansive UNSC sanctions regime that prohibits most trade with the country, including a prohibition on trade with the country in missile and nuclear technology, and most types of arms, in place since 2006. Pyongyang’s advancements in its nuclear and missile capabilities have had an impact on what, how and to whom North Korea may sell its nuclear and missile technology in the future. Its experience in identifying customers and engaging in illicit trade under the international sanctions regime over the past two decades will also have influenced its patterns of onward proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developments in the international sanctions regime and North Korean missile and nuclear capabilities, as well as changing geopolitical dynamics, necessitate a re-examination of North Korean onward proliferation. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has resulted in the widening of existing schisms in the international community, with countries opposing Russia’s aggression against Ukraine on one side, and those that have supported Russia or remained ambivalent on the other. Those in the latter camp, which includes North Korea and Iran, appear to have found in Russia a willing trading and diplomatic partner as Moscow seeks to reduce its isolation. This study is thus particularly timely in light of the recent high-level meetings between Pyongyang and Moscow, and the more general apparent expansion of relations between the two countries, as well as other developments – such as the gradual reopening of North Korea’s borders following the Covid-19 pandemic, the expiry in October 2023 of the UN Security Council (UNSC) embargo on trade in nuclear-capable missile technology with Iran, and the expiry of UNSC proliferation-related targeted financial sanctions on Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper builds on existing academic literature, expert analysis and case studies relating to North Korea’s onward proliferation of nuclear and missile technology by considering how what is already known about North Korean transfers of nuclear and missile technology may have been – or may in the future be – impacted by some of the technological, economic and geopolitical developments outlined above and throughout the paper. Based on this analysis, the authors explore developments relevant to already-identified factors, as well as emerging ones, that shape whether Pyongyang may transfer its nuclear and missile technology, and what wares North Korea may transfer, and to which client states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-literature&quot;&gt;Existing Literature&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some previous work has considered North Korea’s onward proliferation, the literature is limited and much of it is more than a decade old. Much of the existing literature on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes has focused on developments in its nuclear and missile capabilities, Pyongyang’s revenue-raising efforts under sanctions, and its procurement of WMD and military technologies. More broadly, discussion of the threat posed by North Korea’s weapons programmes has focused on denuclearisation and (more recently) deterrence, rather than on the threat posed by onward proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most insightful and in-depth work on North Korea’s onward proliferation was published by Joshua Pollack. In 2011, Pollack examined North Korea’s missile sales and how these had changed since what he called the “Golden Age” of North Korean missile exports in the 1980s. Pollack observed that Pyongyang had shifted – with some exceptions – from supplying complete missile systems to transferring parts, materials and expertise instead. He also noted that North Korea was moving its focus towards cooperation in joint missile development and production with a smaller number of countries – particularly Iran and Syria – as opposed to transferring full missiles to a range of customers. Pollack argued that these shifts stemmed from market saturation for North Korea’s missile offerings as a result of past missile transfers and requirements for components and maintenance services from past customers. He also attributed this shift to a deprioritisation of ballistic missiles among some potential customers, particularly in the Middle East, in favour of Western-supplied piloted aircraft, cruise missiles and missile defence systems, and pressure from the US to curtail engagement with North Korea. As the authors outline in this paper, some analogous factors appear to be impacting on more recent supply and demand drivers in North Korea’s onward proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollack also examined North Korea’s nuclear exports, arguing that Pyongyang seems to have prioritised technological exchange instead of currency generation in the limited number of known transfers of its nuclear technology. However, Pollack also argued that Pyongyang may seek to leverage its nuclear expertise and technology for revenue generation in the future. Naturally, his work relied on the data available to him over a decade ago; since then, additional cases and data points on North Korean missile and nuclear exports have afforded greater understanding. The present-day utility of other works in understanding the phenomenon of North Korean onward proliferation of missile and nuclear technology has been even more limited by their age. Others studying North Korean onward proliferation have limited their study to discrete aspects, such as transfers to non-state actors, or China’s role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has also benefited from research on adjacent topics such as North Korea’s arms exports and sanctions evasion networks. Notably, in her 2016 book, Target Markets: North Korea’s Military Customers in the Sanctions Era, Andrea Berger identified a range of factors driving demand for North Korean military goods, considering customers in three categories: “resilient” customers with deep political and military ties to Pyongyang, “reluctant” customers with few other options in terms of suppliers, and less committed “ad hoc” customers. Berger’s work highlights the unique nature and context of specific relationships and their developments, which has helped to inform some of the analysis in this paper. Others have considered the role of specific entities in North Korean proliferation activities and procurement networks. However, no study in the past decade has revisited the question of North Korea’s onward missile and nuclear proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-arguments-research-methodology-and-structure&quot;&gt;Key Arguments, Research Methodology and Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its growing technological offering and continuing need to generate hard currency, North Korea has significant incentives to sell its missile, nuclear and dual-use technologies to other states. Surpluses created by technological advances may also be available for sale. However, despite clear incentives to proliferate, a range of factors that work to constrain North Korea’s sales are likely to prevent an all-out onward-proliferation bonanza. Many of these drivers and restraints, discussed in the literature, continue to shape North Korea’s onward proliferation activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the changing geopolitical landscape – particularly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – may provide new opportunities for North Korea. Russia’s willingness to engage in military trade with North Korea may give other countries the green light to breach UN sanctions and accept North Korean arms, missile or even nuclear technology. There is a real risk that such developments could lead to a resurgence of the North Korean arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In re-examining the topic and building on others’ work, the authors were able to consider a wider range of data, as new material has become available over the past decade. Part of the reason for limited research on North Korean onward proliferation is the methodological challenge inherent in the study of Pyongyang’s proliferation activities. The extreme opacity of the North Korean economy, its regime and policymaking process makes the country a challenging target for researchers. Like any other country, North Korea guards the details of its military programmes – including procurement, technological developments and exports – particularly closely, making the study of its nuclear and missile matters especially difficult. Partial data on specific cases most often becomes available with a significant time lag, following interdictions of technology, the discovery of major proliferation rings such as the AQ Khan network, or in reports on the movement of North Korean technicians to customer states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More data on North Korean missile and nuclear developments and transfers is available than ever before. The UNSCR 1718 PoE has produced almost 20 detailed public reports since it was established in 2009, rich in details on North Korea’s sanctions evasion activities and illicit networks. Pollack’s work was largely unable to benefit from this data, which has provided insights into North Korea’s missile relationships with Egypt, Iran and Syria, as well as its dual-use technology exports. Increased access to open source data by investigative journalists, think tank analysts and academics has also led to the proliferation of analysis on NorthKorean capabilities and sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have supplemented the information available in public sources with 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with experts through video conferencing and in person in London between June and early August 2023. Interviewees included former government officials and former members of the UNSCR 1718 PoE, as well as academics and other researchers working on matters related to North Korea’s nuclear, missile and broader military programmes, North Korean domestic, economic and security policies, and broader Asian security issues. Interview questions were tailored to each expert’s respective area of knowledge, but broadly focused on North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes, proliferation activities and networks, domestic and foreign policies, and international efforts to counter North Korean proliferation. The interviews allowed the authors to gauge current views on the state of North Korea’s onward proliferation enterprise and to test hypotheses as they were developed over the course of the research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the methodological challenges in studying matters related to the North Korean missile and nuclear programmes, and the dearth of current data on the subject, interviewees often had to caveat their assessments, noting that they were based on limited data and assumptions and were thus speculative. Consequently, the authors extend the same disclaimer to the findings outlined in this paper. Nevertheless, common themes in interviewees’ assessments emerged and these were supported by further research, allowing the authors to confidently formulate their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors’ analysis is presented across two main chapters. Chapter I considers recent developments in North Korea’s technological offering and assesses which technologies may be of interest to customers. Chapter II outlines the likely factors influencing North Korean decision-making on whether to transfer its nuclear and missile technology, and how these may have evolved in recent years. The paper concludes with 10 recommendations to address supply of and demand for North Korean missile and nuclear technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has long acted as an exporter of ballistic missile technology – particularly SRBM systems. According to one estimate, North Korean supply made up around 40% of the ballistic missiles supplied to the developing world between 1987 and 2009; more than 500 missile systems in total.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The genesis of North Korea’s own missile programme was the transfer of Soviet-design Scud SRBMs from Egypt in the 1980s. North Korea in turn supplied the Scud system – and related components – to a wide range of customers, many based in the Middle East. This included Iran, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Yemen and the UAE. North Korea also transferred Scud missile technology to Myanmar and Vietnam in East Asia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Pyongyang transferred Nodong MRBMs, a scaled-up version of the Scud SRBM, to Iran and Pakistan in the 1990s. Both states’ programmes have advanced far beyond this early North Korean assistance – as is the case for a number of North Korea’s earlier customers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has also transferred IRBM technology to Iran and has allegedly offered IRBMs to private arms dealers in the past.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The authors are aware of just four cases in the public domain of North Korean transfers of technology pertaining directly to nuclear weapons capabilities, from the 1990s to 2016.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nuclear trigger technology to Pakistan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korean technicians assisted Pakistani weapons scientists in producing krytrons – components used to trigger a nuclear device – in the mid-1990s. This was part of a series of technological deals between the two states, with Pakistan receiving complete missiles and parts from North Korea, as well as North Korea receiving centrifuge technology, and its technicians training in Pakistani facilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Uranium gas to Libya.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In December 2003, after the revelation that Libya was purchasing a centrifuge enrichment plant from the AQ Khan proliferation network, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in the country were shown three mystery cylinders of uranium hexafluoride (UF6), a uranium gas that is fed into the centrifuges during the enrichment process. US analysis of contamination on the outside of the cylinders showed that they had originated in North Korea’s Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Centre. The IAEA later stated that the 1.7-tonne shipment was the first of a larger planned series of transfers of 20 tonnes between North Korea and Libya brokered by Khan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A reactor for Syria.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea worked with Syria to construct a nuclear reactor near Al-Kibar in Syria between the late 1990s and 2007 (when the site was bombed by Israeli aircraft). The reactor – the most extensive example of North Korea’s nuclear exports in the public domain – was a smaller-scale version of North Korea’s 5-megawatt (MW) graphite-moderated reactor at Yongbyon. Intelligence reports suggested that the reactor would have been capable of producing plutonium for one or two weapons annually, had it been fuelled or gone critical.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sale of thermonuclear weapon isotope online.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2016, an open source investigation revealed an advertisement for lithium-6. Lithium-6 is an isotope that can be used in thermonuclear weapons – either directly, or by irradiating it in a reactor to produce tritium. The advert was posted openly on a business-to-business (B2B) website and listed a phone number linked to the North Korean embassy in Beijing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-north-koreas-current-technological-offerings&quot;&gt;I. North Korea’s Current Technological Offerings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has acquired and developed – and therefore could potentially export – a wide range of missile and nuclear technologies. This potential technological offering has expanded over the past decade as North Korea has advanced its missile and nuclear capabilities – both indigenously and through acquisition of technology from other countries. While the offering has expanded, the fundamental range of options for transfer has not changed, and includes everything from fuel cycle facilities and complete missile systems to capabilities for building these facilities, individual dual-use goods and components, as well as expertise relating to elements of missile production, and to the nuclear fuel cycle or to weaponisation. Table 1 summarises some of the main types of transfers North Korea could consider (there is evidence of past exports across all these categories, except for the transfer of complete nuclear warheads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s developments in nuclear and missile technology over the past decade could have a dual effect on its supply of technology. First, newly developed capabilities – which are more attractive to a wider range of customers – could be transferred. Second, the replacement of older designs and systems with newer, higher-quality or more capable ones could create surpluses of older systems, goods and expertise that could be exported. These surplus items may be appealing to a different subset of customers – those with less ability to absorb technology, lower capability needs, limited budgets or perhaps similar older systems in need of spare parts or interoperable systems. At the same time, North Korea’s expanding catalogue of missile systems and nuclear capabilities raises the question of whether it could now consider a sub-set of this catalogue of technologies to be too strategically important for its own security for them to be transferred to customers abroad. These security concerns are explored further in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missile-technology-offerings&quot;&gt;Missile Technology Offerings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, North Korea has mostly exported short-range, and sometimes medium-range, ballistic missiles. Could recent developments in its short-, medium- and longer-range ballistic missiles create new sales opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developments in SRBM and MRBM Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has debuted a series of solid-fuelled SRBMs since 2018. Although the exact specifications of the systems – some of which have multiple variants – are unclear, they will likely replace the liquid-fuelled Scuds and Tochka-type systems in North Korea’s arsenal, and potentially also in its sales catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea first revealed the KN-23 solid-fuelled SRBM during a 2019 parade. Since then, several variants have been developed, including smaller shorter-range and larger longer-range versions. KN-23 variants have been developed for deployment on a variety of platforms, such as road mobile transportable erector launchers, underground silos, railcars, submarines and underwater silos. The KN-24 – another solid-fuelled SRBM, with a range of around 400 km – was also unveiled in 2019. A further 2019 debut, the KN-25, is a solid-fuelled system described in North Korean media as a “super-large multiple rocket launcher”. It has four launch tubes on each launcher, and a range of up to 380 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These newer solid propellant missile systems could appeal to customers for several reasons. Beyond their quicker time to launch, solid-fuelled systems are easier to operate than liquid-fuelled ones (which require greater expertise for maintenance and handling of highly explosive, corrosive and toxic fuels). Older liquid-fuelled systems also require the procurement of a range of support vehicles and handling facilities – increasing the human and financial investment required. North Korea has also recently shown signs of exploring ampulisation technology – a set of measures to ensure maintenance of liquid-fuelled missiles in combat readiness for longer periods of time. This could both make a more appealing product, overcoming some of the shortcomings of liquid-fuelled systems, and see North Korea find ways to reduce the maintenance burden and investment required by customers for liquid-fuelled products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developments in IRBM and ICBM Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean advances in missile technology that have received the most media attention relate to the country’s long-range systems, such as IRBMs and ICBMs. This includes the KN-17 IRBM, successfully tested in 2017; the KN-26 medium- range submarine-launched ballistic missile, successfully tested in 2019; the KN-28 (Hwasong-17) ICBM, successfully tested in 2022; and, most recently, the Hwasong-18. The latter, debuted in February 2023 and successfully tested in April, is North Korea’s first solid propellant ICBM – a significant development in its strategic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested that Pyongyang may consider transferring some of its longer-range missile systems to customers abroad. Indeed, North Korea did transfer IRBMs to Iran, which were likely based on imported Soviet missile technology. However, the strategic significance of these systems to North Korea’s own defence – and the insights they could betray into North Korea’s technology (including the state of its missile capabilities and domestic production capability, or reliance on foreign components) – may disincentivise Pyongyang from transferring them to others. The strategic importance that North Korea places on its missile capabilities, as well as the limited opportunities for intelligence collection on these systems by external actors, may make Pyongyang sensitive about having these capabilities fall into the hands of an adversary. Similar considerations could be applied to the Hwasong-8 carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle, which – while being an SRBM – has strategic significance for Pyongyang that could make transfer less likely. Although, as some of the experts interviewed for this project noted, any missile technology might be for sale for the right price, and Pyongyang may not care about its technology being intercepted provided it has received payment from the customer. These competing security and economic considerations are discussed in more detail in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential customer base for longer-range missile systems is also limited. There are few countries that would benefit from an ICBM capability (which suggests the need to hold at risk an adversary further than 5,500 km away) who have not already shown some interest in developing these systems domestically. The relationship between ICBMs and nuclear weapons, in which one technology often necessitates the development of the other to have strategic value, also reduces any potential customer base. Iran may be the most obvious exception, and would likely benefit from further collaboration with North Korea on long-range missile technology (albeit probably without the transfer of complete long-range missile systems), and is a case discussed further below and in Chapter II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential for Surplus Sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk that North Korea may export surplus older systems, notably those based on liquid-fuelled Scud or Nodong technology that are likely being replaced (or may be in future) by newer solid-fuelled systems. North Korea used to frequently parade these missiles, but a system based on Scud or Nodong technology has not appeared in a parade since 2017. The KN-02, an early North Korean-manufactured version of the solid-fuelled Soviet OTR-21 Tochka missile, which was first unveiled in 2007, has also not been paraded since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it remains unclear how many newer systems North Korea has been able to deploy, the apparent phasing out of older missile models raises questions as to what might have happened to these older systems, and whether surpluses could be for sale. Arms marketing material of unclear veracity handed over in the 2020 undercover documentary film The Mole included Scud C and Nodong (marketed as Scud E) systems and supporting vehicles allegedly for sale, as well as a system described as “Tochika-U”, likely the KN-02.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surplus missile technology – including full missile systems, spare parts or components – may appeal to customers still operating Scud- or Tochka-type systems (see Table 2). However, this group of states is declining in size, with the returns of maintaining such aged technology diminishing, if not already non-existent – particularly if states have access to more modern options in the form of more advanced missiles or UAVs. The two states that received North Korean Nodong-type missiles in the 1990s, Iran and Pakistan, both indigenised the technology and have since progressed in their own programmes, although surplus Nodong-type systems could potentially be of interest to new customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ANTGa59.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: States Holding Scud and Tochka Technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: IISS, The Military Balance 2023 (Abingdon: Routledge, 2023) and a survey of other open source information. Note: Current data is difficult to compile – but inclusion in this table suggests that there is either evidence these countries currently operate these systems, or little evidence to suggest that the capability has been retired.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surpluses created by the superseding of North Korea’s Scud fleet could lead to parts being available for sale. Evidence of North Korean trade in spare parts for these older systems, though, is dated. A 2013 shipment of Scud parts originating in North Korea, including connectors, relays, voltage circuit breakers and a barometric switch, was interdicted en route to Egypt from Beijing. North Korean markings were visible on two of the items – suggesting manufacture in North Korea. Egypt has continued to maintain and operate Scud systems, and it is not out of the question that more recent (and successful) shipments of spare parts and components have occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea may have other uses for its surplus missiles besides sales – including recycling, cannibalising them for materials, parts or components, mothballing them for future contingencies, or launching them in provocations. The war in Ukraine may also yield lessons. As one interviewee pointed out, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated the continued value of short-range systems on the battlefield, and this may lead North Korea to retain older systems in great numbers for future contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collaboration in Missile Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the sanctions environment and an evolving customer base, North Korea’s missile proliferation behaviour has largely adapted from the shipment of full systems towards the provision of spare parts, materials and technical support. As an unnamed UN member state noted to the UN PoE in 2019, “Instead of exporting full missile systems, the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) is sending technicians to a buyer country and establishing a complete supply chain”, noting that this pattern had been seen in Egypt, Iran and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile collaboration with Syria has been ongoing for many years. North Korean technicians were reportedly involved in the upgrade of the Scud D to create a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle in 2008. A delegation of Syrian engineers allegedly spent six years in North Korea from 2011 to 2017, and further exchanges took place around 2016, with a group of North Korean missile technicians staying on a Syrian airbase. North Korea has also supplied missile-related components to Syria as part of its collaboration with the country. Five containers of commercial items (many with applications in Scud missiles) originating in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Denmark, Japan and the US were seized by an unnamed state while being shipped to Syria from Dalian, China in 2014. The PoE also noted in 2015 and 2016 that a Syria-based official from North Korean arms exporter Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) imported ball bearings and fibre optic cables, as well as bringing in three North Korean technicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s missile collaboration with Iran has involved higher-end missile technology, given that Iran has a large (and expanding) missile industrial base and export capability of its own. Collaboration with Iran has not always been smooth sailing, with trust levels taking a significant hit after North Korea supplied the BM-25 Musudan IRBM, a missile with significant technical issues. US information suggests that over recent years there has been further collaboration on technology that is potentially of use in longer-range systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2016 sanctions notice suggested that North Korean technicians were collaborating with Iranians on an “80-ton rocket booster” being developed by North Korea. The notice stated that Iranian technicians from liquid-fuel missile producer SHIG travelled to North Korea for this purpose and named individuals who had travelled to Pyongyang for “contract negotiations”. It also suggested that KOMID had made shipments of missile-related goods to Iran, including “valves, electronics and measuring equipment suitable for use in ground testing of liquid propellant ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles”. Further information on this collaboration was included in a 2021 UN PoE report, which noted that North Korea and Iran had “resumed cooperation on long-range missile development projects”, with the report focusing in particular on the development of a space launch vehicle (SLV). This collaboration included the “transfer of critical parts” and 13 North Koreans were named who had travelled to Iran to support KOMID’s work. The report also noted the high level at which such engagement was signed off within Iran, naming senior SHIG and Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO) officials, and noting that the current director of AIO was a “key player in negotiations” when he had been the SHIG director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-technology-offerings&quot;&gt;Nuclear Technology Offerings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of the transfer of a complete warhead – something that all experts interviewed for this paper suggested was highly unlikely – there is a range of other nuclear-related technologies that North Korea could transfer. For instance, Pyongyang could sell nuclear material or isotopes, with a range of options short of weapons-usable fissile material. However – beyond the transfer of dual-use technologies with applications relevant to the production of nuclear weapons – the transfer of nuclear-weapons-relevant technology, nuclear material and other relevant isotopes was judged relatively unlikely by experts interviewed for this paper, for a number of reasons outlined further below. Nevertheless, previous North Korean transfers of nuclear technology – including reactor technology, nuclear materials, and even weaponisation technology (see Box 2) – suggest that the possibility for future transfers exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While US government assessments have suggested that North Korea likely has an arsenal of “up to 60 nuclear warheads”, there are significant gaps in public knowledge about the state of its programme and stockpile. Early attention to North Korea’s nuclear programme focused on the plutonium aspects of the fuel cycle and the 5-MW reactor at the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Centre. While it was suspected that North Korea may have uranium enrichment capabilities, the plutonium programme was, for a long time, the only publicly known North Korean nuclear weapons pathway. This changed in 2010, when a US delegation, including former Los Alamos National Laboratory Director Siegfried Hecker, was shown a centrifuge facility at Yongbyon. There have been no further public reports of foreign access to North Korea’s nuclear facilities since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty persists regarding other potential enrichment facilities, the numbers and types of centrifuges North Korea may be deploying, and many other details about its uranium and plutonium fuel cycles and weaponisation processes. The limited number of recently seized shipments of goods or materials destined for North Korea’s centrifuge programme or other parts of the country’s nuclear weapons programme also restricts public understanding of the programme and how its recent development may have shaped North Korean nuclear wares available for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reactor and Enrichment Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although North Korea has shown a willingness to transfer reactor technology in the past – namely, in its provision of assistance and materials for the construction of the Al-Kibar reactor in Syria – it would be incredibly risky for North Korea and any potential customers to engage in a further reactor construction project. Any such project would be relatively easy for foreign intelligence agencies to detect using a variety of human, signals and technical means. Reactors are large construction projects that are visible in open source satellite imagery. Even if the reactor being constructed were relatively small (as in the case of Al-Kibar), and even if most of the necessary physical materials could be sourced overseas, the development of such a structure would almost certainly be noticed by various national intelligence agencies, the IAEA or even open source analysts using commercially available satellite imagery, drawing significant scrutiny. As in the Al-Kibar case, other intelligence sources – such as human and signals intelligence – would likely reveal any North Korean involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centrifuge enrichment technology perhaps offers greater opportunities for export, as demonstrated by the AQ Khan network’s sale of centrifuges and related technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya in the 1990s and 2000s. The transfer of centrifuge capabilities could range from a small number of machines with associated expertise to a full turnkey centrifuge facility, and could be harder to detect than the construction of a reactor, given that facilities can be constructed covertly underground and that they lack the distinctive visual signatures of a nuclear reactor. However, the construction or expansion of such facilities in past instances has also been monitored using open source satellite imagery in the context of North Korea, Iran and other states. Disassembled shipping – consisting of many shipments of largely benign-looking industrial goods and materials (as seen in some of Khan’s transfers of enrichment technology to Libya) – could also make detection difficult. However, greater awareness of the risks posed by the transfer of centrifuge technology among customs and intelligence agencies following the Khan case, as well as the enhanced ability of NGOs to collect and monitor data on illicit trade activity, could mean that multiple connected shipments would be detected more readily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited knowledge of North Korea’s centrifuge technology makes it difficult to assess whether it has old surplus centrifuge models it may want to sell and/or whether it possesses newer technologies that are more appealing to customers. During his 2010 visit, Hecker observed a facility with around 2,000 machines that appeared to be based on the Pakistani P-2 centrifuge model, and fabricatedwith rotors made from “alloys containing iron” according to one North Koreanengineer – interpreted by Hecker to mean maraging steel. As some analysts have noted, that North Korea is still operating these P-2 type machines is “an assumption that should be treated with caution”. Indeed, a paper published by a North Korean scientist indicates at least some interest in more advanced models of centrifuges. Taking the Iranian nuclear programme as a point of comparison, Tehran has developed multiple generations and models of centrifuges in a similar time span. It would be reasonable to assume that North Korea could have made comparable progress. However, the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme and the motivations behind it are different from those of North Korea: Iran is more focused on publicly displaying its technical capabilities and trying to create leverage in the context of diplomacy over its nuclear programme, while North Korea is likely focusing on improving the efficiency of its centrifuge technology to expand its fissile material stocks and nuclear arsenal, with no public communication aspect – at least for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movement towards more advanced models would suggest that North Korea has developed domestic advanced centrifuge production capabilities and may indicate that there are fewer chokepoints for the sub-technologies required for production. Full centrifuges (whether more or less advanced) or constituent dual-use technologies (discussed further below) could both appeal to customers. However, the extreme secrecy surrounding this aspect of North Korea’s programme would make the practicalities of marketing and sharing this technology difficult and risky for North Korea, as the interdiction of shipments could provide significant insights into Pyongyang’s programme. Development of more advanced centrifuges could also create surpluses of older machines and spare parts – items that Khan’s network tried to provide to Iran and Libya, with mixed success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intangible Nuclear Transfers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the transfer of tangible enrichment or reprocessing technologies, North Korea may seek to capitalise on the export of intangibles – that is, expertise, skills and design information relevant to nuclear weapons development. Such an offering could certainly be useful for states looking to develop aspects of a nuclear fuel cycle or move towards a nuclear weapons capability. Transfer of intangibles could accompany tangible transfers, as was the case in Syria when North Korea deployed experts and transferred technology to construct the Al-Kibar reactor. It could also involve North Korea aiding other states in solving specific technical challenges, such as North Korean technicians’ support to Pakistan in producing krytrons in the 1990s (see Box 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of the different aspects of North Korea’s nuclear knowledge will ultimately be decided by Pyongyang’s prospective customers/partners, but the most useful and unique offering is likely to be North Korea’s tacit knowledge – the things that cannot easily be codified and transferred, and only learned by doing. This could include the experience of producing fissile materials through reactor operation and reprocessing, running an enrichment plant, or experience related to nuclear weapons design, testing and weaponisation (an even rarer area of expertise outside the nuclear weapons states). This sphere of knowledge might be of particular interest to Iran, a state that has mastered enrichment technology and may have an interest in pursuing a weapons capability in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dual-use-technologies&quot;&gt;Dual-Use Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the level of monitoring of North Korea’s borders has risen, and the transfer of full missile systems or other large missile and nuclear-related technology has thus become riskier, North Korea is likely to look to export more innocuous dual-use technologies and materials – those that have both civilian and military applications. While North Korea likely relies on imports for a large proportion of the higher-end items for its WMD and military programmes (the so-called “chokepoint” technologies), as its programme has advanced, Pyongyang has undoubtedly indigenised the production of some dual-use components and materials, and may look to capitalise on these production abilities and any surpluses through onward sales. It may also look to act as a broker, leveraging its procurement networks around the world to source dual-use goods for customers, either for use directly by the customer or by North Korean technicians assisting in missile- and nuclear-related manufacturing and development projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the transfer of dual-use items from North Korea would still violate UN sanctions, such transfers would be more inconspicuous than the movement of large missile and nuclear technologies. North Korean-manufactured goods could be laundered within the extensive legitimate global trade in dual-use technologies and would, if uncovered, be less politically contentious than full systems. Russian or Chinese markets provide extensive laundering opportunities which could be capitalised on with minimal risk, as Moscow and Beijing have historically turned a blind eye to North Korean sanctions violations. Online platforms – such as the Chinese B2B site used to market North Korean lithium-6 in 2016 (see Box 2) – could provide opportunities for the anonymous sale of technology, obfuscating obvious links to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for North Korean transfers of dual-use goods to countries that had previously purchased North Korean missile technology. For example, PoE reports note the interdiction in 2010 of a shipment of aluminium alloy rods, copper bars and brass discs to Syria, with the products likely originating in North Korea. A shipment of North Korean-origin graphite cylinders was also interdicted in 2013 en route to Syria. North Korea has also previously marketed its dual-use machine tools overseas. In 2013, the UN listed Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation – North Korea’s main machine tool producer – for its involvement in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes. As researchers noted in 2014, the company attended a trade fair in Dandong, China in 2013 and marketed machine tools in China and Russia under the names of “Millim Technology Company” and “Koryo Technologies” (or “KORTEC”), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While technological developments in North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes help dictate what may be available for sale, a range of political, economic and security factors also play an important role in influencing both demand for – and North Korean willingness to supply – these technologies. This chapter explores in more detail what is likely to motivate and restrict both North Korea and its potential customers when it comes to engaging in missile and nuclear technology transfers. While the need to generate revenue remains a strong motivator for Pyongyang, demand for its wares has been progressively waning. This decline is the result of several factors, namely, changing technological needs and greater supplier choice among Pyongyang’s customers, as well as concerns over the quality of North Korean goods and the risk of interdiction. The chapter also maps out the changing sanctions context, and how Russia’s arms purchases from North Korea could undermine the sanctions regime and risk a resurgence of North Korea’s arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;continued-need-for-revenue-generation&quot;&gt;Continued Need for Revenue Generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the past, revenue generation remains a key incentive for North Korean missile technology transfers. North Korea’s economic troubles long predate the UN sanctions regime, with the country repeatedly defaulting on debt repayments from the 1970s onwards. The imposition from 2006 of increasingly expansive UNSC sanctions on the country’s economy exacerbated existing economic challenges, while more recent sectoral sanctions introduced in 2016 and 2017, and the border closures stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic, have put North Korea in an especially precarious economic situation. States are prohibited from virtually all economic engagement with the country, leaving it cash-strapped and desperate to seek out and exploit economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely how much revenue North Korea has generated, or may be able to generate, through the sale of missiles or nuclear technology is challenging to ascertain. Public reporting on individual North Korean missile and nuclear transfers is extremely limited and very rarely includes data on the value of transactions. Furthermore, reported figures may not include estimates for the transfer of expertise, manufacturing facilities, or maintenance and support services. Some of the available figures unsurprisingly suggest that military transfers offer North Korea lucrative opportunities for revenue generation, with estimates – which are based on sources that are either unclear, dated and/or difficult to verify – citing figures in the hundreds of millions of US dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples provide insights into the revenue raised from individual transfers,transactions or weapons systems. While comparing the prices offered for ballistic missile systems is extremely challenging, a review of the prices of North Korean conventional weapons offerings supports the hypothesis that North Korean systems are generally cheaper than the alternatives. The prices offered in the 2020 documentary The Mole, and to British arms dealer Michael Ranger in a deal around a decade ago, suggest that North Korean arms are often offered at a price below the market rate of equivalent systems. This has historically made North Korean arms appealing to customers, particularly in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mole saw marketing materials – including a price list for North Korean weapons systems – handed to an actor playing the role of an investor during a 2017 trip to Pyongyang. The price list included a cost breakdown for missiles with different types of warheads, launchers and associated handling vehicles. Missiles and vehicles were priced per unit and in quantities of five, three or two units. For example, Scud C missiles with high explosive warheads were offered for $2.795 million per unit, but sold in lots of five for $13.975 million, whereas Nodong missiles (termed Scud E for extended range) were offered for $4.94 million per unit and $24.7 million for five. While they are impossible to verify, such values are not outlandish compared to figures seen elsewhere. Sale of components and parts can also be lucrative: the PoE noted in 2015 and 2016 that a KOMID official based in Syria (with the rank of major general) shipped ball bearings and fibre optic cables, and brought in three North Korean technicians, earning over €100,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea could potentially leverage more sensitive nuclear transfers for extensive profits far above the market rate, especially in situations where the customer has no alternatives. Illicit procurement networks often see intermediaries monetise the risk by charging a premium, and North Korea could do this through selling goods it has either produced or procured, as part of a package for customers. Analysis of the cost of the UF 6 sold to Libya through the Khan network in the early 2000s suggests that the three cylinders of 1.7 tonnes were sold for $2 million, the equivalent of 40 times the then market rate. Similarly, transfer of North Korea’s more advanced missile systems (or, more likely, related technology) such as its IRBM, ICBM or newer hypersonic technologies may offer particularly lucrative opportunities for revenue generation. However, as mentioned, Pyongyang may be reluctant to transfer some of these higher-end technologies to avoid betraying the details of its advanced systems and production capabilities to adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the high risk, larger projects such as the construction of facilities could also garner significant sums. While of unclear veracity, media reporting from 2009 citing an Iranian defector and Israeli intelligence claimed that Iran financed Syria’s purchase of the Al-Kibar reactor from North Korea, paying Pyongyang between $1 billion and $2 billion for the project. The Khan network – and especially Khan’s Libya deal – saw the transfer of a 10,000-centrifuge plant for between $100 million and $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean arms sales have also been heavily shaped by the financial incentives of North Korean arms trading company representatives – essentially, the salespeople – working overseas. These representatives are often accredited as diplomats, work out of embassies, and are entrepreneurial in building relationships and exploiting opportunities. Indeed, they are compelled to be entrepreneurial: North Korea’s overseas missions, including embassies, are believed to be self-funding, tasked with raising funds to sustain themselves and the regime back in Pyongyang. While the financial driver at this working level may manifest itself through arms sales, decisions to sell missiles and nuclear technology are likely far more sensitive, and almost certainly are taken in Pyongyang. Nevertheless, North Korean operatives abroad are likely to be under pressure to identify revenue-generating opportunities to decision-makers in Pyongyang, which may include potential deals for the transfer of missile or even nuclear technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for North Korea to engage in barter trade as it has in the past, exchanging missile and nuclear technology, expertise and materials for other goods. Experts interviewed for this paper pointed to oil, grains and fertiliser as goods that North Korea may be especially interested in procuring in a barter arrangement. In the 2000s, the Myanmar government “gifted” rice to North Korea in exchange for “technical services and equipment”, which reportedly included conventional weapons. Recent reports have suggested that Moscow may offer Pyongyang food in exchange for munitions. Such barter arrangements allow North Korea to receive payment without needing to access the international financial system, while also accessing goods it is prohibited from (or may struggle in) procuring freely as a result of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfers of the full missile and nuclear systems that are likely to prove most lucrative to North Korea have become riskier and more challenging due to increased global awareness of UNSC sanctions on North Korea, improved interdiction capabilities and expanded open source scrutiny of the country’s trade activities. This led some of the experts interviewed to ask whether Pyongyang would continue to pursue missile and nuclear transfers, or shift to less risky and easier to move commodities for revenue generation. North Korea’s increasing exploitation of cryptocurrency is one example of an alternative yet highly lucrative revenue-generation line, with cryptocurrency hacks allegedly generating $1.7 billion for North Korea in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of more innocuous but still sanctioned goods and services – such as textiles or the export of construction labour and IT services – are also less risky sources of revenue. For instance, coal has historically been a major source of revenue for North Korea and has been directly linked to the financing of the country’s missile and nuclear programmes, although it may be seen by the broader international community as being less politically sensitive than trade in missile, nuclear or other military technology. However, North Korea’s desperate economic situation may mean that it does not have the luxury of choosing between revenue streams, and may instead require it to pursue all means available to raise funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-for-technology-barter&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Technology Barter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One form of barter trade which may be particularly attractive to North Korea is the exchange of its missile- or nuclear-related expertise and capabilities for that of other states, or engagement in collaborative missile and nuclear technology development. As mentioned earlier, striking deals which benefit North Korea technologically has long been at the core of the country’s proliferation deal-making. As Pollack has noted in his work on North Korea’s nuclear trade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the evidence is ambiguous, a careful examination suggests that many past transfers were actually done not for profit but in exchange for components or materials that benefited Pyongyang’s own nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the three nuclear cases that Pollack examines (see the first three listed in Box 2), he noted that each potentially had a barter aspect to them. However, evidence is admittedly thin in places. For example, assisting Pakistan’s krytron development came after the transfer of centrifuge components, drawings and plans to North Korea; transfers of UF6 into the Khan network may have been repayment for Khan’s assistance to North Korea in producing it; and North Korea could potentially have benefited from plutonium produced in the Al-Kibar reactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Pyongyang continues to develop its missile and nuclear programmes, exchanging complementary expertise or working on new advances in collaboration with partners will remain an attractive option, albeit one that likely has less necessity and more limited returns than in the past, given North Korea’s own recent technological successes in its nuclear and missile programmes. Priority areas for North Korea’s missile development – and for potential collaboration opportunities – are likely to include items outlined in the five-year plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems adopted at the Eighth Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea in January 2021. These include improvements in missile accuracy up to a range of 15,000 km, improvements in solid fuel propulsion for submarine-launched and ground-based ICBMs, military reconnaissance satellites, and R&amp;amp;D in hypersonic glide vehicles, nuclear-powered submarines and UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given North Korea’s technological successes and the sanctions regime, there is now a smaller range of countries that could both offer technology the country could benefit from and, importantly, be willing to offer such technology in exchange for North Korean wares. An obvious candidate would be Iran, as it has made great leaps in its centrifuge and missile programmes over the past decade. One expert interviewed for the project also suggested that there may be room for cooperation between Iran and North Korea on hypersonic glide vehicles. Russia could be another candidate. Further North Korean arms transfers to Russia (potentially including ballistic missiles) could allow North Korea to request technology from Russia’s extensive WMD and other high-technology programmes – such as its space launch or submarine programmes – in return. Moscow’s willingness to provide such technologies, given its historical commitments to non-proliferation and its potential security concerns vis-à-vis a North Korea with more advanced missile and nuclear capabilities, are not a given, but recent engagement seems to suggest a potential willingness to cooperate (see Box 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-war-in-ukraine-and-the-growing-north-korearussia-technology-transfer-axis&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 3: War in Ukraine and the Growing North Korea–Russia Technology Transfer Axis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recent developments in North Korea’s relationship with Russia are concerning for the future of both non-proliferation efforts and the UN sanctions regime. Russia’s war in Ukraine has created a need for weaponry and materiel, as well as renewed efforts by an increasingly isolated Moscow to garner political support from a smaller range of allies and partners. Initial arms transfers of “infantry rockets and missiles” were allegedly made between North Korea and the Wagner Group in November 2022. More recently, research has suggested that hundreds of containers of weaponry – likely ammunition – have been transferred from North Korea to Russian military bases, while South Korean intelligence reported indications of North Korean ballistic missile transfers to Russia in early November 2023.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The potential for exchange of more advanced and strategically important technology is clear. In July 2023, Russian Defence Minister Shoigu was shown around an arms fair in Pyongyang by Kim Jong-un, where he viewed ICBMs, SRBMs, hypersonic missiles and UAVs. During Kim’s trip to Russia to meet Putin in September 2023, the Russian leader hosted his North Korean counterpart at Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome and noted North Korea’s interest in rocket and space technology. Media reports surrounding the meeting also suggested North Korea was interested in “advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines”. Further details are yet to emerge. However, advances in missile technologies – including items identified in Pyongyang’s 2021 plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems – are also likely to be on North Korea’s wishlist for Moscow.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With these breaches of the arms embargo and possible movement towards breaches on the prohibition on transfers of other technologies, the future of the UN sanctions regime – which in some senses has been on life support for several years – is precarious. In September 2023, around the time of Kim’s visit, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov noted that sanctions were “adopted in a completely different geopolitical situation” and accused Western states of “lies” over humanitarian support. If Russia, a UNSC permanent member, so blatantly violates sanctions and is seen to use North Korean arms or missile systems in Ukraine, it may lead other states to look to North Korea for arms, and could potentially open the floodgates for further North Korean arms and missile sales.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ideological-and-foreign-policy-considerations&quot;&gt;Ideological and Foreign Policy Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, North Korea’s sales opportunities have been influenced – in part – by its broader foreign policy relationships and objectives, and vice versa. Pyongyang’s arms exports began during the Cold War, expanding significantly through the 1970s and 1980s, as North Korea built its military–industrial complex. Through its Cold War military sales, the country sought to demonstrate its commitment to the socialist cause, strengthen the capabilities of fellow members of the socialist bloc, and gain favour with Moscow and Beijing. Even during the Cold War, however, ideology was not the sole driver of North Korea’s military transfers, with the export of military technology and expertise being part of its broader efforts to consolidate relationships with developing countries around the world and compete with Seoul for influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, North Korea has continued to do business and conclude cooperation agreements in a range of fields with a variety of countries, with no indication of any discrimination on ideological grounds or links to any known direct North Korean security interests. Unlike Iran, which has been known to transfer missiles to its proxies across the Middle East, North Korea does not have similar relationships with proxies on whom it might rely to achieve certain security objectives, and thus be incentivised to transfer capabilities to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent geopolitical developments may create greater opportunities for North Korea to strengthen political ties through technology transfer. Russian arms purchases from, and growing engagement with, North Korea creates political benefits for Pyongyang. While new UN sanctions resolutions have been an unlikely prospect in recent years, with no agreement even on new entities to be added to the UN sanctions list, the relationship with Russia helps to bring North Korea out of its sanctions isolation. The apparent degradation of the international sanctions regime could also see a resurgence in what Berger describes as “reluctant” customers, as well as “ad hoc” ones. This could make other potential customers view relationships with North Korea involving arms transfers as acceptable, and could even give North Korea new opportunities to pursue such relationships alongside (and in support of) Russian activities in Africa, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, these recent developments mean that North Korea has more to play for in pursuing its international relationships and in using technology to that end. However, there is no indication that ideological sympathies or diplomatic priorities are going to be the only or even the primary driver of North Korean sales of military technology abroad – including missile and nuclear technology. Rather, these considerations will serve as a facilitator for, and an additional benefit from, Pyongyang’s illicit trade, which will still likely be driven by opportunism and the need for revenue generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sanctions-transfer-environment-and-risks-of-interdiction&quot;&gt;Sanctions, Transfer Environment and Risks of Interdiction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of interdiction, sanctions and other punitive measures is a major disincentivising factor for most countries when it comes to engaging in missile, nuclear and most other trade with North Korea. As such, North Korea’s biggest customers for arms and missile technologies today largely fall within what Berger describes as the “resilient” group. These are customers that continue to engage in business with Pyongyang despite UNSC sanctions, driven by longstanding political and military ties or else similarly under international arms embargoes or otherwise isolated. Iran, Syria and potentially Myanmar (see Box 4) clearly fit this profile, as countries that have little to lose politically by engaging with North Korea, have historical ties with Pyongyang (including in the sphere of military cooperation), and which are themselves isolated and limited in their weapons procurement options. The benefit (or necessity) of doing business with North Korea outweighs the risk of further sanctions or other reprimands for these countries from the US, the UN or others, as their economies are already subject to sanctions. However, the actual demand for North Korean longer-range missile and/or nuclear technology from these countries is likely to be tempered by some of the other factors outlined in this paper – including absence of need for these more strategic technologies, perceived unreliability of North Korea as a supplier, and the availability of similar options from other isolated suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-myanmar-a-relationship-renewed&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 4: Myanmar: A Relationship Renewed?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Myanmar is believed to have previously purchased ballistic missile technology from North Korea alongside a more extensive variety of other conventional weapons technology. However, the specifics of the transfers are opaque. In 2012, the US government noted that Myanmar had been a customer of North Korea’s missile programme, while a leaked Myanmar government report suggested that Burmese military representatives had visited a missile factory in North Korea capable of producing Scuds and likely Nodong missiles in 2008, alongside a range of other facilities in the country. A more recent, unconfirmed report notes that 20 North Korean missile technicians were in Myanmar until 2015, and – citing independent researchers based in the country – that missile cooperation has restarted between the two countries in the wake of the 2021 military coup.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Myanmar’s military regime has also been accused of nuclear weapons aspirations in the past, notably around 2010, centred around allegations by a defector who worked in Myanmar’s strategic industries – but these were largely discounted. Experts interviewed for this paper expressed scepticism that Myanmar would be interested in a nuclear weapons capability, noting the country’s pressing economic and internal security challenges. Past reports that Myanmar was interested in building a nuclear weapon have also been rejected by members of the US intelligence community and other experts. The fact that the Myanmar military’s primary concern is domestic armed insurgency also raises questions over the utility of procuring advanced missile capabilities or nuclear weapons technology from North Korea, although such capabilities could help the regime feel more secure against external invasion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving large physical shipments to and from North Korea covertly (see Box 5) has become markedly more difficult amid an improved understanding of common sanctions-evasion practices, and in light of the ability of governments and non-governmental organisations over the past decade to scrutinise North Korea’s airports, ports and border crossings using satellite imagery, trade and corporate data, and other investigative resources. The border closures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic (see Box 6) and resultant reductions in trade have also made recent movements of goods easier to detect. Increased monitoring and the potential for interdiction has therefore raised the risks of undertaking transfers of missile and nuclear goods, as well as deploying North Korean technicians, from North Korea itself. In contexts where interdiction was not possible previously, ships believed to be carrying suspicious cargo for Pyongyang have been pursued by naval vessels and forced to return to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-5-evolving-means-of-transfer&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 5: Evolving Means of Transfer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Historically, transfers of North Korean missiles were undertaken by state-connected air freight and shipping fleets. In large part, a shift away from the more obvious state-connected modes of transport towards commercial shipping has been observed since the mid-2000s. A 2021 PoE report, however, notes that state-owned shipping companies have continued to play a role. According to one unnamed UN member state, KOMID – which has been called North Korea’s “primary arms dealer” and main exporter of missile technology – has reportedly cooperated with Iran’s SHIG on shipment logistics, engaging in “shipments to Iran, using vessels belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL), and routinely operating non-stop voyages from one third country ports to Iran”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Geography also determines the easiest shipment routes, with rail connections across the border between North Korea and Russia allegedly being used to move weapons to the Wagner Group in November 2022. Russia and China’s evolving stance on North Korean sanctions could make North Korea’s land borders important vectors for proliferation-sensitive exports. However, more recent arms transfers between North Korea and Russia seem to have involved initial shipments from the former to a Russian submarine base using Russian-flagged and military-connected cargo ships running a “shuttle” service with their automatic identification system (AIS) transponders turned off to avoid detection.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenging logistical environment will likely see North Korean proliferation networks continue to adapt. Pyongyang may seek to fulfil more of its contracts entirely outside its borders, establishing manufacturing facilities in client states – as it previously had in Namibia to produce conventional weapons, for example – or in third countries, and relying increasingly on the extensive procurement networks it has established, notably in China but also around the world, to source the necessary components and materials. There may also be fewer interdiction risks if North Korean exports continue to shift towards projects that combine tangible and intangible support. In these arrangements – as seen in missile relationships with Iran and Syria, and the Al-Kibar reactor project – North Korean operatives can procure goods for projects largely outside of North Korea, and exports from North Korea can be limited to specific goods and technicians.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The constraint that the sanctions environment is currently imposing on North Korea is contingent to a significant degree on Russia and China’s future actions, with the evolution of North Korea’s growing relationship with Russia being pivotal. However, several interviewed experts noted that China’s willingness to turn a blind eye to North Korea’s onward missile and nuclear proliferation is not likely to be unlimited, especially in cases where developments affect China’s national security interests. Beijing is a signatory to a range of non-proliferation agreements and has its own security interests that may be undermined by North Korean ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology transfers. For example, China’s clear interest in avoiding instability on the Korean peninsula, and particularly any proliferation actions by North Korea that might elicit a response from the US and its allies, could potentially lead Beijing to exert pressure on Pyongyang to prevent it from engaging in such transfers. However, the degree of influence that Beijing has over Pyongyang’s onward proliferation decision-making calculus is likely limited. Some analysts have argued that China’s interest in maintaining stability in Pyongyang actually makes Beijing reticent about applying political or economic pressure, unless the risks of inaction outweigh the costs (for example, in the instance of potential North Korean nuclear warhead or fissile material transfers). Ultimately, the degree of direct coordination between Beijing and Pyongyang on sensitive matters such as missile and nuclear transfers – which would likely take place at the highest levels – is very difficult to ascertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-6-the-covid-19-pandemic&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 6: The Covid-19 Pandemic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea shut its borders to all passenger and commercial traffic at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Satellite imagery in March 2020 showed North Korean ships being recalled to the country’s ports, while land crossings with China and Russia were closed and border fences, guard posts and patrol roads were reinforced and expanded. North Korea also stopped the rotation of diplomats from its missions abroad – as it likely also did with its missile and arms technicians and procurement operatives based overseas. The country, relatively isolated in normal times, closed itself off almost entirely from the rest of the world. In the second half of 2023, though, there were signs that the borders were starting to open up again. Movement through ports and land crossings increased, restrictions on some official travel eased in spring, and North Korean nationals abroad (including some workers) were allowed to return as of August 2023, with limited commercial flights restarting that same month.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is difficult to definitively assess the impact of these restrictions on North Korea’s procurement efforts and the onward transfer of missile and nuclear technology from the country. It is reasonable to assume that transfers slowed significantly between early 2020 and 2023. Several experts interviewed for this paper pointed to the pandemic restrictions as a reason why they were sceptical that North Korea was actively exporting missile and nuclear technology. However, North Korean technicians based overseas were also likely stuck abroad in customer states and unable to return home. As the country begins to open its borders and resume trade, missile and nuclear technology transfers may become more likely – particularly given recent North Korean efforts to exhibit its wares, and amid the further disintegration of the UN sanctions consensus. The restrictions on trade and travel since 2020 have also further exacerbated the economic situation within North Korea, creating further pressure to generate revenue or source critical supplies like food from abroad, which may further incentivise the sale of missile and/or nuclear technology.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-concerns-over-advanced-deterrent-capabilities&quot;&gt;Security Concerns Over Advanced Deterrent Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security concerns, paired with the challenging transfer environment, will likely make North Korea carefully consider the transfer of certain particularly strategically important systems and technologies. These sensitivities are likely to stem from the risk that transferred technologies or information surrounding them may fall into enemy hands, with negative impacts for North Korea’s own nuclear deterrent. For example, North Korea’s adversaries could gain valuable information about North Korean capabilities from seized shipments of nuclear or missile technologies, related goods and materials, or even wreckage recovered from the battlefield. Intelligence can be derived from seized technologies, providing insights into manufacturing, supply chains and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examination of interdicted missiles, or wreckage recovered after their use, may yield insights into North Korea’s manufacturing capabilities or the specific types of technology that it is importing to develop its programmes. This could allow North Korea’s adversaries to better counter the country’s illicit supply chains. Nuclear forensic techniques could provide insights into North Korea’s fuel cycle if North Korean fissile material or contaminated goods were seized in transit. Intelligence gained through examination of seized or recovered goods can also be used to construct countermeasures. This is a particular concern with regard to more modern ballistic missiles that might yield insights to inform developments in missile defence capabilities and arrangements by the US or its partners such as South Korea and Japan. The transfer of certain newer systems unique to North Korea would also reduce the prospect of potential plausible deniability of Pyongyang’s involvement in the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If North Korea is concerned about undermining its own security through transfers, this would lead to the development of two categories of systems. The first includes items that are core to North Korea’s security, and which would not be transferred: interviewees referred to these as the “crown jewels” or “top state secrets core to North Korea’s survivability”. This would include nuclear warheads and fissile material – which would be unlikely to be transferred for several reasons – as well as ICBMs and other missiles core to North Korea’s deterrent. The second category would include lower-level and older technology, which North Korea would be less concerned about transferring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I explored some of the surplus technologies that may fall into this second category and discussed several reasons why North Korea may not be willing to transfer all of its older systems. A few further considerations may also follow from this security thesis. Reluctance to export newer systems and reveal information could lead to the development of export variants for the new SRBMs. However, this would require significant upfront investment from Pyongyang or its customers, which would be challenging in an environment with limited cash flow – which is exactly the situation in which North Korea and many of its historical and potential customers find themselves. It is also possible that if the design information of certain systems is compromised (for example, after wreckage is recovered after a test, or following a hack of the manufacturers), the security rationales against wider transfer for that particular system may be undermined, if concerns about the compromise of strategically important information on certain North Korean capabilities is indeed a consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changing-technologies-and-markets&quot;&gt;Changing Technologies and Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological developments may also restrict demand for North Korea’s missile offerings. Chapter I outlined the remaining (but shrinking) market for the Scud-and Tochka-like technologies that North Korea may have in surplus. Indeed, due to its extensive history of Scud exports and – in some cases – related manufacturing capabilities, North Korea may have reduced its appeal as a supplier to some customers that managed to absorb the technology. However, in the present day, North Korea’s missile sales also have to compete with newer technologies and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, militaries’ growing demand for UAVs is well documented. UAVs may be seen as a less expensive and more operationally appropriate system by some countries that would have previously sought short-range missiles. While UAV and SRBM capabilities differ significantly, including in their utility, the former may be well-suited – if not more desirable – for states without an active missile programme and in need of low-yield but high-precision capabilities to carry out limited and precise attacks in neighbouring countries or against factions on their own territories. UAVs are cheaper, more versatile, and easier to produce and transfer than ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has shown some advances in its UAV programme, with drones penetrating South Korean airspace in recent years, and two large novel UAV systems shown to Shoigu in Pyongyang in July 2023. However, Iran’s capabilities for producing and exporting these systems are more advanced: Iran has well-established UAV capabilities and has exported drones to partners in the region and further afield. Critically, Iranian UAVs have now been extensively battle-tested – not only by Iranian proxies in the Middle East but also on a large scale by Russian forces in Ukraine. As such, past customers of North Korean SRBMs may now look to Iran as a UAV supplier instead. As Pollack noted, the 1991 Gulf War helped to shape missile markets, reducing interest in North Korean products as cruise missiles played a prominent role. Russia’s war on Ukraine could also affect potential North Korean missile markets, although extensive UAV and missile use makes it difficult to establish possible lessons at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran is also an established proliferator of missile technology, having exported missiles to proxies and partners in the Middle East. With the expiry of the UNSC embargo on nuclear-capable missiles and related technology trade with Iran in October 2023, Iran may seek to expand its customer base and thus pose competition for North Korea in securing new customers for its missile technology (although such trade with Iran is still sanctioned by the US, Europe and others).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;claims-to-nuclear-responsibility&quot;&gt;Claims to Nuclear Responsibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final restraining factor – albeit one with unclear salience – consists of the non-proliferation norms that emerged after 1945, and North Korea’s notion of nuclear responsibility. The UN sanctions regime imposed on North Korea was, in some sense, an embodiment of these norms. Since acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, North Korea has repeatedly referred to itself as a “responsible nuclear power”, including in the context of onward nuclear proliferation. These are likely efforts by Pyongyang to normalise itself as a legitimate nuclear power outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – akin to the status enjoyed by Pakistan and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an October 2006 statement, just days after North Korea’s first nuclear test and the subsequent UNSC resolution condemning it, North Korea’s foreign minister referred to the country as a “responsible nuclear weapons state [that] will never use nukes first and will not allow nuclear transfer”. These claims have most recently been codified in the September 2022 Law on DPRK’s Policy on Nuclear Forces (Section 10):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The DPRK, as a responsible nuclear weapons state, shall neither deploy nuclear weapons in the territory of other countries nor share them and not transfer nuclear weapons, technology and equipment concerned and weapon-grade nuclear substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the earnestness of these claims is unclear. By virtue of developing a nuclear weapons programme outside the recognised international non-proliferation framework – namely, the NPT – North Korea has already demonstrated its disregard for nuclear non-proliferation norms. Several experts interviewed for this paper also noted that North Korea has not offered any definition of what it means by “responsibility” in the nuclear non-proliferation context. However, the excerpt from the 2022 law could arguably be taken as a definition of what Pyongyang considers to be “responsible” behaviour by a nuclear power. Whether Pyongyang’s commitments can be taken at face value is debatable, but its past proliferation of nuclear technology after the 2006 statement should raise serious doubts. There is less of an international consensus regarding missile non-proliferation. North Korea has tended to deny allegations rather than make claims about responsibility when it comes to the transfer of missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a growing technological offering and a persistent need to generate hard currency, North Korea still has significant incentives to sell its missile, nuclear and dual-use technologies to foreign customers. It now has a wider range of more advanced missile and nuclear technologies than ever before, some of which may be available for sale to interested buyers. Pyongyang’s technological progress may also have created surpluses available for transfer, particularly Scud, Tochka and Nodong missiles, or even surplus or second-hand nuclear and dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these clear supply-side drivers, though, a range of factors work to constrain North Korea’s sales – particularly on the demand side of the equation – and these are likely to prevent an all-out onward-proliferation bonanza. The potential markets and customers for North Korean missile technology have been whittled down by a variety of factors, including North Korea’s assistance to customers in indigenising the technology it has sold, the emergence of competitors such as Iran, and the development of newer and more appealing technologies – namely, UAVs, but potentially also other suppliers and systems in future. The sanctions landscape and the unprecedented monitoring of the Korean peninsula also reduce sales opportunities and increase the risks of interdiction. Given Pyongyang’s recent technological advances, there may also now be only marginal returns on North Korean efforts to obtain technology for its own programmes through barter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about putting its own deterrent at risk are also likely to temper North Korea’s willingness to export more advanced capabilities, despite the potentially lucrative price tag that could be attached to them. Offering these systems for sale is far riskier than peddling the Scud or even the Nodong systems that were based on well-understood and frugal 1960s Soviet missile technology. Insights gained from interdicted systems or those recovered from the battlefield after leaving North Korean control could do harm to North Korea’s national security. The export of such systems would increase the chances of them falling into adversaries’ hands, despite minimal recent large interdictions of North Korean military shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a continuation of some of the trends observed by Joshua Pollack in his work over a decade ago, the limited potential customer base, as well as a more challenging transfer environment, suggests that North Korea is most likely to continue engaging with established missile customers – those that Andrea Berger termed “resilient”, such as Iran or Syria. Future transfers are likely to involve dual-use components or intangible transfers of expertise rather than complete systems – because of limited demand and due to the greater chances of the latter being interdicted. North Korea’s extensive procurement networks outside its borders may also allow it to procure technology from third countries to transfer to customers, meaning that fewer direct shipments would be required. The ubiquity of largely anonymous online platforms may also help to identify potential customers and facilitate the sale of dual-use technology, despite the extensive international sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the changing geopolitical landscape resulting from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine may bring new opportunities for North Korea. On the one hand, Pyongyang may benefit financially and technologically from technological exchanges with Russia. On the other, Russia’s willingness to engage in military trade with North Korea and Moscow’s ability to veto further UNSC sanctions against Pyongyang or any of its future customers may give other countries the green light to accept North Korean missile and maybe even nuclear technology. The cover provided by Russia’s – and, to a less public extent, China’s – patronship of Pyongyang could lead to a significant change in North Korea’s fortunes as a supplier. Although only time will tell how the relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow develops, there remains a real risk of a broader collapse of the UN sanctions regime and the resurgence of North Korea’s arms and missile export enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the above analysis – and the clear need to pay attention to the issue – this paper presents 10 recommendations, organised into two sets, to help in countering North Korean missile and nuclear technology proliferation. The first set concerns efforts to deter and dissuade Pyongyang from engaging in onward proliferation – that is, they address the supply side of the equation. The second set addresses the demand side, suggesting ways to reduce North Korea’s customer base. The recommendations call for an approach that relies both on diplomatic engagement with Pyongyang and on harder measures that signal a willingness to disrupt and punish violations of sanctions and international non-proliferation norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-addressing-supply-side-factors&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Addressing Supply-Side Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Clearly message and demonstrate commitments to interdict, learn from and exploit North Korean missile and nuclear transfers.&lt;/strong&gt; A concern that North Korea is likely to have over the transfer of its missile and nuclear technology – particularly more advanced or strategically significant systems – is the potential for that technology to fall into the hands of Pyongyang’s adversaries. This concern should be validated and leveraged. The US, the UK and their partners need to continue prioritising efforts at interdicting North Korean shipments of weapons technology, as per their UNSC obligations – either in transit or at their destination (for instance, in Ukraine, should Russia procure and use North Korean missiles in the future). They must also make clear that the technology will be inspected, shared with North Korea’s adversaries and used to help develop effective countermeasures, including missile defence. Outreach should also continue to be conducted on the relevant UNSC resolutions and through informal networks such as the signatory states to the Proliferation Security Initiative “Statement of Interdiction Principles”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Bolster intelligence efforts, engage with allies and support open source researchers as force multipliers.&lt;/strong&gt; Further bolstering intelligence collection to target potential North Korean procurement and export networks can help strengthen countermeasures across the board. The US, the UK, and Western and Asia-Pacific allies should ensure that the necessary processes are in place to allow for intelligence-sharing and collaboration in this sphere. They should ensure that new means to monitor potential intangible transfers (especially the movement of people such as technicians and engineers) are developed. This also includes greater exploitation of open source intelligence to further investigate North Korea’s relationships and monitor the internet for potential North Korean marketing of dual-use technologies on B2B websites. The lithium-6 and machine tool examples discussed above, as well as North Korea’s recent arms transfers to Russia, are all export or marketing activities that were uncovered by non-government researchers using open sources. Open source exploitation by non-governmental organisations can be a force multiplier when the intelligence community’s resources are stretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Strengthen counter-proliferation-financing efforts to weaken the revenue-generating potential of North Korean missile and nuclear transfers.&lt;/strong&gt; Revenue generation is likely to be North Korea’s key driver for engaging in onward proliferation of missile and nuclear technology. Continuing to invest in efforts to prevent Pyongyang from receiving or moving funds can help weaken that incentive. While North Korea may receive some payment by way of barter trade (not involving the formal financial system), targeting financial flows can impact how lucrative Pyongyang believes its proliferation activities to be. This should include continued awareness-raising of international and multilateral sanctions on North Korea, of standards and best practices for countering proliferation financing (CPF), and of common sanctions-evasion methods. National governments and international organisations engaged on CPF issues should prioritise sharing best practices and resources – for instance, model CPF legislation or lists of entities suspected of supporting North Korean proliferation financing (even if these are not sanctioned). While there have so far not been any known cases of North Korea using cryptocurrency as payment for proliferation-related transactions, Pyongyang is clearly transitioning its activities to the online space and has engaged extensively in crypto theft for revenue generation. Ensuring that CPF efforts keep up with these adaptations will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Include non-proliferation commitments in any nuclear negotiations with North Korea.&lt;/strong&gt; Any future negotiations with North Korea on its nuclear programme should include commitments to international non-proliferation and nuclear security standards. Including an explicit commitment from North Korea to not transfer nuclear technology to other states – particularly with reference to the 2022 law on its policy on nuclear forces and clarifying North Korea’s definition of nuclear “responsibility” – as part of future negotiations could help positively reinforce any existing tendencies in Pyongyang to present itself as a responsible nuclear custodian. Such an approach, however, would require some level of recognition (even if tacit) of North Korea’s nuclear weapons capability – a proposition that is the subject of much debate within the expert community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5: Engage with China on preventing North Korea’s onward proliferation, including by highlighting implications for Chinese interests and security.&lt;/strong&gt; China has been a key facilitator for North Korean sanctions-evasion activity and likely has at least some, albeit limited, influence on Pyongyang’s decision-making in relation to onward proliferation. Engaging with China on the issue may therefore yield some benefit, especially if Beijing can be convinced to curtail Pyongyang’s access to transhipment routes, as well as financial and corporate infrastructure. To be sure, the likelihood of this approach’s success is dubious, as Chinese interests and security concerns diverge significantly from those of the US, Europe and other East Asian countries concerned with North Korean proliferation. In fact, creating instability in certain parts of East Asia might be in China’s interest if such instability were to absorb US resources and attention. There may be potential to incentivise Chinese cooperation, including through appeals to Beijing’s desire to be seen as a responsible nuclear power, as well as through continued identification and sanctioning of Chinese entities involved in supporting North Korean sanctions evasion. Taking a transactional approach may be another possibility – linking US openness to addressing issues of Chinese concern with Chinese willingness to prevent – or at least not support – North Korean onward proliferation activity. However, the currently limited state of dialogue between the US and China, as well as other issues such as the tension over semiconductor export controls and the issue of Taiwan, will make having an impact in this regard challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-addressing-demand-side-factors&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Addressing Demand-Side Factors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6: Double down on counter-proliferation messaging and support.&lt;/strong&gt; If indications emerge that North Korea’s onward proliferation of missile and nuclear technology is starting to ramp up again, the US and its partners should consider making a clear statement that buyers of North Korean arms, missiles or nuclear technology will be heavily punished with sanctions and other tools. This messaging should, among other things, make clear that states purchasing North Korean technology will be cut off from Western technology across the board, and that they will be made subject to unilateral sanctions and other measures. Messaging should also continue to include the broader implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea. A tailored approach should acknowledge that some states may not perceive engagement with North Korea as problematic – despite international prohibitions to this end – and may actually be sympathetic to supporting the growing camp of anti-Western countries, or may be ambivalent about condemning or countering the behaviour of these anti-Western countries. As such, providing incentives to these countries to comply with their international obligations – whether through appealing to their standing as responsible members of the international community or by offering economic or other support – may be necessary. A combined “carrot and stick” approach is likely to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7: Consider offering alternatives to North Korean missile technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Following Recommendation 6, the US and its partners should consider offering alternative technologies or other incentives to potential customers when possible. Some states that seek to source missile capabilities from North Korea might do so because they lack – or cannot afford – alternative technologies or suppliers. As part of a targeted approach, the US and its allies should consider whether helping such states find alternative missile technology suppliers may be possible, without compounding the global proliferation problem or exacerbating situations of insecurity. Offering alternative sources of nuclear technology is, of course, a lot more problematic. In these instances, interested governments may be able to engage with countries on other strategic issues to identify drivers for the desire to acquire nuclear technology and identify possible solutions to addressing these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8: Target demand-side countermeasures to specific customers and prioritise engagement with those that are most likely to be receptive.&lt;/strong&gt; At the same time, the US and its partners should prioritise engagement with countries that are likely to be most receptive to being dissuaded from engaging in trade with Pyongyang, and tailor approaches to individual potential customers. Trying to prevent missile transfers between North Korea and states that have had long-term missile cooperation partnerships with Pyongyang or which are themselves already subject to sanctions – the likes of Iran and Syria – through diplomatic engagement or threats is unlikely to bear fruit. Offering alternative suppliers in these instances is also not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9: Make North Korea an unreliable supplier and technical partner.&lt;/strong&gt; Countries interested in preventing North Korea’s onward proliferation should commit to efforts to making Pyongyang an untrustworthy supplier and partner for technical collaboration. As mentioned earlier in relation to Iranian reservations about the dependability of North Korean missile systems, sowing such mistrust can help discourage future purchases from – or collaboration with – Pyongyang. This should include increasing efforts to interdict shipments of weapons and materials, and could also include attempts to target North Korea’s procurement networks operating overseas, using some of the established extraterritorial tools targeted at customers’ programmes. Efforts could also be made to try to insert compromised technology into North Korea’s procure-to-supply networks, thus further undermining the credibility and reliability of North Korea as a supplier. Countries that are important suppliers of key technologies that North Korea may need for its missile and nuclear wares – namely, countries in North America, Europe and Asia – can play an important role in efforts to prevent North Korean procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 10: Carefully utilise unilateral counter-proliferation tools.&lt;/strong&gt; While the current political dynamics on the UNSC will likely preclude any further UNSC sanctions against North Korea (or its facilitators or customers) in the foreseeable future, individual governments should continue to sanction North Korean and related entities that facilitate North Korean proliferation, or target them with other unilateral tools. While unilateral sanctions technically create no obligations for compliance by entities outside the relevant country’s jurisdiction, their appearance on sanctions lists will – or at least should – trigger adverse media and other compliance-screening measures at financial institutions or companies proactively seeking to comply with export controls. In the case of the US in particular, the importance of its financial sector and the US dollar to global markets means that many financial institutions around the world screen against US sanctions lists even if they are under no domestic obligation to comply with them. Such designations can also help facilitate open source investigations or the sanctioning of these entities in other jurisdictions. Use of other elements of the unilateral toolset developed and deployed by the US in recent years – which includes civil asset forfeiture as well as other targeted efforts against specific entities overseas – may also be appropriate in certain cases. However, application of these powerful tools should be considered on a case-by-case basis due to the risks of political blowback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western governments enacted a sweeping array of sanctions, stringent export controls and other policy actions designed to stem the flow of critical technology – including drones, thermal cameras, industrial machinery, semiconductors and microelectronics – to the country’s armed forces and intelligence agencies. Faced with losing access to these essential supply lines, Russia adapted, rerouting trade flows through friendly jurisdictions and bordering countries, often using complex front-company networks to evade scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost overnight, countries with little history of microelectronics trade became hubs for Russia’s technology flows. For example, in 2022, Armenia’s microelectronics imports from the US and EU increased by over 500% and 200%, respectively, with most of these later re-exported to Russia. Similarly, Kazakhstan’s microelectronics exports to Russia increased from around $250,000 in 2021 to over $18 million in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, Russia’s importers have appeared to hide in plain sight. Since the 2022 invasion, one of Russia’s largest microelectronics distributors – Compel JSC – seems to have continued moving tens of millions of dollars in critical components through the heart of Europe and Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data seen by RUSI, Nieuwsuur and ARD MONITOR confirms that Compel appears to have dozens of customers that are subject to sanctions for connections to Russia’s military-industrial complex. To date, however, Compel has only been sanctioned by the US and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TFCcXyv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ COMPEL JSC, Moscow, Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Compel JSC is one of Russia’s largest distributors of microelectronics, founded by Boris Rudyak in 1993. In July 2023, the US Treasury designated Compel for allegedly importing dual-use technology into Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Compel appears to operate procurement networks abroad that are seemingly run by Russian nationals in Europe and East Asia who are intimately linked to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-electronics-powerhouse&quot;&gt;An Electronics Powerhouse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time over the Kremlin on 25 December 1991, Boris Rudyak seems to have already had a long and storied career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting his professional journey as an apprentice at a vocational school in the Soviet Union’s first motor vehicle plant, Rudyak later found himself tending patients in a psychiatric hospital. As a resourceful man with many talents, he would later work for the fire brigade, as a watchman, as a cameraman, and even collecting nuts in a forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other Russians whose lives had been broadly defined by the stultifying Soviet system, Rudyak’s big break was to come shortly after its dissolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the Western-technology transfer control regime known as COCOM officially ended in 1994, Rudyak claims he was travelling to Singapore and stuffing suitcases with microelectronics for sale back home. In 1993, Rudyak officially registered Compel JSC, legitimately importing the sophisticated microelectronics that the Soviet Union was once forced to smuggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Vladimir Putin’s reign, Russia’s GDP rose rapidly, buoyed by surging oil exports and the dizzying rise in global oil prices. The 2008 recession and corresponding collapse in prices, however, sent the Russian economy into a tailspin. In October 2009, Rudyak delivered a presentation explaining how the Russian electronics industry waxed and waned with the fluctuations of the global oil market. Following the precipitous oil price collapse, Rudyak claimed that Russia’s microelectronics market contracted by 40%, leaving over a third of the market dominated by military and security customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this market volatility, Compel’s Russian business seems to have thrived. From 2019 to 2021, the company imported a mean annual average of $32.2 million in microelectronics and related items. In the first seven months of 2023 alone, Compel imported approximately $29 million dollars’ worth of components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia’s microelectronics imports entered the crosshairs of regulators after thousands of Western-designed and manufactured components were found inside the country’s weapons platforms. As a result, many of the world’s largest microelectronic component manufacturers – including Analog Devices, Microchip Technology, Murata Manufacturing, Nexperia, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments – terminated sales into Russia, and many also prohibited their distributors from selling into the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemingly undeterred, Compel continued importing thousands of shipments of components manufactured by Analog Devices, Microchip Technology, Murata Manufacturing, Nexperia, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments. Compel’s product catalogues seem to have removed a couple of these suppliers, including Texas Instruments, Analog Devices and STMicroelectronics, since the US sanctioned the Russian company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-they-come-from&quot;&gt;Where Do They Come From?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of suppliers to Compel has dwindled since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Germany-based WWSemicon GmbH and Hong Kong-based Finder Technology continued shipping to Compel in 2023 and appear to have become the company’s largest suppliers, accounting for at least 65% of Compel’s imports since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian trade data indicates that before February 2022, Compel’s largest suppliers were WWSemicon GmbH, Finder Technology Ltd and the now-dissolved Compel International Oy, a possible affiliate company of Compel based in Finland. From January 2019 to February 2022, 98% of Compel International Oy and WWSemicon’s exports and 83% of Finder Technology’s exports were destined for Compel and Beliv LLC, another Rudyak company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ydijPBF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Compel’s annual imports and suppliers from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data seen by RUSI, Nieuwsuur and ARD MONITOR.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compel’s suppliers diversified in the lead-up to the invasion, seeming to peak at 40 companies in 2021. However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the roster of suppliers shrunk drastically, with nearly all imports coming from only six companies. WWSemicon and Finder Technology were by far the largest, accounting for over 98% of imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite trade records showing that WWSemicon continued exporting millions of dollars’ worth of components to Compel as recently as July 2023, representatives for WWSemicon told Nieuwsuur they had stopped shipments to the company “long ago”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions and export controls have complicated Russian procurement efforts, microelectronics have increasingly been routed through hubs such as Hong Kong. To restrict Russia’s access to critical technologies, the US and UK have sanctioned several Hong Kong companies for supplying Russia’s defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, in June and July 2023, Finder Technology shipped over $1.1 million in microelectronics to Compel under nine HS codes identified in May by the US as “high priority items” for Russian weapons systems. These HS codes cover several categories of critical microelectronics, including processors, field-programmable gate arrays, tantalum capacitors, ceramic capacitors, amplifiers and memory modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finder Technology did not respond when contacted by Nieuwsuur and ARD MONITOR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From the outskirts of a residential neighbourhood in Munich, WWSemicon appears to have maintained exceptionally close ties with Compel for nearly 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wwsemicon-gmbh&quot;&gt;WWSemicon GmbH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Boris Rudyak told Nieuwsuur that WWSemicon was “not part of the Compel network”, he claimed the companies engaged in “good business before the war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an analysis of trade data, corporate documents, social media and other records indicates that Compel and WWSemicon have maintained exceptionally close ties for nearly 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, WWSemicon was registered in 2005 by Russian nationals Oleg Shtots (AKA Alex Stotz) and Vladimir Avetisyan. Notably, Avetisyan is also the sole shareholder and general director of RBA-Management LLC in Russia, one of Compel’s founding shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost two decades after WWSemicon was founded, the company is now owned by several former Compel employees, including Boris Rudyak’s daughter, who worked for Compel from 2007 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another shareholder of the company listed their LinkedIn title as “lead developer” at Compel-SPB LLC – a company owned by Rudyak’s RBA-Group. Meanwhile, a third shareholder, who also manages the Slovakia-based WWSemicon branch, was referred to as Compel’s general director in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finder Technology was co-founded in April 2005 by the same person that founded WWSemicon in Germany, Oleg Shtots. Hong Kong registry documents from 2019 reveal that Shtots used both Russian and German passports, and that same year, he began using the name “Alex Stotz” on Finder Technology’s corporate documents. Corporate documents from 2023 for Finder Technology still list Shtots as the sole shareholder of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An email for Oleg Shtots listed on a Russian-language German employment forum appears in the URL of a public Google Calendar for an “Alex Stotz”. The calendar blocks off “Electronica”, a trade event in Munich, and contains departure dates of Compel from the event. It also includes meetings labelled “Boris” during one of several apparent trips to Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with WWSemicon, Finder Technology’s employee base seems to include individuals affiliated with Compel. Russian court records reveal that, in 2017, Avetisyan – WWSemicon’s co-founder – led Finder Technology’s legal representative’s office in Russia, and another employee’s LinkedIn account states that until March 2022, they were also a purchasing manager for Compel and two US-based companies, Rapid GCS Inc and Real Time Components (RTC) Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While neither Rapid GCS nor RTC appears to have shipped to Russia since the 2022 invasion, both historically shipped millions of dollars in microelectronics and related components from Analog Devices, NXP Semiconductors, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments to Compel, Beliv and Dadjet LLC, the latter of which is also owned by Boris Rudyak. RTC’s shipments into Russia appear to have ceased in July 2020, but Rapid GCS continued its exports until February 2022 – the month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both companies share a phone number and a New Jersey address, and Rapid GCS’s registered agent appears to operate an X account with the biography “Regional Purchasing Manager at Real Time Components (RTC/Compel)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-do-they-go&quot;&gt;Where Do They Go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many of Compel’s customers include commercial enterprises, data seen by RUSI, Nieuswsuur and ARD MONITOR reveals that the company has received thousands of payments from dozens of Russian companies sanctioned after the invasion began. Many of these companies have extensive links to the country’s defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several companies that were later sanctioned for being part of Russia’s defence industrial base made thousands of payments to Compel from January 2022 to January 2023, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Testkomplekt LLC, which is sanctioned by the US, the UK, Switzerland and Ukraine. Testkomplekt is also a key microelectronics supplier for Radiopriborsnab LLC, which is ultimately owned by subsidiaries of Rostec, the Russian state-owned defence industrial conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Staut LLC, which is sanctioned by the US and UK for supplying export-controlled technology to the Russian defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EuroMicroTech LLC (EMT), which is sanctioned by the US. EMT’s website features letters of gratitude for the “timely provision of items” from a Rostec subsidiary and a military facility founded in 2009 by the Russian Ministry of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NIIIT LLC (AKA RIIT Ltd), which is sanctioned by the US. One of NIIIT’s founders was Ostec Enterprises Ltd, a semiconductor supplier for several Russian defence entities, including an alleged manufacturer of Kinzhal hypersonic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Specialized Devices and Systems CJSC (SPS), which is sanctioned by Ukraine, Switzerland and, most recently, the EU for facilitating a Netherlands-based sanctions evasion operation. Nieuwsuur confirms that SPS lists several EU-sanctioned Rostec subsidiaries as customers, and other reports claim that SPS is licensed by Russia’s Federal Security Bureau to supply Rostec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;EKB Neva LLC, which is sanctioned by the US and Ukraine and certified by the Russian government to supply Russian military end-users. In 2020, EKB’s director was arrested for allegedly forging certificates of Western microelectronics imported for military use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hiding-in-plain-sight&quot;&gt;Hiding in Plain Sight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of the companies that have continued to import microelectronics, components and technology into Russia following the 2022 invasion, Compel appears to have been forced to reroute trade flows through jurisdictions like Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the movement of millions of dollars’ worth of components through Europe, even after the invasion, unfortunately highlights the ease with which some Russian companies have continued to procure technologies that could be used by the country’s military–industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia faces the prospect of a protracted conflict in Ukraine, the Kremlin is increasingly gearing up its economy for war. The Russian finance minister left little room for interpretation about Moscow’s priorities when he said in October 2023 that “the main emphasis is on ensuring [Russia’s] victory – the army, defence capability, armed forces, fighters – everything needed for the front, everything needed for victory is in the budget”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, with Russia diverting all possible financial and technical resources to support its war of aggression, Ukraine’s partners should ensure that Western technology and microelectronics are not in Russia’s arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the design of the sanctions packages imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the initial focus was on throwing the net as wide as possible. The aim was to impose restrictive measures on a broad range of financial and trade activities. However, following the early flurry of activity, attention has now shifted towards ensuring effective implementation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over nearly two years, the RUSI-led European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet) has highlighted the main structural challenges faced by EU member state national authorities, and businesses with sanctions responsibilities. It has also identified that all stakeholders – whether private sector actors seeking to improve their implementation or governments monitoring for circumvention and evasion – need better data. This would allow sanctions to be more effectively implemented, and circumvention and evasion more effectively tackled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain insights on this issue, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS) at RUSI hosted a roundtable discussion in Barcelona in November 2023, with the support of Dow Jones Risk &amp;amp; Compliance. The event gathered sanctions experts from the public and private sectors across different European jurisdictions to explore, under the Chatham House rule, the role of data in strengthening the implementation and enforcement of sanctions. This engagement was part of SIFMANet’s activities supported by the National Endowment for Democracy, and along with a video filmed on the day, this report presents the main findings from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-data-to-support-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;The Need for Data to Support Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions used to be an isolated task within the compliance departments of financial institutions, whose primary responsibility consisted of screening sanctions lists to check for individual and entity name matches with their client base and transaction activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the workshop, private sector representatives noted that this modus operandi started to change following the introduction in 2014 of sanctions against Russia, in response to the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. This programme introduced sector-specific sanctions, which for the first time required financial institutions – and others from the private sector such as oil services companies – to have a deeper understanding of their clients and, critically, their activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task demanded increased resources from these elements of the private sector, as well as their clients, to obtain and process data that was far more complex than merely checking for sanctions-list name matches. Fast forward to February 2022 and the sanctions that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion dramatically increased this burden and introduced complex sanctions compliance to a large number of economic operators that had never been exposed in this way before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, businesses place significant demands on national competent authorities to assist with identifying where they require licences to continue their operations, but also information regarding possible entities engaged in sanctioned activities, something that is not yet widely available from the typical vendors of sanctions screening services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from both governments and the private sector clearly articulated in the workshop that if sanctions are to be implemented effectively by the private sector, placed on the frontline by their governments, then a significant improvement in data is required. There was also strong agreement that banks should not be left to carry this burden on their own. Governments must clearly make those businesses engaging in trade exposed to sanctions aware of their responsibilities and must either have proper internal sanctions-monitoring controls or access to third-party tools that can provide them with the necessary compliance capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the purpose of the workshop was to focus specifically on data, the next section addresses specific tactical data that the private sector could leverage to improve its sanctions compliance, and how governments can use data to facilitate better private sector implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-data-is-helpful-for-implementing-sanctions&quot;&gt;What Data is Helpful for Implementing Sanctions?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of data for improved sanctions effectiveness falls into two parts: data used to support implementation by EU member states’ banks and businesses; and data (mainly related to trade) used to identify sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improved-implementation&quot;&gt;Improved Implementation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For banks and businesses operating in the EU, data plays two roles: first, it facilitates better identification of sanctioned individuals and their assets; and second, it clarifies where clients might be involved in restricted sectors or activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beneficial Ownership Registries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beneficial ownership registries are useful sources of data on companies and their ownership structure and related natural persons involved in them. However, both public and private sector participants noted that registers, if accessible, often do not hold the same type of information in each country, they do not always hold reliable and updated information, and they are at times only accessible in certain languages. In addition, some jurisdictions have business registries that require subscriptions and have limited financial intelligence on, for example, companies’ financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants defined public access to beneficial ownership registers as a crucial element for sanctions implementation and they regarded the ruling from the November 2022 European Court of Justice as a new and troubling challenge. A representative from the Spanish Treasury explained that one of the goals of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU is to harmonise information across EU registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Client Documentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the lack of publicly available and machine-readable data, trying to map client activities involving Russia’s neighbouring countries and trading partners demands that the private sector devote substantial amounts of manual labour to check information submitted by clients on their transactions. Businesses hold the deepest knowledge of the sector in which they operate and of their own activities. So, the data they provide is essential. However, representatives from financial institutions noted that it is increasingly difficult to rely on information submitted by clients given that, as elaborated below, it may be subject to a lack of knowledge on the part of their clients or to obfuscation tactics used by those seeking to evade sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses are not only trading in goods subject to sanctions, but also technical services, and many do not know the extent of their sanctions obligations. An example shared by a participant described that providing crew members for a vessel carrying Russian oil could fall under EU prohibitions, but many businesses do not know this, and rely on financial institutions to inform them that such activity is prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, participants noted that they are increasingly holding conversations with clients regarding suspicions of document forgery. Financial institutions explained that the supporting information provided to justify the submitted documentation is often useful to confirm or reject their suspicions. But again, this work creates a significant extra burden on the financial institutions’ sanctions compliance community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively manage their monitoring burden, many financial institutions are thus following a risk-based approach. If a financial institution sees a client trading with a third country with which it has maintained trade relations in the past, then it can lower manual effort. On the contrary, if the business relationship was recently established or has now shifted to include controlled goods, the financial institution will increase the manual work required to check the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While financial institutions monitor clients across all sectors, key corporates may serve as the most useful and expert sources of data. These include shipping companies, logistics firms and airlines. These businesses hold the raw data required to check goods that banks do not have access to, such as the bill of lading, the itinerary of vessels or identity location spoofing. The top companies in these sectors are screening these elements, but with a lower level of scrutiny than banks would like them to for sanctions-compliance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, better data is required if the private sector is to be fully empowered to play its role on the frontline of sanctions implementation. As the complexity of sanctions has grown, the provision of and access to data has lagged. New tools need to be developed by those companies with expertise in providing data services; and governments need to provide access to additional sources of data that can enhance the effectiveness of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;identifying-circumvention&quot;&gt;Identifying Circumvention&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as facilitating improved implementation, data – particularly trade data – can be used by governments to identify changes in trade flows that may be indicative of emerging sanctions circumvention routes used by Russia to procure the key goods it requires for its military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trade Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public and private sector representatives acknowledged their initial positive assessment of the reported declines in their jurisdictions’ direct trade with Russia. This assessment changed once they identified the increasing exports – including of controlled and banned goods – to third countries regarded as high-risk for circumvention. This indicated that their trade with Russia continued, albeit indirectly. To properly observe and understand the specific transactions and flows, and the extent to which they represent sanctions circumvention, authorities and the private sector point to various data points to strengthen their sanctions compliance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted the difficulty of proving that goods exported from a specific jurisdiction to a third country are then re-exported to Russia through generic import/export trade data. Sources such as UN COMTRADE – described as not particularly user-friendly – or national customs data can serve as a good guide to identify suspicious trade flows, but do not provide sufficiently deep insights. A participant provided a visual example in which a member state exported apples to a third country, and the third country exported apples to Russia. The flow of apples can be identified in the member state’s national customs data but unless the items are specifically identified, it is hard to prove that it is the self- same apples that enter Russia. Participants added that the customs data from Russia and certain third countries may be a useful starting point but cannot be trusted and often entail language translation complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for this lack of clarity, tools such as Import/Export Genius provide transaction-level tracking data, identify where a product was produced, and to where it was shipped. Authorities and financial institutions can use this data to then query companies involved on whether sanctions are being breached. A key piece of information employed in trade is Harmonised System (HS) codes. These describe the nature of a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HS codes differ across jurisdictions, as countries incorporate additional digits to the six-digit HS codes for further classification. For example, in the EU they are known as TARIC codes and in the US they are HTS codes. This creates divergences among HS codes, which authorities and businesses must understand. HS codes are particularly useful to screen for dual-use goods. However, participants highlighted that not all dual-use goods have HS codes. This a critical challenge as the technical descriptions of HS codes in regulations often create confusion, which increases cost of compliance for businesses that must manually check them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, authorities and financial institutions have detected that some businesses will alter the HS codes of goods to pass them off as products not subject to prohibitions. This is related to the document forgery issue that is increasingly spotted by financial institutions in the information provided by clients. Participants explained that when a bank is financing trade through letters of credit, they will have more information on the operation than if the trade is conducted via “open account” through which their access to data is limited to just seeing the financial transaction. This makes it harder to spot irregularities. As one participant noted, “the task now consists of screening against information that is not there”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection of trade data is essential for the private sector to effectively implement sanctions and detect circumvention. However, trade data also plays a key role in the diplomatic efforts of authorities. The EU both requests trade data from third countries and also asks them to validate its own perspective on the third country’s trading activity, to assess their involvement in circumvention. Suspicious trade flows and confirmed circumvention activities identified through the aforementioned analysis of trade data by EU operators can be leveraged by authorities from sanctions-imposing countries to deter third countries from facilitating circumvention through their jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the roundtable, participants also pointed to other data sources that would be useful for authorities and businesses to exploit and process to enhance their investigations and compliance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, for individual financial transactions, Business Identifier Codes (BIC) are well-known sources of data used for addressing SWIFT messages, routing business transactions and identifying business parties, but the screening of less common items can also provide valuable information. One such example is screening IP addresses that may help identify businesses operating in high-risk jurisdictions. IP addresses can be disguised through VPNs, but their usage can be detected and as a result trigger a red flag to demand enhanced due diligence. As private sector participants noted, screening IP addresses is an increasingly common practice by larger financial institutions and e-commerce firms to block transactions from sanctioned jurisdictions and/or flag transactions for further scrutiny. They noted that national competent authorities could enhance the effectiveness of private sector sanctions implementation by providing this information in sanctions designations as and when available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to leverage such additional data points to support sanctions implementation highlights the added complexity of the post-2022 regimes. Using these data sources to triangulate and identify evasion activity demands a considerable degree of manual work to check the entities involved and their activities. Yet, despite the resources required, going beyond basic due diligence and conducting open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis must now be a critical component of sanctions implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regards to maritime transport, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) required by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)to locate vessels was also noted by both public and private sector participants as providing valuable data. Even though the AIS can be turned off, this should trigger a red flag in due diligence systems. AIS will also indicate changes in the draft of the vessel, which might reveal that transhipments took place due to a change in the vessel’s cargo. This can be complemented with the use of satellite imagery. Similarly, IMO identification numbers of designated vessels are key pieces of data that institutions should have at their disposal to monitor their activity such as reflagging or change of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector actors, particularly financial institutions that can afford to make such investments, are increasingly developing OSINT capabilities as they can provide invaluable data on clients, their partners and their activities. The information can be openly shared with authorities and other private institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;persisting-challenges&quot;&gt;Persisting Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While available circumvention routes are increasingly limited, participants noted that supply chains are getting more layered with complex multi-jurisdiction corporate structures and operators increasingly struggling to control what is happening along a particular route. The manual work required to effectively obtain and screen the necessary data is a cumbersome burden for the private sector and the task of identifying companies owned or controlled by sanctioned individuals in the supply chain is challenging. Ownership data is relatively straightforward when it is publicly available – which, as indicated above, is not always the case – but determining “control” is a more difficult task, given that the necessary information might not be public and the concept of “control” can be judgemental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain areas, participants explained that they face the challenge of combining contradictory datasets. For instance, when monitoring to confirm that a transaction was done below the oil price cap, both authorities and businesses must check data from shipping companies and customs pricing data, which do not always match. This intense screening is conducted for each individual transaction but if the goal is to disrupt the trade of oil or battlefield items before it happens, operators would need to develop foresight by identifying patterns and incorporate these mapping activities into their compliance procedures to anticipate potential evasion transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further complication to these mapping efforts and the blocking of suspicious transactions is the decoupled nature of payment flows from their related trade flows. While payments are flowing between two jurisdictions, goods may be produced and transported from factories in third countries. For example, a Swedish entity can have a Dutch bank account, receive the payment from a shell company in Turkey, and ship controlled goods from Malaysia via a third country to Russia. Financial institutions emphasised that it is very challenging to block such transactions as they are often unaware of the trade flow connected with the payment, a trade flow involving countries outside the Western sanctions regime and thus not subject to local control. Furthermore, even if (in this case) the Turkish shell company is identified as facilitating sanctioned trade, a new shell company can easily be established in its place elsewhere with no transaction history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible way of addressing this challenge, raised by finance experts at the roundtable, is to identify pinch points in the payment flows, for example by making more use of SWIFT messaging data by mandating greater use of currently discretionary fields, to help illuminate payments related to circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing burden placed on the private sector led participants to express their concern over the lack of clarity regarding the extent of their compliance obligations to confirm there is no risk of sanctions violation or circumvention. They have significantly increased their sanctions-dedicated resources and tools but at some point they have to make a judgement as to how far their due diligence obligations extend. Participants explained that investigations had traditionally been limited to checking two levels of ownership, but recent investigations have gone down many more levels of ownership to identify the real individual controlling an entity. Private sector representatives added that this may clash with the expectations of regulators, which will also differ across the jurisdictions they operate in. Even minute differences will be immense for internationally operating institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear message from participants was that many businesses lack experience regarding the availability and use of the data sources discussed at the workshop. This often means they resort to third-party data providers and vendors. These services ease the burden on businesses, but authorities have raised concerns of an over-reliance on these services without understanding how the tools they provide work. Participating authorities explained that their inspections showed that many businesses do not properly detect the right matches after inputting the data provided into their systems, and some screening systems struggle with fuzzy searches with multiple options per identifier. These fuzzy searches are themselves the outcome of vast discrepancies across sanctions lists, further complicating compliance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the heavy burden imposed on the private sector is met with a lack of incentives to actually comply with sanctions obligations. First, participants noted that HS codes are used for tax purposes, so businesses are not always interested in reporting them accurately. Furthermore, for intentional circumvention schemes, public and private sector representatives agreed that the consequences of breaching sanctions at the moment are not enough to deter violations, both in terms of low financial penalties but also low chances of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is partly related to the insufficient level of information exchanged within the EU, a major impediment to sanctions investigations and enforcement. Currently, many investigations are crippled when a national competent authority requests information from a member state where sanctions violations are not yet criminalised. A participant suggested that to improve the sharing of data and avoid duplication, the EU needs a sanctions-related institution such as OLAF, which is currently the only agency that coordinates member states regarding imports and exports. Regional initiatives for enhanced information-sharing within the EU are happening in areas such as the Baltic states, but this should be happening across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one workshop participant noted, a key feature of the current sanctions regimes against Russia is that policymakers are expecting sanctions to achieve far more today than has been expected of sanctions regimes in the past, and governments’ messaging often seems to expect companies to screen transactions against non-existing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core pillar of the effectiveness of the current sanctions implementation and enforcement landscape is the availability, accessibility and quality of data. During the workshop, participants proposed a series of valuable sources of data for authorities and businesses to strengthen their investigations and compliance mechanisms. However, these data sources pose a series of challenges in themselves, which the EU must take measures to mitigate in order to improve the sanctions efforts across the public and private sectors. The importance of this is clear. Data can not only support better implementation of sanctions by EU member states and their financial institutions and businesses, it can also provide a strong basis from which to engage in dialogue with third countries that are vulnerable to – or indeed are already facilitating – sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a focus on how governments can support the private sector in achieving their goals, some specific recommendations emerged from the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity of obligations.&lt;/strong&gt; Supervisors need to clarify what is required of the private sector. Too often requirements and expectations are ambiguous and lack specificity. Although ambiguity may be a means by which governments can ensure businesses do not merely restrict their compliance obligations to the bare minimum, the uncertainty faced in the private sector on whether they have done enough for a single transaction leads to inefficient responses, the investment of extensive (potentially unnecessary) resources and manual work, and economic costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced awareness in the private sector.&lt;/strong&gt; Businesses must expand their understanding of the steps needed to conduct sanctions due diligence on clients, their trade partners, controlled products and sectoral risks. Governments must support this education process by providing briefings and access to new data sources that can facilitate sanctions implementation. As one participant noted, screening for “persons connected with Russia” is just not possible – or desirable; and placing the burden of policing businesses entirely on the banking sector is not efficient. Key industry sectors such as shipping and logistics must be made to feel equally responsible and empowered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmonisation and consistency are key.&lt;/strong&gt; Small inconsistencies in sanctions interpretations by authorities can have a significant impact on the private sector. For example, within the EU, the understanding of ownership and control differs across member states and, in consequence, guidance for businesses operating in several jurisdictions varies. Likewise, the quality and nature of information found in national beneficial ownership registers varies, is often not updated, is in different languages, and is not publicly available. Among the sanctions coalition, key identifiers such as HS codes also differ and alignment in this regard would facilitate the tasks of both authorities and the private sector. More broadly, the quality of trade data is lacking and should likewise be presented in a harmonised manner as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimising use of trade data.&lt;/strong&gt; First, trade data from EU member states can be trusted and should be the foundation of trade-related sanctions implementation. EU member state capacity in this field varies – development of an EU member state sanctions trade data expert working group could enhance the use of this data to identify EU-based weaknesses. Second, trade data should continue to be used to engage with third countries to ensure common understanding of the key items that are subject to restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve EU-wide trade data sharing.&lt;/strong&gt; The EU should create an EU sanctions-related information-sharing mechanism similar to OLAF to ensure consistent interpretation of sanctions (particularly related to trade).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidation must continue.&lt;/strong&gt; The consolidation of regulations is essential for businesses with insufficient experience to navigate complex EU legislation. Furthermore, a consolidated – and more closely aligned – list of sanctioned individuals and entities from the international sanctions coalition would facilitate the task of businesses that aim to be compliant across all regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make greater use of SWIFT data.&lt;/strong&gt; Tackling circumvention trade flows would benefit from identifying pinch points in the flow of payments, for example by making more use of SWIFT messaging data by mandating greater use of currently discretionary fields, to help illuminate payments related to circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological advancements.&lt;/strong&gt; The current level of manual work required to fulfil sanctions compliance obligations is an unsustainable burden on the private sector. Greater attention should be placed on developing tools that will facilitate the effective compliance of businesses. For example, a participant noted Singapore’s introduction of blockchain to track payments and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, data – in all its forms – is emerging as a key tool in enhancing the effectiveness of sanctions implementation against Russia. Yet, the provision and availability of data by governments to the private sector has lagged the growth in complexity of sanctions. Accessible data has the potential to enhance the ability of financial institutions and businesses across the EU to be fully empowered to correctly identify entities, industry sectors, activities and specific goods that should be blocked. It can further assist with the identification of circumvention activity and underpin diplomatic engagement with third countries. The challenge ahead is to enhance the quality and accessibility of these data sources to ensure the impact needed to further restrict the funding and resourcing of the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, cybercrime has entered the realm of national security. This shift has been driven by one type of cybercrime in particular – ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging from the Russian cyber-criminal ecosystem in the early 2010s, ransomware today is a highly disruptive form of cybercrime that encompasses a range of tactics and techniques designed to extort ransoms from individuals, businesses and even governments. Although cyber fraud likely affects more individual UK citizens on a personal level and generates greater economic losses, ransomware is a particularly acute threat to the UK because of its ability to cause harm to nationally important services – ranging from the ability of local councils to provide social care or ensure your bins are collected to the provision of essential healthcare services. Put simply, ransomware can (and does) ruin people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware has proven to be highly lucrative for many of the criminals that participate, with UK victims paying an average ransom payment of £1.6 million in 2023 according to one survey. Large profit margins have enabled ransomware operators to reinvest revenues, expand their capabilities, and largely stay ahead of cyber defenders and law enforcement. Although the National Crime Agency (NCA) and its international counterparts have had some tactical successes against the ransomware ecosystem, absent a major shift in the cost–benefit calculus of ransomware operators, the next 10 years of cybercrime will likely continue to be dominated by this pernicious form of offending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-ransomware-from-spray-and-pray-to-organised-cybercrime&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Ransomware: From “Spray and Pray” to Organised Cybercrime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although ransomware has existed in some form since the 1990s, it was largely non-viable as a profitable cybercrime until the emergence of cryptocurrency in the late 2010s, which enabled cybercriminals to monetise ransomware while maintaining a degree of anonymity. In 2013, ransomware was characterised by the so-called “spray and pray” model, which targeted a large number of individual users. These operations had low yields with uniformly priced ransoms for all victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, from 2016 onwards, ransomware began to evolve into the form that is dominant today. Ransomware operators moved away from the “spray and pray” model and started to focus on organisations rather than individuals, using tactics to deploy ransomware to thousands of computers within a single organisation to increase their leverage and therefore demand higher ransoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, two important tactical modifications emerged that helped ransomware operators extort higher payments at greater scale. First, they became more purposeful in their victim selection. Some developed so-called “big game hunting” ransomware operations, which involves prioritising larger and therefore more lucrative victims; others focused on targeting critical services and organisations that rely on constant delivery of operations, such as healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the criminals behind the Maze ransomware operation started to steal as well as encrypt victims’ data. Other ransomware threat actors swiftly followed suit and over the last few years coercion tactics have continued to evolve, with dedicated data leak sites, leaks to journalists and harassment of employees and clients all employed as parts of efforts to make victims pay. A new cyber extortion collective made up mostly of English-speaking young men has even threatened physical violence against its victims. Our own research on ransomware harms, which is based on interviews with UK victims of ransomware, found examples of harassment of school children, healthcare patients and other vulnerable groups following ransomware incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the ransomware ecosystem resembles something more like a professionalised industry than a ragtag network mostly active on dark web forums and marketplaces. This is not just because of the revenues generated by ransomware (which are believed to run into hundreds of millions of dollars for the most successful gangs), but also because of the growing levels of professionalisation that have developed within the ecosystem. The ransomware-as-a-service business model has enabled the specialisation of roles within ransomware operations, allowing ransomware developers to recruit affiliates who conduct operations for a cut of the profits. Ransomware is also supported by the broader cybercrime-as-a-service ecosystem, particularly services and marketplaces that specialise in obtaining and selling access to victim networks (known as initial access brokers) or monetising and laundering the proceeds of ransomware. The service-driven cyber-criminal economy enables ransomware threat actors to streamline their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The reality for many ransomware victims is that government support is likely to be very limited, with the accessible response ecosystem largely privatised&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, ransomware threat actors have developed structures more like legitimate businesses than traditional organised crime groups. The group behind the now defunct Conti ransomware operation, for instance, at one point employed between 65 and 100 salaried staff, with defined roles, HR staff and employment policies. The profitability of ransomware can make this extremely attractive, pulling more would-be cyber-criminals into the ecosystem. Ransomware therefore represents a form of organised crime that is in keeping with modern digital economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the impact of ransomware on the UK specifically is challenging. Since 2019, 2,607 ransomware incidents have been reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). However, the ICO does not collect data or produce intelligence on the threat or financial impact of ransomware. Reporting to Action Fraud is believed to be considerably lower – the NCA assesses that less than 10% of ransomware incidents are reported to law enforcement. However, prominent attacks against UK businesses and critical national infrastructure providers emphasise the threat of ransomware to UK’s economy, national security and society. In 2023 alone, ransomware has disrupted the Royal Mail, one of the largest providers of outsourced services for the UK government, schools and an NHS Trust. A ransomware attack was also blamed for the permanent closure of one of the UK’s largest privately-owned logistics providers, KNP Logistics Groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-daunting-21st-century-challenge&quot;&gt;A Daunting 21st-Century Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of contemporary organised cybercrime as a national security dilemma presents a serious challenge for the UK’s law enforcement community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dilemma is exacerbated by a toxic combination of geopolitics and the double-edged sword presented by technological advancement. The concentration of ransomware operators in “permissive” jurisdictions with whom UK relations are relatively poor – most notably Russia – means that law enforcement’s capacity to arrest or interfere with many threat actors is limited. While a Russian cyber-criminal stated in an interview that their biggest concern was the prospect of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and Western law enforcement collaboration, this seems unlikely to materialise at the time of writing. As recently emphasised by NCA Director-General Graeme Biggar at RUSI, serious and organised crime has become more global and sophisticated, straddling the “real” and “virtual” worlds. Ransomware is – unfortunately – a perfect illustration of this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s approach to the ransomware dilemma can be described, in part, as characterised by pragmatism. This is not to be confused with defeatism. Where possible, the National Crime Agency has collaborated with international partners on arrests of ransomware operators and affiliates outside of Russia. The UK’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation has also recently joined forces with the US’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to sanction known ransomware operators, representing both a form of “naming and shaming” and an effort to limit specific cyber-criminals’ ability to monetise ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligning with a pragmatic approach to “resiliency” that underpins the National Cyber Security Strategy, the UK’s public sector cyber response ecosystem has increasingly focused on reducing the ransomware threat and supporting victims. This ecosystem includes the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the NCA, Regional Organised Crime Units and local police. Victim support is triaged through the Incident Response Framework, with technical incident support tightly rationed and restricted to organisations with the greatest national security and economic impact. A number of victims may receive support in the form of incident response coordination and advice from NCSC and/or NCA liaisons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the reality for many ransomware victims is that government support is likely to be very limited, with the accessible response ecosystem largely privatised. A ransomware victim organisation may, variously, draw upon the support of firms offering incident response, ransom negotiation, external counsel and public-relations management. Organisations either pay for these services themselves or draw on cyber insurance policies. However, the recent development that some sectors – including operators of critical national infrastructure – may be uninsurable by virtue of their sector should be cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given the absence of easy solutions, it is time to talk more actively about ransomware and organised cybercrime with the public at large&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of triaging and general reliance on private sector incident response services is a pragmatic approach amid current economic realities; it would be impossible for the current public-sector response ecosystem to scale sufficiently to serve as a “blue light” cyber response service. However, the quality of incident response matters. The NCSC’s assured cyber incident response schemes are a positive step toward promoting best practices to encourage optimum outcomes for victims of ransomware and other cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-should-we-do-next&quot;&gt;What Should We Do Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We write this with a degree of weariness. As active researchers in this space, we have talked, researched and written about ransomware for countless hours. Ransomware’s prominence as a cybercrime and national security threat means that this issue has consistently been at the forefront of our recent work. The UK government has also been actively talking about the issue, for instance, with the conducting of an internal “ransomware sprint”, the attendance of high-level meetings (and signing of agreements) with like-minded international partners, and the issuance of calls for evidence by Parliamentary Committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given the absence of easy solutions, it is time to talk more actively about ransomware and organised cybercrime with the public at large. In a liberal democratic society, a serious societal-level threat merits mature and considered conversations in a range of accessible forums. Ransomware arguably first emerged into the UK-wide conscience in 2017, with the WannaCry ransomware attack’s impact on some NHS Trusts serving as a pronounced indication of ransomware’s capacity to disrupt core societal services. After extolling that everyone had a responsibility for cyber security, Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May were given a reprieve with Marcus Hutchin’s kill-switch. But arguably the first significant opportunity for a proper and sustained national conversation was bypassed. Likewise, pronounced disruptions at local levels – for instance, Hackney, Redcar and Cleveland, and Gloucester City councils – have not ushered in focused conversations at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such conversations could include more candid detail about the government’s place and role in the fight against this threat, in both preventative and reactive terms. Given financial and resource constraints, it is unlikely that the UK will significantly expand its technical response support for victims. But this should be conveyed to the public clearly and candidly. Recent RUSI research has highlighted a disconcerting degree of ambiguity and confusion among the public and ransomware victims about the role of government and law enforcement in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the question of how the UK should employ offensive cyber capabilities against the ransomware ecosystem. At the launch of the UK National Cyber Force (NCF) in 2020, the UK government identified organised cyber-criminals as a potential target for offensive cyber operations. In 2022, then GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming suggested that the NCF was now actively targeting ransomware threat actors. Given that UK intelligences agencies have been able to disrupt the online activities of international terrorist organisations – and publicly disclose elements of this interference – there is a case for more public debate about the purpose and effectiveness of these operations. However, as the US experience with using offensive cyber operations against ransomware has highlighted, such operations may have a limited effect while the business model remains intact, and should be seen as complementary rather than a replacement for a strategy that focuses on fundamentally changing the cost-benefit calculus of the perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future trajectory of ransomware is not clear. Arguably, this form of organised cybercrime has not yet reached saturation point. While some ransomware operators have dispersed following law enforcement activity, others have emerged. Operators continue to diversify their strategies to put maximum pressure on victim organisations and adapt to improved cyber security practices among their targets (for instance, viable backups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, further growth and evolution of this threat should be anticipated. While it is not possible to speculate precisely on how ransomware will evolve, the UK and like-minded partners should anticipate turbulence, continue to raise their cyber resilience, and focus on ways to make life much more difficult for the criminals that perpetuate it.&lt;/p&gt;

This paper argues that the primary requirement is to implement a comparative shift away from protection and towards mobility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army is likely to be called on to engage in high-intensity warfighting at some stage in the future, and must be able to do so credibly in order to contribute to NATO’s deterrent posture. Heavy armoured forces and main battle tanks will remain an important element of warfighting, and will therefore continue to occupy an important position in the British Army’s Order of Battle. There have been concerns about the vulnerability and survivability of main battle tanks on the contemporary battlefield, as well as the ability of lighter forces backed up by ISTAR capabilities and indirect fires to create difficult operational problems for the enemy in high-intensity warfighting. However, heavy armoured forces – through their substantial combat power – ensure that a force can remain mobile while in direct contact with enemy forces, and as such heavy armour still has a valuable role to play on the battlefields of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, adaptations are necessary if heavy armoured forces are to remain relevant. This paper argues that the primary requirement is to implement a comparative shift away from protection and towards mobility. Secondary requirements are numerous, and include better use of deception and decoys to counter improved enemy ISTAR capabilities, and the potential integration of uncrewed ground vehicles to add situational awareness and defensive capabilities without increasing vehicles’ weights (already problematically high). The British Army’s heavy armoured forces will also need to relearn old lessons about logistics, sustainment, vehicle recovery and the reconstitution of armoured formations that have suffered a significant level of battlefield attrition. Finally, crew expertise matters, and will – as always – be essential for keeping vehicles in working order on operations and minimising the need for the concentration of vulnerable elements of the support apparatus such as forward repair facilities. Investment in the British Army’s people should therefore not be overlooked in the heavy armour context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War is the largest conventional land war in Europe since 1945. The conflict has registered high losses – many at the hands of new weapons – among the main battle tank (MBT) fleets of both sides, and in this context a longstanding debate has regained prominence: what future does the MBT have on the battlefield or in the force structures of modern militaries? The debate has been one of the more controversial and divisive ones over the future of warfighting. Although tanks were pivotal to 20th century warfare, their utility was often questioned – even during the Cold War – in a way that the utility of other revolutionary technologies such as aviation and radio communications was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tanks were introduced in the First World War to reduce casualties and break the deadlock imposed by trench warfare, notably in the Battle of Cambrai in 1917. After experimentation and increasing adoption during the interwar period, the Second World War saw tanks become established as a mainstay in the European and North African theatres of operations. However, since 1945, their utility has routinely been questioned and discussed. Most – but not all – of these discussions have concluded that MBTs still retain utility, but nevertheless concerns (particularly about whether the role of tanks can survive when faced with new threats) are periodically revived by instances of high losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This debate is hugely relevant to the UK defence establishment (and particularly the British Army) as it looks to overcome years of underinvestment in conventional capabilities. A major component of this paper, therefore, will be to identify the implications of the MBT’s changing role for the British Army’s force structure if it is to have the capability to fight on future battlefields. In 2022, Chief of the General Staff General Sir Patrick Sanders declared that Operation Mobilise – to deter Russian aggression in Europe – was to be the British Army’s priority. This will mean the acceleration of the Future Soldier modernisation programme, with the aim of restoring the British Army’s ability to conduct mobile combined arms warfare. While the strategy is explicit about having a positional character, this is because it is largely focused on deterrence and as such will involve posturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for deterrence to work, it must be credible. Credibility requires not just a presentational force but the ability to warfight, and British warfighting doctrine is defined by the “manoeuvrist approach” – doctrinal terminology for manoeuvre warfare. Manoeuvre and heavy armoured forces – both heavy armoured combat vehicles classed as MBTs and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) or armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) and the associated support and logistics vehicles and apparatus – are deeply interconnected. Heavy armoured forces are known for their ability to manoeuvre and for using their unique characteristics to maintain this ability, even against other heavy armoured forces, and have traditionally been able to remain mobile under heavy direct and indirect enemy fire, and to engage and destroy conventional ground forces (including other tanks). Heavy armoured forces, if they are well-trained and well-led, can also quickly reform after taking objectives, and then immediately exploit further opportunities to do the same again (although, as will be explored below, these characteristics are not absolute and may not be guaranteed in future). The key characteristics of heavy armoured forces can be summarised as mobility, firepower and protection – criteria against which individual vehicles are judged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns about the continued viability of MBTs, coupled with the clear imperative for the British Army to retain its ability to credibly fight wars, provide the context for this study, which examines the fate of the MBT and heavy armoured forces within the British Army, based on a survey of the changes to combined arms warfare and of evolving British strategic policy. There is much at stake here: force structure changes and procurement decisions have long lead times and must be made early. Unpacking the debate about heavy armoured forces in sufficient depth to identify trade-offs and opportunities (and, indeed, dead-ends) is therefore essential if policymakers and military leaders are to reshape land forces so as to remain credible for future warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study frames issues in broad terms in order to be as accessible and useful as possible to international military practitioners, academics, policymakers and observers from outside the British defence establishment, but is UK-focused and, where appropriate, explores inherently technical issues. Chapter I covers British policy in the context of strategic warfighting requirements. Chapter II analyses the basics of combat power and the characteristics of MBTs and heavy armoured vehicles in order to provide a baseline understanding of/guide to the underlying issues. Chapter III covers the challenges to the continued utility of heavy armoured forces and discusses what adaptations should be made to ensure that they remain viable in the context of the changing threat landscape and operational environment. The paper concludes with recommendations for the way ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an engineering study, and although engineering issues will be introduced or discussed where pertinent, some issues – for example, the adoption of remote turrets or rubberised tracks – may be left unaddressed where they do not have sufficient relevance for the tactical, operational or policy choices identified. As a primarily theoretical analysis of the nature of operations, the study relies on a mixture of approaches to address the questions outlined above: a survey of the existing literature; engagement with military practitioners; observations of military exercises; and fieldwork in relevant operational areas. Much of the utility of armour is reliant on enablers and supporting capabilities, as well as the coordination of different arms in combination: combined arms. Thus, parts of this study will discuss other systems, rather than focusing solely on tanks per se. This is essential, as the utility of MBTs/heavy armoured forces cannot be adequately addressed if that capability is examined in isolation. However, the primary focus will be MBTs, as the issues of combined arms integration and supporting capabilities are too broad to be addressed comprehensively here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be outlined in Chapter I, this study is predicated on credible conventional deterrence and thus the ability to warfight on land as an important pillar of security. Although this is current British policy, it is not a universally advocated strategy, and may justifiably be questioned. The key variables that determine the validity of conventional deterrence include to what degree an adversary’s activity is constrained by how it sees its options for escalation management, and whether it is actually deterred from crossing the threshold of conventional war. Only the latter question can be answered within the scope of this study, through the metric of credibility. Subordinate to this are questions of the flexibility of conventional forces. Arguably, conventional forces have utility across the spectrum of operations short of high-intensity war, and indeed it has sometimes even been argued that they are essential for these tasks due to the limited combat power of lighter forces. Consequently this study will, as a secondary consideration, also briefly touch on the dual-utility of heavy armoured forces for expeditionary and sub-threshold operations, as the strategic questions left unaddressed by this study indicate that it is essential that heavy forces whose primary application is high-intensity war should have secondary utility or be adaptable to other lower-intensity forms of competition and conflict. In more practical terms, the fact that the UK’s strategic imperatives and defence policy could change in the future means that these questions about utility, which affect force structure and procurement decisions for conventional forces, should not be omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final baseline assumption for this study is that the future of armoured warfare should not be predicated on a less-capable adversary employing its forces poorly. Russia, the declared adversary and primary threat to NATO, is in the process of depleting its conventional forces, which have also proved themselves to have been presentational – investment was dedicated to impressive-looking technical capabilities, while basic practicalities were ignored. Catastrophic political decisions in the Kremlin, aside from the overall strategic blunder of launching a full-scale invasion in the first place, led to the prioritisation of equipment procurement over reforming the Russian armed forces’ system of logistics and sustainment, hierarchical command structure, training and education doctrine, and military culture. The failure to recognise the need for revolutionary organisational change has contributed to Russia’s military failures, but the extent of the self-created disaster in Ukraine will inevitably prompt reflection. Russia is likely to learn and rebuild its capabilities, while remaining an adversary and European security threat for the foreseeable future. This long-term threat should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-warfighting-as-a-component-of-british-defence-policy&quot;&gt;I. Warfighting as a Component of British Defence Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although warfighting has returned to prominence for the British defence establishment, the progressive reduction of Britain’s fleet of MBTs and heavy armoured vehicles over the past 14 years represents a cause for concern. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review stated that heavy armoured forces, which were deemed to include the Challenger 2 and Warrior IFV force, and the supporting AS90 self-propelled artillery and Titan and Trojan engineering vehicles, would be reduced in number, albeit with sufficient numbers retained for high-end warfighting and maintaining the possibility of regenerating these capabilities should the situation demand it. However, the Review was agnostic about the divisional force structure and only specified the retention of a division headquarters under which brigades might be commanded. The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, meanwhile, committed explicitly to a warfighting division, stating that its ground combat component would comprise two armoured infantry battalions and two Strike Brigades. Although the armoured infantry brigades would continue to field Warrior and Challenger 2, the Strike Brigades, with their Ajax vehicles, indicated a shift towards comparatively lighter mechanised forces that would trade sheer combat power for increased strategic mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 Integrated Review likewise directed the British Army to become smaller and lighter. Former Chief of the General Staff General Sir Nick Carter considered competition – the constant use of a blend of military and non-military tools by the UK’s enemies and adversaries without breaching a threshold that might trigger a decisive military response – to be a higher priority than warfighting, and directed that concept/capability development and restructuring efforts should reflect this prioritisation. This approach flipped older assumptions that the Army’s warfighting functions served as an insurance policy to be held at readiness, with warfighting formations being able to adapt to lower-intensity conflicts if required. Although counterintuitive, there was a certain rationale to this, as well as plenty of historical evidence suggesting that capabilities developed for low-intensity conflict could prove not only useful but transformational for high-end warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this clear direction of travel, the aforementioned elements of British defence policy have received significant criticism, with repeated controversies over whether plans have been realistic or affordable. As for the higher strategic direction that such plans are intended to deliver against, the 2023 NATO Vilnius Summit did not include any detailed updates regarding the UK’s direct contribution to the Alliance, and Paul Cornish has noted that the recent Integrated Review Refresh included 22 sub-strategies, which therefore provides little guidance for subordinate parts of government about what to prioritise (given that resources and leverage are finite). While explicitly de-prioritising certain areas of policy can appear undiplomatic and incur a short-term political cost, the current failure to clearly prioritise has resulted in the members of the professional military community expressing increasingly divergent understandings of what is being asked of them. Some fundamental points about the Integrated Review therefore require examination. First and foremost, the Integrated Review Refresh, although it argues for a tilt, still privileges the Euro-Atlantic over the Indo-Pacific, and the land domain and Russia are seen as the most prominent arena and threat to the UK. In terms of alliances, NATO is “the highest priority”. While the Indo-Pacific and China receive a great deal of attention in their own right within the Integrated Review, this paper is redicated on the view that Indo-Pacific security is most efficiently supported by ensuring that European security is adequately addressed by European countries, such that lines of effort in the Indo-Pacific are not undermined by drawing excessively on the US capabilities required in that theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with regard to European security, the Defence Command Paper outlines other capabilities that will be grown as a matter of priority. This is a different approach from other members of NATO. The French Army, for example, is aiming to restore its ability to conduct armoured warfare at corps level, and while many French units are light- or medium-weight, the eventual replacement of the Leclerc with another more modern MBT remains a key French defence policy aspiration. The British Army will not experience the same regeneration for warfighting at scale, and its heavy armoured capabilities will not grow unless there is a fundamental shift in guidance; however, neither has the British Army been directed to shed this capability. The Future Soldier Guide issued in 2021 outlined the British Army’s warfighting division, 3rd Division, as containing two Armoured Brigade Combat Teams equipped with Ajax, an upgraded Challenger 3 and Boxer, and a Deep Recce Strike Brigade Combat Team equipped, after restructuring, with a mixture of guided multiple launch rocket system (GMLRS) and AS90 fires capabilities and Ajax and Jackal 2 for reconnaissance. And so although the structure and enabling capabilities of the British Army’s warfighting component are shifting, it is clear that the British Army will retain its heavy armoured forces, exemplified by the Challenger series of MBT, for warfighting: a rare scenario to be sure, but one at the core of why the UK maintains its armed forces in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the focus on warfighting, a competing priority that must be highlighted is that of expeditionary operations and limited conflict, and the role that heavy armoured forces can play in these contexts. The post-Cold War move away from conventional deterrence, during which heavy forces suffered from a degree of neglect, was part of a shifting paradigm that prompted a resurgence of interest in smaller conflicts dating back to Britain’s colonial era. During the Cold War, there had been divergent imperatives: on the one hand, to resource conventional deterrence between superpower-backed alliances; and, on the other, to fight small wars in distant expeditionary conflicts, often colonial in nature. Both scenarios involved superpower and ideological competition, but manifested very differently in terms of the lower stakes involved in the expeditionary conflicts (at least for the Soviet and NATO participants). Previously, the problem was conceived of as how to use lighter, more agile, more politically engaged expeditionary forces when militaries were prioritising heavier European warfighting forces that were based more on maintaining the peace through deterrence. The prospect of a major war between superpowers was a frightening one, but also a scenario that was more easily comprehended by the military units that were committed to it. The debate re-emerged, supposedly new but echoing the same considerations that previous generations had grappled with: conventional deterrence versus grey-zone competition, with the split between heavy and light forces predicated upon deployability and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the traditional division of labour between heavy and light forces, therefore, a strong case has been made for the utility of heavy armoured forces even in such delicate missions as peace support. In positive contrast to the shortcomings of Task Force Ranger in Mogadishu, for example, the Swedish-Danish-Norwegian heavy armoured battalion Nordbat 2 exemplified this utility in Bosnia in 1993 when it was able to provide decisive overmatch and retain freedom of movement, which in this case was essential to the UN mandate in their area of operations. Canadian forces, too, found Leopard 2 MBTs to be invaluable tactically in the Afghanistan counterinsurgency campaign, despite having envisioned being able to make do with the 17-tonne wheeled Light Armoured Vehicle III (LAV III).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, arguments in favour of the continued use of heavy armour outside of high-end warfighting are likely to fall victim to the financial and logistical challenges associated with deploying and sustaining heavy armour. Even for the best-resourced militaries, heavy armour is likely to be an unaffordable luxury except when facing a peer or near-peer conventional force. Likewise, for all the strong arguments that can be made in favour of Nordbat 2’s deployment to Bosnia, it must be remembered that there were numerous peace support operations ongoing at the time, all of which could lay justifiable claim, on moral or humanitarian grounds, to receiving serious military resourcing from the international community. The realities of multiple conflicting demands and limited capacity mean that British heavy armoured forces will at best be committed sparingly to such future missions, if at all, as a secondary benefit of maintaining a warfighting force that might on occasion donate small force elements if able to do so. Their presence can help peacekeepers, policing missions, counterinsurgencies and stability operations to focus on their core missions more effectively (through tactical overmatch), thus removing the distraction of these missions getting bogged down in indecisive combat situations. This useful function of heavy armoured forces should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad utility of heavy armoured forces across the spectrum of conflict – both their utility in their primary role, and as a hedge against future sub-threshold contingencies should the acute requirement for conventional deterrence in Europe decline in the long term – means that, from one perspective, the argument in favour of MBTs is clear-cut. Yet sceptical arguments about MBTs generally point to technological changes that compromise the ability of heavy armoured vehicles to maintain one or more of their three traditional characteristics – mobility, firepower and protection. Many of these concerns are valid, particularly those relating to pervasive UAV ISTAR, networked headquarters and forces, and precision fires able to strike large numbers of targets far from the frontline, which bodes poorly for forces that are either slow, easy to detect or require a large logistics tail. In this conception of the future, lighter ground forces will be more viable through a reduced signature, more operational mobility, and through their reduced cost allowing them to be generated in larger numbers, offsetting the enemy’s ability to concentrate precision fires against an identifiable centre of mass. Implicit in this vision is that geographical concentration of forces in the attack will be difficult, meaning that units will have to fight dispersed for an increasing proportion of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As will be discussed in Chapter III, this hypothetical conception of the future is not unchallenged and its precise implications are disputed. Nevertheless, experimental evidence indicates that changes of one sort or another will be required for ground forces to remain effective, with experience from Ukraine suggesting that alternatives to dispersion are to “dig deep, or move fast”. All three of these alternatives will likely play a role during different phases of operations and campaigns, but dispersion looks set to remain the prevalent approach, and several resulting adaptations to force composition and structures would in theory create a survivable, viable warfighting force. But it would be one that lacked combat power in the direct fight – that is, when engaging an enemy force within direct line-of-sight using weapons systems organic to the units employing them (whether supported by enabling indirect capabilities or not). The conflicting imperatives to disperse or concentrate forces pose difficult dilemmas that have yet to be conclusively resolved. The resolution of these questions requires an examination of exactly what MBTs bring to high-end combined arms warfighting – and it is to this that we turn next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-role-of-the-mbt-in-combined-arms-warfare&quot;&gt;II. The Role of the MBT in Combined Arms Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theoretical underpinnings of combined arms warfare, though well established, are worth reiterating here. While heavy armoured forces have numerous applications, their primary purpose is warfighting – the application of violence in order to defeat an enemy. This requires combat power, traditionally understood to comprise three core elements: mobility; protection; and firepower. Firepower is sometimes referred to as lethality or offensive power. Mobility, protection and firepower have long been components of combat power in US Army doctrine, and provide a widely accepted theoretical framework. Leadership was sometimes considered to be an additional fourth component. In US doctrine, this model was expanded to eight components by 2017: “leadership, information, mission command, movement and maneuver, intelligence, fires, sustainment, and protection”, a departure from the underlying principles that attempted to integrate disparate elements into the model. The result, at the risk of blurring what aspect of war was being described by the original model, nevertheless highlights the importance of supporting arms and integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model of combat power is not directly replicated in British doctrine, but, where combat power is euphemistically referenced in the British Army’s keystone ADP Land publication, it is seated within the physical component of fighting power. The tactical functions of a combined arms force provide the best analogue to US doctrine: these are command, intelligence, outreach, information activities, fires, manoeuvre, protection and sustainment, a valuable contrasting model in that it highlights the inevitable transition from warfighting to stability operations, even in the context of a warfighting campaign, in a way that US doctrine does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other academic models can also be useful. For example, operability has been hypothesised by Yoo, Park and Choi as an alternative fourth function of combat power when considering the original triangular framework at the platform level; the technical and tactical reasons for this will be discussed in a subsequent chapter. While operability might better be described as a cross-cutting attribute that helps deliver and sustain all forms of combat power, and the suggestion may be conceptually flawed, the importance of operability, logistics and sustainment should nevertheless be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding warfighting and combat power in terms of the original triangular framework of mobility, protection and firepower is useful, as it encourages thinking about how a force should function overall and deliver the required effects when conducting operations in the land domain. In particular, the triangular model is useful for identifying the core trade-offs that are inherent to different types of force, whereas augmented versions of the model include elements – for example, leadership and command and control – that are applicable regardless of the type of force being assembled, and which therefore do not usefully illustrate the trade-offs between heavy armoured forces (built around MBTs) and other lighter formations. However, as will be discussed, integration of other elements is essential to ensure the viability of heavy armoured forces, and so should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, and regardless of which variation of the conceptual model of combat power is preferred, their value lies in countering the technological determinism that is prevalent in commentary on defence and security issues. While this determinism is often driven by an appreciation of technological capability, it can result in overestimations of the impact of technological change, or in a failure to understand the second- and third-order impacts of this change on other parts of a military system and on battlefield dynamics. All of the elements discussed above factor into effective combined arms warfare at some stage. Those forces that make warfighting their forte and can credibly fight wars at scale do so in large part due to combining arms, whereby a variety of different arms – artillery, infantry, armour, engineers, logistics, medical services and so on – act in concert. However, not all militaries can be considered combined arms forces, as this status is achieved only by mastering the simultaneous integration of capabilities to create the right synchronised effects to prevail in war, preferably decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mobility-firepower-and-protection&quot;&gt;Mobility, Firepower and Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this model, MBTs are not the only element of a force that delivers combat power. At a platform level, however, the original triangular concept of mobility, firepower and protection best encapsulates their value, for while they trade these characteristics off against each other (as does any type of platform), MBTs nevertheless embody all three in a unique, heightened manner. The way that armour operates at the platform level governs the broader tactical and operational dynamics when these vehicles are fielded at scale. A deeper understanding of armoured vehicles is therefore useful, as it explains why they have developed the characteristics that now typify them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBTs developed their current format in the interwar period: a tracked hull with an engine; an independently rotating turret; and a main armament. By the end of the Second World War, this configuration had been almost universally refined to eliminate features such as hull-mounted machine guns and had standardised the MBT crew at either three personnel – commander, gunner and driver (if an autoloader is used to reload the main gun) or four (if an extra crew member is added to load the main gun manually). Apart from the driver, most MBTs have all other personnel located in the turret and turret basket assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobility is the most complex of the three characteristics that this configuration delivers. Although tracked vehicles are valued for their versatile mobility characteristics, MBTs and heavy armoured forces should not be described as the most mobile type of formation: rather, they are useful under certain circumstances. Physical terrain is not homogenous and so generalisations tend to be unreliable, and light infantry can of course move through and fight in almost any environment impassable to other forces if given sufficient time (the obvious example being primary jungle). Restrictive terrain has – perhaps erroneously – been deemed unsuitable for armoured forces. Tracked armoured vehicles can operate in most types of mountainous terrain except for alpine-like mountain ranges (where even light infantry would require technical rock-climbing skills to achieve full mobility) and the summit zones of interior and coastal mountain ranges. However, outside of these extreme instances, it is broadly correct to say that tracked vehicles – which in military terms largely mean heavy armoured forces – are the most tactically mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical reason for this is that the increased contact area of tracked vehicles’ running gear generally gives them lower ground pressure than their wheeled counterparts, thus providing improved thrust and traction (even if the tracked vehicles are in absolute terms far heavier). Theoretically, this improved traction will be less pronounced on loose or frictional soil (such as sand) than on cohesive soil (for example mud or clay), but in practical terms the difference is limited. Tracked vehicles are less likely to become bogged in or to slip, and can thus cross more difficult terrain than wheeled vehicles. Provided that ground is not so soft that vehicles start to sink, tracked armoured vehicles also have a significant advantage over light infantry, and if the ground is trafficable then their engine power means that they will be able to move much faster than dismounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the power of the engine and the design of the drivetrain, a major limitation on the off-road mobility of individual vehicles is the shearing effect between the tracks (or wheels) and the terrain, which causes a loss of traction and hampers vehicles’ ability to cross ground. Shearing is most likely to occur on steep slopes; traversing slopes is significantly more difficult than heading directly up ascents and down descents, and the consequences of a failed traverse are more likely to involve a roll-over. With regard to clearance angles, the approach, departure and belly-clearance or ramp angles will also influence what obstacles a vehicle can climb over. While wheeled vehicles are also good at traversing slopes, tracks have the advantage of being comparatively resilient to small arms fire and fragmentation from artillery, which have a tendency to shred rubber tyres and immobilise wheeled vehicles. This allows tracked vehicles to retain mobility even in the midst of heavy fighting, although this comes at the cost of increased mechanical complexity, with implications over longer distances that will be discussed shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hull shape and drivetrain design can give remarkable tactical mobility under the right circumstances. During the Korean War, British troops often marvelled at the ability of their Centurion MBTs to climb up slippery, muddy hills and to wade through flooded rice paddy fields. Unfortunately, this kind of ability involves inherent trade-offs, and different designs within the same vehicle class and formal tactical role can exhibit markedly different performance. For example, a low number of road wheels grants sufficient tactical mobility while being mechanically simple, but the resulting high ground pressure degrades the ability to operate on soft ground. Likewise, tracked armour is excellent in mountainous terrain up to a certain gradient, but where lighter tracked vehicles excel, heavier tracked armour might struggle, both because of tight mountain roads and generally constricted terrain, and due to the weight and ground pressure of the vehicles making steep slopes impossible to traverse. Most principles and techniques of off-road tactical mobility are transferable between wheeled and tracked vehicles, but tracked vehicles tend to be more forgiving. Nevertheless, reading the ground and how to move across it is a skill, and tanks must still be driven carefully. With professional and well-trained operators, heavy armoured vehicles can cross difficult ground quickly, and push through many obstacles, in a way that other forces cannot. Likewise, the mobility advantage does not necessarily make wheeled or heavy tracked armour more suited to manoeuvre. In forest, jungle or mountainous terrain, armour may be better employed positionally due to the requirement for slow, careful movement, or by leveraging its high level of firepower and protection when forcing an enemy from key terrain, with manoeuvre derived from the employment of light infantry. It is first and foremost the environment and context that determine how heavy armour is employed. The employment of armour to enable manoeuvre is a product of geography first, and of the characteristics of the vehicles second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over long distances, wheeled forces may enjoy comparative advantage over heavy tracked armour if trafficable routes are available. Due to the simplicity of their running gear and drivetrains, wheeled vehicles require less maintenance and experience a far lower breakdown rate. They also require less fuel, and the reduced maintenance requirement in turn reduces the volume of spare parts, maintenance stores and recovery mechanics that need to accompany them. It has thus been argued that lighter wheeled vehicles provide better operational mobility when moving between positions, areas and objectives, an attribute that is written into the British Army’s Strike Concept. The truth is more complex: heavy armour is still able to move at pace over great operational distances, and can do so over worse ground, whereas wheeled armour, with its different mobility characteristics, remains competitive with its heavier counterparts at the operational level, depending on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues of strategic mobility also need to be considered. When driving into theatre or to a forward assembly area, MBTs and heavy armoured vehicles are carried on heavy equipment transporters (HETs) for substantial parts of the journey to reduce wear and tear on the drivetrain and running gear. Long road moves are often associated with a high rate of breakdowns if heavy armoured forces need to drive without support from HETs, and those vehicles that do arrive will still incur a higher maintenance burden. MBTs and heavy armoured vehicles can technically be airlifted into a given theatre, but only the largest transport aircraft are able to carry them, and cannot transport them in large numbers. Thus for large armoured formations to arrive in theatre quickly, an unattainably vast strategic airlift capability would be needed, as otherwise such a move would be impossible within any reasonable timeframe due to the number of trips that would be required. Access to runways of sufficient dimensions (and paved to a standard to safely accept heavy transport aircraft) is also a limiting factor. Sealift is the most efficient method of moving MBTs and heavy armoured vehicles over long distances and between theatres, but this requires time and safe ports at which to offload vehicles (unless a specialised amphibious landing capability for heavy armoured vehicles is also factored in). Railway transport is also efficient, but involves similar bottlenecks to airlift, this time with regard to rolling stock and available railheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All modes of long-distance transport for heavy vehicles still require practice if they are to be completed without unnecessary delays; no one should underestimate the inherent coordination challenge facing the combat units themselves, the logistics units supporting them and the organisations in charge of the infrastructure stemming from the distances involved and the transport volumes associated with large numbers of vehicles. Consequently, the threat posed by heavy armour is most credible when it is either forward-based or reserved for use within an operational distance of its home base. Nevertheless, it should be noted that deployment of heavy armoured forces is possible, and that medium armoured forces, particularly those built around tracked armoured vehicles (regardless of whether they are of a lighter weight) also incur many of the same costs and constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protection is the one inherent attribute of heavy armoured forces that cannot be replicated by lighter combat vehicles. This protection traditionally came from large amounts of passive armour, either rolled homogenous steel or some form of composite material, which could deflect or absorb the energy from an incoming projectile. Passive armour can be angled, and is generally concentrated on the frontal aspect of vehicles in order to provide the best protection for the least weight. Some vehicles complement this arrangement with explosive reaction armour (ERA) blocks: boxes of explosives that detonate when struck with a sufficiently powerful projectile, dissipating the energy of the incoming projectile and reducing the likelihood of the armour being penetrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive armour has increasingly been enhanced by active protection systems, which can be split into “hard kill” and “soft kill” systems. Hard-kill systems physically shoot down incoming projectiles. For example, Rheinmetall’s APS-Gen3 comprises short-range radars (which detect incoming projectiles on approach), electro-optical sensors (which locate projectiles immediately before impact) and an explosive countermeasure (which detonates to destroy the projectile) – this latter kinetic element could be described as a guided ERA block. Other systems, such as the Israeli-designed Trophy, fire their own shotgun-like munitions to intercept incoming projectiles. Soft kill systems are more diverse, and encompass any system that interrupts the guidance systems of incoming projectiles or the systems from which they are launched or guided. Retro-reflective detection, laser warning receivers and defensive electronic warfare systems all aid in the detection of anti-tank weapons attempting to target the vehicle. In terms of defeating the anti-tank systems themselves, lasers may be used to dazzle electro-optical sensors, while radio frequency jamming may serve to disrupt command signals between a missile and its launcher. While the technologies/methodologies of different soft-kill systems vary, they are for the most part only relevant to defeating guided systems. The promise – and limitations – of technological developments in this area will be discussed in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of firepower or lethality, modern MBTs remain one of the most potent platforms on the battlefield, particularly when focusing on direct line-of-sight or close-range engagements. This is due to the power of their main armament and their ability to carry other anti-tank weapons, all of which can quickly be brought to bear by virtue of being mounted in a stabilised turret. Jonathan House usefully split anti-tank weaponry into two categories – chemical energy weapons and kinetic energy weapons. This distinction remains valid and applies equally to weaponry mounted on MBTs, or on lighter vehicles, or carried by dismounted infantry. Chemical energy weapons typically equate to anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), although long-ranged precision fires and loitering munitions technically fit within this bracket; as these weapons are generally employed within the anti-tank role performed by other forces (with limited use by MBTs themselves), they will be discussed in Chapter 3. While MBTs do not have a monopoly on lethality, the size of MBTs as a platform means that carrying anti-tank weapons does not require them to forsake mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinetic energy weapons category essentially encompasses the main guns of MBTs, as self-propelled or towed anti-tank guns have been deemed tactically ineffective by most militaries, and man-portable anti-tank rifles are considered to be too low-powered to threaten all but the lightest modern armoured vehicles. Whether of Western or Russian design, MBT main guns now generally fire armour-piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, the core penetrator dart being made from either depleted uranium or tungsten. While other forms of munitions can be fired, other types of specialised anti-tank round such as high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and high explosive squash head (HESH) are less effective against modern armour. If equipped with modern ammunition, the main gun remains a potent anti-armour weapon, with the added benefit of being comparatively light, quick to reload, and cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBT main guns have long been stabilised, allowing them to fire accurately on the move. This remains a significant engineering challenge, putting established defence contractors who have mastered the manufacturing of stabilised guns at a distinct advantage to competitors. Most Western MBT main guns are of 120-mm calibre, which is the approximate maximum size for a main gun round that can be handled quickly by a human loader without mechanical assistance. Any significant increase in calibre would force Western heavy armour to swap the human loader for an autoloader: this would probably require the four-person crew of commander, gunner, loader and driver to be reduced by one, a move that is considered undesirable due to workflow issues both in the vehicle itself and in the field more generally. Were the fourth crew member to be retained alongside the autoloader, MBT turrets – which are already approaching practical size limits – would have to become even bigger. Given the trade-offs involved, and bar any unexpected technological advances in main gun technology, tank main guns are unlikely to significantly increase their lethality in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, they remain potent, especially when factoring in the weight and rate of fire that an MBT can employ from its stock of onboard ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the ability of MBTs to quickly cross difficult terrain and obstacles, to quickly engage successive targets (including other MBTs) in their direct line-of-sight with a highly effective main gun, and their ability to absorb punishment and continue fighting unless targeted by dedicated anti-tank capabilities, make for a potent and flexible ground combat unit. While this comes at the cost of a higher logistics and sustainment framework to support them, MBTs’ sheer combat power makes them uniquely capable not only of destroying other heavy armoured forces (if employed correctly), but of maintaining momentum while doing so. They are particularly useful, if properly employed and enabled, for offensive operations transitioning to breakthrough-and-exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, breakthrough-and-exploitation corresponds to deep battle theory (or deep operations theory, in the parlance of its Soviet authors), which emerged in the run-up to the Second World War. This was an offensive doctrine centred on striking deep into an enemy’s rear areas following the penetration of its lines and then causing sufficient disruption to prevent an enemy from moving forces to effectively plug the hole in its lines or encircle the attacking forces. Breakthrough-and-exploitation is advantageous, if achieved, in that it can overrun rear areas, and is “designed to induce systemic collapse”. If momentum cannot be sustained, offensive operations may instead aim to bite and hold objectives and ground, a less ambitious but still valid approach to operational design. Of course, these concepts of operation date to the early- and mid-20th century, and the combined arms integration required for successful offensive operations of either kind will require adaptations to be made to force design, composition and structure. While many of these adaptations relate to the changing character of war and fall upon supporting arms, MBTs and the units fielding them must likewise embrace change to stay relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-challenges-and-necessary-adaptations&quot;&gt;III. Challenges and Necessary Adaptations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges and necessary adaptations fall under several categories. Some relate to additions to the combined arms system, others to the integration of the component arms, and some to the MBTs at the core of heavy armoured forces. There are also two alternative force structures that in theory offer a warfighting capability with sufficient lethality to fight against heavy armoured forces: motorised or dismounted light forces equipped with ATGMs (but without the ability to fire them while mobile); and medium armoured forces. The utility of these alternative force structures for high-intensity warfighting is effectively a separate research question, as they are arguably in competition with heavy armoured forces. However, given that the question of their effectiveness against MBTs and heavy armoured forces overlaps with questions about the effectiveness of MBTs and heavy armoured force themselves, a brief overview is still required. More importantly, this overview encapsulates the technical challenges and adaptations required for MBTs due to the threat posed by ATGMs themselves. Armoured forces that fight on the move are mechanised, while those which fight by dismounting and working in conjunction with their infantry can be considered motorised; by this definition, for example, a Stryker brigade combat team is a motorised formation. These should be addressed as two separate but related structures, against which heavy armoured forces can be subjected to comparative assessment. Another major aspect to be addressed in depth relates to the support to and sustainment of MBT-equipped formations, an understudied area which is nevertheless fundamental to their viability. Finally, there are also issues of technological change at the platform level to be considered below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pervasive-istarprecision-strike&quot;&gt;Pervasive ISTAR/Precision Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of pervasive ISTAR, command and control (C2) modernisation and strike capabilities through precision-guided munitions have been at the forefront of the debate about the changing character of warfare and the implications for military forces. One way that this should be countered is throug improved force protection, delivered by the adoption of new (or at least improved) capabilities and through restructuring combined arms formations. This issue has been covered extensively, and while the associated debates cannot be comprehensively re-examined in this paper, suffice to say that electronic warfare (EW), artillery and counterbattery capabilities, and short-range air defence (SHORAD) all play a role. The issue is in any case largely agnostic of force type – whether light and dismounted, or medium or heavy armoured: all force types must integrate the capabilities discussed and embrace change according to the evolving character of combined arms warfare. The one caveat is that, given that heavy armoured forces have a correspondingly larger logistics footprint and greater maintenance and support requirements than most other types of forces, they may prove particularly vulnerable to this changing battlefield dynamic if combined arms integration is not effective. There are several relevant issues to cover here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are serious differences of opinion over the consequences of recent developments, including how to interpret the effectiveness and efficiency of C2 modernisation at moving information internally and the effectiveness of precision fires at fighting the deep battle. In the context of the difficult challenge that the deployment of uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) imposes on land forces, the debate surrounding the best way forward often loses sight of the fact that the pervasive ISTAR and precision fires complex offers quite narrow effects. Drones and precision fires face the same inherent boundaries that aviation encountered in previous eras: aviation could attack enemy forces and systems throughout the area from the frontline to the strategic deep, and have outsized effect in certain regards, but could not independently hold ground or control populations, nor have other persistent effects. Similarly, drones and precision fires, even though they constitute a distinct line of effort, are still effectively only enablers of other ground forces. What drones and precision fires have long promised – and are now able to achieve – is attrition of key capabilities, and potentially (if targeting is done properly) the degrading of the enemy military’s system of systems. Events such as Exercise Green Dagger, nested within the larger Exercise Warfighter 22, both of which took place in late October 2021, provide evidence about the potency of pervasive ISTAR, C2 modernisation and precision strike when a professional NATO force implements highly refined targeting procedures. In this instance, long-ranged precision fires cued on by a combination of UAV ISTAR and traditional forward reconnaissance patrols mauled participating ground forces, and while manoeuvre was possible during certain intervals, at other times ground combat formations that were identified while in unfavourable positions were heavily attrited, with few options available in response. Lighter ground forces experienced struggles of their own, with issues relating to attrition and a failure to maintain momentum in the close fight. Furthermore, although the impact of new technologies was concerning, it should be remembered that open desert environments provided ideal conditions for UAS, and the lopsided performance under these conditions would not necessarily be replicable in a different climate and in more complex terrain. Even in Ukraine’s Donbas region, characterised by open fields and limited cover, the extensive use of UAS – for all the changes it has wrought – has yet to prove decisive and has not pushed traditional ground combat capabilities from the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration concerns the emphasis placed on offensive capabilities without the same regard for their defensive counterparts. Following a 20-year period of counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan during which neither the air domain nor the electromagnetic spectrum was contested, even the exceptionally well-resourced US military has come to exhibit a mismatch between these different specialisations. While UAS and precision fires technology have been invested in and progressively refined, defensive EW, SHORAD and counter-UAS (CUAS) have received sporadic and comparatively limited attention. Of these, only CUAS has claimed a belated prominence in the discourse about the future of warfare. Forces rotating through iterations of exercises such as Warfighter are exploring how to address the issue, but the evidence suggests that, rather than this being an inherent offence–defence mismatch which favours new technologies, Western forces are simply playing catch-up and need to rebalance their capabilities and concepts of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One resultant avenue that is often forgotten is within the broad field of camouflage, concealment, deception and decoys (C2D2), where camouflage and concealment receive far more attention than deception and decoys. Part of this is because it is easier to build standardised technical solutions or procedures to implement camouflage and concealment. Deception, on the other hand, is situation-dependent, and requires intellectual investment and problem solving for every iteration. It is also difficult to do consistently and effectively in the absence of a nuanced understanding of the adversary’s procedures and mindset – understanding of enemy technical ISTAR capabilities alone will not suffice. Meanwhile, the cost of decoys can create disincentives to utilising them extensively in training, and there is also a risk that deception and decoys will draw too much resource and undermine the main effort. Depending on the type of decoys used, significant numbers of personnel might be needed to manage them, especially if decoy units and activities are to be convincing even when viewed with a variety of different sensors and detection capabilities. (As a basic example, an enemy might be convinced that a decoy vehicle is real when viewing it in the visual light spectrum, but its thermal signature or the lack of radio frequency activity could reveal it for what it is, meaning that an enemy with capable and diligent ISTAR specialists would likely not be deceived for long.) One solution might be to homogenise the appearance and signature of ground forces, containerising logistics, ensuring that vehicles appear as similar as possible, and adopting communications systems that disguise which nodes are of critical importance – mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) or mesh networks are a good example here, as this kind of disguise is an inherent feature of the way that they transfer data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, simulated formation-level activity in the electromagnetic spectrum may not stand up to scrutiny if cyber analysis reveals inconsistencies or a lack of concurrent activity in the social media space, as the pervasiveness of social media and the tendency of local inhabitants to naturally document any unusual activity happening in their vicinity means that such inconsistencies can be easily detected using open sources; such activity is hard to control, suppress or convincingly fabricate. Improving the D2 element of C2D2 is therefore a challenging proposition in terms of both resourcing and overall feasibility. Nevertheless, if turned into a dedicated line of effort and practised and refined on exercise, it may prove a powerful tool for creating uncertainty, slowing enemy decision-making, and causing the misallocation of enemy resources, all of which increase the survivability of ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach to force protection and C2D2 is that of counter-reconnaissance. Although counter-reconnaissance – prioritising offensive action against an enemy’s ISTAR rather than relying on passive or reactive force protection – is a longstanding concept, militaries have only partially adapted it in response to technological change. In an example that proves useful for illustrating both current challenges and potential solutions, in February 2020 the US Army’s 25th Infantry Division took part in Warfighter Exercise (WFX) 20-03, a computer-based simulation. The division found itself fighting a difficult initial shaping battle against enemy long-ranged precision fires and ISTAR assets due to attrition that these enemy capabilities were causing. Passive and reactive air defence deployed against UAS proved inadequate, and so the division approached the problem not as one of force protection but of prioritising the targeting and destruction of enemy ISTAR in order to break their kill chain. The 25th Infantry Division attempted to target different elements throughout the kill chain – the UAS themselves, dismounted forward observers, and UAS ground control stations, as the launchers for enemy indirect fires were assigned to corps-level assets. They had little success against UAS, downing some systems but being unable to destroy enough to have any overall effect. UAS ground control stations were identified as a more vulnerable element of the kill chain. The prioritisation of the counter-UAS battle, and the detection and collation of the enemy forces’ electronic and signals signature allowed the division to understand what effects they needed to apply and where, though the division’s own C2 processes proved insufficiently integrated to consistently destroy identified targets or render the enemy’s UAS network ineffective until the division could adapt and reorganise these processes. While this adaptation was taking place, the division’s ground manoeuvre elements had been badly attrited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While accepting the limitations of such simulations in terms of realism, even those as well-resourced and layered as Warfighter, and that the measures taken achieved only partial success within the duration of the exercise, nonetheless the division’s identification of the least successful line of effort (kinetic CUAS) and the most promising (aggressive counter-reconnaissance against enemy ground stations) provides a useful indicator of the direction that force restructuring and the reform of concepts of operation should take. Overall, for heavy armour to be survivable, combined arms formations need to be able, one way or another, to prevent an enemy from saturating the battlespace with UAS, disrupt or slow down the links between UAS sensors and the precision weapons to which they feed targeting information, and to retain the ability to deceive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-ground-combat-force-structures&quot;&gt;Alternative Ground Combat Force Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ATGMs and Fighting Dismounted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the direct fight, increasingly capable ATGMs pose the most obvious threat to MBTs. While opposing MBTs can be armed with barrel-launched or tube-launched ATGMs, the fact that ATGMs do not rely on velocity means that they can be launched from a tube, and that in theory any light vehicle or dismounted soldier can thus be equipped with an effective anti-tank weapon. The technology continues to develop, and at present the lethality of modern systems such as Javelin, NLAW and Kornet is difficult for MBTs to counter directly. The most effective ATGMs, such as Javelin, have a top-attack function whereby the missile guides itself via an irregular trajectory to strike the weaker top armour of a targeted vehicle. Top-attack munitions also have the advantage of being difficult to counter with active protection systems (APS), as these must track and calculate the trajectory of the incoming missile in order to intercept it. However, ATGMs come at a high per unit cost, and top-attack munitions are the most expensive of all (and will require skilled operators until sensor and guidance technology improves). They are also bulky and heavy for dismounted infantry to carry, not to mention the difficulties of a dismounted unit carrying more than a handful of spare missiles with it, are slow to reload compared with the main gun of an MBT, and so have severe tactical constraints, even if they are more lethal in absolute terms. In a direct line-of-sight fight with MBTs and heavy armoured forces, the operators of ATGMs can be vulnerable, although if they are well-sited and implement good battlefield discipline to minimise their visual signature, they are very difficult to spot and can be used to conduct effective ambushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ATGM use by lighter armoured forces bears consideration, as these forces can in theory conduct offensive operations. Here, it is worth differentiating between mounted and dismounted forces. The US experience is that any medium formation that requires dismounts for lethality will be difficult to manage because of the constant transition between mounted and dismounted tactics. The British experience of exercising dismounted ATGM-armed light cavalry forces in the anti-armour role resulted in similar conclusions. Such forces are versatile and effective in defensive operations but difficult to use for offensive purposes due to the time required to manoeuvre and deploy them. In order to attack a heavy armoured force, a medium armoured force without mobile anti-armour capabilities of sufficient lethality will generally need to move to within 3 km of the enemy, advance or infiltrate on foot, and engage with man-portable anti-armour weapons. If the medium motorised force is paired with more mobile anti-armour capabilities such as heavy armour of its own, these dismounts can operate in a targeting role, but this points to their being a complementary capability rather than a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some advantages to motorised anti-armour capabilities. On operations in Afghanistan, without tracks and with a quiet engine, Strykers were found to be able to approach targets without being detected before deploying their dismounts. However, displacement and exfiltration is difficult in general, as is manoeuvre. If a medium motorised force is committed against a heavy armoured force, the sub-units that make contact with the enemy will lose momentum and the initiative, although they will be able to hold ground and retain lethal effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In complex terrain, medium motorised forces may fit operational needs. During the Battle of Irpin in the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukrainian infantry forces armed with ATGMs were not only lethal but also extremely mobile. However, the terrain around Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel is not conducive to armoured and mechanised mobility: the three suburbs are bounded by dense forest, and most of the open ground is part of the marshy floodplain around the Irpin and Bucha rivers, presenting a further obstacle. The village of Demydiv was one of many deliberately flooded to block Russian movement. The Russian Army did use light infantry in its attempts to manoeuvre away from the main roads, but these performed poorly. However, the battle was one of urban and forest fighting that heavily favoured the defender, and Ukrainian victory owed much to Russian planning failures – both factors being situational and not necessarily replicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, evidence from Ukraine suggests that fighting armoured forces is difficult and dangerous for ATGM-armed dismounted light infantry, even if they possess Javelin, one of the most effective and lethal systems currently available. If such forces are detected by enemy tank crews they become acutely vulnerable to the tank’s main armaments, which cause large numbers of casualties. The main gun of an MBT can also outrange all but the most capable of ATGMs, such as Javelin, and the evidence from Ukraine indicates that the addition of thermal shielding to Russian T90s could successfully reduce the effective range of Javelin to well within that of the vehicle’s main armament by making it harder for the command launch unit to lock on to targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the presence of ATGMs on the battlefield puts pressure on armoured forces, and is driving changes to tank design (such as the adoption of APS), prompting weight increases – as will be discussed later. Conversely, the presence of armour requires the careful husbanding of anti-tank capabilities which would otherwise be useful for other tasks. For example, the British Milan ATGMs deployed in the Falklands War, which were used in an anti-fortification role and were critical to overcoming dug-in Argentine infantry and marines, would have been less available (if available at all) for those tasks had the British task force been simultaneously guarding against the threat of even a small Argentine armoured force. ATGMs pose a distinct threat, but cannot lay claim to having made the MBT obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium Armoured Forces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium tracked armoured forces require the briefest commentary, as they are most similar to the heavy armoured forces built around MBTs. They operate on the same principles, but are comparatively lighter, less protected and carry less firepower, and they have the same drawbacks (albeit to a lesser extent in some regards). RAND conducted a study of the utility of medium tracked armoured forces, and concluded that they performed well, and benefited significantly from strategic, operational and tactical mobility and a less burdensome logistics requirement, but also found that their reduced combat power resulted in less successful outcomes if they were deployed against competent heavy armoured forces. These outcomes could only be offset by either close air support and artillery dominance or by the opposing heavy armoured forces not being employed competently (and without combined arms integration of their own). This study factored in the use of ATGMs (both vehicle-mounted and carried by dismounts) by medium armoured forces. The history of US light and medium armoured forces in the Second World War, at the point when they encountered German heavy armoured forces with a significant combat power advantage in the direct fight, was not a happy one, and involved significant losses, an experience that still shapes current US thinking on the employment of MBTs. This has been termed the Sherman Dilemma, whereby a force adopts a less-capable combat vehicle with the expectation that combined arms integration will offset its disadvantages in the direct fight, only to discover that combined arms integration does not provide the expected benefits under actual operational conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The category of medium forces is quite a varied one. The US Army Stryker formations fit at the lower end of the category, at just over 16 tonnes; although the MGS variant was armed with 105-mm main gun, this made for a top-heavy and unstable vehicle (mechanical issues with the turret were also an issue), and this variant was eventually retired. Thus, Stryker formations remain reliant on ATGMs for lethality when engaging heavier forces. Meanwhile the British Army’s Ajax vehicles, which weigh 38 tonnes, occupy the upper end of the medium forces category. The dividing line between “medium” and “heavy” forces, in fact, is blurred, as many MBTs – particularly those of Soviet or Russian design – are considerably smaller and lighter than their Western equivalents: for example, the T90 weighs 48 tonnes, while the T72 weighs only 46 tonnes. An alternative framing might be that, given the obvious pressures on heavy armoured forces, that heavy armoured vehicles and MBTs, when they are employed, should perhaps be lighter in future. However, as will be discussed in the section on logistics, sustainment, recovery and reconstitution, adopting Soviet design principles to achieve this end would be unwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their lesser logistical/sustainment requirements and increased deployability, medium armoured vehicles enjoy niche advantages over their heavy counterparts. Medium armoured vehicles with rapid-firing main armaments can generally hyper-elevate their guns compared with standard MBT designs, and therefore have a tactical advantage in urban, mountainous or complex terrain (noting the exception of the South Korean K2 Black Panther MBT, whose innovative suspension system allows the engagement of high- and low-angle targets)., However, when it comes to warfighting, the evidence suggests that medium armoured forces have consistently been at a disadvantage against heavy armoured forces, resulting in high losses when these two force types go head to head in the direct fight. Overall, these different force structure options are best seen as being complementary, rather than as substitutes for each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wheels-and-tracks&quot;&gt;Wheels and Tracks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheels and tracks remain a recurring topic of discussion, and therefore should be briefly acknowledged. The discussion continues even though the dynamics, in themselves, are generally agreed. It has already been mentioned that more difficult terrain will generally be more easily traversed by tracked vehicles, whereas wheeled vehicles will have to move more carefully and be more selective about their route – or indeed may not be able to cross the same terrain at all if it is sufficiently difficult. The implication is that the choice of routes, tactical formations, and use of ground for cover involving both tracked and wheeled vehicles will force the formation to conform to the mobility capacity of the least capable vehicles. Alternatively, concepts of operation need to make allowances for a disjoint between the wheeled and tracked elements of the force, and accept them not operating entirely in tandem. Incidentally, different types of vehicle may also experience interoperability issues, even if they fit within the same category. For example, CVR(T), though extremely useful in Afghanistan and other theatres, suffered in the First Gulf War in large part because, on the advance in open terrain, it could not keep pace with the Challenger- and Warrior-equipped heavy armoured forces for which it was supposed to provide forward reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, wheels and tracks have often been forced to operate together out of necessity, as even the best-resourced militaries must go to war with the equipment they have available – and this sometimes involves integrating disparate platforms and units. Wheels and tracks can verifiably work together successfully. However, where it is economically feasible, states with heavy armoured forces have tried to maintain as much commonality or similarity of hull and drivetrain as possible within formations. This should remain an aspiration, if British Army vehicle fleets can be rationalised over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-sustainment-recovery-and-reconstitution&quot;&gt;Logistics, Sustainment, Recovery and Reconstitution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micah Clark has argued that: “An experienced tank crew is the ultimate combat power multiplier for its ability to conduct field-expedient maintenance to unconventionally repair issues that would otherwise render a tank non-mission capable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the threat environment, MBTs need to remain mobile to avoid detection and targeting – but this creates dilemmas when factoring in the need to go static in order to conduct maintenance and repairs. Thorough preventative maintenance in garrison is a first step, but even with new vehicles, in good order, armoured forces require constant maintenance to keep them operational, and consume significant volumes of supplies. A squadron of MBTs requires a large amount of fuel, and heightened mobility will proportionally heighten the logistics burden for fuel resupply. Likewise, crews require rest, which the increased maintenance burden inherent in MBTs disrupts, further degrading operational tempo compared with simpler wheeled platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the key characteristics of protection, mobility and firepower that ground combat vehicles embody, Yoo, Park and Choi identified operability as the fourth key function. While the standing of operability as an equal consideration is open to debate, it is nonetheless important to highlight overall logistics and sustainment functions. Clark’s observation referenced above is often underappreciated, except by armoured personnel themselves, and “the often-overlooked operator’s perspective calls for the focus to fall on maintainability in the field over incremental upgrades to firepower and survivability”. Future MBTs and heavy armoured vehicles should be designed and constructed with modularity and repairability in mind, ensuring that as many repairs as possible can be completed on-site by the vehicle crews themselves, without having to recover the vehicle to a rear maintenance area or bring forward specialist repair crews; this dynamic is a much-overlooked – but critical – element in influencing heavy armour’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, recovery of immobilised MBTs is challenging, especially under fire, requiring well-practised and properly-equipped recovery crews if it is to be effective, but it can allow technically killed vehicles to be rapidly returned to service if they can be withdrawn from enemy contact and evacuated to forward repair facilities. Delays to recovery operations in Afghanistan for damaged Stryker vehicles could fix units for 24 hours even when recovery vehicles were readily available. Units were forced to defend what proved a tempting target for insurgent attacks, showing that the challenges of recovering and repairing heavier vehicles in warfighting conditions should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Second World War, although in many regards a dated case study, provides some critical lessons. In particular, the long duration of the war means that the multiple campaign seasons, large distances covered by advancing and retreating units, and the intensity of fighting (which resulted in high levels of tank loss) can provide useful insights into questions around the extended sustainment of heavy armoured forces in the face of attrition during warfighting campaigns, even if some fundamental differences can be identified with regard to contemporary scenarios (discussed below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet experience on the Eastern Front in the Second World War was that tanks might be knocked out, repaired and returned to service as many as four times during an operation. Tanks lost in a repairable state outnumbered those which were irrecoverable by two-to-one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wartime and post-war Soviet research found that on average during an operation which lasted 15 to 20 days the overall tank loss rate was 82% of the starting strength, with 70% of the losses being repairable and 30% of the repairable losses due to non-battle reasons such a mechanical problems or getting stuck in a swamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After approximately 20 days of constant operation, the Soviet Army found that the breakdown rate started to escalate dramatically, illustrating the importance of preventative maintenance. If Soviet forces lost ground, the rate of irrecoverable tank losses would increase dramatically as repairable tanks – and, in the worst-case scenario, tank repair facilities and recovered tanks undergoing repairs – were overrun and fell into German hands. Recovery and maintenance personnel organic to tank formations were invaluable: not only were they well-placed to quickly conduct repairs, but – if well-led – were likely to consider themselves an integral part of the team and perform better than centralised recovery and maintenance personnel based at higher or rear echelons; moreover, additional benefits were derived from their familiarity with specific vehicles. The importance of stocks of spare parts should not be underestimated, an oversight which plagued German forces in the Second World War, as a lack of spares could turn what should have been a quick repair job into a lengthier delay as tanks spent an extended period of time in the care of a maintenance unit, awaiting the necessary parts. Another flaw in the German operation was that cannibalisation of vehicles and inter-unit competition exacerbated the system’s deficiencies and meant that more damaged or broken-down tanks were unavailable than otherwise might have been the case. Interestingly, the experience of German tank crews was that, although they were trained to conduct basic repairs and could in theory assist the dedicated mechanics, in practice (when accompanying badly damaged tanks to rear echelon maintenance facilities) some crews had a tendency to interfere with the work of the maintenance personnel and generally make a hinderance of themselves unless other activities could be found to keep them occupied. Although this dynamic is at odds with the experience of well-trained modern crews, it is worth bearing in mind for unit commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Dickson’s distillation of the Soviet experience bears citing in full:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The number of tanks in service at any one time during a battle was very dynamic. On the minus side tanks were being destroyed or damaged due to battle or non-battle reasons. On the plus side was only the ability of the repair units to put damaged tanks back into service. Therefore the pool of damaged tanks was a great asset to a tank unit as long as they could be repaired in a timely manner. This had several significant consequences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As long as repair units were able to repair all or most of the tanks which were damaged, a tank unit was able to maintain its strength, only slowly weakening due to irrecoverable losses and the time it took to repair tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The faster a tank unit advanced, the farther behind the repair units lagged and the more time they had to spend moving to keep up. Both reduced the number of tanks which could be repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Retreat was a potential disaster for the damaged tank pool. With a limited number of evacuation vehicles, most tanks had to be abandoned on the field, never to be repaired. Loss of the damaged tank pool resulted in a dramatic reduction in tank strength.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Operational pauses were critical and allowed repair units time to catch up and clear the backlog of tanks to be repaired. This, and the fact that it did not retreat and lose its damaged tank pool, is why the 5th Guards Tank Army was able to reconstitute itself after the battle at Prokhorovka.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these points remain entirely valid for the modern employment of heavy armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent experience complements these lessons. The South African Defence Force (SADF) in the Border War provides an interesting example of an armoured force operating at reach and lacking mass, which could neither rotate formations nor reconstitute them during operations. In Operation Hooper, as the majority of the SADF’s armoured strength had been assembled, SADF Ratel IFVs and Olifant MBTs could not be replaced and had to either forgo maintenance – sometimes for up to 800 hours of combat – or be refitted at the front by their sub-unit mechanics. Both wear and tear and combat damage aggregated, whittling away at the number of available vehicles, and those that did go into combat often did so in a degraded and less effective state. This contributed to the inability of the SADF to maintain operational momentum and reinforce or exploit successful offensives. Concurrently, Cuban airpower served to limit SADF frontline resupply and maintenance. In most regards frontline combat units were kept supplied, albeit austerely, or could make do without non-critical items. However, spare parts for artillery and armoured vehicles were the two areas in which the logistics problems could not be solved through improvisation, resulting in ever-reducing capability due to the importance of armoured and indirect fire support and the heavy maintenance burden imposed on the units in question by the high and sustained operational tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of lessons learned from recent operations in Ukraine, the majority of Russian armour losses have still been the result of poor maintenance or logistics. In the case of the Ukrainian armed forces, the majority of repairs are carried out up to 300 km away from the frontlines in order to protect irreplaceable maintenance machinery and personnel from artillery fires. While the journey from the frontline to these facilities could be only five or six hours, an impressive feat of logistics in itself, this still constitutes a major endeavour. In the summer of 2022, Ukrainian tanks that had been destroyed on the battlefield, but recovered, were being repaired in Poland at a rate of 20–30 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all has implications for the current and future operational contexts for Western forces: unless formations can be furnished with ample layered air defences or the enemy thoroughly blinded by counter-reconnaissance operations, the requirement to keep major maintenance hubs safe from as much of the enemy’s precision fires as possible will probably necessitate them being based far from the frontlines. This could make tank pools less vulnerable to overrun, but would also mean that the tank pool would not be able to reconstitute armoured units as responsively as might be desired given the greater geographical distance between them and the units deployed forward. This would also increase coordination challenges and reduce the benefits of repair units being associated with frontline formations (the echelon at which maintenance units should be held). As well as creating the traditional logistics problems, this would also entail the concentration of large numbers of vehicles under repair, creating a large signature that could be detected and targeted even if located deep in the rear. Forward repair units should therefore be structured, equipped and protected in such a way as to operate dispersed and avoid developing a backlog of tanks under repair, while investment in education, training and track miles in developing crew skills will be key determinants of their ability to keep vehicles operable, enabling many repairs to be completed without the assistance of mechanics or the need for a vehicle to be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the scale at which forces operate, policymakers and senior leaders should understand that in order to credibly generate a warfighting capability at a given scale – be it battle group, brigade or division – a military will require sufficient depth to rotate it with a counterpart formation. Furthermore, avoiding spending on spare parts will amount to a false economy, and one that has in previous conflicts proved disastrous on operations. A sustainable supply of a large number of spare parts should be factored into procurement and fleet management decisions, otherwise a force may be exposed to excess attrition during warfighting and will accumulate an unnecessarily high level of permanently lost vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changes-to-tank-design&quot;&gt;Changes to Tank Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of changes to tank design that can be suggested, implemented either through modifications to existing vehicles or by including them in more comprehensive upgrade programmes. Unfortunately, some of these will prove impossible to implement even within the framework of the ongoing Challenger 3 upgrade, but these could still be made at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MBTs and heavy armoured forces require better ISTAR capabilities, both within and beyond line-of-sight. Beyond line-of-sight, one capability that should be integrated into heavy armoured forces is UAS reconnaissance to assist with tactical-level detection (although this point is force type-agnostic – light and medium forces equally require this capability). Within direct line-of-sight, “see-through armour” (a type of augmented reality) is promising, although literally transparent armour is far enough away from being practicable to be discounted for the moment). See-through armour involves mounting high-resolution cameras on the outside of the vehicle and using software to merge their feeds together to give the crew an expanded view that eliminates blind spots, allowing them to look in different directions more quickly than is possible with traditional sights and viewports. Given that kinetic strikes against the vehicle’s armour will quickly damage or destroy cameras, the existing series of armoured viewports and optics should not be eliminated, but see-through armour capability would still reduce the chances of MBTs being successfully ambushed or blundering into ATGM-armed dismounts without warning (both scenarios that can reduce the advantages normally held by heavy armoured forces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refining MBTs’ onboard optics and detection systems is another important avenue of improvement. Challenger 2 remains an impressive sensor platform, with both electro-optical and thermal optics able to identify targets beyond the effective range of direct fire anti-tank weapon systems if the crew actively scans the right arcs and areas. However, upgrading the range and fidelity of sensors and, more importantly, increasing their field of view is an obvious area for ongoing improvement, and one that private industry will continue to provide new commercial-off-the-shelf options for due to the wide applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detection systems operating outside of the visual light spectrum should also be considered, such as laser and radar warning receivers: it is already planned that Challenger 3 will be equipped with a laser warning receiver. As this type of system can only feed data to APS or provide immediate warning of an enemy contact, other forms of sensor may also prove useful in increasing situational awareness. Retro-reflective detectors, ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) radar and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are all options that would provide advance warning of surveillance – although these come with constraints: passive retro-reflective detection seems unlikely to be able to distinguish scopes and sensors from coincidental backscatter and reflections from other sources, particularly in urban environments, and so an active laser emitter would probably be necessary bar any unexpected technological breakthrough. GMTI and SAR systems, meanwhile, would be best mounted on an antenna and thus might only be deployable when static; these systems would therefore not give passive protection at all times, but would provide the capability to periodically scan for threats, and would require a tactical pause or short halt to do so. Note the risk of the radar emissions being detected must be factored in when considering such options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in turn raises questions about crew and commander workload and about the echelon level at which these systems could be integrated. While a retro-reflective detection scan produces near-instant results, outside of a headquarters setting GMTI data would require artificial intelligence (AI) support to even partially automate target classification – and even then the data would still require human analysis to filter out clutter and noise. These systems may therefore be inappropriate for platform-level integration. The commander of an unmodernised Challenger 2 already has a high cognitive burden when managing a tank crew and, in the case of sub-unit commanders, also has a troop or squadron to oversee. Maintaining situational awareness while closed down takes practice, given the limited fields of view and the fact that rotation of the turret where the commander is located is independent of the position and direction of travel of the hull – even before the designation of targets, issuing of other instructions, and communicating via radio inter- and intra-echelon are taken into consideration. In addition, space is at a premium in the turret given the battle management systems already in place. This situation is unlikely to change with the introduction of Challenger 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering the adoption of extra systems, one caveat is that there is limited space available in the current Challenger 2 turret for additional battle management and situational awareness equipment. In order to prevent intended improvements being counterproductive for the crew operating the platform, it would be much more preferable to undertake a wholesale overhaul of the interior ergonomics and a thorough integration of new capabilities with existing ones, rather than incrementally add systems in a piecemeal manner. It would be a mistake to add systems that require a significant level of management by tank commanders; such systems should instead be operated either by attached specialists or handled an echelon above, with data passed down, using AI support to ensure that the cognitive effect on the tank commander is beneficial rather than overwhelming. There are also serious questions about whether these technologies could be added to MBTs without increasing their weight to an impractical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to the proposition that future MBTs and heavy armoured vehicles should be lighter, John Stone argued this exact point when he noted that, although the US and the UK adopted manoeuvre warfare as the core of their warfighting doctrine in the 1980s, their MBT designs were still rooted in the 1970s in terms of size, amount of armour, and weight (60–70 tonnes). In Stone’s view, the logistics tail made necessary by this misalignment of concepts of operations and vehicle design amounted to a bloating that directly impeded the very operational tempo and mobility that the vehicles were supposed to enable. Whether Stone was correct or not, MBTs certainly cannot afford to get any heavier than they are now. Once a tank weighs above approximately 80 tonnes, the engineering and design choices required to overcome increasing ground pressure result in vehicles that are useful only for niche tasks or which are simply impractical. Even at 70 tonnes, problems abound. The Department of Defense (DoD) and US Army have in the past been at odds over whether tests indicated that weight increases had compromised the Abrams M1A2 SEPv3 MBT’s ability to cross standard bridging equipment, be carried by Heavy Equipment Transporter System (HETS), and be recovered in the event of damage or breakdown. Nor does Challenger 2 enjoy the same cross-country mobility as its smaller forerunner, the Centurion. The current balance between weight and equipment requirements may be the best balance possible given the threat environment, but seeking further protection may prove counterproductive and mobility issues should not be exacerbated, as mobility too is critical to survivability, allowing tank crews to better use ground and avoid slow movement or being forced into remaining static.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential benefits of moving to lighter vehicles, Russian design principles for MBTs, which might be characterised as being design-optimised for ease of manufacture and extreme mechanical simplicity, are probably best avoided. As Michael Kofman recently highlighted, Western platforms, particularly armoured vehicles, have proven significantly more survivable than Russian-designed and -manufactured equivalents. Despite a similar vulnerability to being mission-killed, crews are far more likely to survive and vehicles are more likely to be recoverable and repairable. This results in forces that can be organically reconstituted far more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, increased battlefield lethality might make it difficult to achieve improved survivability through passive or reactive protection. Technological developments in this area might offer some promise, but also involve limitations. For example, expectations of the benefits to be derived from countermeasures such as APS should be moderated. APS have a high power demand when they are active, and some vehicles cannot provide such power. Moreover APS, when active, also involve the use of radar guidance, generating an associated electromagnetic signature that in theory could assist enemy targeting. APS are also generally single-use or quickly expended, such that a moderate volume of incoming fire can overwhelm even an effective and reliable APS, leaving the vehicle in question reliant on its passive protection systems. APS technology may provide a layer of protection, but is no guarantee of survivability against a determined or well-armed enemy. They are most effective when heavy armoured forces can concentrate and quickly overwhelm an enemy, whether that enemy is equipped with heavy armour itself or is composed of lighter forces armed with anti-tank weapons. Improved ISTAR capabilities and situational awareness technologies, coupled with concepts of operations that prioritise counter-reconnaissance, may be the best way to ensure that the MBT remains a viable platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncrewed-ground-vehicles-ugvs&quot;&gt;Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final question is whether the role of the MBT can be performed by UGVs. Unfortunately for enthusiastic technologists, the answer is that the future MBT will not be able to operate uncrewed any time soon. A hypothetical head-to-head comparison with the MBT will serve to illustrate the shortcomings of UGVs. UGVs can be controlled remotely, or they can be autonomous. If they are controlled remotely, they rely on data links, which present a vector for attack – they can be hacked, or the signal can be disrupted. Alternatively, UGVs can be autonomous, but this presents its own problems – most importantly, the technology controlling the UGV’s autonomous performance must be mature and sophisticated enough for the vehicle to be useful. UGVs of both kinds will perform best if managed by human personnel nearby, and these personnel must be protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crewed MBTs do not suffer from any of these disadvantages. An armoured vehicle such as a modern MBT is extremely versatile: it can be employed with a great deal of precision, can operate independently for an extended period of time fulfilling a variety of different mission-sets, and can rapidly switch between these mission-sets, provided it has a well-trained and competent crew. For example, on a single patrol, an MBT crew could, if required, perform a variety of different combat missions with tactical flexibility, including patrolling, reconnaissance, attacking, and holding or defending ground. The crew can handle surrendered enemy combatants, provide limited on-the-spot humanitarian relief such as first aid or emergency supplies to civilians, and conduct maintenance on its vehicle, and do all of this independently in extremis. While an MBT and its crew are not optimised for many of these tasks, and might perform some of them poorly if unsupported or in an environment not conducive to them completing that task effectively, they could nevertheless turn their hand to different tasks as necessity dictated. This range of capabilities is a difficult standard for a UGV to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, situations where the UGV concept can complement the use of MBTs. For instance, in tanks where the crew operates the turret remotely from inside the hull (Remote Weapons Stations, RWS) some elements of UGV technology could be leveraged, making the vehicle less vulnerable to enemy fire when taking hull-down positions. Crewed vehicles also provide useful platforms for mounting the infrastructure required to supervise UGVs and for stationing their human operators (albeit accepting that MBTs themselves currently suffer from internal space limitations, meaning that command and control of UGVs would probably have to be performed from supporting vehicles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some overlap between MBTs and UGVs in terms of their technology and the purposes for which they are deployed – especially when crewed tanks are fitted with systems that have elements of automation, such as improved sensors and situational awareness, and the off-boarding of hard-kill and soft-kill countermeasures. In this context it seems highly likely that UGVs will play a complementary role within heavy armoured forces rather than have a realistic prospect of replacing MBTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A heavy armoured force remains the best option for high-intensity warfighting due to its combat power. While it exhibits vulnerabilities, so do all types of force structure, and facing a heavy armoured force compels an enemy to make difficult choices and places the burden of operational planning upon it if it hopes to be successful. Nevertheless, if the British Army were called on to engage in high-intensity warfighting without a significant number of MBTs, it would still be viable. A smaller, lighter, more autonomous force backed up by critical enablers in the form of ISTAR capabilities and indirect fires could maintain a high degree of lethality and pose difficult operational problems for any enemy force. However, the integration of many of these critical enablers must happen at battlegroup level and above, due to the limited capacity of company headquarters (even if assisted by advanced C2 tools that allow capabilities to be delegated) and due to the expense and inefficiency of distributing such capabilities evenly across small units. This analysis of the implications of using lighter forces raises questions about the ability of sub-units to perform offensive operations effectively due to a lack of combat power. Moreover, a warfighting capability built around a core medium armoured force would struggle to achieve its likely operational objectives were it to come up against a capable combined arms enemy force built around MBTs and heavy armour. While a medium or light force might be cheaper at a platform level, as well as more numerous and more distributed, ground combat units would suffer in the close fight, in both material and human terms. Medium armoured and light forces would be better seen as complementary to heavy armoured forces, with different formations able to cover one another’s weaknesses and augment one another’s capabilities when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army faces several challenges in maximising the utility of its current armoured forces. They have suffered years of underinvestment, the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010 having identified heavy armour as an area of low priority. Ambitions were set low, at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;preserving the ability to reconstitute our levels of military capability in areas which are currently low priority, such as heavy armour – tanks – should international circumstances change. This means both holding in reserve certain sorts of equipment not needed for current operations and – importantly – maintaining core levels of training and experience among our personnel. This would provide us with the potential for expansion in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has only recently begun to change amid decisions such as procuring Challenger 3 and Boxer, but many areas require investment. Consequently, there is a need to understand where resources and financial investment should be prioritised, since a complete, simultaneous overhaul of all the areas requiring modernisation is unrealistic. Critically, for heavy armour to be effective and survivable, the combined arms force as a whole needs to be able to conduct effective shaping of the battlespace to prevent saturation by enemy UAS and precision fires, and to be able to create sufficient uncertainty through deception that these enemy capabilities cannot target and attrit ground combat formations for decisive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring that heavy armoured units have sufficient track miles and collective field training to maintain expertise at armoured warfare is more important than any technological advance. The major determinants of whether heavy forces will prove viable given the pressures put on them will be training, skill, and, critically, motivation – that is, the human element, the moral component and the professionalism of the force, which will culminate in the continued ability to fight in a truly combined arms manner. However, beyond this, changes and adaptations are still required. At the sub-unit level, technological improvements can improve situational awareness and contribute to better tactical employment, but will have to be integrated in such a way as to not compromise the existing strengths of MBTs: off-boarding of capabilities on to support vehicles and UGVs may prove a fruitful avenue of adoption and experimentation. Future MBT designs would benefit from prioritising mechanical simplicity and repairability, and from prioritising the resilience of parts that cannot easily be repaired in the field. If weight reduction to improve mobility over difficult terrain is to be considered when modernising platforms, this should not extend to adopting Soviet design principles that trade away platform or crew survivability (although the British defence establishment is in any case unlikely to go down that route given the pattern of increasing vehicle weight and a healthy appreciation of their duty of care compared with the Russian Armed Forces). The Challenger 3 upgrade provides an opportunity to improve the design in line with at least some of the principles outlined in this paper. A critical enabler with regard to turning these recommendations into reality is an overhaul of MBTs’ interior ergonomics and the thorough integration of systems housed in the turret to ensure that crews benefit from technical improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MBTs and other heavy armoured vehicles at the core of combined arms formations remain important for both warfighting and other operations, as their unmatched combat power in the close fight helps ensure that a force can remain mobile when necessary. However, the balance must be shifted away from protection and towards a greater emphasis on mobility. This encompasses both strategic and operational mobility, since mobility contributes to survivability. The success of MBTs in the Gulf War set high cultural expectations regarding the survivability and offensive lethality of MBTs and heavy armoured forces organised, equipped, trained and employed as per the Western/NATO model of the time. These expectations need to be recalibrated, as individual tanks are increasingly vulnerable on the battlefield; nonetheless, well-trained, competently led and adequately equipped heavy armoured formations, supported by the correct enabling capabilities, are mobile, lethal and exceedingly difficult to counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical lessons about attrition in armoured warfare must also be relearned. Due to high maintenance requirements, crews may need to be rotated to prevent exhaustion and maintain a tempo of operations, and units may need to increase headcounts to ensure that some rotation is feasible. Heavy armoured forces need to get used to recovering and repairing damaged vehicles and replacing crew casualties as an inherent part of their operations. This also needs to be done in as dispersed a manner as possible in order to contend with an increasingly transparent battlefield and the threat of precision fires. It will be critical to maintain both recovery and repair units, as well as specialists, so that heavy armour can be quickly returned to its units after repair, with a particular emphasis on spare parts availability in the long term to ensure that vehicle losses do not translate into high rates of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crew expertise in maintenance (both preventative and curative) is essential to reduce the burden on forward repair facilities run by dedicated mechanical engineers, and will also reduce the facilities’ detectable signature, offering them greater protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these measures will need to go hand-in-hand with investments in track miles and training time: the traditional qualitative superiority of the human element can make the difference between a viable and non-viable armoured capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the traumatic attack it experienced on 7 October 2023, Israel completely changed its strategy for dealing with Hamas from containing and deterring the group to trying to destroy it. There are several scenarios for what might happen next. To determine how the present war is most likely to develop, it is essential to examine previous confrontations in the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it took over in Gaza in 2007, Hamas and other groups – mostly the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) – have engaged in a series of confrontations with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the two most significant of which were in 2008–2009 and in the summer of 2014. Other rounds of fighting were much smaller, such as those that occurred in November 2012, May 2021 and August 2022. Understanding the complexity and risks of the ongoing fighting in the Gaza Strip requires looking into the similarities and differences between previous confrontations and the current war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;victory-in-sight&quot;&gt;Victory in Sight?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel fought several high-intensity wars with Arab states between 1948 and 1982. Since 1982, the IDF has confronted only Arab non-state actors (NSAs). In Lebanon, it fought Hizbullah in the 1980s and 1990s, and again in a major war in 2006. Since then, the IDF has confronted Hamas and other smaller Palestinian groups like the PIJ in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The main confrontations have taken place in Gaza, all of them ending in a tie – much to Israel’s frustration. Although Hamas and the PIJ are elusive, flexible and capable of putting up a tough fight, the IDF is still much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During all of the previous confrontations, Israel hesitated on whether to try to destroy its foes due to various constraints and the negative implications of an all-out war in the Gaza Strip. Since destroying NSAs like Hamas is a tall order, Israel’s preferred method for containment and deterrence until now has been based on a strategy called ‘mowing the grass’. This meant that from time-to-time Israel had to degrade the military capabilities of its foes in the Gaza Strip by conducting a short and limited campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last confrontation before the current one, that of August 2022, was in a way different from other clashes in the Gaza Strip because Israel considered its outcome to be a victory. Yet in reality, it was a minimal success. On that occasion Israel confronted only the PIJ, which paid a price but still survived. Nevertheless, it seems that the results of that campaign boosted Israel’s confidence and, together with other steps it took to upgrade its defences around the Gaza Strip, convinced Israel that it was ready to deal with any hostilities that might break out on the border. Israel also assumed that Hamas would not seek war. On 7 October 2023, Israel paid dearly for its blunders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the attack of 7 October, Israel concluded that it must revise its national security strategy. Such a highly important process should be carried out in a careful manner by methodically examining all the options. Yet Israel decided to go immediately on the attack, launching massive aerial bombardments followed by a large-scale land offensive. This made sense politically given that Israel received sympathy and, more importantly, support for its actions from the US, the UK and other Western powers. Yet it might lose some or even most of this support as the war progresses due to heavy casualties among the Palestinian population and the vast scale of destruction in the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of the former rounds of fighting, Israel stuck to its policy of pursuing a limited campaign due to the constraints and negative ramifications of a war in the Gaza Strip. Now, Israel has drastically changed its policy, even though the constraints remain and some of them have even become more acute. Israel does not want to govern the Gaza Strip, but it cannot ignore the poor conditions there. In previous confrontations, it avoided toppling Hamas’s rule, leaving it to continue running the Gaza Strip. Hamas has, of course, done an awful job; instead of investing in improving Gazans’ standard of living, it has focused on preparing to confront Israel. This has meant that infrastructure and services for the Palestinian population have sharply deteriorated in recent years, up to a point where the Gaza Strip is on the verge of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as Hamas has been in charge there, this has mostly remained its problem, but now that the IDF has seized a large part of the Gaza Strip, it has also become Israel’s concern. The war, with all its destruction, will of course make the dire situation in Gaza much worse. Israel wants to take ‘overall security responsibility’ in the Gaza Strip, while hoping that others will handle civilian affairs there. It would ideally like another government to do this, but no state – not even any of Israel’s Arab neighbours – is willing to deal with the giant mess in the Gaza Strip. The most reasonable choice seems to be the Palestinian Authority (PA); yet in previous confrontations, Israel assumed that the PA would not be up to the task if it were to bring down Hamas’s regime. There is now even less chance of this because in recent years the PA has become weaker, making it less likely that it could go back to controlling the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thousands of young men in the Gaza Strip who will struggle to find a job in the present circumstances may agree to fight for Hamas for lack of a better choice&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor that has worsened in the last year is Israel’s internal stability, following a wave of protests against the government. While these have subsided since the war broke out, they could well erupt again later on. The current war in the Gaza Strip may also contribute to domestic instability, depending on its outcome – and a crisis inside Israel could make it harder to solve the huge problems in the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, the group has had several confrontations with Israel. The two main ones were in the winter of 2008–2009, lasting 22 days, and in the summer of 2014, lasting for 50 days. Other campaigns included the one in May 2021, which went on for 12 days, and the one in August 2022, which lasted only three days. The current war might go on for several months. Israel has to be ready for this, on several levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas’s leaders are ‘high on Israel’s target list’. On previous occasions, such as in 2004 and 2012, Israel has assassinated some of Hamas’s top leaders – yet the group not only survived those blows, but got stronger. Therefore, decapitating Hamas’s leadership now is unlikely to annihilate the group. It could even be counterproductive, because the new leaders might be more capable of fighting Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF is also killing Hamas’s combatants, including senior figures like brigade and battalion commanders, in an effort to disrupt the group’s command and control. In the last major confrontation in the Gaza Strip in 2014, Hamas lost up to 1,000 combatants. During the present war it is absorbing many more casualties, but it could yet obtain new recruits. Iran will give Hamas money for this purpose, and thousands of young men in the Gaza Strip who will struggle to find a job in the present circumstances may agree to fight for Hamas for lack of a better choice. Others will doubtless join Hamas to avenge family members or friends lost during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-factors&quot;&gt;Military Factors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors made past confrontations easier for Israel, some of which are also relevant in the present conflict. The IDF has clear superiority over its foes in the Gaza Strip, enjoying major advantages in terms of firepower, manpower and technology. Yet it still has a tough task if it wishes to defeat Hamas, let alone destroy the group. This will be difficult because in previous confrontations in the Gaza Strip, the IDF was often able to exploit an element of surprise. The best-known example was at the start of the confrontation in December 2008, when the IDF launched an air raid that inflicted heavy casualties on Hamas. By contrast, on 7 October 2023, the IDF was taken completely by surprise, putting it in a state of shock and hindering its response. Although it subsequently recovered, its counterattack was obviously expected by Hamas, which was able to prepare accordingly. In this sense, the IDF will need to wait for a better opportunity if it wants to catch Hamas off-guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous confrontations, the IDF was able to concentrate its efforts, such as deploying its best units on one front – that is, in the Gaza Strip. Now, however, the IDF has to secure its northern border with Lebanon and deal with clashes in the West Bank, even if the level of friction on those fronts is quite low. As long as there is no escalation in Lebanon, the IDF can focus its attention on the Gaza Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas and the PIJ have fired more than 9,000 rockets and missiles since the start of the current war. In previous confrontations they have fired fewer, but on this occasion the rockets and missiles are not the main threat to Israel. While they can still cause harm, almost all the Israeli losses from the present conflict resulted from the ground invasion into Israel on 7 October. The firing of missiles and rockets is mostly an act of defiance and terror, forcing Israeli civilians to run for cover. Many in Israel do not have proper shelters, although they do receive an alert – a process that has improved over the years. Israel’s famous air defence system, the Iron Dome, has once again proved to be very effective. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is trying to suppress the firing of rockets as it has done in previous rounds of fighting, with ground forces now also participating in this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trying to defeat Hamas by assassinating its leadership and killing as many of its combatants as possible might not work&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the confrontation in 2008–2009, the IDF cut the Gaza Strip in half. It has done the same in the current war, but the present Israeli operation has reached deeper inside the Strip, exposing the IDF’s lines of communication to ambushes. Still, it has taken this risk as part of a strategy to encircle and isolate Hamas’s positions. This large-scale manoeuvre has had an impact on Hamas and its performance. The group might lose control of the Gaza Strip, although it may yet avoid collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF avoided a major land offensive in previous rounds of fighting because of the fear of losses. Israel as a country is very sensitive to casualties, yet following the horrible events of 7 October, it is more willing to pay the price. The IDF is also striving to avoid harming the Arab population for moral and political reasons. In the current war, the fighting is more large-scale and intense, so unfortunately there is more collateral damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF recently called up over 350,000 reserves, mostly from the ground forces. This is Much more than in former confrontations, and serves to indicate how this war is different. Many of Israel’s reserves have not trained much if at all in recent years. The IDF is trying to fix this now by conducting exercises, but returning soldiers to top form takes time. There are also difficulties in providing enough equipment, such as body armour, for so many troops. This is hardly a surprise because before the war the IDF had based its level of build-up on recent confrontations in the Gaza Strip, assuming there would be more of the same. The strategy was to depend on the IAF and intelligence rather than on massed ground units. According to this concept, budgets were allocated to other areas at the expense of providing training, equipment and so on to a large part of the ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem for the IDF is that the last time it fought an urban conflict in the Gaza Strip was in 2014. Since then, the IDF has conducted several operations in Gaza but without using ground forces, let alone penetrating the Strip by land. This lack of combat experience might have affected current operations, including their cost to the IDF. Nevertheless, the motivation of Israeli troops is high because they are convinced this war was forced on Israel and they want to make sure Hamas will not be able to conduct an attack like that of 7 October ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, Israel has engaged in several rounds of fighting in the Gaza Strip with Hamas and the PIJ. Analysing these previous confrontations is crucial to understanding the current war. Almost all of the clashes that occurred from 2008 to 2022 ended in a tie, and some in Israel even saw them as a failure. Israel considered the last confrontation it had there, in August 2022, to be a success, which may have boosted its confidence too much. Now, following the terrible events of 7 October, Israel has drastically changed its strategy from containment to annihilating Hamas, but this is a tall order. The current war is costlier and longer than any previous confrontations. Trying to defeat Hamas by assassinating its leadership and killing as many of its combatants as possible might not work. Israel has to have realistic goals to begin with. It can inflict on Hamas the biggest blow it has ever suffered and topple its rule of the Gaza Strip. Yet, as in previous confrontations, Hamas as a movement might manage to hold on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF failed on 7 October 2023 in terms of its intelligence and readiness. Yet it has managed to recover and enjoys similar advantages to previous rounds of fighting, such as superiority in both firepower and technology. There is also high motivation among its troops, and the Iron Dome is proving itself once again. For the time being, the IDF can concentrate on one front, as in previous confrontations, although this might change. Unlike in the confrontation of 2008, however, the IDF does not enjoy the element of surprise. Other aspects unique to this confrontation include the mass mobilisation of reserves, with some troops not being well trained or equipped. A lack of combat experience in urban warfare is another challenge for the IDF, having relied on the IAF in former confrontations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is some similarity between the current war and previous confrontations, but there are also major differences. Israel must be aware of these in order to avoid crucial mistakes as it becomes more and more committed to this showdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 5 December, Qatar hosted the annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the regional grouping that includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Inevitably, Israel’s ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza topped the agenda of the discussions between Gulf leaders, which were also attended by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message from the summit was straightforward and unsurprising. The six Gulf monarchies called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities and Israeli military operations”, demanded “the release of civilian hostages and detainees”, and backed efforts to “revive the peace process in the Middle East” and “the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital” .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the various agreements to adopt joint positions and work together – in areas going far beyond the war in Gaza, from efforts to remove trade barriers and collaborate on tourism, to shared commitments to investing in oil and gas as well as renewable energy – recorded in the lengthy 122-article final statement, the summit ultimately appeared to be intended to signal one thing above all: Gulf unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pragmatic-gulf-unity&quot;&gt;Pragmatic Gulf Unity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, with the Middle East in the midst of a crisis defined by the long-standing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, it is perhaps easy to forget that until just three years ago, a deep fracture between the Gulf Arab states – specifically between Qatar (backed by Turkey) on one side, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE on the other – was one of the defining features of regional instability. Today, things are different. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have become particularly close over the past year or two. Differences and intra-Gulf competition still persist, perhaps especially between Saudi Arabia and the UAE these days, but the overall mood is one of pragmatic alignment – certainly vis-à-vis the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has clearly assumed the mantle of regional leadership. It hosted an extraordinary Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh in November, notably with the attendance of Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi; and Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud has led a group of his counterparts from across the region on an international tour with stops in Beijing, Moscow and London, among others. Qatar has led mediation efforts with Hamas to facilitate the release of hostages, which resulted, for example, in the seven-day truce at the end of November. The UAE – which has the closest ties with Israel of all Gulf states – has remained quieter thus far, but it appears poised to play a key role whenever there is eventually a more permanent ceasefire in Gaza, precisely because it is probably the Arab country Israel trusts the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Riyadh, Doha and Abu Dhabi have thus far worked together and vocally endorsed each other’s efforts. They have looked to leverage their different relationships with the Israelis and Palestinians, as well as across the region, rather than to compete with one another. The eventual question of helping to establish and strengthen a future Palestinian leadership could well bring intra-Gulf competition back to the fore, but for the moment at least, the three monarchies are clearly aligned in their view of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar are in very similar positions and share very similar interests with regard to the current crisis&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three were clearly horrified by Hamas’s 7 October attack. Saudi Arabia and especially the UAE have long been critical of, and even hostile towards, Hamas. Qatar has a different relationship with the group, hosting its political office in Doha in coordination with the US and the Israeli government, but it clearly also did not support the attack. However, what Israel has done since 7 October has, form the perspective of Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha – and the wider region, for that matter – gone far beyond exercising a legitimate right to self-defence. In their view, Israel’s operation to go after Hamas has become a brutal all-out assault on the Palestinian people. The attempt by US President Joe Biden to equate Russia and Hamas as evil aggressors and Israel and Ukraine as victims worthy of support does not resonate in the Gulf (or indeed anywhere in the Arab world). Rather, if there is any relation between the wars in Ukraine and Gaza from the Arab perspective, it is between Ukrainian civilians and the Palestinian people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ongoing-quest-for-stability&quot;&gt;The Ongoing Quest for Stability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar are in very similar positions and share very similar interests with regard to the current crisis. While the war is taking up a lot of their bandwidth, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha are united in their determination to maintain the overall strategic course they were on before 7 October. All three are pursuing highly ambitious domestic agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Saudi Arabia, Vision 2030 – a root-and-branch transformation of the Kingdom – is the all-important North Star for all decision-making, including on foreign policy. The UAE wants to consolidate its position as the most dynamic regional power and a hub for global affairs; its hosting of the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference COP28 is illustrative of this. Qatar, meanwhile, is looking to build on the success of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, including by expanding its gas production capacity to solidify its status as the world’s most important exporter of liquified natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical to all of these ambitions is the maintenance of a modicum of stability in the wider region. In many ways, the war in Gaza erupted just as Gulf leaders felt like their regional strategy to de-escalate and reduce tensions wherever possible was working. Not only had they buried the hatchet of their intra-Gulf dispute, but they had also managed to steer their relations with Iran into calmer waters. In fact, in the effort to contain the war at least geographically, the new channel of communication between Riyadh and Tehran has undoubtedly been crucially important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar remain worried about the violence in Gaza stoking regional instability, even if the spectre of a wider regional war can be kept at bay. While they are confident that they can manage popular anger about Israel’s conduct in Gaza at home, they are aware that their counterparts in Egypt and Jordan – two countries whose stability they regard as pivotal for the region – might have a harder time doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Gulf states have seen the US’s strong support for Israel as another sign that Washington’s strategy in the Middle East is out of step with the regional mood&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, even if Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha are feeling more confident about their ability to manage tensions with Tehran, they nevertheless see – and have always seen – a great risk in Iran’s ability to use the Palestinian cause and its claim to leadership of the resistance against Israel to shore up its regional position. The attacks on commercial ships supposedly linked to Israel by the Yemeni Houthis – one of Iran’s partners in the region – obviously worry Saudi Arabia, for example. For now, these activities are not directed at the Kingdom, but with the Red Sea central to Riyadh’s economic development plans, they clearly represent a long-term threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf states are therefore likely to continue to emphasise the need for pragmatism and de-escalation. They will try to protect the gains they have made in their relations with Iran, even if this proves to be an uphill battle. Similarly, they are unlikely to fundamentally change their approach towards Israel. The UAE has made it clear that it has no desire to give up what has been from its perspective a tremendously beneficial expanding relationship with Israel since the conclusion of the Abraham Accords in 2020. Saudi-Israeli normalisation may have become a more distant prospect due to the war, but it remains on the horizon. The strategic drivers behind normalisation, ranging from shared security interests vis-à-vis Iran to the promise of lucrative economic opportunities, remain unchanged. Even Qatar will continue to maintain its pragmatic arms-length relationship with Israel, not least because it is precisely its ability to talk to the Israeli government and security services, as well as to Hamas, that makes it such a valuable mediator and interlocutor, both in the current crisis and likely in the future too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their relations beyond the region, the Gulf states are also trying to stay the course. The war has re-emphasised the centrality of the US to regional security, as impressively illustrated by the extensive ramping-up of the US military presence in the immediate aftermath of the 7 October attack. At the same time, however, the Gulf states have also seen the US’s strong – and in their view uncritical – support for Israel as another sign that Washington’s strategy in the Middle East is out of step with the regional mood and their own priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have therefore continued to express their conviction that the world – and the region with it – is moving towards a multipolar order, and have done what they can to make this a reality. This has included the Saudi-led foreign ministers delegation’s demonstrative choice to make Beijing the first stop of their tour to build international consensus around a call for a ceasefire in Gaza, regardless of the fact that China has shown very little ability or willingness to make any meaningful efforts to resolve the crisis. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visits to the UAE and Saudi Arabia also fit into this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, it is very clear that the war in Gaza has made life harder for the Gulf Arab states. Leaders in Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Doha want to focus on developing their countries and claiming their places on the global stage, and they are determined not to let either the volatility of the region they happen to find themselves in or the unstable global environment prevent them from doing so. In this context, the war in Gaza is a setback, but not one that changes the overall strategic calculus in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two decades leading up to Russia’s February 2022 invasion, Ukraine had become a major producer and exporter of numerous agricultural commodities. In the 2020–2021 harvest season — the last season unaffected by Russia’s full-scale invasion — Ukraine was the fifth-largest exporter of wheat, honey, and walnuts worldwide; the third-largest exporter of maize, barley, and rapeseed; and the world’s top exporter of sunflower oil, sunflower meal, and millet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to Russia’s intentional attacks on all aspects of Ukraine’s agriculture sector, and collateral damage from hostilities, Ukraine’s production and exports are diminished today from prewar levels. As of June 2023, the Kyiv School of Economics estimated that Ukraine’s agriculture sector had incurred $8.7 billion in direct damages to agricultural machinery, equipment, and storage facilities, as well as from stolen or damaged agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and seeds, and outputs, such as crops and livestock. The sector’s $40.3 billion losses represent farmers’ diminished incomes due to foregone production, lower selling prices for products, and higher operational costs across all stages of the agri-food value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment, published in February 2023 by the World Bank in partnership with Kyiv School of Economics, the Ukrainian government, the European Union, and the United Nations, provides the most thorough evaluation of the war’s consequences for Ukraine and the investments required to ensure its future prosperity. However, the continuous and comprehensive nature of Russia’s assault complicates any estimate of damage and needs. Following the report’s publication, further losses and damages resulted from Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2023 and its immediate intensification of attacks on agricultural export infrastructure along Ukraine’s Black Sea and Danube River coasts. Between July and October, 17 separate attacks on Ukraine’s ports, grain facilities, and civilian ships destroyed 300,000 metric tons of grain and further reduced the country’s export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This destruction has resulted in a further downward spiral in Ukraine’s agricultural economy. Limited export routes have raised transportation costs and reduced the volume of goods farmers can sell, decreasing farmers’ incomes and eliminating profitability. While incomes have fallen, the costs of agricultural inputs have risen, and damage to farms and equipment imposes additional, heavy costs on farmers. As a result, many farmers are curtailing their activities and reducing the size of their harvests. And despite the Ukrainian government’s efforts to insulate agricultural workers from the draft, active war has drawn farmers to the battlefield, reducing the size of Ukraine’s agricultural labor force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In aggregate, this has significantly decreased Ukraine’s agricultural production and exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/czTj1Z5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, in 2022, Ukraine managed to remain among the world’s top producers and exporters of corn, wheat, sunflower oil and seeds, and soybeans, due to the determination of Ukraine’s agricultural labor force, the commitment of Ukraine’s government, and support from numerous other partners, including governments, multilateral organizations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and research institutes. According to Kyiv School of Economics president Tymofiy Milovanov, efforts to rebuild Ukraine’s agricultural sector should continue even as conflict continues because it is unlikely there will be a “clear end to the war.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky established the National Council for the Recovery of Ukraine from the War just two months after the full-scale invasion began, and the council continues to develop the Ukraine Recovery Plan in partnership with Ukrainian civil society institutions, partner governments, and international organizations and companies. The overarching goal of this work is not just to reconstruct Ukraine, but to build on the country’s reforms in recent years and transform Ukraine’s economy for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of investing in Ukraine’s agricultural sector is threefold: to bolster Ukraine’s economy in wartime, to restore its capacity as a major global food supplier, and to strengthen its position as a bulwark to Russia’s influence through its own agricultural exports. Rebuilding and transforming Ukraine’s agriculture sector will require coordinated investments in its soil, labor force, agricultural institutions, and infrastructure. Adequate and low-cost routes must be secured for Ukraine’s agricultural exports; damaged farm, storage, transportation, and port infrastructure must be rebuilt; destroyed and stolen equipment and goods must be replaced; farmlands must be demined, tested, and restored; farmers’ access to seeds, fertilizers and other agricultural inputs much be secured; and farmers’ needs for additional financing and training to continue agricultural activity must be met. Investments to address immediate needs and obstacles are ongoing, but even more immense challenges will require international attention in the coming decades, including demining waterways, namely the Black and Azov Seas, modernizing the country’s irrigation infrastructure, and addressing the repercussions of the Kakhovka dam collapse on surrounding ecosystems and agricultural livelihoods. This work will take place in the context of Ukraine’s 2024 farmland market reform and the country’s candidacy for membership in the European Union, which will necessitate further reforms to Ukraine’s agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper focuses on two aspects of Ukraine’s agricultural reconstruction that are crucial to supporting transformation throughout the sector: demining Ukraine’s farmland and improving access to fertilizers in Ukraine. The information and insights included herein are the result of CSIS research, with input from numerous experts in Ukraine, Europe, and the United States. Information and policy recommendations regarding rebuilding other aspects of Ukraine’s agriculture sector can be found in other CSIS publications and will be the focus of future scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demining&quot;&gt;Demining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-scale-and-nature-of-landmine-use&quot;&gt;The Scale and Nature of Landmine Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, a significant proportion of combat has been waged across farmland in Ukraine’s rural areas, compromising Ukraine’s agricultural economy. The nature of the war’s impacts on Ukraine’s farmland varies by locale. War-related damage to Ukraine’s farmland includes craters and other physical destruction from munitions attacks; possible chemical contamination from munitions, fuel spills, shell remnants, and human remains; and depressions from armed vehicle tracks. According to the commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, Russian troops were firing between 40,000 and 60,000 shells at Ukrainian positions every day as of August 2022. Up to 20 percent of ammunition fired does not detonate, and Russian troops regularly place landmines in fields and forests. Among threats to Ukraine’s farmland, unexploded ordnance and the extensive placement of landmines remain widespread concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Reuters investigation into landmine use in Ukraine revealed “landmine contamination so vast it is most likely unprecedented in the 21st century,” with emplaced landmines numbering in the hundreds of thousands. By mid-2023, Ukraine had become the most mined country in the world, surpassing Afghanistan, Syria, Cambodia, and other countries in which landmines are a common feature of warfare. According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, about 30 percent of Ukraine’s lands, or approximately 174,000 square kilometers (67,000 square miles), has been exposed to conflict and will require surveying and, if necessary, demining. According to Interfax, a further 13,500 square kilometers (over 5,200 square miles) of the Black Sea, Azov Sea, and Ukraine’s rivers and other inland bodies of water are potentially contaminated with landmines. Likewise, according to Human Rights Watch, the scale of landmine use in Ukraine has resulted in a “large, dispersed, and complex level of contamination that will threaten Ukrainian civilians and hinder recovery efforts for years to come.” One deminer (or “sapper”) is able to clear between 15 and 25 square meters per day, and given the current rate of progress, some estimate that complete demining of Ukrainian territory could take decades or even centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antipersonnel mines and anti-vehicle mines have been used in the ongoing war, with at least 13 types of mines identified in Ukraine to date, according to Human Rights Watch, which are located in at least 11 regions across central and eastern Ukraine (see [map]). The preponderance of landmines in Ukraine have been emplaced by Russia, which is not a signatory to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Mine Ban Treaty). Human Rights Watch has even identified in Ukraine several previously unseen Russian landmines produced as late as 2021, including antipersonnel mines. Though Ukraine is a signatory to the Mine Ban Treaty, Ukraine has used antipersonnel mines in at least one location since Russia’s invasion, according to Human Rights Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Landmines used in the war have been hand-emplaced, mechanically laid, scattered by truck-mounted projectors, and delivered by rocket. They include small, plastic-cased PFM-1 antipersonnel mines, which can be easily mistaken for harmless objects and overlooked by metal detectors; POM-3 anti-personnel mines, which can be scattered by air and detonated with mere vibrations, such as nearby footsteps; metal- and plastic-encased anti-vehicle mines, which can be buried in shallow holes and penetrate vehicles’ under-armor upon detonation; and PARM anti-vehicle mines, which can be placed above ground and fire a projectile into their target. Russian forces are also employing “Zemledelie” systems, which can remotely lay mines in areas as large as several football fields in short periods of time, creating minefields of varying complexities across Ukraine. The “Zemledelie” system, Russian for “agriculture,” was developed by the Russian company Rostec and was first observed in use in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the extent of Russia’s mine placements and the use of mining technology innovations within Ukraine have resulted in mine contamination of enormous complexity, scale, and lethality. As of September 2023, 246 civilians (including 13 children) had been killed by explosive devices, and 521 civilians (including 53 children) had been injured across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bGsCnWd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukrainian-government-efforts&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Government Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the war continues, the Ukrainian government’s assistance for demining efforts continues to evolve. The Ukrainian government was already supporting demining efforts in Ukraine when Russia invaded in February 2022; previously occupied areas of Luhansk and Donetsk had been subject to demining efforts since 2015, following Russia’s 2014 invasion. In November 2021, the Ukrainian government announced the creation of the National Mine Action Authority, an interagency group led by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence that is responsible for the development of national policy and plans for demining as well as coordination of all actors involved in demining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among Ukraine’s mined territory is a significant proportion of Ukraine’s farmland. The precise proportion of Ukraine’s farmland that has been contaminated by landmines is impossible to determine while hostilities continue. Estimates of Ukraine’s farmland exposed to landmines range from 470,000 hectares (or 1,814 square miles), according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, to 2.5 million hectares (or 9,652 square miles), according to Ukraine’s first deputy minister of agrarian policy and food. GLOBSEC estimates that 5 million hectares (or 19,305 square miles, approximately 15.2 percent) of Ukraine’s farmland are unsuitable for use due to landmines, contamination with explosive ordnance, and exposure to armed hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence announced the creation of an Action Plan for Demining Agricultural Land to facilitate spring sowing and fall harvesting of crops in 2023 and after. The Ministry of Defence is responsible for ensuring implementation of the plan and coordination among Ukrainian and international partners. To expedite humanitarian demining nationwide, the Ukrainian government announced the formation of the Interagency Working Group on Humanitarian Demining in June 2023, chaired by the Ministry of Economy, and the working group held its first meeting in September 2023, emphasizing the importance of creating a mine action strategy for Ukraine. Later in September 2023, Ukrainian prime minister Denis Shmyhal convened the first Demine Ukraine Forum among Ukrainian government representatives and international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humanitarian-demining&quot;&gt;Humanitarian Demining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate purpose of mine removal dictates the level of investment — of time and funding — in demining efforts. Swiftly clearing an area of mines in the course of combat or immediately thereafter is called military, combat, or operational demining. Operational demining is conducted by special military units or other emergency services and is intended to clear a path for the safe advance or retreat of troops. Though it may quickly return access to roads, residential buildings, or other areas of common use, it does not necessarily guarantee the safety of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanitarian demining, by contrast, aims to “clear land so that civilians can return to their homes and their everyday routines without the threat of explosive hazards,” according to the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS). Humanitarian demining involves numerous, resource-intensive steps, all of which are required to guarantee that an area has been thoroughly searched and cleared of explosives and is safe for use. Steps required for humanitarian demining include a non-technical survey of land, involving interviewing communities and reviewing records of conflicts; a technical survey, involving the use of equipment or animals to determine the boundaries of minefields; mine removal, most commonly through mine detonation; and certification that mine removal is complete and land is safe for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, humanitarian demining in Ukraine is presently carried out by 18 certified mine action operator organizations, including NGOs (e.g., the Danish Refugee Council, HALO Trust, the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action, the Norwegian People’s Aid, and DanChurchAid), companies (e.g., Demining Solutions, GK Group, and TetraTech), and Ukrainian entities (e.g., the Ukrainian Sappers Association, Ukrspecexport, and Ukroboronservice). Entities that wish to contribute to Ukraine’s demining efforts must complete a complex certification procedure before working as demining operators in Ukraine. In recognition of the need to expedite and streamline the certification process for demining operators, the State Emergency Service’s Interregional Center for Humanitarian Demining launched an online portal for interested organizations to apply for certification and keep apprised of the application’s status. After obtaining certification to demine its own farmland across Ukraine, the Ukrainian company Nibulon has recognized the use of its expertise across Ukraine’s farmland broadly and will offer its services to farmers and to the state. As of September 2023, 30 additional organizations are awaiting certification, including 18 governmental operators from Ukraine’s State Emergency Service, State Transport Special Service, and armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the Ukrainian government does not fund humanitarian demining services, so most farmers must pay for demining services themselves. At the Demine Ukraine Forum, Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko noted that Ukraine’s 2024 budget would include UAH 2.0 billion ($54.7 million) to partially compensate farmers for demining services. Minister Svyrydenko also announced the establishment of the Prozorro demining market, through which farmers are expected to select certified deminers. The Ukrainian government will compensate farmers for half the cost of demining through the Prozorro system, and the Ukrainian government is considering the best way to compensate farmers for demining costs borne before 2024. Ukraine’s state bank, “Ukragasbank,” has also launched a soft lending program to fund the demining of farmland within the framework of the “Affordable Loans at 5-7-9 percent” program, improving farmers’ access to demining financing and incentivizing farmers’ use of legal, certified demining operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;progress-demining-ukraines-agricultural-land&quot;&gt;Progress Demining Ukraine’s Agricultural Land&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Ministry of Defence’s Action Plan for Demining Agricultural Land, the Ukrainian government specified 470,000 hectares of agricultural land in nine regions of Ukraine that would need to be surveyed and, if necessary, demined. These regions are where “the problem of contamination is most urgent and the clearing of agricultural land is most feasible,” according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence. In addition to the National Mine Action Authority, coordinated by the Ministry of Defence, Ukraine’s Interagency Working Group on Humanitarian Demining, coordinated by the Ministry of Economy, also supports humanitarian demining across Ukraine. In a press release from the Ministry of Economy in June 2023, the Ukrainian government noted that the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food would update the identification of territories that would need to be demined. According to the Ministry of Economy, 100,000 of the 470,000 hectares specified in the action plan had been cleared by June, and by the end of 2023, up to 165,000 hectares of land could be cleared for agricultural use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government has continued to publicize progress under the action plan. By September 2023, the Ukrainian government had surveyed 188,600 hectares of agricultural land under the plan, of which over 124,000 hectares will require clearance, including through humanitarian demining. By October 2023, the Ukrainian government had surveyed more than 225,000 hectares of agricultural land identified in the action plan and had returned 170,000 hectares to economic use. In addition to these periodic updates, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine publishes daily updates regarding its progress demining Ukrainian territories through a portal that is only accessible within Ukraine. Between the beginning of the invasion and November 14, 2023, 454,827 explosive objects and 2,892 kilograms of explosive substance have been defused, including 3,124 aerial bombs. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence has also partnered with the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining to maintain an interactive map of mine contamination across Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-needs-and-international-support&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Needs and International Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent progress, the demining needs of the Ukrainian government remain staggering. As of February 2023, the cost of clearance of explosive ordnance across Ukraine was estimated at $37.6 billion, according to the Ukraine Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment produced by the Kyiv School of Economics, the World Bank, the Ukrainian government, the European Union, and the United Nations. This estimate represents the significant investments needed in equipment, training, and salaries, including to expand the strategic planning and operational capacities of Ukraine’s demining forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous countries, multilateral organizations, and NGOs have provided financial and other support for demining in Ukraine, including for the demining of agricultural land. In June 2023, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) announced a joint plan to clear landmines and other explosive remnants of war from agricultural land, in collaboration with the Fondation Suisse de Déminage and with support from the UN Ukraine Humanitarian Fund and private donors. In July 2023, the Ukrainian government announced that numerous partners — including the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Denmark, Canada, Austria, Switzerland, South Korea, and the Howard Buffett Foundation — together had pledged $244 million for humanitarian demining clearance. In July 2023, South Korea pledged to provide demining equipment to Ukraine, and Japan has similarly offered technical assistance in 2023. In September 2023, the U.S. Department of State announced $90.5 million in humanitarian demining assistance to Ukraine, in addition to the $47.6 million the State Department had announced in September 2022 for a similar purpose. Croatia hosted the first International Donors’ Conference on Humanitarian Demining in Ukraine in October 2023, attracting representatives from more than 40 countries, and Switzerland, which announced over €100 million (approximately $107 million) for humanitarian demining in Ukraine in October 2023, will host the Second International Donors’ Conference on Humanitarian Demining in Ukraine in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-reality-for-farmers&quot;&gt;The Reality for Farmers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Tmi3T4H.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A farmer and a member of a demining team of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine carry an unexploded missile near the village of Hryhorivka, Zaporizhzhia region, on May 5, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the Ukrainian government’s recent progress on its Action Plan for Demining Agricultural Land and considerable support from international partners, many farmers face difficulties accessing humanitarian demining services. One licensed company, for example, is reported to have offered demining services to farmers for $200 per acre of farmland. Because the war has reduced harvests and incomes, and increased the costs of inputs, most farmers are unable to afford such prices. Furthermore, Ukraine’s byzantine bureaucracy can lead to long wait times for demining services. Duplication of services across ministries and the constant evolution of priorities and plans can lead to bottlenecks, which the Ukrainian government admits and is seeking to redress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, some farmers are resorting to conducting demining activities themselves. As one farmer reported to Foreign Policy, “At first we waited for the state to demine our fields. Then we understood it wouldn’t happen, so we decided to do it ourselves.” Three of this farmer’s employees scanned his farmland with handheld metal detectors, marking potential mines with flags. Another farmer operates a remote-controlled tractor, outfitted with panels stripped from Russian tanks, to scan his fields for landmines. One farmer in Kharkhiv explained the situation to local Ukrainian media (authors’ translation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Out of 3,000 hectares, I have 1,000 hectares mined. I left the application for demining immediately after the de-occupation. The emergency department says that they will not clear the mines in the near future because they do not have time. We are now communicating with the neighboring farms to clear the fields [ourselves]. The situation with the neighbors is still worse, all their lands are “seeded” with explosives. We will look for a way out on our own, because today it is cheaper to buy a field than to demine it. We are considering the possibility of buying a drone that looks for mines or renting a special car. Otherwise, life will not return to our villages. . . . I need to clear the fields and sow crops this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, many farmers opt to use the services of uncertified or “dark deminers,” who charge prices lower than certified deminers but who cannot guarantee that land they survey is clear of mines and safe for use. Among farmers who use dark demining services, accidents are reportedly common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And among farmers in regions exposed to conflict, not only the presence but the fear of landmines can keep farmers from working their land, according to CSIS interviews. Kyiv School of Economics president Timofiy Milovanov characterized the current situation as two systems of demining at tension within Ukraine: the “legacy” system, whose adherence to international mine action standards renders it slow and expensive but best able to guarantee the safe clearance of lands, and the alternative system made up of Ukrainians that “have to work . . . [and] protect their children,” who “innovate right now, whether it’s certified or not.” Such demining “innovations” are borne from farmers’ need to continue agricultural activity for their livelihoods, but the risks of uncertified demining are severe. A farmer in Kherson who opted against planting in the face of mine contamination told Reuters, “I have no moral right to send workers to fields as it is dangerous for life.” CSIS interviews revealed the same tension between these two systems, with some Ukrainian entities advocating for equipping farmers with demining machines to expediate the process, and others insisting that farmers are not professional deminers and their participation in the process would risk lives and complicate the government’s coordination and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that while overall production and export levels have fallen since Russia’s invasion, agricultural yields per acre have risen compared to last season for Ukraine’s major commodities, although the USDA estimates include crop production in Crimea and occupied territories, where Russia reaps the benefits of favorable harvests. For wheat, for example, yields are estimated at a 4.5 tons per hectare, up 17 percent from 2022 and 13 percent from the five-year average. This suggests that production losses are due primarily to reduced planting: the USDA estimates that harvested area has fallen 26 percent from the five-year average. In fact, farmland exposed to hostilities since February 2022 has left an impact visible from space, according to NASA’s Harvest program, which estimates that up to 2.8 million hectares (or over 10,800 square miles) of Ukraine’s agricultural land have been abandoned as a result of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unique-considerations-for-agricultural-land&quot;&gt;Unique Considerations for Agricultural Land&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence, or even the fear, of landmines on agricultural land has affected farmers’ harvests across Ukraine. At the same time, the process of demining farmland could also depress agricultural yields, as some farmers may experience long-term impacts once their land has been demined. A report from the NGO Mine Action Review, with funding from the Norwegian, Canadian, and Swiss governments, details the numerous destructive effects of demining on soil. The most common machinery employed in demining is equipped with flails, tillers, and rollers, which can disrupt soil structure, accelerate soil erosion, and disrupt water, carbon, and nutrient cycles. While the most expedient and safest method of landmine disposal is through remote detonation, detonation generates a crater that displaces topsoil while compacting subsoil into the crater. Finally, the detonation of landmines can release toxic pollutants into soils and waterways, including from explosive substances as well as the breakdown of other munitions components. In Cambodia, for example, researchers found that the content of heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, and copper increased by 30 percent in soil in a 1-meter radius of the detonation point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitigation measures for such effects of landmine detonation are unclear, and data on the environmental impacts of landmine detonation are limited. The extent to which the detonation of landmines could affect soil fertility and water quality in heavily mined territories has not been widely examined or reported. Only one international covenant, the International Mine Actions Standard 07.13, addresses the impacts of demining on agricultural land, stating that national authorities and mine action operators have the responsibility to “ensure that all mine action activities . . . are carried out in accordance with applicable legislation, safely, effectively and efficiently, but also in a way that minimises any adverse impact on people, wildlife, vegetation and other aspects of the environment.” The standard further specifies that mechanical clearance and bulk demolition, or the process of clearing land with machines designed to detonate ordnance, require greater oversight than other clearance methods given that “these processes have the ability to severely impact the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GzdQD2W.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Employees of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine present to media the Ukraines first Armtrac 400 specialized mine clearance vehicle, purchased through the UNITED24 fundraising platform, near Kharkiv, on October 27, 2022, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although detonation carries risks for agricultural land, leaving landmines in the ground can also lead to chemical contamination as the munitions age and corrode. The leaching of hazardous chemicals into soil and groundwater can take anywhere from 10 to 90 years, but Ukraine’s farmland may experience pollution from buried ordnances sooner rather than later. Russia has reportedly used Soviet-era landmines against Ukraine, which would corrode faster than landmines produced more recently. Further, the characteristics of Ukraine’s fertile soils that enable plants to thrive also enable the soil to “cling on to a lot of these toxins following the war,” according to soil geomorphologist Joe Hupy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to identify the impacts on agricultural soil and groundwater resulting from exploded ordnance, unexploded ordnance, and landmines have only just begun within Ukraine, and CSIS interviews with in-country experts and operators revealed that more investment, time, and resources are needed before these impacts can be accurately determined. The Ukrainian Researchers Society, FAO, and WFP have partnered to map munition craters, soil pollution, and the presence of “bombturbation,” or incidences of explosives cratering, compacting, displacing, and ejecting hazardous materials into soil. Their preliminary study of contamination in the Kharkiv Oblast using remote sensing and soil sample analysis shows that over 420,000 craters across roughly 655,072 hectares of arable land have resulted in over 1.3 million cubic meters of displaced soil, 4,214 hectares of bombturbated soil, and 28,286 hectares of potentially contaminated soil, with only 1.76 percent of assessed soils found to be contaminated with heavy metals. A CSIS interview with the FAO Ukraine office confirmed this level of contamination is not concerning for the safe consumption of crops, but rather for the potential of reduced agricultural production in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collection of researchers across Ukraine, Lithuania, Portugal, and Spain have conducted a similar assessment within the Kharkiv Oblast, also finding that explosions on and within soil have damaged soil structure and released heavy metals into surrounding soils. The researchers note these findings are concluded from a minimal sample size that may not reflect the full extent of the war’s impacts on soils, especially given the limited access to areas of intense combat. These preliminary analyses are a significant step toward understanding the war’s effects on Ukrainian farmland, but offer an incomplete picture of what will be required to restore agricultural soil following the war’s conclusion. The scale of soil analysis required to determine the unique impacts of this war on Ukraine’s black soils will necessitate improved access to in-country soil testing facilities and greater investment in Ukraine’s remote sensing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, Ukraine’s minister of economy acknowledged, “Without demining, we will not be able to fully launch our economy. Mine clearance is therefore the starting point for the recovery of our country and its economy.” Significant progress against the challenge of demining Ukraine’s farmland is clear. At the same time, the scale of landmine contamination across Ukraine’s farmland and the importance of sustained agricultural activity to its economic recovery require unparalleled measures by the Ukrainian government along with support from international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a description of ongoing best practices and additional steps needed to demine Ukraine’s farmland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government is prioritizing humanitarian demining at the highest levels, including by the leadership of the Ministries of Economy and Defence, as well as by the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the course of adapting demining services to the ongoing war, the Ukrainian government recognizes that inefficiencies remain and is attempting to expedite the provision of humanitarian demining services and reduce the cost to Ukraine’s farmers through the recently launched demining market on the Prozorro system and through soft loans to farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government is also tracking the resources needed to demine Ukraine’s farmland, including demining equipment and training for deminers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Action Plan for Demining Ukraine’s Agricultural Lands aims to synchronize humanitarian demining of Ukraine’s farmland, and the Ukrainian government is attempting to unify all Ukrainian government demining activities under a forthcoming mine action strategy, which the Interagency Working Group on Humanitarian Demining is presently drafting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Ukrainian government should continue to take steps to reduce the prevalence of “dark demining” of Ukraine’s agricultural land and demining by farmers themselves, recognizing risks to the safety of farmers and other civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Ukrainian government is coordinating regularly with international partners to fill gaps and prevent overlaps in services, including through the International Donors’ Conference on Humanitarian Demining in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the Ukrainian government and its partners appear to be aligning activities with UNMAS’s Five Pillars of Mine Action, including mine education, with Minister of Economy Svyrydenko recently emphasizing the need for a “nationwide awareness campaign to educate children from an early age about the dangers of explosive ordnance.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complete humanitarian demining of Ukraine will require 10,000 sappers, necessitating an additional 7,000 deminers to supplement the 3,000 specialists working across the country today, according to Prime Minister Shmyhal. Funding for deminers’ training and salaries must be increased, with training for one sapper costing up to $6,000.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting non-technical surveys prior to other humanitarian demining procedures is the most cost-effective way to confirm the presence of landmine contamination and efficiently release non-contaminated land. In its action plan and national mine action strategy, the Ukrainian government should formalize the release of low- and no-risk land through non-technical surveys before conducting technical surveys in order to release more land for economic use as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In completing non-technical surveys, technical surveys, and mine removal, sappers should have access to advanced demining technologies, including drones, ground-penetrating radar, and satellite imagery analysis enhanced by artificial intelligence, in order to expedite humanitarian demining and increase the safety of deminers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine should continue to invest in its capacity to manufacture advanced demining equipment locally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the face of the rapid evolution of Ukrainian government demining processes, the Ukrainian government should continue to clearly communicate the steps farmers must take to access certified demining services and receive compensation for them, including through the newly announced demining market under the Prozorro system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government and international partners should also attempt to reduce the cost to farmers of humanitarian demining of their agricultural land, recognizing that any costs borne by farmers will detract from investments in agricultural production, resulting in lower farmer incomes, production, and exports nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given the urgent need for actionable information about the impacts of demining on agricultural land, and the fragility of the ecosystems on which agricultural activity depends, Ukraine’s government and international partners should invest in research on the impacts of demining agricultural land and disseminate best practices for demining Ukraine’s farmland to minimize impacts on soil fertility, water, and agricultural productivity. Such considerations and steps should be codified in plans for demining Ukraine’s farmland today and in the future, for the awareness of Ukrainian and international deminers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian government and partners should also increase the availability of soil testing to ensure the absence of chemical contamination and the safety of crops produced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Humanitarian demining is more than just neutralizing mines or other explosive devices. It is about providing people with the opportunity to return to their homes and live safely. It’s about the recovery of the economy and the restoration of the country, and ultimately, about global food security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fertilizer&quot;&gt;Fertilizer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is endowed with uniquely fertile farmland. Nearly two-thirds of Ukraine’s total arable land is covered in black soils, a highly fertile soil type containing ideal clay content for plant growth and high quantities of organic matter, such as humus, and nutrients, including calcium, nitrogen, phosphates, and potassium. Ukraine’s wealth of fertile soil facilitated its rise as a major global food supplier, even as it applied less fertilizers per hectare compared to neighboring countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ A farmer rides a floater truck spraying fertilizers on a farm in Kyiv on April 19, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While harvesting crops removes essential nutrients from soils, mineral fertilizers replace these nutrients for subsequent harvests. Ukraine’s major agricultural harvests require application of nitrogen, in the form of ammonia nitrate, urea, anhydrous ammonia, and other forms; phosphorus, in the form of diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate, and other forms; and potassium or potassic fertilizer, in the form of potash. Worldwide, fertilizers have accounted for a large share of agricultural productivity growth over the past century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impacts-of-russias-invasion-on-fertilizer-use-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Impacts of Russia’s Invasion on Fertilizer Use in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s increased agricultural production and exports over the past two decades are largely due to an increase in the use of fertilizers by Ukrainian farmers. Russia’s invasion has disrupted Ukrainian farmers’ ability to purchase and apply fertilizers since 2022. According to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, Ukrainian farmers applied 27.7 percent less fertilizer in 2022 than 2021, using roughly 20.8 million metric tons of mineral fertilizers in 2022 compared to 28.8 million metric tons in 2021, representing declines in the use of nitrogenous, phosphatic, and potassic fertilizers. Reductions continued into the 2022–2023 season: compared to average rates from 2018 to 2022, a March 2023 survey of 119 agricultural enterprises in Ukraine found that nitrogen application decreased by 16 percent for corn and wheat, 19 percent for sunflower, 21 percent for canola oil crops, and 24 percent for soybeans. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food shows that access has not improved as the country heads into its third growing season since Russia’s invasion: most Ukrainian farmers will be able to apply only half the fertilizers necessary for the 2024 harvest season, with only 10 percent of respondents fully equipped to meet their crops’ fertilizer needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insufficient fertilizer use impacts the quality and quantity of current and future harvests. According to the first deputy minister of Ukraine’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, a decrease in fertilizer application by 30 percent or more can reduce yields by 50 percent. The consequences of reduced fertilizer application can vary from farm to farm, depending on the nutrients applied, the crops cultivated, the season’s soil and climatic conditions, and the practices farmers employ throughout the season. A farm’s history of crop cultivation also determines which nutrients are present in the soil at the time of planting and which nutrients need to be applied for a specific crop’s optimal yield. Excessive application of one or more types of nutrients can likewise impact the quality and quantity of an upcoming harvest. Fertilizer application is not a one-size-fits-all practice, and many agricultural enterprises seeking to reduce any adverse effects of excessive mineral fertilizer application rely on soil testing to tailor the nutrients applied to the specific needs of their soil. As Ukrainian farmers have faced difficulties accessing and affording a range of mineral fertilizers, they have resorted to applying whatever nutrients are available in their own stores or from local suppliers, often not within recommended timeframes, which may have long-term impacts on Ukraine’s soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fertilizer-and-ukraines-agricultural-economy&quot;&gt;Fertilizer and Ukraine’s Agricultural Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to fertilizer is necessary for the livelihoods of Ukraine’s farmers and for Ukraine’s agricultural output, two related but distinct facets of Ukraine’s agricultural economy. Across Ukraine, roughly 2.7 million people were engaged in agricultural activity in 2021, comprising 17.3 percent of Ukraine’s total labor force. Access to fertilizers is important to small-scale farmers (farmers cultivating less than 500 hectares), who operate 82.4 percent of Ukraine’s agricultural enterprises, as it is central to the prosperity of their farms. Access to fertilizers is critical for medium- and large-scale producers, who operate the remaining 17.6 percent of Ukraine’s agricultural enterprises and are responsible for the majority of Ukraine’s agricultural exports and export revenues: agricultural enterprises cultivating over 500 hectares of farmland made up nearly 80 percent of Ukraine’s cereal and legume crop production in 2022. Medium- and large-scale enterprises are better able to access and afford fertilizers than small-scale farmers: the 10 percent of agricultural enterprises surveyed by the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food that can meet their crops’ fertilizer needs in 2024 are medium- or large-scale operations, with no surveyed small-scale farmers reporting that their fertilizer needs are met for the upcoming season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/62OPPqG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fertilizer prices remain high within Ukraine, Ukrainian farmers are adjusting their sowing plans to plant crops whose nutrient requirements they can meet with current fertilizer stores. Ukraine’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food also observes farmers basing their plans on the needs of domestic markets as export routes remain limited, sowing their fields with more peas, barley, millet, and oats relative to prewar harvests. According to the FAO’s January–February 2023 survey, nearly 20 percent of small-scale farmers in Ukraine, defined by the FAO as cultivating 250 hectares or less, had stopped purchasing fertilizers due to high prices. Of the 1,927 agricultural enterprises interviewed by the FAO, 81 percent expressed a need for more fertilizers to continue agricultural activities. Ukrainian farmers, especially small- and medium-sized producers, have resorted to a barter system with input suppliers in which fertilizers are purchased with grains and agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;factors-restricting-access-to-fertilizers-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Factors Restricting Access to Fertilizers in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian farmers’ reduced access to fertilizer is due to numerous, concurrent shocks, including global fertilizer price spikes following Russia’s invasion, curtailed nitrogenous fertilizer production within Ukraine, and high logistics costs due to Russia’s obstruction of Ukraine’s primary trade routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-price-spikes&quot;&gt;Global Price Spikes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite carveouts for food and fertilizer exports, international sanctions on Russian and Belarusian banking, trade, and energy sectors have reduced the two countries’ share of the world’s fertilizer trade, estimated at 18 percent in 2020, triggering global price spikes for all mineral fertilizers. In Ukraine, farmers’ fertilizer stocks helped insulate them from initial fertilizer price spikes, but domestic prices rose by the fall of 2022 after farmers exhausted their fertilizer supplies. The implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July 2022 expanded agricultural exports, increasing farmers’ working capital — and increasing demand for fertilizers and other agricultural inputs. As farmers prepared for the spring 2023 sowing campaign, fertilizer prices increased. For example, prices for potassium nitrate, or saltpeter, rose from UAH 27,000 (roughly $750) per metric ton to UAH 37,000 (roughly $1,025) per metric ton from July to October 2022. By February 2023, farmers spent UAH 8,000–9,000 (roughly $220–250) for the nitrogenous fertilizers needed to cultivate just one hectare of corn, excluding additional costs for fuel, potassic and phosphatic fertilizers, and other inputs, compared to prewar prices of roughly UAH 6,000 (roughly $165).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to disruptions in global fertilizer markets, energy price spikes affected global fertilizer prices in the months following Russia’s invasion. Global price spikes for natural gas and coal, key ingredients in the manufacturing of fertilizers, reduced fertilizer production capacity and added further upward pressure on fertilizer prices around the world. Europe’s fertilizer industry was hit especially hard as countries slashed imports of Russian natural gas, coal, and oil. High manufacturing costs forced plants to close across the region, reducing Europe’s overall fertilizer production by approximately 70 percent and its nitrogenous fertilizer production capacity by 50 to 60 percent in 2022. China’s ammonia production also contracted in response to high coal prices following Russia’s invasion. China’s October 2021 restrictions on fertilizer exports kept its 25 percent share of the global trade off global markets until December 2022, which pushed fertilizer prices even higher during the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reduced-domestic-production-of-nitrogenous-fertilizers&quot;&gt;Reduced Domestic Production of Nitrogenous Fertilizers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to Russia’s invasion, Ukraine produced enough nitrogenous fertilizer to meet over 70 percent of domestic demand. In 2021, domestic production exceeded 5.2 million metric tons, while Ukraine imported 1.4 million metric tons of nitrogenous fertilizers. After Russia’s invasion, only two of Ukraine’s five nitrogenous fertilizer factories remained operational, causing domestic production to fall by 78.3 percent to 1.1 million metric tons in 2022, and imports to triple to 4.3 million metric tons. By February 2023, the Cherkasy Azot and Rivneazot factories increased production capacity by 40 percent and 50 percent, respectively, but Ukrainian farmers still saw a shortage of mineral fertilizers, including nitrogenous fertilizers, ahead of the 2023 spring sowing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-logistics-costs-due-to-obstructed-trade-routes&quot;&gt;High Logistics Costs due to Obstructed Trade Routes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports obstructed trade routes that were previously responsible for over 90 percent of Ukraine’s agricultural exports and a majority of its fertilizer imports. This sudden lack of access to its primary, high-volume trade routes forced Ukrainian traders and agricultural enterprises to turn to road, rail, and river routes for fertilizer supplies from new sources. According to Ruslan Voytovych, the director and founder of Arus Trade, a fertilizer importer in Ukraine, his company’s shift to road transport routes significantly limited the volume of supplies he could import and raised delivery costs by 60 percent in the months following Russia’s invasion. Taras Ivashchenko, the head of Belor Ukraine, another Ukrainian fertilizer importer, found that the Danube River ports can only handle 30,000 to 40,000 metric tons of fertilizer imports per month, which is “almost nothing” for the Ukrainian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukrainian-government-and-international-efforts-to-improve-access-to-fertilizers&quot;&gt;Ukrainian Government and International Efforts to Improve Access to Fertilizers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food has supported farmers’ applications for fertilizer aid through the State Agrarian Register and coordinated agricultural aid through this system, while Ukraine’s bilateral and multilateral partners have invested to improve Ukrainian farmers’ access to fertilizers. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the AGRI-Ukraine initiative in July 2022 to help meet the needs of Ukrainian small- and medium-scale farmers for agricultural inputs, financing, improved export logistics and infrastructure, and capacity for drying, storing, and processing harvests. As of July 2023, USAID contributed $350 million, leveraged an additional $250 million from other donors and the private sector, and was seeking to leverage a further $250 million for the initiative. As of the time of publication, AGRI-Ukraine had provided 12,892 small-scale Ukrainian farmers (defined, in this case, as cultivating less than 500 hectares of farmland) with approximately 18,300 tons of complex and nitrogenous fertilizers for the 2023 spring and autumn campaigns. This September, the initiative announced a partnership with South Korea to deliver to Ukrainian farmers $5 million of fertilizers donated by South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International agricultural aid packages have largely targeted the small- and medium-sized enterprises otherwise unable to sustain operation in wartime, but assistance also funnels through the Ukrainian government’s “Affordable Loans at 5-7-9 percent” program, which offers low-rate subsidized lending for agricultural enterprises of all sizes. Launched in early 2020, the program provides loans up to UAH 90.0 million (roughly $2.5 million), depending on the loan type and the enterprise’s size and activity. The program has received direct financing from the World Bank through USAID’s AGRI-Ukraine initiative and provided UAH 158.0 billion (nearly $4.4 billion) to agricultural enterprises through 40,509 loan agreements since February 2022. Combined with the FAO’s cash transfers, this assistance has enabled farmers to afford the purchase of fertilizers at elevated prices from in-country suppliers. According to CSIS interviews, Ukraine’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food has encouraged partners to concentrate investments into this soft loan program over procuring and distributing in-kind fertilizer donations, as this financing concurrently empowers farmers to decide which inputs to prioritize purchasing and sustains business for Ukrainian fertilizer suppliers. Farmers in front-line oblasts, however, benefit more from in-kind fertilizer donations, as active conflict disrupts these farmers’ ability to obtain fertilizer on local markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-long-term-alternative-fertilizer-suppliers&quot;&gt;Securing Long-Term Alternative Fertilizer Suppliers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Kmrg5en.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine fertilizer imports were down significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, ranging from a decline of 65 percent for nitrogenous-based fertilizers to over 85 percent decline for potassic fertilizers. Historically, Russia and Belarus supplied fertilizer and fertilizer ingredients to Ukraine. While Ukraine instituted an embargo of Russian fertilizer imports in 2018 due to Russia’s 2014 invasion of Donbas and the Crimea annexation, it was still heavily dependent on Belarusian supplies when Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Over 2019–2021, Belarus alone accounted for 71 percent of Ukraine’s potash imports, 58 percent of its urea imports, and 41 percent of its complex fertilizers imports, or fertilizers containing all three nitrogenous, phosphatic, and potassic elements. With Belarusian imports essentially ending with Russia’s full-scale invasion in late February 2022, Ukraine relied on other trade partners such as Poland, Germany, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan for its potash imports in 2022. As Ukraine’s trade relationships with two of the world’s largest fertilizers producers are now severed, the government of Ukraine and Ukrainian agricultural enterprises are struggling to identify alternative sources to fill the considerable supply gap left by foregone Russian and Belarusian imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine faces different challenges accessing nitrogenous, phosphatic, and potassic fertilizers. Even with curtailed domestic production capacity, Ukraine can meet some of its domestic demand for nitrogenous fertilizers, and Ukraine’s trade partners can supply additional nitrogenous fertilizer as well as phosphatic fertilizers. However, securing alternative potash suppliers will remain a challenge for Ukraine’s agricultural enterprises. The global potash market is highly concentrated, with Russia and Belarus accounting for 41 percent of global potash trade in 2020. The world’s top producer of potash is Canada, with 39 percent of global market share, but transporting supplies from Canada to Ukraine would require long and costly freight shipments in addition to overland transport through Europe. This inherently expensive route introduces complex logistical issues and would likely only result in high potash prices on domestic Ukrainian markets if attempted. Kernel, Ukraine’s largest producer and exporter of vegetable oils, procured two vessels of complex fertilizers and potash from Morocco’s OCPGroup and Jordan’s Arab Potash Company in the summer of 2023. However, concerns remain as to whether these potential trade partners could supply enough potash to meet the significant needs of Ukrainian farmers, especially as food producers around the world are anticipating higher demand for potash in the coming decades. To meet domestic needs, Ukraine will likely have to turn to smaller potash producers that are closer to home, such as Germany, Israel, and Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dWMxBc0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-1&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war continues to suppress agricultural production in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government continues to help improve Ukrainian producers’ access to fertilizer, and access to fertilizer remains a priority within support packages from Ukraine’s partners to its agricultural sector. This aid has been essential to maintaining Ukrainian agricultural production since February 2022. Nonetheless, the amount of assistance has been insufficient to meet farmers’ immediate needs, indicating the importance of additional efforts in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a description of ongoing best practices and additional steps needed to increase access to fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improved information about the specific fertilizer needs of Ukraine’s farmland, including through investing in both remote sensing and traditional laboratory soil-testing programs could enable farmers to purchase the right quantity of the right nutrients and inform the government’s projections for domestic fertilizer requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investment in Ukraine’s national infrastructure for geospatial data would enable high-quality, rapid soil analysis that could predict Ukraine’s fertilizer needs with greater accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As international partners such as USAID, the FAO, and others continue to support Ukrainian farmers’ access to fertilizers, improved information sharing regarding the long-term plans for Ukraine’s fertilizer market would help partners align their assistance with the needs of Ukrainian farmers and fertilizer producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Ukraine’s partners should support rebuilding Ukraine’s capacity to produce nitrogenous fertilizers domestically, restoring — or even exceeding — Ukraine’s prewar production capacity, which will require an uninterrupted supply of raw materials, particularly natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Ukraine rebuilds its capacity to produce fertilizers domestically, the Ukrainian government and partners should continue to calibrate assistance so as not to reduce demand for Ukrainian-produced fertilizers and fertilizers secured by domestic suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s candidacy for membership in the European Union will necessitate further reforms to its agriculture sector and production standards as the European Union aims for climate neutrality by 2050. For instance, aligning with the European Union’s common agricultural policy requires Ukraine certify 3 percent of its total agricultural land as organic by 2030. As Ukraine and its partners work to secure sufficient mineral fertilizer suppliers to fill the gap left by foregone Russian and Belarusian imports, concurrently incentivizing increased use of organic fertilizers would help sustain production and soil fertility, as well as support the country’s path to EU integration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, international partners should support Ukraine’s efforts to secure long-term suppliers of fertilizer, especially potash, to replace foregone inputs from Belarus and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s agriculture sector has been a major front in Russia’s war since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The systematic destruction of Ukraine’s farmland, agricultural equipment and infrastructure, and export capacity has contributed to a global food crisis that continues to affect millions around the world. For Ukraine to strengthen its economy to fend off Russia’s continued assault, restore its role as a major global food supplier, and maintain its counterweight to the influence Russia wields through its own agricultural exports, unprecedented support is necessary to restore Ukraine’s natural resources and transform its agricultural institutions, infrastructure, and labor force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As urgent needs — related to agriculture and all sectors affected by the war — occupy the attention of Ukraine and its international partners, they should not lose focus on a resource central to Ukraine’s rise as a global agricultural powerhouse: its black soils. The focus of this report has been the safe and expeditious demining of Ukraine’s farmland and increasing farmers’ access to fertilizer. Essential to both endeavors is soil testing, which could both ensure the safety of agricultural land once it has been cleared of mines and help farmers determine the appropriate types and levels of fertilizer to apply to their land. Rebuilding Ukraine’s agriculture sector from the ground up must involve identifying the optimal set of soil testing methods for Ukraine’s agricultural soils and scaling up a national infrastructure for such testing within Ukraine in the face of numerous, concurrent challenges imposed by Russia’s war.&lt;/p&gt;

Western governments, however, have been reluctant to compete with Chinese enterprises in the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-issue&quot;&gt;The Issue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After a sluggish start, Gulf states are getting serious about the energy transition.&lt;/strong&gt; Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are embarking on a concerted effort to decarbonize their power grids and seek regional and international leadership roles in the new energy world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China has established itself as an essential partner in Gulf states’ energy transitions.&lt;/strong&gt; China and Chinese companies have built on their ties with Gulf states in the oil and petrochemical sectors and have gradually transitioned to higher-value inputs in the renewables sector, becoming investors and coinvestors in Gulf states’ largest-scale solar and wind projects in the Middle East and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western governments have been reluctant to compete head-to-head with Chinese enterprises in the renewables sector in the Gulf.&lt;/strong&gt; The state capitalist landscape acts as a tacit barrier to entry to private Western firms and is more familiar to Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan do not enjoy strong economic ties. Uzbekistan does not even feature in Saudi Arabia’s top 100 trading partners. Yet, a Saudi state-owned developer, ACWA Power, recently broke ground on central Asia’s largest wind project as part of a planned $7.5 billion investment in Uzbekistan. But this project reveals more about the strength of Saudi-Chinese ties than it does about Uzbekistan. A Saudi company may be the lead developer, but a Chinese manufacturer made the wind turbines, a Chinese company is set to install them, and China’s 49 percent stake in ACWA’s portfolio company helped make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, both China and Chinese companies are playing a central role in the energy transition. They are especially prominent in supply chains for renewables, providing critical components for wind, solar, and energy storage projects. China’s dominant position within these critical supply chains has raised alarm bells in the United States and European Union, with both resorting to muscular industrial policy to push back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But China has received a considerably warmer welcome in much of the Global South and in the Middle East especially. Chinese companies and capital have grown beyond their traditional role as suppliers of renewable energy components to become investors and project developers, building deeper economic ties with countries in the process. This expansion along the value chain is particularly visible in the Gulf, where state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have entered into partnerships with their Chinese counterparts to codevelop large-scale renewable projects in the region and elsewhere in Asia and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief will map the growing economic relationship between China and the Gulf states in the context of the global energy transition and deepening geopolitical ties. Starting by tracing the roots of this relationship to older forms of cooperation on oil and gas, conventional power, and petrochemicals, the brief will demonstrate that the partnerships in renewable energy have strong precedents. It will then give an overview of the role of China and Chinese companies in the Gulf states’ nascent energy transition, before looking at emergent forms of cooperation outside of the region by SOEs from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Gulf states get serious about the energy transition, China and Chinese companies are emerging as essential partners. Gulf SOEs are eager to play leading roles in the next technological wave, as electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, hydrogen, and carbon capture technologies take center stage. They see China as a leading player in each of these technology areas. Beyond the Middle East, Gulf states have identified a range of soft-power opportunities afforded by other states’ energy transitions, particularly in the Global South. China is a key partner to these states as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gulf-states-begin-to-decarbonize&quot;&gt;The Gulf States Begin to Decarbonize&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf states are latecomers to the energy transition. In comparison to other major developing countries, they invested late in solar and wind and have lagged far behind. Comparing their investment in renewables with neighboring Jordan—also a monarchy with high levels of solar radiation but one with no oil—demonstrates how rentier states often move more slowly (Figure 1). The exception is the UAE, which leads the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states in decarbonizing its power sector with solar and wind. In addition to the solar and wind captured in the chart below, its Barakah nuclear plant now contributes almost 25 percent of the country’s electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fRbSRRs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Solar and Wind as Share of Total Capacity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a delayed start, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are clearly now embarking on a concerted effort to decarbonize their power grids, and they are developing wind and solar at a considerably faster pace than other members of the GCC (Figure 2). The differences between the approaches of these states are noteworthy and are not correlated with wealth within the group. Among the subgroup often referred to as “super rentiers,” consisting of Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE, Kuwait is a laggard while the UAE is a leader. Although the rentier effect seems to explain the late transition start as a group, it does not explain the differences now emerging within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JIf7o9P.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Renewables Development in the GCC (Capacity in MWp).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-definitively-state-led-transition&quot;&gt;A Definitively State-Led Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and the UAE are looking to assume regional and international leadership roles in the new energy world that is taking shape. The UAE’s hosting of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) in 2023 is perhaps the most obvious example, but Saudi Arabia is also aiming to play a regional leadership role in combating climate change and recently launched the Middle East Green Initiative, a climate mitigation platform and reforestation program. This new posture within the climate and transition discourse represents a stark departure from the more cautious and sometimes obstructionist role played by these states in the past and demonstrates their aspirations as middle powers in the emergent multipolar international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having embarked on their domestic transitions late, Gulf states have had limited opportunities to carve out spaces for themselves in the value chain of renewable energy components, with efforts to establish solar module production facilities generally producing uncompetitive and disappointing results. Early investments by regional and national oil companies (NOCs) in solar technology providers, such as Petroleum Development Oman’s investment in Glasspoint and Saudi Aramco’s investment in the Japanese thin film producer Solar Frontier, failed to yield industrial policy outcomes or returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Oman are approaching the next phase of the transition with considerably more dynamism, marshaling sovereign wealth and directing resources from their NOCs in an attempt to lead the nascent hydrogen economy and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies. These oil and gas states see their locations, renewable energy resource potential, and experience in conventional energy development as distinct advantages with these two sets of technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE’s and Saudi Arabia’s state-owned renewable power developers—Masdar and ACWA Power, respectively—have played a dominant role in the early stages of their countries’ energy transitions. The role of SOEs distinguishes their early transitions from other GCC states. Masdar and ACWA have developed the majority of completed projects in their home states; each is also the second most prominent developer in the neighboring state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE and Saudi Arabia seem to have employed a national champions strategy, with these companies using their home markets to accumulate large portfolios of projects that qualify them to compete on the global stage. This distinctly state capitalist approach to power development separates the UAE and Saudi Arabia from their regional peers. Domestically focused sovereign wealth funds either created or acquired specialized developers—unrelated to the NOCs and legacy utility firms—to advance renewables. In contrast, Qatar and Kuwait have given renewables deployment mandates to the NOCs and their affiliates, with largely disappointing results. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has gone a step further in this state capitalist direction. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced that only 30 percent of its planned utility projects would be developed through a competitive tender process (its state-owned developer is still the largest winner of these tenders) and that it would directly develop the other 70 percent with partners of its choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigating this state capitalist landscape, with astonishingly low prices at tenders (Figure 3), has proved too complex or unappealing for most Western firms. The inroads made by the French state-owned firm Électricité de France (EDF), which has built a portfolio of wind and solar projects in the region in partnership with Masdar, remains the exception. Chinese firms have also begun to make notable progress, first as component suppliers and contractors, but also more recently as developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5A073TV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deepening-geopolitical-ties-between-china-and-the-gulf&quot;&gt;Deepening Geopolitical Ties between China and the Gulf&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning this trend of deeper economic cooperation is a geopolitical context in which the Gulf states—having long expressed anxieties about U.S. commitment to the region—have adopted a more proactive foreign policy, courting China to secure a stronger position in the multipolar landscape taking shape. This strategy was strikingly evident when Saudi Arabia and Iran recently signed an agreement in Beijing to resume diplomatic ties six years after having closed their embassies. The symbolic value of the signing taking place in Beijing and the implicit role given to China as guarantor are more relevant than China’s actual role in facilitating the agreement. President Xi Jinping’s visit to Saudi Arabia in 2022 also came with a flurry of deal announcements worth an estimated $30 billion. U.S. policymakers have increasingly scrutinized China’s investments and interest in the region in recent months. If Saudi Arabia is to receive the security guarantee it is seeking as part of an agreement, the administration is asking for an unwinding of these ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia’s and the UAE’s recent ascension to the BRICS group (previously made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) as part of an expanded 10-member organization is in many ways indicative of the tectonic shifts taking place in the international system. Of the original BRICS members, China played a crucial role in the effort to expand the group and include the two Gulf states (the new members, not coincidentally, were four of the five Middle Eastern states that have “comprehensive strategic partnerships” with China). It is too early to discern the practical effect of this development, but the UAE has already joined the group’s New Development Bank, and Saudi Arabia is expected to follow soon. This group is aiming to provide an institutional forum for a more depoliticized approach to development cooperation outside of the universe of Western institutions and the G7, whose relative economic clout has declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-gulf-conventional-power-ties&quot;&gt;Chinese-Gulf Conventional Power Ties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and the Gulf states have developed deep economic ties in the conventional energy and petrochemical sectors. Trade and investment patterns have slowly transitioned from transactional relationships based on the sale of energy one way and consumer goods the other to deeper ties involving joint ventures and large infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on hydrocarbon trade between the Gulf and China obscures the depth of the relationship in the power, refining, and petrochemical sectors. Much attention is often given to the fact that China has become Saudi Arabia’s leading trade partner over the past two decades, with Saudi Arabia currently supplying about a fifth of China’s crude imports, with similar trends in the other Gulf states. But in a liquid market such as that of oil or gas, this trade does not necessarily lead to deeper economic ties. However, foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector and joint ventures between state-owned firms do have the effect of deepening ties, locking companies into long-term investment cycles and facilitating the exchange of skills and talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Aramco’s recent history reveals the gradual deepening of ties taking place between sets of SOEs from both sides. The first of these large projects was the establishment of the Yanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company (YASREF) in 2014, a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and the China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) over a $10 billion refining facility on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day (b/d). The success of the venture clearly engendered trust and confidence on both sides, and the two countries subsequently announced a number of other projects. Notably, these include Saudi capital from Aramco and state-owned petrochemical giant SABIC flowing to greenfield and brownfield refining and petrochemical facilities along China’s coastline, and Chinese capital from its state-owned Silk Road Fund leading a consortium that acquired 49 percent of Aramco’s gas pipeline company in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE and Oman have also attracted Chinese energy contractors and FDI, including the China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company’s construction of the Habshan-Fujairah oil pipeline in 2012, which bypasses the Strait of Hormuz, through which 45 percent of China’s oil imports flow. Chinese SOEs have also directly invested in UAE offshore concessions over the past 10 years. ADNOC, Abu Dhabi’s national oil company, recently signed a framework agreement worth an estimated $12 billion with China’s Wanhua Chemical to codevelop downstream projects following a state visit by President Xi in 2019. This list of projects is long and continues to grow, both within the oil and gas sectors and in fields such as logistics and port infrastructure in particular. The picture that emerges is one of a deepening economic relationship with a strong understanding on both sides of how to cooperate on long-term and often risk-prone infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulf states and China share a state capitalist model of development typified by SOEs negotiating deals on both sides, and this similarity likely facilitates cooperation and the integration of national and corporate agendas in the deals that are reached. These SOEs are political actors first and economic actors second, so where political will exists for deals to be made, as there has been over the last five years, these firms tend to overcome the commercial hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-centrality-in-the-gulf-energy-transition&quot;&gt;China’s Centrality in the Gulf Energy Transition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s role in Gulf states’ energy transition mirrors trends in their broader economic relationship. The Chinese side has gradually transitioned to higher-value inputs, from component suppliers, to contractors, and finally to investors and coinvestors in the largest scale solar and wind projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominance in clean energy supply chains is not unique to the Gulf. The top six solar module manufacturers globally by production value are all Chinese companies. Chinese companies also dominate a variety of other solar and wind components along the value chains. In markets that exhibit the rentier effect and a strong focus on achieving the lowest price at tender, states have tended to focus on importing the cheapest and most efficient components. These components nearly invariably come from China, even if that comes at the expense of effective industrial policy in the short term. This has meant that the Saudi and UAE markets have rapidly become important export markets for Chinese companies. Chinese contractors such as the China Energy Engineering Group and Shanghai Electric have also played an important role in building the first group of utility-scale projects, but with the entry of lower-cost Indian contracting firms, they now play a smaller role in that part of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing role as an investor and developer in solar projects, both at the utility and commercial scale and in greenfield and brownfield developments, is interesting. For the most part, Gulf states do not have an issue accessing capital or debt, and Gulf SOEs typically do most of the investing in this sector. But at the utility scale, module manufacturers such as Jinko Solar, the largest in the world, are leading consortiums that have won large solar tenders in Saudi Arabia. Chinese firms have captured much of the value chain in such projects; in this case, Jinko is the developer and module supplier, and a smaller percentage of expenditure—for cables, civil contracting, and understructures—is directed to local firms to satisfy local content requirements. Jinko also played a similar role in the 1.2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) Al Sweihan project in Abu Dhabi, which is one of the largest single-site photovoltaic (PV) projects in the world. Jinko codeveloped the project along with UAE state-owned developer Taqa and also supplied the modules. These two recent projects signal Chinese firms’ strong intention to play a role in all parts of the project development value chain in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the 2019 announcement that China’s state-owned Silk Road Fund had acquired 49 percent in ACWA Power Renewable Energy Holding (ACWA Power RenewCo) represents the clearest and most important signal of this deepening cooperation, as the company is one of Saudi Arabia’s main renewable energy project holding companies, with 1,668 megawatts (MW) of wind and solar assets in the UAE, South Africa, Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco. This larger transaction followed a series of one-off greenfield codevelopment deals between ACWA and the Silk Road Fund relating to one coal and two solar projects in the UAE. The growing partnership would prove to be a precursor to more international codevelopment in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of October 2023, the total Chinese investment in ACWA projects has exceeded $10 billion. ACWA’s chair highlighted these developments during an address at a forum celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative in October 2023. During the forum, ACWA signed seven new cooperation agreements with a host of Chinese SOEs and asserted its commitment to the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable developments have also occurred at the commercial and industrial scale. In 2021, the China Three Gorges company, one of the largest state-owned power developers, acquired UAE-based Alcazar Energy. With a portfolio of only around 400 MW, this transaction is not interesting for its scale. Rather, it indicates a nuanced understanding of the market on the part of China Three Gorges because it bundled together a large group of smaller projects from markets across the MENA region—an indication that their risk appetite extends beyond cooperation with state-owned players on mega-projects. Unsurprisingly, the Silk Road Fund also played a role financing the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another powerful indicator of the deepening economic cooperation between China and the Gulf on clean energy is the increased level of investment further upstream in the renewables value chain. As the United States and European Union have erected new trade barriers to slow the growth of Chinese companies in key sectors, the opposite trend seems to be unfolding in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have each established ambitious sets of industrial policies and have marshaled their sovereign wealth to attract joint venture partners to codevelop manufacturing facilities in their domestic markets. The most notable example of this trend is the announcement of a joint venture agreement between Saudi Arabia’s PIF and China’s Longi Solar, one of the world’s largest module manufacturers. Longi has since become the module supplier of preference on a series of mega-scale solar PV projects developed by the PIF. A similar agreement was also recently announced between the PIF and China’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Company (Foxconn) to codevelop an EV brand in Saudi Arabia called CEER, breaking ground on the project in 2023. The PIF has also built an assembly plant with the U.S. EV carmaker Lucid, after becoming its largest shareholder, and is set to begin operation in the third quarter of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ The Dhafra Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Independent Power Producer (IPP) Project in the United Arab Emirates’ capital, Abu Dhabi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large developers from the United States and the United Kingdom are notably absent from the broader renewable landscape altogether, despite a growing appetite for investments in other developing markets in Asia and Latin America. An exception to this absence of Western firms is the large role played by French firms in the Gulf renewables landscape, particularly large state-owned firms EDF and Engie. Their success at winning public solar and wind tenders in the region, and building lasting partnerships with local developers, lends credence to the hypothesis that it is the shared feature of state ownership, nearly ubiquitous in Chinese, French, and Gulf firms operating in the sector, that is key to success. The statist nature of these firms permits access to lower-cost capital and cheaper debt and enables them to invest with longer time horizons than private firms, allowing them to target projects that have substantial soft-power or non-financial returns to their state ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-and-gulf-clean-energy-cooperation-beyond-the-middle-east&quot;&gt;Chinese and Gulf Clean Energy Cooperation beyond the Middle East&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their deep cooperation in the Gulf, China and Gulf states are also increasing their economic cooperation elsewhere in the world. China and the Silk Road Fund’s acquisition of half of ACWA Power’s renewables portfolio company in 2019 gave the two state-owned companies shared exposure to a group of projects in South Africa, Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco. This type of engagement is qualitatively different from the type of FDI that preceded it and indicates a deeper level of cooperation and alignment. A number of other greenfield development agreements between the two parties followed this deal, most notably the 1.5 gigawatt (GW) Sirdarya combined cycle gas turbine facility in Uzbekistan and a $2.4 billion investment in three large wind projects spearheaded by ACWA totaling an additional 1.5 GW. These facilities, set to be completed in early 2024, are expected to meet up to a quarter of the country’s power needs. These investments have quickly made Saudi Arabia an important economic player in a former Soviet republic with which it previously shared only tenuous ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the recent addition of the UAE and Saudi Arabia to BRICS, these types of engagements are likely to increase substantially, with the Gulf states gaining legitimacy and access to new markets by associating with China, a great power. China is also eager to strengthen partnerships with traditional U.S. allies in the region, and as budget constraints have slowed Belt and Road Initiative projects in recent years, China could increasingly look to Gulf financial sponsors to play a role in stalled development plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;western-responses&quot;&gt;Western Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Western governments generally have been reluctant to compete head-to-head with Chinese enterprises in the Gulf as the global energy transition unfolds. The major U.S. initiative in this field is the November 2022 UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy, which promises to “catalyze” $100 billion and deploy 100 GW of clean energy by 2035. What “catalyze” means exactly is unclear; other parts of the plan refer to “mobilizing,” but fundamental issues such as financing, control, and ownership are not spelled out. Partly, this omission is due to a different idea of the relationship between the government and private sector in Western societies. But it is also due to a Western preoccupation in the energy field with dividing the roles of asset owners, policymakers, and regulators. In the Gulf, these roles are often conflated in the interest of speed and agility. The strategy of Western firms is to precede construction with intensive studies on demand, economic viability, and environmental impacts; to stress safety; and to have diverse stakeholders evaluating technical and economic analysis, forecasting, simulation, communication, and management. China’s orientation to build things and get them online quickly is often very much more in tune with the instincts of Gulf governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy relationship between China and the Gulf states has evolved slowly from a relationship characterized by transactional trade to one that now includes large-scale reciprocal FDI in both conventional fossil fuel assets and increasingly in renewable energy assets that are the central pillars of the Gulf states’ energy transitions. A decade and a half of investment cooperation in the oil and gas sector afforded both sides opportunities to develop relationships and trust, which have been carried forward by a different set of state-owned firms into the renewables sector. China’s dominant position in the supply chain of both solar and wind projects has also amplified this trend. Moving beyond this pattern of reciprocal FDI in the energy sector, China and its Gulf partners have begun to develop projects jointly in other developing markets, signaling a further deepening of this economic relationship and growing alignment of economic and foreign policy priorities. Interestingly, the unique success of French state-owned firms among Western developers in this market strongly suggests that state ownership in a state capitalist landscape brings with it a set of advantages and perhaps acts as a tacit barrier to entry to other private Western firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2023, the UK and most NATO allies have been understandably preoccupied with the need to support Ukraine, tackling a range of economic and social challenges, and most recently the sudden explosion of violence in the Middle East. However, the number of acute short-term challenges has distracted political and public attention away from the rising danger of an even more serious conflict in the coming years. Put simply, Russia has now transitioned its economy onto a war footing; US production is not sufficient to replenish its own stockpiles and fulfil Ukraine’s needs; and European countries are trying to manage an increasingly dangerous situation from an unsustainable peacetime defence and industrial posture. This would not be such a serious risk were it not for the fact that the US military is increasingly facing a threat that it cannot overmatch from Chinese forces in the Indo-Pacific. NATO is currently heavily dependent on the US in a wide range of key areas – most notably the ability to roll back Russian ground-based air defences from the air, as well as ammunition resupply, tanker aircraft, command and control and satellite capabilities. In the event of a clash with China in the Indo-Pacific that removes the capacity for large-scale US military reinforcement and support elsewhere, Europe will be left vulnerable to concurrent military aggression by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the year, Russian forces in Ukraine have been suffering from significant shortages of vehicles, weapons and above all ammunition. However, from a low point in the spring, Russia’s military supply situation has been steadily improving. Its factories are standardising around fewer types of tanks, artillery howitzers and UAVs, resulting in steadily rising production figures. From around 40 long-range missiles per month at the start of the invasion, Russia is now producing more than 100 per month. Artillery ammunition production has almost doubled, and has recently been supplemented by over 1 million shells and hundreds of howitzers from North Korea. Factories have also been set up in Iran to add resilience and additional capacity to Russia’s rearmament drive after the vast losses in materiel and ammunition expenditure of the past 18 months of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is settling down for a long war, aiming to grind down Ukraine and exhaust the capacity and will of its Western supporters to supply the vehicles, ammunition and weapons it needs to keep fighting successfully. Despite the huge expenditure this year, the Russian government has announced plans for a 68% increase in defence spending, to around 6.5% of GDP, next year. This will likely prove disastrous for the Russian economy in the very long term. However, those hoping that Russia’s current effort is unsustainable in the short term are likely to be disappointed; it is worth noting that for much of the Cold War, Soviet spending on defence was far higher than this – reaching 21% of GDP by 1985 – and still took decades to arguably bring about the collapse of the USSR. The Kremlin can leverage a formidable coercive information and security apparatus to maintain tight control over any forms of public or political dissent. What little disagreement is visible in Russian political and media circles is largely over how rather than whether to continue the war, with many critics calling for greater escalation or even direct conflict with NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Europe has failed to make the necessary investments in increased industrial production capacity and defence spending. With the notable exception of Poland, many national commitments to significant additional defence spending have either not yet materialised or are not slated to take effect for several years. The most obvious example is Germany, which shortly after the Russian invasion made a public commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence by 2024, in addition to a one-off €100 billion investment in revitalising Bundeswehr capabilities. However, only €1.5 billion from the fund had actually been spent by mid-2023, and the defence budget as a whole actually decreased slightly compared to 2022. The UK Defence plan following the Defence Command Paper refresh is already £16.9 billion short of projected planned expenditure over the coming 10 years. Even so, most of the one-off £5 billion boost granted in 2023 was allocated to long-term nuclear submarine and weapons programmes, with only £1.9 billion of it going towards munitions resupply and purchases for Ukraine over two years. The European Defence Agency’s multinational 155mm artillery procurement programme is a solid plan along the required lines, but has been glacially slow to set up compared with the pace at which Ukrainian requirements are outstripping supply capacity. The EDA programme is also still far from sufficient at its current scale to put Ukraine’s war effort on a sustainable footing for the immediately foreseeable future, let alone replenish Europe’s own defence stockpiles, which have been badly depleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite growing political frustration in many Western countries at the rising costs and lack of decisive progress, there is no easy way out of this war. In post-Cold War counterinsurgency conflicts, Western expeditionary campaigns ultimately ended when a political decision was made in Washington and other capitals to make some form of messy compromise in exchange for a sufficient “peace” to withdraw. This is not possible with Russian aggression in Ukraine. Talk of Ukraine “having to enter negotiations” is dangerously misguided and naïve because it ignores the fact that Russian aims have hardened, but not changed. The Kremlin’s will to grind on can be seen in its clear preparations for a long war and continued offensive action despite suffering several hundred thousand soldiers killed or seriously wounded and more than 2,500 tanks visually confirmed destroyed or captured. This is not the behaviour of a regime that will accept any lasting end to its offensive war of choice if Western governments withhold military support to force Kyiv into making concessions for a negotiated ceasefire. In fact, such a betrayal of Ukraine would have quite the opposite effect, encouraging Putin’s regime to continue to fight in the belief of eventual victory. It would also send an incredibly dangerous message to both Russia and China about the West’s lack of will to fight, making it far harder to deter future aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The only way to end the war is to convince Russia that its prospects for military success will get worse over time, rather than better&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine is forced to negotiate a ceasefire, Russia would be in a strong position to demand retreats from key positions and the removal of Kyiv’s remaining military initiative as baseline concessions. Such a process would also fracture Western political unity – which has largely held up to this point – and break all trust between Ukraine and its Western partners, since it could only be forced by withholding desperately needed support. Russia would then most likely spend three to six months reorganising its currently weak logistics, training and force dispositions, and then restart offensive operations from a much stronger position. This was done repeatedly in Syria, where Russia and the Assad regime used ceasefire agreements to freeze the front when they needed an operational pause, and then relaunched offensives where and when it suited them best. Russia also reneged on the Russia–Chechnya Peace Treaty of 1997, signed following the stalemate of the First Chechen War, by reinvading Chechnya in 1999 with much better prepared forces and conquering the country in a brutal campaign that involved almost completely destroying the capital city of Grozny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no concessions the West could force Kyiv to offer, or indeed offer itself, that are more valuable to the Kremlin than defeating Ukraine through its current strategy of resourcing a long war to exhaust Western support and grind down resistance by 2025 or 2026. States do not stop fighting when they think that they can win wars, especially after taking hundreds of thousands of casualties and seeing their previous aura of military power badly damaged internationally by initial poor performance. The only way to end the war is to convince Russia that its prospects for military success will get worse over time, rather than better. This requires investing in the large-scale defence industrial production needed to make Ukraine’s slow offensive progress sustainable. At that point, the Kremlin would have a strong incentive to negotiate a settlement that might conceivably hold, on something approaching acceptable terms for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is set on a course that will see its production of weapons, ammunition and new formations increase significantly over the coming 2–3 years. Depending on how successfully Western governments sustain the supplies that Ukraine needs to keep fighting effectively, this will either make future Ukrainian advances harder to achieve or potentially result in serious reverses to gains made so far. Either way, without major increases in European defence production and a focus on reorganising and training militaries to credibly roll back any future Russian aggression against Alliance territory, Russia will regenerate a capacity to directly threaten NATO faster than most political or even military planners appear to realise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has repeatedly shown himself to be a strategic opportunist who will take huge military risks if he believes there is a quick and easy win to be had. The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was itself predicated on the false assumption that Russia could quickly decapitate the Ukrainian government and impose a puppet state without major fighting. NATO must be capable of deterring Russian military aggression that might seek to take advantage of any perceived opportunity to seize symbolic areas of Alliance territory and challenge Article 5 without effective military recourse in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Chinese military is growing faster and increasing its capabilities more quickly than most thought possible even five years ago. Developments in very long-range anti-ship and anti-tanker/AWACS aircraft missile systems are particularly problematic for key US military capabilities across the vast distances of the Indo-Pacific. Furthermore, many of the US technical answers to some of these problems – such as the Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, Collaborative Combat Aircraft and the new B-21 Raider bomber – will not be available until 2029 or 2030 at a useful scale. The upshot is that the maximum period of risk of the Chinese military attempting to blockade or invade Taiwan or key disputed territories in the South or East China Seas is likely to be 2026–2028. Very problematic Chinese capabilities will be largely mature and fielded, but many of the US answers will not be ready yet. In the event of a dangerous standoff or an actual military conflict in the Indo-Pacific during this period, therefore, the US will be heavily stretched to meet its own commitments and Allied needs in that theatre. It is likely that EUCOM and CENTCOM would have to transfer assets to INDOPACOM in such a scenario, and Europe certainly could not count on rapid reinforcement at scale in the event of a concurrent Russian attack on NATO territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The costs of successfully deterring a well armed and amoral adversary pale in comparison to the unimaginable costs of even a successful defensive war once it has begun&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any analysis attempting to argue that the military threat from either China in the Indo-Pacific or from Russia in Europe should be prioritised as the more likely misses a fundamental point. China has a strong interest in supporting Russia to ensure it remains a serious military threat in Europe that splits US and Western attention. More importantly, the only likely scenario in which Russia might directly attack a European NATO country is during a concurrent standoff or actual conflict that leaves US forces largely fixed in the Indo-Pacific. In the event of such a military confrontation with China in the mid-to-late 2020s, Russia will have a strong incentive to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to break NATO while the US cannot reinforce Europe effectively. By 2026–2028, Russia’s industry will have been at full-scale military production for years, allowing it to rebuild its increasingly battle-hardened forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deter this concurrent threat, European countries – including the UK – must urgently invest in significantly increasing production capacity for the artillery ammunition, spare parts and air defence missiles required to keep Ukraine in the fight while also refilling their own dangerously depleted stockpiles. European air forces, in particular, must also rapidly procure specialised weapons and dedicate serious aircrew training time and focus to developing high-end suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) capabilities. Currently these reside almost exclusively among US air arms. The credible capacity to roll back Russian conventional forces in Europe relies on achieving air superiority, since NATO’s European powers lack the recruitment capacity or funding to field the scale and quality of ground forces and land-based firepower needed to beat Russia without it. To avoid being extremely vulnerable when or if US rapid reinforcement is unlikely, European air forces must be able to collectively destroy the Russian SAM systems that currently would make air superiority over contested Alliance territory impossible to achieve without a major US SEAD/DEAD campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing at scale in munitions and weapons production will require real political leadership, not least the courage and eloquence to explain to publics unused to genuine military threats why such investment is necessary at a time when so many other public services are desperately short of money. However, Ukraine illustrates vividly that the costs of successfully deterring a well armed and amoral adversary pale in comparison to the unimaginable costs of even a successful defensive war once it has begun. History suggests that few start wars that they believe will be long or difficult, but many long and difficult wars are started because one side believes the other cannot prevent a quick victory. Thus, the immediate target need not be the full capability to immediately fight and win a long war with Russia. Rather, it must be putting Ukraine’s defence on a sustainable footing and simultaneously rebuilding Western ammunition and equipment stockpiles, as well as the SEAD/DEAD capacity needed to convince Russia it could not achieve a quick and easy landgrab in Europe if the US and China were to come to blows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes years for investment in Defence to bear fruit, and so even if the necessary investments are made in short order, there will be a significant lag before seeing results in frontline forces. This renders a danger that is potentially only a few years away – practically around the corner in defence planning terms. To quote Winston Churchill on the urgency of rearmament in the House of Commons in 1936: “Will there be time to put our defences in order… or will the awful words ‘too late’ be recorded?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第118天。代表李予信的大律師關文渭進行結案陳詞，就被告被控「以威脅使用武力或其他非法手段」顛覆國家政權，關認為根據普通法下的詮釋原則，「非法手段」應只指涉與「實質脅迫與強迫（physical coercion and compulsion）」相關的手段，否則定義會太闊。法官問如有人用電腦病毒攻擊政府系統，是否不涉顛覆罪下的「非法手段」，辯方同意，但指這或涉恐怖活動罪，而即使《國安法》或出現漏洞，也應由立法機關而非法庭去填補。法官亦關注，《國安法》由中央草擬，為何辯方認為普通法原則適用，關引終院案例指《國安法》須與本港法律並行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，關指李予信無轉發「墨落無悔」聲明、論壇無提否決預算案，而公民黨非本案「共謀者」，控方不能將黨的行為歸咎李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方應以同類原則詮釋其他非法手段僅涉物理脅迫&quot;&gt;辯方：應以「同類原則」詮釋、「其他非法手段」僅涉物理脅迫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件今踏入結案陳詞第3日，控方上周就控罪中的「非法手段」作法律陳詞，指不限於刑事罪行及武力相關行為，議員濫用職權和違反職責也屬非法。代表李予信的大律師關文渭今代表其中13名被告作出回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭表示，就《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權罪下，「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」犯案的條文，應以「同類原則（ejusdem generis）」（即列出具體事物的前句如跟隨一個概括性字眼，後者所指事物應受前述類別所限）詮釋，當中「以武力、威脅使用武力」均涉「實質脅迫與強迫（physical coercion and compulsion）」，因此「其他非法手段」也應受此類別所限，只涉「實質脅迫與強迫」的相關行為，包括刑事恐嚇及刑事損壞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問用病毒攻擊是否不涉非法手段-辯方同意但指涉恐怖活動&quot;&gt;官問用病毒攻擊是否不涉非法手段 辯方同意但指涉恐怖活動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關並指，在22條下，如有意圖顛覆，相關手段便是非法。法官李運騰續問，那如某人有意圖顛覆，但手段不涉武力是否便不違法？關指視乎其行為是否涉「物理脅迫與強迫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續舉例，若以電腦病毒攻擊政府電腦系統，令行政立法和司法機關無法運作，又或釋放新冠病毒作生化或化學攻擊，也不屬辯方所指的「非法手段」，不會觸犯顛覆國家政權罪？關同意，但指這樣或干犯恐怖活動罪，仍受《國安法》所規限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法或有漏洞但非法庭責任填補&quot;&gt;辯方：《國安法》或有漏洞但非法庭責任填補&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，但恐怖活動罪旨在保障市民及財產，顛覆罪則保障政治制度，若辯方所言正確，《國安法》或會出現漏洞。關同意，但指法庭的責任不是要填補漏洞，這是立法機關的責任，若法庭這樣做有濫用司法權力的風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方條文每字皆有意思不冗贅列武力為限非法手段意思&quot;&gt;辯方：條文每字皆有意思不冗贅、列「武力」為限「非法手段」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭亦不認同控方所指，《國安法》目的是將所有可能危害國安的罪行都刑事化，強調人大常委制訂《國安法》條文的每隻字都有意思，不會以很多字眼表達同一意思；而假如條文針對任何非法手段，則毋須再冗贅地列出「以武力、威脅使用武力」。因此列出相關字眼，是讓人以「同類原則」理解何謂「其他非法手段」，將其意思限制為只涉武力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關並指，中國《刑法》無就「顛覆」定義，但「顛覆」一般指推翻政府權力及法律所制訂的制度，而這很少能透過非武力手段達致。而人大常委立法時已列出「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞中央或香港特區政權機關依法履行職能」等，擴闊「顛覆」的意思，故條文應同時會包含限制，即只限與武力相關的非法手段，以免意思過闊（over-breadth）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注普通法原則或不適用國安法-辯方須與本港法律並行&quot;&gt;官關注普通法原則或不適用《國安法》 辯方：須與本港法律並行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，「同類原則」乃普通法詮釋原則，但《國安法》是由「北方」（中央）草擬（drafted up in the North），為何辯方認為會適用？關引終審法院就呂世瑜案的判詞，指《國安法》須與本港法律並行（work in tandem）。李運騰指，該判詞亦指詮釋《國安法》時應考慮與維護國安有關的全國性法律，惟關回應相關法例非常簡短，無列明任何手段或是否涉武力，因此《國安法》22條特別提到「以武力、威脅使用武力」的非法手段就很能反映問題（very telling）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，《國安法》第一條提及《國安法》立法目的，或隱含「同類原則」不適用（implied exclusion）。關同意《國安法》是因2019年社會事件而訂立，但引人大常委副委員長王晨2020年5月22日就《國安法》的講話，提到立法背景是「反中亂港勢力」破壞香港社會秩序，毀損公共設施及癱瘓政府和立法會運作等，而當時在議會內有武力阻礙議會運作，不知道人大常委立法時是否欲針對該些行為。關強調，法庭必須肯定該講話排除「同類原則」的應用，才能指隱含「同類原則」不適用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方如非法手段可擴至民事過失太闊十分危險&quot;&gt;辯方：如非法手段可擴至民事過失太闊、十分危險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「非法手段」的界線，關文渭認為，若民事過失如侵入土地和誹謗也可被視為「非法手段」會十分危險。李運騰問，若該人作出相關行為時有意圖顛覆，「為什麼不可以？」關回應，那便會令條文定義「非常廣闊、太過廣闊（very wide, too wide）」。李運騰則指，《國安法》的嚴苛，某程度上是被控罪須證被告意圖顛覆的條件，而有所減輕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告否決目的為迫政府回應五大訴求基本法無禁止&quot;&gt;辯方：被告否決目的為迫政府回應五大訴求、《基本法》無禁止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關續指，重點並非「非法手段」是否只限刑事罪行，而是基於預算案內容以外的原因否決是否合法。而控方的主張是議員若考慮預算案以外的原因而否決，便屬不考慮議案內容和優劣的「無差別」否決，屬「非法」。但關指，本案有無法抗拒的證據顯示，被告否決目的是迫政府回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡即問，迫政府回應五大訴求豈不是被告的藉口，因他們知道不可能達到？關指根據各方陳詞，若說被告只是以五大訴求作為掩飾是有悖常理。關續重申，除非法律禁止，否則個人可以做任何事情，而法例沒有列明議員投票時應該或不應該考慮什麼；法例只列明要根據政府提案「審核、通過財政預算」，故如被告審視預算案後發現沒有五大訴求的內容而否決，也不能說他們沒有審視過預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李予信或於案發前已退出參與&quot;&gt;辯方：李予信或於案發前已退出參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於就李予信的案情，關文渭指李沒有參與過超級區議會的協調會議，雖有出席3月25日公民黨記者會，但沒有轉發過黨6月簽署「墨落無悔」的帖文。而就李提到否決權的選舉單張，關指是在《國安法》前印發，並於6月30日晚收回，李於《國安法》後短時間已印製沒有提到否決權的新單張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李的選舉論壇筆記提到否決預算案，關文渭指在7月4日、即《國安法》生效後數日的超區選舉論壇上，李從沒有提過否決預算案，大部分其他參與者包括鄺俊宇和涂謹申也沒有提過；而黨友鄭達鴻雖在6月19日街站提到否決預算案，但那是《國安法》前的事，至7月12日的街站無公民黨成員再提過。辯方認為就李是否在案發時間（2020年7月1日）前已退出（withdraw）參與有疑點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方不應將黨行為歸咎黨員&quot;&gt;辯方：不應將黨行為歸咎黨員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關續指，除去以上所有證據，控方指控只餘李予信的公民黨黨員身分。惟關引案例強調，單以政治連繫定罪屬危險，公民黨無被指為「共謀者」之一，不能將黨的言行歸咎黨員，而是視乎被告的個別言行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李有份拍攝、楊岳橋提到否決預算案的初選宣傳片段，關稱是於《國安法》前拍攝，由黨所剪輯和發布，只是黨的行為而非李的行為；而李初選落敗後報名港島地區直選，但那從不是組織者協議的目標。關最後指，李的供詞沒有動搖，如法庭認為他所言是正確或可能正確，應讓他脫罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭陳詞完畢後，續由代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 進行結案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第118天。所有被告的代表律師完成結案陳詞，正式結束118天的審訊，法官料約3至4個月後裁決，但不能作出保證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案指控被告以「非法手段」無差別否決預算案，意圖顛覆國家政權，控方指濫用議員職權亦屬「非法手段」。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 今陳詞指，《基本法》無規定議員應如何投票和說明何謂濫權，議員只是向選民問責，議員投票不是法律問題、是政治問題，不應由法庭裁定他們有否恰當履行職責。Beel又指，何桂藍早料會被DQ、亦認為35+不可能，故不可能意圖做出她根本知道不可能的事；而何並非要無差別否決，而是望審核預算案，即使政府回應五大訴求但財案有不公她也會反對。Beel 又指，本案整個串謀公開進行，無人相信當時所做是違法；而控方是將政治問題變成刑事罪行問題，本案案情在任何其他普通法管轄區均不會構成顛覆，而是被視為「尋常政治」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指顛覆條文模糊23條草案可助理解-官稱不相關&quot;&gt;辯方指「顛覆」條文模糊23條草案可助理解 官稱不相關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表李予信的大律師關文渭今早陳詞完畢，最後由代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 陳詞。Beel 指，根據《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權罪，被告必須「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」作出22條下的4項行為，並同時有顛覆國家政權的意圖才能入罪。惟 Beel 指條文模糊（vague），沒有訂明何謂「顛覆」和「非法手段」，提出應以2003年就《基本法》23條立法的草案去理解立法原意，當中顛覆條文包括「推翻中央人民政府」。惟法官李運騰質疑，該條例從無通過，只是本地立法機關的立法原意，但本案要處理的是人大常委的立法原意，兩者截然不同，不認為與案有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，《國安法》同樣無列明「國家政權」定義，李運騰提議以內地法律理解，惟 Beel 指內地法律指涉中央政府，但香港不是國家。李運騰續指香港政府也是行使中央所授予的權力，惟 Beel 指無證據顯示被告推翻香港政府。法官陳慶偉續引控方呈交、由清華大學法學院教授王振民等編著的《香港特別行政區維護國家安全法讀本》，指有提到就國家政權的解釋，又指「國家政權的概念是我們所不熟悉（not known to us），是內地法律制度所熟悉」，Beel 無進一步補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方非法手段應限刑事罪行法例不清晰被告不知投反對會否犯罪&quot;&gt;辯方：「非法手段」應限刑事罪行、法例不清晰被告不知投反對會否犯罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「非法手段」的定義，Beel 同意應以「同類原則」詮釋，而法庭如不接納只限與武力相關，亦應限於刑事罪行，否則便會令法律不清晰，公眾難以分辨何謂合法和非法行為，有違普通法傳統及法治精神。Beel 並指，若說「非法手段」不限於刑事罪行，是「矛盾修辭（oxymoron）」，因控方是指「你可以透過不犯法去犯法（“You can commit a crime by not commiting a crime.”）」；李運騰回應但控方仍須證明被告意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續解釋，被告達成協議時，應知道其行為將會構成刑事罪行才能入罪。李運騰問，即他們犯案前要獲得一個法律學位？Beel 否認，指對法律無知不是辯解理由，但法律應是公眾可理解。法官遂舉串謀打劫銀行的例子，指被告的參與行為可能是合法，如只是負責「睇水」或擔任司機，但若知道串謀的目的並同意參與便可構成罪行，並問此情況下控方還要證明被告知道打劫銀行是刑事罪行嗎？Beel 指不需要，因被告可從法例知道其行為是刑事罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰即說，《國安法》於6月30日通過，每人也可以閱讀條文。但 Beel 強調當中就「非法手段」定義不清晰，被告不能知道就預算案投反對票會否構成罪行，強調若法例無明文規定為犯罪行為，法庭不得加以定罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方法例無說明何謂濫權議員向選民問責法庭不應干預&quot;&gt;辯方：法例無說明何謂濫權、議員向選民問責法庭不應干預&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就控罪指被告旨在濫用當選後根據《基本法》第73條受託的職權（包括「根據政府的提案，審核、通過財政預算」），Beel 指條文只是列明立法會而非議員有的權力，且該權力是可用可不用。李運騰即指，議會獲賦予權力不代表可被濫用，但 Beel 反問「什麼是濫用？」，指《基本法》無規定議員在投票時有什麼職責、也沒有說明何謂濫權，控方亦無相關專家或案例支持，質疑是「空洞的論點」；又指這「不是法律問題，是政治問題」，反問「如何就議員有否恰當審核議案立法？審核是什麼意思？要去到什麼程度才足夠？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續引何桂藍證供，指預算案有議員無法審核的部分，如「基本工程基金」和現時已撥款130億的國安開支，議員不是不想審核，而是無法審核。而終審法院就梁國雄案的判詞，指法庭不應干預立法會內部事務，Beel 指議員如何投票沒有法律規定，是立法會內部程序問題，不是法律問題；而議員如何投票最終是向選民問責，不應由法庭裁定議員有否恰當履行職責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 又指，控方是將純粹政治議題變成刑事罪行問題，但本案案情在任何其他普通法管轄區並不會構成顛覆罪，而是會被視為尋常政治（normal politics）。法庭在本案應考慮普通法原則，而非政治考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方不應接納被告涉公職人員行為失當無人可迫特首解散立會及下台&quot;&gt;辯方：不應接納被告涉公職人員行為失當、無人可迫特首解散立會及下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦質疑控方於本案改變立場，由指控被告濫用73條的職權，移向指控沒有效忠《基本法》及香港特區。惟 Beel 強調，效忠香港特區不是效忠香港政府，立法會由人民選出，議員是對人民有義務（beholden），人民是特區的一部分。Beel 亦指控方在共謀者原則的法律爭議時，才首次提出被告《國安法》前或涉「公職人員行為失當」罪，但不被接納，現時將此論點「起死回生」，法庭也不應接納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就本案指控被告否決預算案後導致特首解散立法會及下台，Beel 強調，根據《基本法》，特首有權不解散立法會，即使解散也不會癱瘓政府，因可申請臨時撥款，亦無人可迫特首下台，除非特首提交相同預算案並被否決。而且據基本法起草委員譚耀宗指，《基本法》50至51條機制原意是讓選民決定特首或議會哪方合理，Beel 反問：「如法例容許，又怎會構成阻撓和破壞政府履行職能？」，指否決致特首下台是《基本法》提供的程序，不可能是憲政危機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方何桂藍早料會被dq不可能意圖做出協議行為&quot;&gt;辯方：何桂藍早料會被DQ、不可能意圖做出協議行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何桂藍的案情，Beel 指沒有足夠證據證明有涉案串謀協議，即使有，何桂藍亦非協議一分子，沒有意圖無差別否決預算案和顛覆國家政權。而何的證供令人耳目一新（refreshing）、誠實、毫無歉意（unapologetic）和直接，沒有提出藉口，其證供可信，望法庭採納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 並指，無論是控方證人區諾軒和何桂藍均認為民主派取得35+不可能，何於5月《國安法》訂立後已知她本人會被DQ，不可能當選和行使其權力，其後亦確實如此發生，「她如何能意圖做一些她知道做不到的事？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 同意，串謀的不可能並非辯護理由，但舉例如有人在協議謀殺另一人前，已知道那人已死了，則根本不可能意圖殺他、亦不可能串謀罪成；而本案中何亦知道不可能做到涉案行為，亦因此無意圖這樣做，她參選只是想取得高投票率，其串謀罪不應成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方何桂藍望審核預算案非無差別否決決定與五大訴求無關&quot;&gt;辯方：何桂藍望審核預算案非無差別否決、決定與五大訴求無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而若法庭不接納，Beel 亦提出何桂藍並無參與控方所指控的任何協議，指預算案需經歷兩三個月的審議階段，而何清楚說明若預算案有無法審核的部分，其預設立場便是投反對票，除非政府說服她投贊成；她亦會指出議案問題並提修正案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，何明顯並非「無差別」否決，其目的是要審核預算案，找出其弊端，而她無直接提倡五大訴求或否決預算案，其立場亦與五大訴求無關，因即使政府回應五大訴求，但預算案有不公她也會投反對。Beel 亦指，何簽署「墨落無悔」只是讓選民看到她敢於運用《基本法》賦予的權力，是個人對聲明的回應，但不是簽署協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方何桂藍僅望推動民主化向政府問責無協議無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;辯方：何桂藍僅望推動民主化向政府問責、無協議無差別否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後指，本案串謀與其他任何串謀不同，整個協調過程是公開，無人相信他們當時所做的是違法、也沒有任何要隱瞞，何桂藍亦希望公眾知道事情如何發生，以在投票時作出知情的選擇。而否決預算案的議題一開始只是次要問題（side issue），因所有人都知道他們有權對預算案投下反對票；只是在得悉提到否決或會被DQ時才開始關注，但人們當時也非關注會干犯刑事罪行，因如何桂藍所說，她從無想過「撳個反對掣」也會被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，本案純粹關乎被告對政府的挑戰，就如譚耀宗及時任中聯辦主任駱惠寧都提過民主派若立會過半，是中央所不容許，2020年選舉制度「完善」後直選議席亦大幅減少，控方是將政治問題變成成刑事罪行問題。Beel 指，何桂藍議程清晰，就是推動民主化，尋求將功能失常的立法會改革，以向政府問責，但從無協議無差別否決預算案。即使法庭認為有，Beel 亦重申無法律規定如何投票、不認為無差別否決是違法，議員只是向其選民問責，應判何桂藍無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官約3至4個月後裁決-但不能保證&quot;&gt;官：約3至4個月後裁決 但不能保證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 陳詞完畢後，所有辯方律師均完成陳詞，正式完結由今年2月6日開審、長達118天的審訊。法官陳慶偉表示，與另外兩名法官其後都要審理其他案件，不清楚需時多久作出裁決，但會盡快處理，料需約3至4個月，但強調不能作出保證，一有裁決會盡快通知各方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師關文渭另為保釋被告申請撤銷宵禁令，控方反對，法官最終批准所有被告撤宵禁令。散庭時，各被告與旁聽人士揮手道別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案不認罪的16人，包括鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林、李予信、余慧明及吳政亨。其中何桂藍、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、余慧明及吳政亨6人不獲准保釋，分別還柙逾26至33個月，其餘10人獲准保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, only a handful of countries have decided to adopt cryptocurrency as a legal tender, most prominently among them El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR). While attracted by the potential economic and monetary incentives that this move has to offer, both countries have faced significant implementation challenges, threatening to undermine their objectives and any foreseeable economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more countries – and developing economies in particular – have begun to consider integrating cryptocurrency into their national financial systems, these experiments highlight that adopting cryptocurrency as a national legal tender necessitates a certain level of preparedness, including appropriate infrastructure, public education, building trust and – last but not least – the establishment of robust financial crime prevention measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-routes&quot;&gt;Two Routes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While El Salvador and the CAR sought to adopt cryptocurrency for similar reasons, their national experiences have been quite different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador took the step of adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, with the goal of increasing investment and assisting citizens that lack access to traditional financial services. Initially, to integrate Bitcoin into its economy, the country contracted third-party companies to develop centralised cryptocurrency wallets known as “Chivo Wallets” and cryptocurrency ATMs. This government-funded project allows citizens to transfer funds quickly through the use of the “lightning network” – a solution that increased the speed of Bitcoin transactions – and without commission fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CAR moved to adopt Bitcoin in April 2022, but the government reversed its decision when the Constitutional Court declared the proposal unlawful a month after it was introduced. After this reversal, the government took a different route and created a partially Bitcoin-backed cryptocurrency, known as the Sango Coin, to be introduced in phases. The first phase would allow the public to buy into the crypto-backed currency, while the subsequent phases would allow the use of the currency for certain government services, like purchasing citizenship, e-residency and land. The CAR’s Constitutional Court ultimately rejected a scheme that would have allowed foreign investors to acquire citizenship for $60,000 worth of Sango Coins or a 250 square metre plot for $10,000 worth of Sango Coins, ruling that nationality cannot be priced in a market and that residency requires physical presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the onset of the project, the coin also promoted the tokenisation of natural resources within the country. Despite the project not initially gaining traction, as of July 2023, the CAR National Assembly revisited the concept and passed a law allowing the tokenisation of land and natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;same-motives-different-challenges&quot;&gt;Same Motives, Different Challenges?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries’ respective political leaders generally cited the potential economic benefits as their underlying rationale for promoting cryptocurrency as a national legal tender. Both countries regard this as an innovative solution to economic stagnation, poor revenue and foreign direct investment, and a reliance on third country-backed currencies. In the CAR, for example, its national currency – the CFA Franc – is backed by France and pegged to the Euro, with several restrictions in place, such as keeping 50% of the CAR’s foreign assets with the French Treasury. Some saw the CAR’s interest in cryptocurrencies as a political move away from France in an effort to lessen reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Both El Salvador and the Central African Republic suffer from a lack of appropriate infrastructure to fully realise the adoption of crypto&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in addition to these legitimate economic concerns, both El Salvador and the CAR faced stark challenges in adopting cryptocurrency as a legal tender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, both countries suffer from a lack of appropriate infrastructure to fully realise the adoption of crypto. For instance, in El Salvador, 40% of the population lacks access to the internet, a critical factor for allowing the cryptocurrency industry to flourish. Fewer than 60% of those who had internet access and mobile phones downloaded Chivo Wallet, and only 20% continued to use it. Also, according to estimates, 40% of all downloads occurred when it was launched in September 2021, and virtually no downloads took place in 2022. Meanwhile, in the CAR, according to 2021 estimates, only 11.4% of the country’s population has internet access, the electricity supply is patchy and unreliable, and mobile phone usage is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software reliability and cyber security safeguards have also become an issue for El Salvador. When the Bitcoin software first went online in the country, it struggled to verify the identity of its users. The public’s scepticism was exacerbated when hackers were able to create accounts and withdraw the $30 in Bitcoin that the country was offering to its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, transparency has been a persistent problem. The president of El Salvador’s tweets, for example, have been the only source of information enabling the public to know the amount of Bitcoin that the government has bought or sold. Similarly, the CAR declared that a Treasury-maintained partial Bitcoin reserve would support the Sango Coin, although little information about the related technicalities has been made available to the general public. Consequently, public trust in these initiatives has been low. There have also been allegations that in the case of the CAR, adopting cryptocurrency would provide a convenient avenue for Russia to evade Western sanctions, given its close ties with the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, appropriate regulatory and legal regimes were not in place prior to the introduction of a government-sponsored cryptocurrency application. The lack of anti-financial crime measures, like Know Your Customer and transaction monitoring, presented a major risk of increased illicit financial flows, especially when converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency – a risk that could also spread beyond the country’s borders. In the CAR, experts conveyed their concerns over the increased risk of financial crime due to the adoption of Bitcoin, which would ultimately impact other countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;What is clear is that adopting cryptocurrency as legal tender requires a certain amount of readiness in terms of digital infrastructure, transparency and accountability&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in addition to low transparency, the price volatility of Bitcoin has raised eyebrows as to whether or not these initiatives are truly worthwhile. Even though Bitcoin’s price volatility appears to be a better alternative for some countries than hyperinflation, El Salvador’s inflation rates are rather low, raising doubts about the effort. Besides, securing convertibility is a tough procedure with Bitcoin’s price fluctuation. Given that the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador is entirely sponsored by public funds via a trust, there is a major risk that the trust’s resources will be drained if the price of Bitcoin declines. According to estimates of the reported amount of Bitcoin purchased by El Salvador, the country has lost approximately $56 million as of June 2022. The IMF has proposed that El Salvador should support the trust through new resources or debt issuance to ensure financial stability and convertibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;important-planning-for-future-initiatives&quot;&gt;Important Planning for Future Initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear from the El Salvador and CAR experiments is that adopting cryptocurrency as legal tender requires a certain amount of readiness in terms of digital infrastructure, transparency and accountability. The most fundamental requirement is physical infrastructure. Countries must be prepared to ensure that the majority of the population has access to reliable electricity, the internet and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, transparency is key. There should be a continuous process of informing the public through official channels about advancements, Bitcoin reserves and other related topics. This should translate into teaching the public how to use crypto, as well as education on the financial risks that cryptocurrencies pose. One notable example is that El Salvador’s Ministry of Education intends to introduce a curriculum centred around Bitcoin in schools beginning in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, countries also need a robust regulatory framework in place to reduce the risk of financial crime. Without proper implementation of cyber security procedures and anti-money laundering (AML) measures around government-funded cryptocurrency applications, there is inherently a higher risk of criminal exploitation. There is already a steady threat of cryptocurrency businesses being hacked. When government funds are involved, this draws more attention from both regular users and criminals alike, and the threat only increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, countries thinking about taking the same path would be remiss to ignore these lessons. While the adoption of cryptocurrency as legal tender may have advantages, problems such as a lack of trust, transparency and accountability, as well as the absence of appropriate infrastructure and robust financial crime prevention measures, may hinder the realisation of the desired economic benefits of cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方質疑控方詮釋「非法手段」無邊無際 僅搬《國安法》「尚方寶劍」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uIM39qS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）踏入審訊第117天，辯方續進行結案陳詞。代表鄭達鴻及梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙指，《基本法》已預想否決預算案的情況和應對，難以想像會被視為空前憲政危機和政治不穩，被告根據《基本法》行事不大可能意圖顛覆國家政權。而兩人均認為「35+」不可能，無意圖參與串謀，當中鄭會審視財案優劣投票，梁過往則因沒有全民退保而否決，但與他人無協議亦無意圖顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而對控方稱被告以「非法手段」顛覆政權不限於刑事罪行、亦涵蓋濫用議員職權，代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑質疑該詮釋「無邊無際」、欠案例支持，只是搬出《國安法》這把「尚方寶劍」；代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉亦指違反職責不能構成「非法」，法律亦無明文規定議員不可不按議案優劣否決。此外，鄒家成一方指他發起「墨落無悔」僅表達對戴耀廷毋須簽協議的失望，並非協議，也從無主張推翻中國政府；柯耀林一方則指他簽「墨落」是受政治環境所迫。案件下周一續審，辯方將繼續進行結案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告知無可能取得35無意圖作出串謀協議&quot;&gt;辯方：被告知無可能取得35+、無意圖作出串謀協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻和梁國雄的資深大律師潘熙今先進行結案陳詞，表示就二人所屬的香港島和新界東選區，控方未能毫無合理疑點證明參與者有達成協議；而即使有協議達成，協議文件提到「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權亦是為參與者提供彈性，不代表一定要否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘續指，就算被告的協議存在，控方亦未能毫無合理疑點證明二人有意圖作出涉案協議行為、是串謀一分子，而可作此推論的證據，包括被告知道民主派無可能在立法會取得35+議席。李運騰即引案例指就算被告認為串謀不會成功，但執行串謀計劃仍屬有罪，潘同意，但重申二人並無此意圖實踐。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方基本法已預想否決機制不大可能以此顛覆國家政權&quot;&gt;辯方：《基本法》已預想否決機制、不大可能以此顛覆國家政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，《基本法》第50至52條已預想（envisage）否決預算案後的政治情況及應對機制（兩次否決致解散立法會及特首下台），難以想像會被視為「空前憲政危機」和「政治不穩」，若被告只是做《基本法》所容許的事，不大可能是意圖參與涉案串謀和顛覆國家政權；而《基本法》亦列明即使否決預算案，特首也可申請臨時撥款、政府仍可運作，案中無證據顯示被告意圖連此撥款也否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官李運騰質疑，臨時撥款有別於財政預算案，難道不會嚴重干擾政府執行職能？潘熙回應不需說到這麼遠，強調《基本法》由人大落實，不大可能根據《基本法》來顛覆國家政權，就二人是否意圖顛覆存有合理疑點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方鄭達鴻會視乎預算案優劣投票很可能與黨有不同立場&quot;&gt;辯方：鄭達鴻會視乎預算案優劣投票、很可能與黨有不同立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對兩名被告，潘熙指鄭達鴻案發時是關注民生和草根的區議員，真誠信相政府是理性，會與議員磋商，而鄭會視乎預算案優劣及政府抛出橄欖枝的程度決定如何投票，即使政府不回應五大訴求，他也可能投贊成。潘又強調，對鄭而言，五大訴求與其他港人的合法訴求均是他想要達到的目標（end），而不是用來顛覆的手段（means）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，鄭的立場很大可能與公民黨不同，他供稱黨內權力不平衡、他不能改變黨政策。而公民黨盡力遵守《國安法》，於《國安法》生效前召開會議，並改用「無字政綱」等，鄭作為法律學生，真誠相信《基本法》機制是讓行政與立法會機關互相制衡，若不是本案，原本會坐在其旁邊幫忙處理案件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方指港島協調文件指每名選民可投4票，與最終共識投1票不同，就提到運用否決權的該文件是否最終協議有疑點，鄭亦沒有收到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方社民連不同意政治攬炒&quot;&gt;辯方：社民連不同意「政治攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於梁國雄，潘指控方證據非常薄弱，當中以社民連6月的〈社會民主連線回應當前香港政治形勢變化的決議文〉指控他會無差別否決預算案，潘指文章表明不同意「政治攬炒」，反而是利用「具有憲制認許，合法合憲的權力機構」的「全面否決權」發揮制衡，亦表明只是否決「惡法和不義撥款」，非無差別否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方梁國雄因無全民退保否決與他人無協議&quot;&gt;辯方：梁國雄因無全民退保否決、與他人無協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，梁國雄曾在選舉論壇提及沒有簽署「墨落無悔」，因「睇到佢係重複返35+嗰個初衷嘅啫」，又指自己做多年議員「年年都」否決，似乎梁明知否決預算案是「35+」的初衷仍參與。潘熙強調應審視所有證據、不能斷章取義，梁並無簽署「墨落」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉亦指梁以往都否決，不代表他在2020年這樣做就是正確。潘熙同意，但強調梁並非無差別否決作「攬炒」，只因沒有全民退保的民生議題而否決，同意法官李運騰指，即使其行為與其他人相似，但他否決是另有原因，與其他人沒有協議，也沒意圖顛覆。法官陳慶偉一度問，既然如此，那梁為何參與初選？又指戴耀廷在初選文件列明要認同五大訴求才能參選。潘重申，沒有證據梁為何參與初選，而參選亦不代表會否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方違反職責遠不至於非法&quot;&gt;辯方：「違反職責」遠不至於「非法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉，強調控方須就所有控罪詳情舉證，又指難以理解，為何否決預算案導致解散立法會和特首下台這個由《基本法》提供的機制會是「非法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對「非法手段」的爭議，控方昨表示不一定涉刑事罪行，同意只是「違反議員職責（breach of duty）」也可入罪。潘熙表示「非法手段」必然指涉刑事罪行，馬維騉亦舉例，若有大律師完全無視專業守則、無法勝任並破壞行業的名聲，他的確是違反專業守則訂明的職責，但不能說其行為是「非法」；而就法官陳慶偉昨舉例若在民事審訊因其中一方是朋友而裁定他勝訴，其裁決也是非法，馬則指法官的裁決可能是不公或會被推翻，但同樣遠遠不至於「非法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方法律無明文規定不可不按議案優劣否決控方須另證顛覆意圖&quot;&gt;辯方：法律無明文規定不可不按議案優劣否決、控方須另證顛覆意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，但本案關乎沒有履行《基本法》下的議員職責。馬同意，但指刑事法律的基本原則，是除非法律禁止，否則個人可以做任何事情。而法律上列明議員職責，但沒有明文規定議員不可以不根據議案優劣來否決任何議案，強調控方所指違反《基本法》下的議員職責本身並不能構成非法手段（“A breach of duty cannot per se amount to unlawful means.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬亦指，控方指被告無差別否決預算案構成顛覆的說法，不可能正確，強調除了證明被告意圖無差別否決預算案，控方亦須另外證明被告意圖顛覆國家政權，否則就會是「循環論證」。馬最後指，陳曾任認真盡責的議員8年，望法庭考慮他有良好品格，其證供有可信性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方墨落無悔非協議僅表達對戴耀廷失望&quot;&gt;辯方：「墨落無悔」非協議、僅表達對戴耀廷失望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑則表示，不同人就否決有不同看法和願景，無證據顯示就否決有達成廣泛共識。法官李運騰指，但鄒家成作為「墨落無悔」發起人，至少與其他兩名發起人有協議，陳世傑回應即使3人就否決有協議，也並非本案所指的串謀協議，亦無證據顯示他同意「無差別」否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，「墨落無悔」只是被告表達對戴耀廷毋須簽署協議的失望與情緒（frustration and sentiment），簽署者只是抱有相同情感，但並非達成協議；而聲明只是呼籲不要投沒有抗爭意志的參選人，當中提到否決預算案但沒有提及「無差別」否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方鄒家成從無主張推翻中國政府僅想利用立法會改善制度&quot;&gt;辯方：鄒家成從無主張推翻中國政府、僅想利用立法會改善制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，區諾軒稱35+的初心是為取得立會過半，獲取更大的議價能力，這亦是各被告認知和參與初選的原因，惟戴耀廷卻試將其看法加諸其他人身上不果。而鄒家成從沒表示有意圖推翻中國政府，其主要關注只是推動本土主義和香港人優先，特首下台和癱瘓立法會也對他沒有意義，因特首永遠都可有替代人選，而鄒是想利用立法會來改變腐敗不公的制度，想作出「改善」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方就非法手段詮釋欠案例支持僅搬出國安法此尚方寶劍&quot;&gt;辯方：控方就「非法手段」詮釋欠案例支持、僅搬出《國安法》此「尚方寶劍」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就法律爭議，陳指「非法手段」應指涉刑事罪行，並形容控方就「非法手段」的定義無邊無際（no boundary），不限於刑事罪行、不止於民事過失，幾乎任何事情都可以是「非法」。陳反問，就控方主張只是濫用議員職權就屬「非法」，「我們有案例和法例支持嗎？沒有」，「控方只是聲稱因為我們在處理《國安法》案件，這是《國安法》，這是尚方寶劍，所以法庭要這樣解讀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引終審法院就呂世瑜案的判詞，指對《國安法》的理解要與本地法律並行（in tandem with），故即使是國安案件，也不代表不應考慮海外案例。陳總結，認為被告沒有協議、沒有意圖顛覆、控方亦無法證明被告無差別否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方柯耀林參選為試水溫非無差別否決&quot;&gt;辯方：柯耀林參選為「試水溫」非無差別否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅表示，針對柯的證據非常薄弱，其選舉經理供稱他參加初選只是為了「試水溫」，以測試有否足夠支持度參與正式立法會選舉，而非要無差別否決預算案。法官陳仲衡問，柯在法庭外向其選舉經理作出的陳述（out-of-court statement）有何證據價值，葉指選舉經理與柯一起進行競選工程，有身位解釋柯參選原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續指，柯的政綱無提及否決預算案，集中民生議題，而他是區政聯盟區議員，其支持是靠社區議題而非激進政治理念，他提出的教育和經濟等政綱亦需政府預算案支持。葉又指，就其參選宣言提到「暴政不斷利用惡法」等，均是「政治修辭」，形容當時香港的政治氣氛下有大規模反政府示威，作為泛民「起碼要以某種形式」顯示對政府的反對，但不能證明柯有串謀無差別否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方柯耀林簽墨落受政治環境所迫&quot;&gt;辯方：柯耀林簽「墨落」受政治環境所迫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於柯簽署「墨落無悔」，葉指其 WhatsApp 紀錄顯示他簽署並非因他同意當中內容，只因其他候選人已簽署，他不想顯得保守，是受政治環境所迫、以免落後於對手，強調不能以此證明他參與串謀。法官陳慶偉一度問，柯是否向選民作出虛假陳述、是說出「半真半假的話（half-truth）」？葉重申他正進行競選，最重要是就柯參與初選目的有疑點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林一方陳詞完畢，尚餘代表李予信的大律師關文渭及代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel。關文渭指需時準備回應控方法律爭議的聯合陳詞，望申請於周一前呈交，周二開庭處理。陳慶偉拒絕，指示於周一呈交及開庭處理，Beel 同日亦會進行陳詞。案件周一（12月4日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第116天，控辯雙方進行口頭結案陳詞。控方就法律爭議陳詞，就被告被控串謀以「威脅使用武力或其他非法手段」顛覆國家政權，控方認為《國安法》原意為防範任何危害國安的行為，「其他非法手段」不限與武力相關、亦不一定涉刑事罪行，被告無差別否決預算案，濫用《基本法》下的議員職權亦屬「非法」；又指今時今日對抗政權無需「暴力革命」，散播謠言也能危害國安，若狹窄詮釋控罪定義會違立法原意。控方亦認為毋須證明被告知道其行為是非法也可入罪。法官陳慶偉預料本案會在3至4個月後裁決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;事隔3個月開庭-旁聽親友向被告揮手&quot;&gt;事隔3個月開庭 旁聽親友向被告揮手&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今天是初選案事隔3個月後再開庭，法院外有約10名軍裝警和傳媒聯絡隊戒備，「王婆婆」王鳳瑤則揮動英國旗，及舉起「Free 47 Free all 立即釋放所有政治犯」的紙牌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;還柙被告步入法庭時，旁聽親友向他們揮手，有人向身穿深啡長褸、樽領灰色毛衣的鄒家成說：「靚仔咗喎！」，鄒露齒微笑，吳政亨亦與旁聽席打手勢溝通。有份代表認罪被告的資深大律師李志喜和大律師吳靄儀亦坐在延伸庭律師席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方其他非法手段應與武力相關-控方不必然涉武力&quot;&gt;辯方：「其他非法手段」應與武力相關 控方：不必然涉武力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方早前提交結案陳詞，部分被告亦就法律觀點作聯合陳詞，控方今就法律陳詞作出回應，而辯方獲准於下周一（12月4日）前提交書面陳詞回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權罪，列明任何人組織、策劃、實施或參與實施「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段（other unlawful means）」，旨在顛覆國家政權行為即屬犯罪。辯方爭議「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」一句應以「同類原則（ejusdem generis）」詮釋，由於前句為「武力、威脅使用武力」，故「其他非法手段」應只指涉與武力相關的手段。副刑事檢控專員萬德豪反駁，詮釋條文時應全面考慮立法脈絡和目的，而《國安法》目的為防範、制止和懲治任何危害國安的行為和活動，以有效維護國家安全，當中無限於武力手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對辯方比較分裂國家罪及顛覆國家政權罪條文用字，前者提到「不論是否使用武力或者以武力相威脅，即屬犯罪」，認為前者才指明非武力手段，後者並沒有。萬德豪反駁兩者寫法不同，指顛覆政權條文中「武力、威脅使用武力」為一個類別，「其他非法手段」則為另一個類別，前者與武力有關，後者則為武力以外的其他非法手段，立法者使用此較概括（general）的字眼，是為了更有效維護國家安全。法官李運騰問，控方立場是辯方詮釋不合理，因會收窄條文用途，有違《國安法》立法原意？萬德豪同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方對抗政府無需暴力散播謠言也可危害國安&quot;&gt;控方：對抗政府無需暴力、散播謠言也可危害國安&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到顛覆罪條文主要針對政治制度及政府履行職能，而恐怖活動罪則針對公眾安全及財產，並指理解要破壞後者必然涉及暴力，但破壞前者是否未必涉及暴力？萬德豪同意，指顛覆罪條文旨在保障政治制度和政府機關，若將破壞相關制度的手段限制為武力是不合理；又指以往一般認為需以「暴力革命」對抗政權，但在21世紀的今天，環境完全不同，要對抗政權不一定需要暴力，而社交媒體令資訊傳播變得容易和方便，人們可利用這些渠道達到危害國家安全的目的，散播謠言也能對政權和政府架構造成影響，狹窄詮釋條文是不正確和不恰當。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方非法手段不限於刑事罪行-被告違議員職責亦屬非法&quot;&gt;控方：「非法手段」不限於刑事罪行 被告違議員職責亦屬非法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於辯方爭議「非法手段」須限於「刑事罪行」（criminal offence），控方不同意，指根據字典，「非法」不止限於「干犯刑事罪行」，又指《國安法》理應是有力有效的法律，若條文難以執行、須先證被告干犯刑事罪行，「製作這樣的法律有什麼意義？」法官李運騰指，辯方或反駁此為顯示罪行的嚴重性，因可囚終身，萬德豪重申考慮立法目的，條文字眼應採用較闊而非較窄的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，「非法」可分為兩個層面，首先就刑事罪行層面，本案被告宣誓擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區，但最終串謀無差別否決預算案，便可能干犯發假誓或串謀公職人員行為失當；而若法庭不接納，控方亦認為應考慮被告對《基本法》的「態度」，指被告濫用議員職權也屬「非法」，因他們沒有擁護《基本法》及效忠特區，違反（breach）《基本法》下的議員職責及《基本法》的核心原則。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度問，若在一宗民事訴訟中理應由原告勝出，但法官因與被告相熟而判他勝訴，那其動機是否濫用職權，令其判決非法？萬德豪同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就辯方援引海外案例指被告是運用憲制權力否決預算案，萬德豪指該案例亦強調議員並非橡皮圖章，投票前須審視議案，與本案的無差別否決不同。法官李運騰則指，其他地區是主權國家，與香港情況很不同，在其他地方合法的事情在香港未必合法，不能直接套用香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方毋須證被告知道行為犯法亦可入罪&quot;&gt;控方：毋須證被告知道行為犯法亦可入罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後就辯方爭議，控方須證明被告犯案時知道所作行為是非法，而被告相信其行為不違法可構成合理辯解。控方回應，「非法」一詞並不涉任何精神意念元素（mental elements），只是用來形容被告的「犯罪行為（actus reus）」而非「犯罪意圖（mens rea）」，因此「無論被告是否相信其行為是合法，也沒有關係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，本案並非「嚴格法律責任」（strict liability）的罪行（即沒有犯罪意圖也可入罪），控方須證被告有意圖顛覆國家政權。控方同意，但舉例就誤殺罪，終院亦裁定被告是否知道所作行為是非法並不重要，認為相同邏輯可應用在本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方有足夠證據吳政亨與各被告涉同一串謀&quot;&gt;控方：有足夠證據吳政亨與各被告涉同一串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續提及，發起「三投三不投」的吳政亨一方主張，就算吳與戴耀廷有協議，也並非本案指控的協議，又指除了戴耀廷外，其他被告均不認識吳政亨，即使區諾軒和趙家賢亦不認為他是計劃一分子。萬德豪指共謀者不一定要互相認識，強調有足夠證據推論吳政亨與所有其他被告涉同一串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官料約3至4個月後裁決&quot;&gt;官料約3至4個月後裁決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方陳詞完畢，就案情的陳詞則依賴書面陳詞。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 其後申請押後至周五就法律觀點回應，但法官陳慶偉認為沒有需要，指可先聽取就事實方面的陳詞；又指法官李運騰將處理另一宗案件（《蘋果日報》案12月18日開審，料審期83天），而他和法官陳仲衡於2024年亦有其他案件要處理。Beel 問及裁決的大約時間，陳慶偉估計約在3至4個月後。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kDICuF4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第116天，辯方進行結案陳詞。代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘表示，本案要在香港的獨特背景下審視，當中爭取雙普選是《基本法》的莊嚴承諾，而案發時香港已回歸23年，爭取普選之路也已持續23年，「35+計劃」是其中一部分；兩人從無提倡顛覆政府機關和推翻憲制秩序，只是相信香港的制度，尋求向政權問責和追求《基本法》承諾的雙普選，「那不可能是顛覆」、「不應是顛覆」，望法庭判處二人無罪。石亦指，發起「三投三不投」的吳政亨只是熱心協助戴耀廷的「粉絲」，與戴無就初選後行為有協議；而余慧明雖表明有意否決預算案爭取五大訴求，但無與他人協議一起否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林卓廷和黃碧雲一方則指二人無簽「墨落無悔」，無足夠證據顯示二人同意無差別否決；何啟明一方稱他簽署「墨落」不代表一定會否決；楊雪盈一方亦指她從無表明無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方吳政亨不關心35後的事與戴耀廷無就當選後行為有協議&quot;&gt;辯方：吳政亨不關心35+後的事、與戴耀廷無就當選後行為有協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早就法律爭議陳詞完畢，續由辯方陳詞。代表吳政亨和余慧明的大律師石書銘表示，二人情況較其他被告「獨特（unique）」，發起「三投三不投」的吳政亨沒有參選；余慧明雖參選衞生服務界，但沒有參與任何協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘指，若說吳政亨與戴耀廷有任何協議，只是限於「三投三不投」計劃及就初選投票日提供協助，而非本案指控與其他被告的串謀協議，因二人無討論過初選後的事，及勝選者入立會後會做什麼；又指從吳的受訪錄音及電郵紀錄，他只是關心如何取得35+，不關心取得35+後的事，他亦曾指在「攬炒書」（「墨落無悔」）和初選之間只能擇其一，會寧願「初選成事先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方吳政亨僅熱心提供協助的粉絲對否決預算案無立場&quot;&gt;辯方：吳政亨僅熱心提供協助的「粉絲」、對否決預算案無立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘強調，若控方案情推到最高，也只能推論吳政亨對戴耀廷辦初選知情、與戴就35+的重要性意見一致，但就如何達成35+、議席分配及有否約束力等，二人沒有協議。石又指，吳與戴的 WhatsApp 對話並沒有提過否決預算案，而吳似是戴的「粉絲」、熱心提供協助，但戴的態度較為冷淡；對控方指二人關係密切，石指吳2016年只是戴耀廷「雷動計劃」的其中一名參與義工，與共謀者相距甚遠，該距離直至本案發生仍未跨越。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石強調，吳於本案僅為「輔助」（auxiliary）角色，屬旁觀者，他嘗試呼籲公眾支持初選，但不代表支持否決預算案；又指區諾軒和趙家賢均不認識吳，趙更稱吳的計劃與他和民主動力籌辦的初選無關。石亦重申，吳無論在《國安法》前後均對否決預算案沒有立場，認為首要是爭取35+，細節之後再傾，亦曾提過望「三投三不投」就否決的議題保持中立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方余慧明無與他人協議否決預算案與政府有談判空間&quot;&gt;辯方：余慧明無與他人協議否決預算案、與政府有談判空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於余慧明，石書銘指她沒有參與地區直選、無參選任何協調會議和論壇，而雖然她表明有意否決預算案來爭取五大訴求，但一直獨自行事，不代表會與其他參與者一起否決預算案，亦沒有與其他地區參選人討論和達成協議一起否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，但余也有參與初選、簽署「墨落無悔」、競選材料提及否決預算案，是否可推論她是串謀一分子？石指可作此推論，但並非唯一無可抗拒推論，又指余簽署「墨落」只因同意當中兩點，而聲明中提到的共識及替補機制與她無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，無從知道政府會如何回應五大訴求、或余入立會後會如何投票，形容這是一個「政治的情況」，並非簡單的「yes or no」，永遠都有「互相讓步（give and take）」；而就余在罷工的經驗，顯然她認為與政府有談判空間，而非不能妥協、要無差別否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，余雖看似「幼稚」的政治素人，但也明白五大訴求不能全部即時實現，否決只是談判策略；而余認為雙普選最重要，若政府未能提供普選時間表才會否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告只是追求落實基本法承諾的雙普選-不能是顛覆&quot;&gt;辯方：被告只是追求落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選 不能是顛覆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘最後總結指，區諾軒也認同整個『35+計劃』是香港爭取普選之路的一部分，而本案要在香港的獨特背景下審視——本案發生時，香港已回歸中國23年，按照《基本法》承諾爭取普選之路也已持續23年。而吳政亨和余慧明均從無提倡流血衝突、並非尋求顛覆政府機關、也不是要推翻憲制秩序。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石強調，二人只是信賴一個在《基本法》實施、香港回歸中國時所許下的莊嚴承諾，「對我們的制度、法律框架和憲制秩序有信心」。歸根究底，他們只不過是尋求向政權問責、想根據憲制帶來政策改變、想追求《基本法》承諾的雙普選，「那不可能是顛覆（that cannot be subversive）」，「那不應是顛覆（that should not be subversive）」，請求法庭判處二人無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林卓廷黃碧雲無簽墨落黃受壓下仍稱有需要才用憲制權力&quot;&gt;辯方：林卓廷黃碧雲無簽「墨落」、黃受壓下仍稱有需要才用憲制權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷和黃碧雲的大律師沈士文則表示，沒有足夠證據顯示二人同意無差別否決預算案，二人只是同意參與初選，但政綱無提及否決預算案，其選區無就無差別否決達成共識，而二人沒有簽署「墨落無悔」，亦無證據顯示他們知道和支持「墨落」。沈指，控方唯一餘下指控二人的證據，分別是黃碧雲的初選論壇發言，及從林卓廷搜得的初選論壇筆記，而他已於陳詞分析相關證據的比重，不再重複。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注，黃碧雲在選舉論壇提到「我哋係會用盡憲制裡面所有權力同埋手段去爭取五大訴求，如果否決財政預算案能夠促成呢樣野，我哋一定會做」。沈指黃提到運用憲制權力，是呼應提名表格上有關擁護《基本法》及效忠特區的條款；而黃當時被較激進的參選人「夾（corner）」，但即使受壓仍向選民承諾，是在有需要時運用《基本法》賦予的憲制權力，與控方指她濫權否決財案相反。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方楊雪盈從無提否決預算案非其他候選人靈童&quot;&gt;辯方：楊雪盈從無提否決預算案、非其他候選人「靈童」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良表示，楊案發時只曾任區議員約5年，熱心服務社區，法庭應整體考慮其背景推論其意圖。雖然她初選落敗仍報名立法會選舉，但並非受其他候選人指派代為參選的「靈童」，而是顯示她不按協議自行行事。而區諾軒曾指楊無就否決預算案表達意見、趙家賢稱就戴耀廷提否決預算案，楊曾向他指「咪由佢講吓先囉」，都可顯示其心態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良又指，楊雪盈只是想參與立法會選舉，雖其名字出現在「墨落無悔」，但只是出現在他人 Facebook 而非其個人 Facebook，無證據顯示她同意簽署。而楊雖有出席7月9日初選記者會，但發言不足一分鐘亦沒有內容；就法官李運騰提到其參選宣言稱要達成立會過半，「令政府正面回應五大訴求」，該文亦只是從辦公室電腦搜得，她從沒有發布。李運騰一度指這可證她對計劃的認知（knowledge），惟張強調，有此認知不代表楊同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又指，楊不曾在論壇提及無差別否決預算案，亦從無提及中央政府等，她不關注五大訴求和否決預算案，反而想爭取撥款，針對她的證據非常有限，應判處無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方何啟明只知初選目的爭立會過半簽墨落不代表必否決&quot;&gt;辯方：何啟明只知初選目的爭立會過半、簽「墨落」不代表必否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀表示會依賴書面陳詞，沒有口頭補充。至於代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明則指，何只是知道初選目的是爭取立會過半，不包括無差別否決預算案；而雖然他沒有如岑子杰般在會議表明反對否決權，但沉默不代表支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明又指，何從沒有在論壇提及否決預算案，而其帖文提到「警暴橫行欺壓市民，公帑絕不能有一分一毫再落入惡貫滿盈的警隊手上」，亦不是否決所有撥款，而是反對撥款增加裝備。而就何簽署「墨落」，阮強調，何同意向政府施壓要求回應五大訴求，但不代表他一定會否決，因他理解該權力是可用可不用，亦無證據顯示他同意無論政府是否回應五大訴求都無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the enhanced Indo-Pacific strategies of the US, Canada and their European partners, as they have fleshed out their respective approaches in a series of important policy documents. But there has been far less research on how governments in the Indo-Pacific view the rhetorical and real-word implications of intensified Western engagement. As part of an ongoing RUSI–Chatham House project on transatlantic cooperation, this Policy Brief seeks to explore how key partners in the Indo-Pacific have perceived and responded to recent North American and European efforts in the region. To what extent do Indo-Pacific countries view these as part of a concerted transatlantic or Western approach, and how would such an approach accord with their interests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than offering a comprehensive study of such a large region, this brief focuses on the perspectives of a selection of Indo-Pacific states that transatlantic governments have identified as priority partners in shaping the future regional order. This includes an inner ring of US allies that have most openly embraced the renewed transatlantic interest in the region, and tougher stances toward China: Japan; Australia; and South Korea. It also includes an outer ring of mostly non-aligned partners that have been more circumspect, welcoming enhanced diplomatic engagement, but raising concerns about the long-term commitment of the transatlantic powers, and the risk that more robust China policies could inflame tensions with Beijing, rather than bringing balance to the region. This group includes India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These groups are not, of course, uniform in their attitudes, which tend to differ across different issues, as is to be expected when dealing with broad geographical spaces such as the Indo-Pacific and transatlantic regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Policy Brief draws on interviews with senior government officials and experts, as well as a review of open-source data on national security priorities. Interviews took place in Hanoi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, London, New York City, Singapore, Washington, DC and other locations between October 2022 and August 2023. The brief does not consider China’s approach to the Indo-Pacific strategies of transatlantic partners in the brief, because these strategies are broadly targeted at China, rather than considering China a partner in the execution of transatlantic policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-inner-ring-australia-japan-and-south-korea&quot;&gt;The Inner Ring: Australia, Japan and South Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US’s closest regional allies – Japan, Australia and South Korea – have been the strongest supporters of intensified regional engagement from transatlantic partners, actively seeking to encourage and shape their involvement, across security, economics, technology and other contested domains. While there are differences of tone and emphasis, this crucial trio broadly shares the analytical framework through which the US and Europe see the Indo-Pacific. Further, the transatlantic partners and this trio share some overarching regional objectives, such as: balancing China’s rising power and assertiveness; pursuing economic de-risking vis-à-vis China; and providing developing economies in Asia with diplomatic and economic options that can boost their resilience. Over the past couple of years, officials from these three countries have expanded and deepened their conversations with North American and European counterparts as they explore areas in which they can learn from one another and, ultimately, better coordinate policies where there are substantial areas of overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and Australia are most closely aligned with the US and Europe. Tokyo and Canberra share transatlantic concerns about the rise of China and its increasing assertiveness: from Beijing’s defence modernisation and deployment of military capabilities to its use of economic coercion, disinformation and other tools of interference beneath the threshold of armed conflict, and its ambition to reshape the international order. New South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has brought his country closer to the positions of Australia and Japan, with his government publishing its own Indo-Pacific strategy in December 2022, and distancing itself from the concerns of his predecessor, Moon Jae-in. But the Yoon administration’s National Security Strategy, published in June 2023, frames the challenge as being the “intensification of US–China strategic competition”, in contrast to how Japan, Australia and transatlantic partners frame China itself as the chief challenge. The concluding statement of the Camp David trilateral summit between the leaders of the US, Japan and South Korea in August 2023 was markedly more restrained in its discussion of China than the final communiqué of the May 2023 summit of the G7, which includes Japan and key transatlantic governments, but not South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While officials and policy experts interviewed from Australia, Japan and South Korea generally did not view their partnerships with the US and Europe through an explicitly transatlantic lens, they universally welcomed increased efforts to discuss shared objectives and work towards better policy coordination in the region. This is happening across a range of overlapping platforms and issues, mirroring the complex arrangements through which the US and Europe are trying to better work together in the region. This reflects US efforts to build a “latticework” of alliances and partnerships that are “more flexible, ad hoc, more political than legal, sometimes more temporary than permanent”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On economics, the US, Europe and Japan are seeking to build a common approach and manage competitive differences over industrial policy through the G7. Neither Australia nor South Korea is a G7 member but, under the rubric of “G7+”, they were both invited to the Hiroshima summit in May 2023, alongside the leaders of Brazil, Comoros, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. Outside of summits, European and North American officials are also engaging with their Australian, Japanese and South Korean counterparts in much more frequent discussions and dialogues about the economic and technological challenges presented by China, and how to ensure development assistance and infrastructure investment in the Indo-Pacific is more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On traditional security, Japan, Australia and South Korea are increasing their engagement with NATO, participating in a NATO summit for the first time in June 2022, and again in 2023. It should be acknowledged, however, that this is in part a response to the war in Ukraine, as well as being a result of transatlantic engagement in the Indo-Pacific. In a show of less-than-perfect transatlantic cooperation, the proposal for a regional liaison office in Tokyo that might have supported a coordinated response to shared security challenges was opposed by French President Emmanuel Macron. Ben Wallace, the then British defence secretary, seemed to support the proposal in comments made in Singapore in June 2023 but, in a subsequent interview, he expressed understanding for the French position and concern about NATO “mission creep” to the Indo-Pacific. Nevertheless, the bilateral “tailored partnership programmes” that Japan and South Korea signed with NATO in 2023 suggest there is agreement across the Alliance on the rising importance of Asian partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no intention to build a comprehensive, synthesised approach to the Indo-Pacific, Australia, Japan and South Korea are all looking to push their cooperation with North America and Europe to a new level through a web of overlapping platforms and priorities anchored in the US alliance system. Japan, Australia and the US are seeking to coordinate their security and economic cooperation with one another and India through the “Quad”. Australia, the UK and the US are deepening their military-to-military and military–industrial engagement through AUKUS. And, despite the historical tribulations of Japan–South Korea relations, both governments have pledged to strengthen trilateral cooperation with the US across traditional security, economic security and other regional issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-in-the-outer-ring-india-indonesia-singapore-vietnam-and-the-philippines&quot;&gt;Challenges in the Outer Ring: India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the core trio, five other important states in the Indo-Pacific – India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines – have taken a more selective and transactional approach to enhanced transatlantic engagement in the region. This reflects the fact that, aside from the Philippines, none of these states is a formal military ally of the US, and all have distinctive traditions of foreign policy independence. Aside from Singapore, they are developing economies with leaderships that are under pressure to deliver growth and jobs. According to the sources interviewed for this brief, these five countries want the US and its transatlantic allies to help maintain a stable balance of power in the region, but they also fear that the intensity of Washington’s competition with China could be a destabilising force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic partners’ economic engagement looks particularly disjointed to those in this circle. Unwilling for domestic political reasons to offer market access, the US is pursuing instead a vague Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). The five countries discussed here are all participating in early IPEF negotiations, but regional officials say it is too early to tell whether these talks can deliver an economic benefit. The UK is seeking bilateral trade deals, and has acceded to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam, but not the US, which pulled out of a predecessor agreement in 2017, or the EU. Meanwhile, the EU’s Global Gateway and the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment remain nascent initiatives, with regional officials sceptical about their ability to deliver tangible, rapid benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One further key challenge is the Indo-Pacific concept itself. Although many advocates of the Indo-Pacific framing see it as a way to embrace a bigger regional role for India, India’s own view of the Indo-Pacific does not tally neatly with those of the US and Europe. The reinvigorated Quad is often painted as a balancing coalition against China, but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stipulated that India “does not see the Indo-Pacific region as a strategy or as a club of limited members. Nor as a grouping that seeks to dominate. And by no means do we consider it as directed against any country”. India’s own initiatives for the region, such as the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and the Indian Ocean vision of “Security and Growth for All in the Region”, are framed in inclusive terms, as is ASEAN’s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. Nevertheless, there is growing consensus in India about the need for a tougher approach to Beijing, in the aftermath of the flare-up of tensions along its border with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has also stepped up its engagement with specific transatlantic countries, including the US, the UK and France. However, India’s maintenance of its historical relationship with Russia, despite the invasion of Ukraine, is a reminder that – as is the case within the transatlantic community – not all Indo-Pacific countries will accept Manichean framings of the region as an arena for a battle of democracies versus autocracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is yet more divergence when it comes to Southeast Asia. Officials and policy experts in that region welcome many aspects of Western plans for the Indo-Pacific, but have concerns that the hardening US approach to China, in particular, may antagonise rather than deter Beijing, and that new frameworks and institutions such as the Quad may bypass or undermine the region’s existing ASEAN-anchored architecture. ASEAN member states are concerned with maintaining “ASEAN centrality” in countries’ approaches to the Indo-Pacific, noting that this is the “underlying principle for promoting cooperation in the … region”. In other words, they would prefer that ASEAN institutions and platforms are the vehicles through which partners implement their Indo-Pacific strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who took office in June 2022, has shed the anti-American approach of his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, and is intensifying security cooperation with Washington as China increases the pressure on the Philippines in disputed parts of the South China Sea. But other governments in this outer ring remain concerned that the US and its transatlantic allies are too heavily focused on competing with, if not containing, China. Key officials and policy experts in Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam fear that the US and European governments could unnecessarily antagonise Beijing, prompting an escalatory spiral that will cost their region much more than it will the Euro-Atlantic. Numerous Southeast Asian officials indicated that Western government narratives that criticised China’s infrastructure investments and framed competition with Beijing as that between democracy and autocracy had fallen flat. However, it should be noted that this has not caused Singapore and Vietnam to hesitate in improving their military ties with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many officials and policy experts expressed a dual fear that the US might abandon the region if US politics turns further inward, and also that it might become too aggressive toward China, which could trigger a potentially devastating conflict in the Indo-Pacific. These perceptions about likely trajectories in US policy also colour expectations among regional partners about what Europe will do, due to the widely held belief that European policy toward the Indo-Pacific largely tracks that of its premier security guarantor, the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communicating their various Indo-Pacific approaches, the US and European governments have tended to stress like-mindedness as a basis for working with a broad array of regional partners, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. Yet those governments have diverse views on the Indo-Pacific, and do not view their engagement in the region through a “transatlantic” lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the US and Europe have put economic security, shared prosperity and resilient supply chains at the heart of their various Indo-Pacific strategies and documents, regional partners expressed concern about the brewing discord between the US and its allies over landmark economic and technological policies. The UK and the EU have warned that the US Inflation Reduction Act, which offers billions of dollars in green subsidies to US companies, could curb competition. Japan and South Korea share these concerns. While the US and the EU have set up a Trade and Technology Council to promote shared rules and norms in this vital emerging domain, they are also pursuing different approaches to the regulation and promotion of the technology sector. Further, recent trips to Beijing by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, European Council President Charles Michel and French President Macron have stirred US fears that its European allies might be softening their approach to China, in the hope of avoiding costly decoupling, and of maintaining or even expanding economic benefits as the Chinese economy comes back to life after Beijing’s abandonment of its zero-Covid strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, countries in the Indo-Pacific do not view the Euro-Atlantic region as an integrated monolithic actor and, according to interviewees, the term “transatlantic” generally holds little meaning across the Indo-Pacific. While the slew of recently published Indo-Pacific strategies and documents has raised awareness of the diplomatic energy that European and North Atlantic countries are directing toward the Indo-Pacific, countries in the region draw different conclusions on how best to work with transatlantic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, Japan and South Korea form a core of partners that are truly like-minded from a transatlantic point of view on many, although not all, issues. Beyond these core partners, degrees of like-mindedness are more limited. Vietnam and India share US and European concerns about China’s growing military might, and want transatlantic partners to help provide a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. However, their divergent views on the war in Ukraine or on Russia’s role are not only a product of dependence on Moscow for military hardware and technology. In the case of India – but perhaps also more widely – this also reflects a welcoming of the opportunities that multipolarity offers for realising greater strategic autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US and European officials need to get better at accepting and navigating these complexities, rather than wishing them away. Just as they will need to engage with governments in the Indo-Pacific as partners in their own right and not simply as participants in a US–China struggle, they will also need their Indo-Pacific partners to be much more honest with them about their qualms and differences in opinion and national interest. While these conversations might not be easy, transatlantic partners can help by better coordinating their engagement with key Indo-Pacific partners, at diplomatic posts in the region as well as in national capitals. US and European diplomats are already coordinating on an ad hoc basis across the Indo-Pacific, but they can and should be better joined up with discussions at headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of Indo-Pacific partners, relationships with the US and Europe will be shaped to a great extent by the trajectory of China’s relationships with them and with the West. The core group of US allies in the region – Australia, Japan and South Korea – are largely comfortable with tougher US and European policy toward China, although there are concerns about the harder-edged rhetoric coming out of the US Congress. Across the rest of the region, there is much more ambivalence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, ultimately, two overarching challenges. First, the US and Europe will need to find the right balance between enhancing security relationships with allies and their closest partners, and helping other regional countries to tackle the economic and non-traditional security issues that they face. Second, while transatlantic states are not seen as a monolithic actor in the region, they can improve their reputations, and the effectiveness of their engagement, if they better coordinate their efforts in the Indo-Pacific, and avoid duplicating them. This will require more candid conversations between transatlantic countries and Indo-Pacific countries. The US and Europe will need to listen more and encourage Indo-Pacific partners to speak up honestly, to ensure that their various Indo-Pacific strategies and approaches can be refined and adjusted as they are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

For the UK, this shifting landscape creates both challenges and leadership opportunities as it heads towards its next general election.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In autumn 2021 we argued that the continent’s security was at an inflection point. We foresaw a coming transformation, driven by either a strategic shock or an aggregation of more modest changes. In fact, both have happened simultaneously: the trauma of Russia’s re-invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has accelerated and deepened multiple other security developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-new&quot;&gt;What’s New?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past two years have witnessed marked changes in the European security landscape. First, state-on-state war has returned on a scale that Europe has not experienced since 1945. Ukraine’s extraordinary resistance and resilience, backed by slow but increasingly steady support from the West, has made sure that it will survive, bloodied but unbowed. The war is also transforming Ukraine into a powerful regional security actor that is now central rather than peripheral to European security, and it is set to play a pivotal role in future Euro-Atlantic security arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we have seen a re-focused NATO. Its 2022 Strategic Concept was clear, if late, in identifying Russia as “the most significant and direct threat” to peace and security. NATO plans, deployments and exercises have pivoted towards addressing the Russian threat in all domains. Finland has become a NATO member in rapid time, and Sweden is now on the path to entry. Neither event was on anyone’s immediate radar in October 2021. These developments will have a positive impact on the Alliance, making it stronger, more coherent and more European.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, new actors and groups have emerged. In October 2021 we commented that European security was no longer driven only by the “big three” (France, Germany and the UK), and that other countries were growing in influence and in their willingness to set the agenda, with support for Ukraine already becoming a unifying factor. This trend has accelerated, encompassing not just Ukraine and Finland, but also Poland – now a US security partner of choice – and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it’s not just the big countries driving change. Denmark and the Netherlands have led on providing F-16 aircraft for Ukraine, while the former donated all its Caesar self-propelled howitzers. The Baltic states lead support for Ukraine when measured by percentage of GDP. And Lithuania has been vocal in calling out Chinese coercive practices, withdrawn from China’s “17+1” arrangement with Central and Eastern Europe and published an independent Indo-Pacific strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the EU is assuming a more prominent role. Russia’s initial diplomatic focus on the US and NATO has had to pivot more towards the EU, with sanctions becoming a significant lever in responding to Russian aggression. The EU now provides military support to Ukraine via the EU Peace Facility, which has had to increase its financial ceiling to meet demand. This would have been totally inconceivable two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The US continues to underpin European security, providing the lion’s share of support to Ukraine and NATO as well as overall defence spending&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the security focus has shifted north, south and east. Unresolved and frozen conflicts are thawing, including in the Western Balkans and the South Caucasus, with the capacity of NATO and the EU to project stability uncertain. The war in Israel and Gaza constitutes a security emergency on Europe’s doorstep with the potential to spread, sow dissension and give Russia an opportunity to meddle and distract from its disastrous war in Ukraine. The collapse of French-led military missions in the Sahel has offered another opportunity for Russia to extend its influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-and-whats-not-changed&quot;&gt;… and What’s Not Changed?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several continuities. First, Russian aggression. Russia’s 2022 re-invasion of Ukraine was not an isolated trauma but the most severe in a decades-long succession of Russian violence, including Chechnya in the early 2000s, Georgia in 2008, Crimea and Donbas in 2014, Syria in 2015, chemical weapons use on UK soil in 2006 and 2018, and the attack on the Vrbětice ammunition warehouse in Czechia in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Western defence burden-sharing remains imbalanced. The US continues to underpin European security, providing the lion’s share of support to Ukraine and NATO as well as overall defence spending. Europe collectively has been catching up on military support to Ukraine, but the nature, volume and timing of US capabilities has made the greatest difference. Moreover, while European defence spending has increased at the highest rate since the end of the Cold War, there are still disagreements on what to spend it on. Therefore, the gap in overall numbers does not take into account the actual capability gap – especially on critical enablers, including intelligence, command and control, logistics and the adoption of new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and closely linked, Western defence industrial production remains insufficient to match the threat. Even for those European countries where there has been some increase in defence spending, it has not yet made much impact on defence industrial production. Moreover, this is not just a European and Ukrainian challenge as global events increase the demand for higher and sustained industrial production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the existing cooperative Euro-Atlantic security structures are no longer fit for purpose, including a near-total erosion of arms control and confidence- and security-building measures that previously constrained Russia. The 7 November statement that NATO allies would suspend the operation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty following Russia’s withdrawal acknowledges the depressing reality. Western capitals need to think creatively about new arrangements, including how to keep the US engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;britain-returns&quot;&gt;Britain Returns!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Integrated Review Refresh (IRR) of March 2023 represented a sober update of UK strategy. Although it emphasised working alongside allies and partners in both the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions, it reaffirmed the primacy of the Euro-Atlantic area for the UK’s security interests, to be bolstered by a reinvigoration of its European relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, these were in a mess. Post-Brexit, UK ministers had opted not to pursue closer ties with EU external initiatives or operations. The announcement in September 2021 of the AUKUS (Australia–UK–US) defence pact had provoked an angry response from France, at the same time as allies were coming to terms with the US-led withdrawal from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A potential future UK–EU defence and security deal could be far more ambitious than simple third-party UK participation in EU security initiatives&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has now inched towards a more pragmatic relationship with the EU. The February 2023 Windsor Framework unlocked the possibility of closer security and defence cooperation, initially in cyber security and counterterrorism, and the UK joined the EU military mobility project. These steps proceeded alongside close practical cooperation on Russia sanctions. In a worsening security environment, a potential future UK–EU defence and security deal could be far more ambitious than simple third-party UK participation in EU security initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-opportunities-and-challenges-for-the-uk&quot;&gt;New Opportunities and Challenges for the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transformation of European security is still unfolding, but the current constellation creates special challenges for the UK, considering that it is a leading European member of NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force but now sits outside the EU, and given how invested it is in its new defence partnership with Ukraine and its long-standing security relationship with the US. Each of these carries uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and most importantly, there is the outcome of the war in Ukraine. The UK and other European states increased support to Ukraine in 2023 alongside rising expectations of a Ukrainian military breakthrough. But winter is now upon us, and the ground war is likely to slow ahead of fresh fighting in spring 2024. With a static strategic frontline, external calls for Ukraine to reach an accommodation with Russia may grow. Yet the UK committed itself in the IRR to “supporting Ukraine to reassert its sovereignty and denying Russia any strategic benefit from its invasion”. It therefore appears bound to continue to advocate the Ukrainian cause and ensure that it has the capabilities to sustain combat operations to liberate its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, 2024 will be a decisive year for US focus and commitment. Washington will host the next NATO Summit in July, and the Alliance will mark the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Washington Treaty in April. These events will take place against a complex US domestic political background, including Congress’s uncertain appetite for support to Ukraine and the prospect of a second Trump presidency that could be even more challenging for US allies than the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current UK government and opposition both stress their Atlanticism. But, with the US having security priorities elsewhere and an unpredictable presidential election ahead, the UK must work harder, alongside European allies, to keep the Euro-Atlantic security community together. Such a leaning into Europe would be welcome in Washington. Strangely, therefore, the best way for the UK to sustain its Atlanticist objectives may be to do more with its European neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain: Europe’s security transformation is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, signs have emerged that North Korea will shrink its diplomatic network. Outposts in Angola, Hong Kong, Spain and Uganda are among “as many as a dozen” missions – a quarter of North Korea’s network of around 50 – that are allegedly slated for closure. As well as assuming more traditional diplomatic functions, North Korea’s missions have played a wider range of roles in support of the country’s national interests, and have grown in importance as Pyongyang struggles with economic isolation and the extensive UN sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I outlined in a RUSI report published last year, North Korea’s embassies, consulates, trade offices and representative missions to international organisations – and the diplomats and intelligence officers that reside there – have played key roles in procuring technology for, and funding, Pyongyang’s nuclear, missile and military programmes. The closure of these missions likely reflects both a tactical-level evolution in North Korea’s sanctions-busting efforts as well as shifting geopolitical realities, with more strategic-level implications for the UN sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-the-missions-to-the-missiles&quot;&gt;From the Missions to the Missiles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s missions have been key nodes in its sanctions-busting efforts, providing the skeleton of a near-global presence that has been used extensively to undertake and support operations. These sanctions-busting roles have fallen into three main categories. First, the missions and the diplomats stationed there are involved in revenue-raising and – given that the revenue raised likely benefits North Korea’s weapons programmes – “proliferation financing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has included trade in sanctioned commodities, with diplomats supporting sanctioned coal and vanadium exports. Diplomats have also run overseas businesses and raised revenue by leasing diplomatic real estate or even by abusing diplomatic alcohol allowances. One of the most prevalent revenue-raising activities for North Korea has been arms sales. Representatives of North Korea’s arms-dealing entities have frequently been accredited as diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Pyongyang’s diplomats have acted as buyers, procuring a wide range of sanctioned goods for import to North Korea. Most concerningly, embassies and diplomatic networks have long procured technology for the country’s weapons programmes, with the embassies in Beijing, Berlin and Moscow being particularly active in this regard. In Moscow, a member of the Office of the Commercial Counsellor – a diplomat named O Yong Ho – sought to procure a range of goods for North Korea’s missile programmes, including aramid fibre, manufacturing equipment, a spinning nozzle, chemicals and stainless steel used in missile fuel production and the construction of submarine hulls. In 2018, a senior German intelligence official noted that the embassy in Berlin had been repeatedly used to acquire missile and nuclear-related technologies, many of which were so-called dual-use technologies of utility in civil and weapons programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomats have also been involved in the procurement of intangible technologies – sensitive knowledge, information and even weapons designs. In 2011, representatives from North Korea’s Belarus Trade Office were caught in a sting operation seeking sensitive missile-related information in Ukraine. Additionally, in 2019, O Yong Ho procured CAD drawings for a Russian cruise missile. Diplomatic procurement efforts also involve much more benign goods – sanctioned luxury items and other commodities – which are scarce in North Korea and help maintain the court economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s missions have been key nodes in its sanctions-busting efforts, providing the skeleton of a near-global presence that has been used to undertake and support operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the missions and their occupants have provided support to North Korea’s overseas business networks through providing use of bank accounts, hosting banking representatives, moving funds and even providing logistical support. As the UN Panel of Experts that monitors North Korea sanctions implementation noted in a 2017 report, Pyongyang’s missions “open accounts that, in effect, perform the services that a financial institution would”. Elsewhere, diplomats have smuggled gold and precious metals as a means of moving funds. Missions have also been closely connected to North Korea’s shipping networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;missions-slated-for-closure&quot;&gt;Missions Slated for Closure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personnel based at two of the missions slated for closure – those in Angola and Uganda –have been heavily involved in sanctioned activities. More recently, North Korea’s relationship with Angola – which dates to the early 1970s – has seen the embassy in Luanda host Pyongyang’s arms dealers. Two diplomats, who were concurrently acting as representatives of North Korean arms dealer Green Pine Associated Corporation, travelled from Angola to Sri Lanka multiple times to discuss Pyongyang’s refurbishment of naval patrol vessels between 2014 and 2016. One of these Green Pine representatives concurrently negotiated contracts, sourced parts and oversaw the refurbishment of the Angolan navy’s own patrol boats. North Korean business in the country also went beyond military equipment. The UN-sanctioned entity Mansudae Overseas Projects undertook 56 construction projects in Angola up until 2015, including the mausoleum that holds the remains of the country’s first president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN Panel, a Military Attaché and diplomats based at the embassy in Kampala, Uganda, oversaw North Korean training of Ugandan air force pilots, technicians and police between 2017 and 2018. Showcasing how North Korean diplomats operate transnationally, the Attaché – a Colonel in the Korean People’s Army – was described in correspondence as the representative of the North Korean armed forces in “Uganda and East Africa” and offered neighbouring South Sudan “Presidential Guard and special forces training” and “tank crew training” while based in Kampala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is less evidence of sanctions-busting activities by the North Korean Consulate in Hong Kong, a third mission which currently looks slated for closure. However, the axis between the city and Macau has seen significant North Korean connections over the years. North Korea long sought to open a trade office in Hong Kong and to commence Air Koryo flights to the city while it was under British rule and prior to the Consulate opening in 1998. More recently, as research by RUSI’s OSIA research group has noted, Hong Kong and businesses there have been a crucial node in the networks undertaking illegal oil shipments to North Korea. The role of Hong Kong businesses in selling high-end chips as part of Russia’s illicit supply chains for military electronics also suggests that North Korea could usefully shop in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adaptation-in-north-koreas-networks&quot;&gt;Adaptation in North Korea’s Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the range of sanctions-busting activities that North Korean embassies have conducted, the closure of as many as a dozen missions at once is surprising. These steps come as Pyongyang is reopening to the world following nearly three years of Covid-19-induced border closures. They showcase adaptation in North Korea’s sanctions-busting networks in real time – a result of several shaping factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision may have a cost-saving rationale. North Korea’s missions are allegedly self-financing, raising hard currency to cover their own operations and sending all surpluses back to Pyongyang. Perhaps these specific missions are not as profitable as they once were. Indeed, both the Angolan and Ugandan governments have taken steps to reduce their connections to North Korea since the mid-2010s. In early 2020, Angola repatriated almost 300 North Korean workers, many of them working in the medical sector. Uganda allegedly cut military ties with Pyongyang around 2016, but subsequent reports suggest cooperation continued past that date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other diplomatic missions and actors can likely pick up the slack when these missions close, and potentially in a more cost-effective way. Nearby remaining missions may be designated by Pyongyang to provide coverage for business activities in these jurisdictions, just as the mission in Rome will provide diplomatic coverage in Spain following the closure of the mission in Madrid. North Korea’s diplomatic arms dealers in Africa already operate across borders, and representatives may be tasked to widen their remit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The open violation of the sanctions on Pyongyang by Russia could have a serious knock-on effect for the sanctions regime more broadly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other actors – those without diplomatic accreditation – may also pick up the slack. Indeed, diplomats may have a declining importance in North Korea’s sanctions-busting. Previously, as states around the world became hostile to North Korean business activities, diplomatic networks became more important. Diplomats had several “competitive advantages” over private individuals, largely stemming from the immunities and privileges afforded by the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Diplomats cannot be arrested, and diplomatic properties and vehicles cannot be searched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, efforts to recognise and address diplomatic sanctions-busting have intensified since 2016. Despite far-from-universal sanctions implementation, North Korea’s missions now likely attract interest from South Korean, Western and other intelligence agencies around the world. The use of local or third-country nationals, or indeed third-country passports obtained by North Koreans, could provide Pyongyang with less obvious means of conducting business than using diplomatic cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, newer sanctions-busting opportunities are likely more profitable than those facilitated by the missions. Although Pyongyang is not in a position to be picky over its revenue streams, the $1.7 billion of cryptocurrency stolen by North Korea-linked hackers in 2022, and the millions that can be gained remotely through IT outsourcing, likely far eclipse the amounts that can be generated by small-scale arms sales or construction contracts in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, recent geopolitical shifts may also provide more bountiful opportunities. North Korea’s normalising relationship with Russia, its alleged transfer of hundreds of containers of weaponry to support Moscow’s war in Ukraine, and the potential for other commercial opportunities may see North Korea’s diplomacy and energy more focused on this relationship. The open violation of the sanctions on Pyongyang by Russia – a UN Security Council permanent member which voted for the measures – could have a serious knock-on effect for the sanctions regime more broadly and its implementation around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tactical-adaptation-and-strategic-gloom&quot;&gt;Tactical Adaptation and Strategic Gloom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond their overt diplomatic function, North Korea’s missions and diplomats are persistent participants in – and coordinators holding together – the dark sanctions-busting economy that has kept the Kim regime afloat through almost two decades of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s closure of many its missions reflects both tactical and strategic-level developments. The closures represent the tactical adaptation of North Korea’s networks, with the missions in question likely not as profitable as they used to be, and with new and more “remote-working” sanctions-busting operations perhaps proving more lucrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, strategic-level developments – notably Russia’s willingness to re-engage with North Korea – also help to account for Pyongyang’s declining need for these assets. The economic benefits of Russia’s arms purchases and broader re-engagement could far surpass the meagre revenue that can be raised through the missions slated for closure. Concerningly, this shift – and North Korea’s changing diplomatic priorities – also reflects a gloomy outlook for the UN sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

The report offers recommendations for investments NATO should make in understanding, tracking, and countering Chinese narratives about the alliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Sino-NATO relations have oscillated between adversary and ally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2019, Beijing’s communications on NATO have sharpened in ways that amount to a rhetorical attack on the alliance. This shift has coincided with intensified Sino-US competition, Chinese concerns about multilateral security associations in Asia, and closer Sino-Russia relations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s recent critiques of NATO contend that the organization is an obsolete artifact of the Cold War and a belligerent force that undermines regional peace and stability. China’s rhetoric also portrays NATO’s partnerships as an illegitimate intrusion into the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although the audience for China’s narrative on NATO may be as much domestic as foreign, if the message is not countered, it could undermine the alliance’s efforts to sustain and develop Indo-Pacific partnerships and erode support for alliances with the United States more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO should, therefore, make proportionate investments to equip itself with mechanisms for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to China’s rhetorical attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and NATO — the military alliance of 31 European and North American nations initially formed to defend against Soviet aggression — have dropped to their lowest point since the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. Simultaneously, the combination of intensified Sino-US competition, increased NATO attention to the PRC, Chinese concerns about multilateral security associations in Asia, and closer Sino-Russia relations have made Chinese attitudes toward NATO more relevant than ever. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the PRC’s communications on NATO have sharpened in ways that amount to a rhetorical attack on the alliance’s legitimacy. And with this rhetoric becoming increasingly hostile, it has the potential to undermine NATO partnerships and relationships not just in the Euro-Atlantic but also in the Indo-Pacific. This suggests a greater need to invest in countering negative narratives to the extent that they can potentially hurt the alliance — with priority given to specific messages and audiences and to relationships with partners in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC’s ambitions and policies — particularly those viewed as “challenges” to the interests, security, and values of the NATO alliance in its 2022 Strategic Concept — are attracting much attention. But what the PRC says about NATO also deserves thoughtful consideration. Although Sino-NATO relations have fluctuated, alternating between opposition and alignment since early in the Cold War, Beijing’s harsh narratives on NATO have recently become more pronounced. On the eve of the 2022 NATO Summit in Madrid, an editorial in the Global Times, a daily tabloid affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party, used vivid language to warn against closer NATO relations with Asia-Pacific partners: “It’s an extremely unwise choice for any Asia-Pacific country and is bound to damage that country’s strategic trust with China, inevitably leading to consequences. . . . The sewage of the Cold War cannot be allowed to flow into the Pacific Ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should seek to understand, track, and counter such PRC narratives about the alliance for several reasons: first, these narratives can damage perceptions of NATO by its members and its partners, especially Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea (also known informally as the Asia-Pacific Four, or AP4); second, undermining trust in NATO is a proxy for undermining the principles of collective self-defense and collective security that underpin international security more widely; and third, for the United States and its bilateral allies in the Asia-Pacific region, attacks on NATO are an indirect way of attacking any alliance with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines the PRC’s attitudes toward NATO over time, with a focus on the 2020–2021 period following the debut of NATO’s official statements on the PRC and the periods following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the release of NATO’s Strategic Concept (which articulates a new position on China). The report reviews Chinese perceptions of NATO and identifies the main themes of contemporary Chinese discourse on the alliance. It then considers the intended audiences of PRC hostile narratives before turning to the strengths and vulnerabilities of NATO vis-à-vis these narratives. The report concludes with practical recommendations for the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sino-nato-relations-over-time&quot;&gt;Sino-NATO Relations over Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1949, Sino-NATO relations have fluctuated “between adversary to ally and back again.” Five distinct periods can be identified. After the initial period of early Cold War antipathy, a second period, beginning in 1972, saw China making “an active diplomatic effort to persuade Western European leaders to strengthen NATO” as a way of drawing Soviet strength away from its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the third period saw NATO cast in a new and dangerous light when a NATO bomb struck China’s embassy in Belgrade during the air campaign of the 1999 Kosovo war, resulting in the deaths of three Chinese nationals. The unfortunate accident had a strong, formative effect on the reputation of NATO in China that persists to this day. Official registration of protest over the bombing was accompanied by state-sanctioned expressions of anger against NATO — involving days of street demonstrations in several major Chinese cities — and the issuance of a rare government statement. On the day of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a PRC foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters that “NATO still owes the Chinese people a debt of blood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth period, following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and NATO’s mission to Afghanistan, was relatively benign despite the PRC’s opposition to NATO expansion and the Balkan interventions. The Afghanistan mission brought NATO to China’s borders, yet Beijing appeared to view the mission positively, whether out of genuine optimism that it would address the threat of Islamist terrorism or as a way of casting some legitimacy on its own counter-terrorism policies in its far western regions. In testimony before the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission in April 2012, China expert Christina Lin pointed to a series of positive exchanges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2002, the Chinese ambassador in Brussels visited NATO headquarters with then SecGen Lord Robertson and explored ways for engagements, particularly in Afghanistan. . . . Following the visit of the Director General of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to NATO Headquarters in 2007, the political dialogue on [the] senior staff level [took] place on a rather regular basis. In May 2007, NATO Military Committee Chairman General Ray Henault expressed that in addition to political relations, NATO wants to establish direct ‘military-to-military’ relations with Chinese armed forces and shake off the embassy-bombing shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the People’s Liberation Army Navy began cooperating with NATO navies on counterpiracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. And in 2011, the Global Times — known for its hawkish views on Chinese foreign policy — published a positive opinion piece about cooperation between NATO and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth (and current) period of Sino-NATO relations began in 2019. During this period, Beijing’s attitude toward NATO seems to have been formed in considerable part by the deterioration in both US-China and Europe-China relations over the preceding few years. The first time the significance of China’s rise appeared in an official NATO statement was in December 2019; the London Declaration, issued at the NATO Leaders Meeting, stated that Beijing’s “growing influence and international policies present both opportunities and challenges.” Almost a year later, a report entitled “NATO 2030: United for a New Era,” produced by an independent panel of experts appointed by the NATO secretary general, identified China as a “systemic rival” and recommended that NATO “continue efforts to build resilience and counter cyber attacks and disinformation that originate in China.” At their June 2021 summit meeting in Brussels, alliance leaders reiterated and expanded on earlier statements: “China’s growing influence and international policies can present challenges that we need to address together as an Alliance. . . . China’s stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest perceived affront to China has been its treatment in NATO’s Strategic Concept, a long-term strategy and planning document that was revised significantly in 2022 from its previous 2010 version. The document more clearly puts China and NATO in opposing positions: “The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our [NATO’s] interests, security and values.” The PRC is mainly covered in paragraphs 13 and 14. Paragraph 13 defines the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC employs a broad range of political, economic and military tools to increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque about its strategy, intentions and military build-up. The PRC’s malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target Allies and harm Alliance security. The PRC seeks to control key technological and industrial sectors, critical infrastructure, and strategic materials and supply chains. It uses its economic leverage to create strategic dependencies and enhance its influence. It strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains. The deepening strategic partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 14 lists the actions NATO plans to take:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests. We will work together responsibly, as Allies, to address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security and ensure NATO’s enduring ability to guarantee the defence and security of Allies. We will boost our shared awareness, enhance our resilience and preparedness, and protect against the PRC’s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance. We will stand up for our shared values and the rules-based international order, including freedom of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this said, regardless of the period of relations, Chinese and NATO interests have at times aligned, proving that the relationship is not inherently antagonistic. Nor have China and NATO necessarily paid significant attention to one another over time. Aside from the Belgrade bombing, as Filip Šebok and Richard Q. Turcsányi noted in a paper for the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, NATO hardly featured in the PRC’s official communications until recently: “There were only 18 direct mentions of NATO in regular press conferences of [the] Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs between 2002 and 2020 — compared to 21 mentions of the Czech Republic, over 200 of Germany, and almost 5,000 of the US.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-perceptions-and-discourse&quot;&gt;China’s Perceptions and Discourse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing what China has been saying about NATO in the last several years, it is worth exploring some of the perceptions behind Beijing’s rhetoric. According to a summary of a 2021 dialogue organized by the US-based Center for Strategic Decision Research and the China Institute for International Strategic Studies (closely affiliated with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army), Chinese perceptions could be roughly summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO is a Cold War organization that needs a threat to survive, and China is a convenient scapegoat. China’s military modernization gives NATO a pretext for higher military spending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States dominates NATO and seeks to use it to turn Europeans, who are politically divided and militarily uneven, against China and to transition NATO from a regional to a global alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western initiatives are nothing but attempts to prevent China’s rise in terms of strategic capability. The United States has been criticizing China and applying double standards on its development of new hypersonic missiles, intermediate missiles, stealth aircraft, battlefield robotics, and cyber and space weapons, even as the United States and its allies are developing the same capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The West’s claims of security vulnerabilities and Chinese state interference are invoked for protectionist reasons and to give Western companies an unfair market advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies are violating principles of state sovereignty and non-interference by condemning China and imposing sanctions on it for its internal behavior in, for example, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s rise, along with the emergence of other major powers, means that the Western-dominated multilateral system is obsolete and Western power will be reduced. Unwilling to accept this, the West has tried to revitalize the G-7 (an economic and political forum for advanced countries) by adding Australia, India, South Africa, and South Korea; and tries to use the Quad (a strategic security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) and NATO global outreach to contain China’s legitimate rise. This effort is destabilizing global politics by dividing the world into new Cold War blocs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These perceptions both underlie PRC discourse on NATO and reflect the broad thrust of PRC foreign and security policy — which essentially opposes a US-led order that appears bent on containing China and instead seeks a new world order that facilitates acceptance of and respect for China’s leadership status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obsolescence-belligerence-illegitimacy&quot;&gt;Obsolescence, Belligerence, Illegitimacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s underlying perceptions and declared foreign policy ambitions have coalesced in an overarching narrative that can be roughly summed up as follows: Although China is the future (ergo the West is the past), American primacy is threatened by China’s inevitable rise, and so the United States uses all means at its disposal — including alliances like NATO — to hype a China threat and contain China’s rise. In determining how to respond to this broad narrative, it helps to break down the elements of China’s messaging and discourse on NATO into three main categories: obsolescence, belligerence, and illegitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obsolescence-cold-war-thinking&quot;&gt;OBSOLESCENCE: COLD WAR THINKING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC’s narrative of Western decline serves to support the domestic legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party and gain external acceptance for China’s overseas power projection. In Beijing’s view, NATO is an emblem of Western decline and is attached to outmoded concepts and institutions, including, for example, so-called Cold War thinking. As Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian put it in April 2022, “NATO was born out of the Cold War and should have long become a past tense.” This interweaving of NATO with established PRC foreign policy narratives became even more evident in the remarks made by China’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Zhang Jun. At a UN Security Council briefing on Ukraine in June 2022, Zhang stated, “The Cold War ended a long time ago, It is necessary for NATO to reconsider its own positioning and its responsibilities, completely abandon the Cold-War mentality that is based on bloc confrontation, and strive to build a balanced, effective, and sustainable European security framework in line with the principle of indivisible security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing views obsolete thinking as afflicting NATO’s whole conceptual mindset, which, in turn, shapes its approach to China. In remarks in June 2022, the spokesperson of the Chinese mission to the European Union stated that “NATO’s so-called Strategic Concept, filled with Cold war thinking and ideological bias, is maliciously attacking and smearing China. We firmly oppose it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples suggest that China objects to NATO’s perceived embodiment of two institutional and structural aspects of Cold War thinking: bloc formation and confrontation. The theme of illegitimate collective defense alliances and minilaterals (small groups of countries collaborating to achieve shared goals) is connected to the broader Chinese discourse on resisting attempts to contain the PRC. Beijing’s statements on the international order emphasize the centrality of the UN Security Council and imply that multilateral alliances based on the right of collective self-defense somehow lack legitimacy, despite the fact that Article 51 of the UN charter specifically validates the right of collective defense. As noted by the spokesperson of China’s mission to the EU, “NATO claims itself to be a defensive organization that upholds the rules-based international order, but it has bypassed the UN Security Council and waged wars against sovereign states, creating huge casualties and leaving tens of millions displaced.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also implying a Western attachment to obsolete thinking, the PRC has talked of a needed evolution of security concepts from “absolute” security to “indivisible” security. In April 2022, General Secretary Xi Jinping highlighted the concept of indivisible security — the idea that no country should strengthen its own security at the expense of others — as a distinguishing feature in his proposed Global Security Initiative: “We should uphold the principle of indivisibility of security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the building of national security on the basis of insecurity in other countries.” According to the official concept paper published in February 2023, the initiative “aims to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, encourage joint international efforts to bring more stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era, and promote durable peace and development in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is essentially touting a superior security order that will supersede the current, US-led order. Again, China asserts that, as an institution founded on collective defense, NATO has not been heeding the principle underlying the concept of indivisible security. (The Kremlin, incidentally, has also promoted this principle in the context of earlier European security cooperation agreements.) In remarks made on separate occasions, spokesperson Zhao and UN ambassador Zhang have issued the following warnings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NATO must immediately . . . renounce its blind faith in military might and misguided practice of seeking absolute security, halt the dangerous attempt to destabilize Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and act in the interest of security and stability in Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Ukraine crisis has once again sounded alarm for the world. Security is indivisible. A blind faith in the position of strength, the expansion of military alliance, and the pursuit of one’s own security at the expense of the insecurity of other countries will inevitably lead to security dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider global economic disruption to energy, food, and fertilizer prices resulting from Russia’s war against Ukraine created another opportunity for the PRC to portray “United States-led Western countries” (in other words, NATO members) as irresponsible in pursuing their own security at the expense of others. A June 2022 article in the China Daily, owned by the Chinese Communist Party, contended that “United States-led Western countries were more busy sending shipments of lethal weapons to Ukraine and have imposed sanctions on Russia, risking the prolonged continuation of the conflict but leaving the world to foot the bill. Food prices have reached an all-time high, as Russian and Ukrainian grain exports are hindered by port disruptions and Western sanctions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to consolidation of the European security order around NATO membership, Beijing seems intent on undermining alliance solidarity by implying that membership or partnership with NATO is somehow incompatible with good relations with the PRC. In a statement following the announcement of Finland’s decision to apply for NATO membership, spokesperson Zhao hinted at the damage NATO membership can cause countries’ bilateral relations with the PRC: “Finland’s application to NATO will bring new factor to bilateral ties with China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belligerence-stirring-up-trouble&quot;&gt;BELLIGERENCE: STIRRING UP TROUBLE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Sino-Russian rapprochement began to change NATO’s attitude toward the PRC; at the same time, Beijing’s and Moscow’s narratives about NATO began to converge. On February 4, 2022, in a joint statement released when President Vladimir Putin was visiting Beijing, China and Russia signaled their opposition to further NATO expansion. Over the summer of 2022, the PRC’s messaging about the war emphasized elements of its critical stance toward NATO; moreover, its messages aligned with the Russian narrative that Washington was “the initiator and main instigator of the Ukrainian crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late June, inclusion of the AP4 countries in the NATO summit in Madrid prompted the PRC to portray the alliance as a source of danger for Asian security and as evidence of a developing Asian NATO. At a UN Security Council briefing on June 28, Zhang stated, “We firmly oppose certain elements clamoring for NATO’s involvement in the Asia Pacific, or an Asia Pacific version of NATO on the back of military alliances. The long-outdated Cold War script must never be re-enacted in the Asia Pacific. The kind of turmoil and conflict that are affecting parts of the world must not be allowed to happen in the Asia Pacific.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a related statement, the PRC highlighted the long peace the Asia-Pacific region has experienced since the end of the Indo-China conflicts in the late 1970s and implied that Asian problems should be addressed by Asian actors. At a press conference on June 30, Zhao asserted, “The Asia-Pacific is one of the most peaceful and stable regions in the world and a promising land for cooperation and development. Any attempt to undermine its peace and stability and sabotage regional solidarity and cooperation will be unanimously rejected by the people in China and the rest of the Asia-Pacific.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrasting NATO’s supposed inherently aggressive character (and associating that with insecurity in Europe) with the idealized peace of Asia, China was subtly reinforcing its centrality in the region and making the case that NATO’s interest in the Indo-Pacific or Asia-Pacific represents a threat to regional security. Also in late June, the spokesperson of the Chinese mission to the EU said, “The Strategic Concept claims that other countries pose challenges, but it is NATO that is creating problems around the world. . . . Who’s challenging global security and undermining world peace? Are there any wars or conflicts over the years where NATO is not involved?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;illegitimacy-bloc-formation-and-intrusion&quot;&gt;ILLEGITIMACY: BLOC FORMATION AND INTRUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s main attack on NATO’s legitimacy is based on structural and geographic objections. The structural critique implies that blocs or even collective security alliances are inherently contrary to a just, democratic, and stable international order. The geographic critique implies that NATO is overstepping its bounds and entering a region where it has no right to be. Both lines are sometimes used in combination, as the spokesperson of the Chinese mission to the EU did when saying, “NATO claims that its defense zone will not go beyond the North Atlantic, but it has flexed its muscle in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years and sought to stir up bloc confrontation here, as it has done in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s current interest in the Indo-Pacific makes it a convenient emblem of a trend emerging in the Asian security structure that worries China: defense minilateralism. Until recently, the US-led security order in the region took a hub-and-spoke form, with an array of bilateral alliances connecting the United States to Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand. However, these alliances have started to be overlaid with a latticework of new minilateral structures, some linking groups of Asian nations and others linking Asian, European, and North American countries. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to a speech by Secretary of State Antony Blinken in June 2022 with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The US administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy is self-contradictory: the US claims to promote the region’s “freedom and openness” as its goal, while in reality co-opting with allies to forge a “five-four-three-two-one” formation made up of the Five Eyes, the Quad, AUKUS, bilateral alliances and IPEF, forming exclusive “small circles” and forcing countries in the region to take sides. AUKUS helps Australia build nuclear-powered submarines and develops hypersonic weapons, pushing up the risk for a regional arms race. Under the pretext of fighting illegal fishing and keeping supply chains resilient, the Quad has vigorously pursued military cooperation and intelligence sharing. The US has also encouraged NATO’s involvement in the Asia-Pacific. These are all attempts to materialize an “Asia-Pacific version of NATO” and promote “integrated deterrence” against China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC’s lumping together of other groupings and NATO seems aimed at delegitimizing not just collective security in the strict sense but any association of defense cooperation or collaboration, in particular those led by or including the United States. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release from February 2023 on the potential of political settlement of the Ukraine crisis asserted that “the security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs.” Beijing has even claimed that the United States wants to use NATO for “harming Europe.” The implication is that countries that ally with the United States are somehow either vassals or allowing themselves to be brainwashed or both. Perhaps because China perceives a lack of agency among smaller states, Beijing presumes what it sees as its own regional leadership would be an acceptable alternative to so-called US hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC insinuates geographic illegitimacy by arguing that an organization based on North Atlantic security is an alien intruder in the Asian region. The fact that the PRC held military exercises alongside Russia in the Euro-Atlantic in recent years, in the Mediterranean in 2015, and the Baltic region in 2017 has not prevented Beijing from criticizing NATO for “inserting itself” in Asia-Pacific affairs. As Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin asserted, “NATO, a military organisation in the North Atlantic, has in recent years come to the Asia-Pacific region to throw its weight around and stir up conflicts. . . . NATO has messed up Europe. Is it now trying to mess up the Asia-Pacific and even the world?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warning is not just directed at NATO itself, but also at NATO’s partners and others in the region. The Global Times editorial published just before NATO leaders met in Madrid in July 2022 made this abundantly clear. In addition to warning that “catering to NATO’s Asia-Pacificization is tantamount to inviting wolves into the house,” the editorial declared that doing so was “bound to damage [countries’] strategic trust with China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s narrative logic — which connects interference by non-Asians in regional security with the deliberate stirring up of tensions and propensity for war — reached its high point in the implication of an Asian NATO: China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs asserted, “The US pushes NATO to insert itself in Asia-Pacific affairs, fan the ‘China threat’ narrative in the bloc’s new strategic concept, and include in its Madrid Summit such US allies in the Asia-Pacific as Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Australia, in a bid to build an ‘Asia-Pacific version of NATO,’ which would disrupt security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The use of scare quotes around “Asia-Pacific version of NATO” serves not only to cast doubt on the idea itself but also to give a misleading impression as to its origin. Neither NATO nor the United States has expressed an ambition to create an Asian NATO; in fact, they have made many statements to the contrary, clearly indicating that no such move is desired or intended. The idea of an Asian NATO is almost exclusively one that emanates, unconsciously or by design, from Chinese discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-audiences&quot;&gt;China’s Audiences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating the danger that PRC narratives pose to NATO requires some understanding of the target audiences. This section identifies audiences from Beijing’s likely perspective, assesses the effects on these audiences from NATO’s likely perspective, and weighs the importance of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;speaking-to-those-at-home-and-abroad&quot;&gt;SPEAKING TO THOSE AT HOME AND ABROAD&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider world is not necessarily the PRC’s primary audience. Research suggests that the domestic audience is more important for China. As Šebok and Turcsányi stated in their NATO background paper, “Chinese actors try to follow its leaders’ instructions and wishes, and the Party overall is motivated by a desire to increase legitimacy vis-à-vis the Chinese domestic audience. These factors are increasingly contributing to the uncompromising posture of Chinese diplomacy abroad.” This is consistent with the larger pattern of PRC security policy and resource allocation, which suggests that internal threats to state security and the position of the PRC are higher priorities than foreign threats to the country. The message that outside powers are containing China and ganging up to prevent its rise is becoming more salient as internal questions inevitably arise about how many of China’s economic difficulties might be the result of choices by the current Communist Party leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second audience is likely China’s partners, particularly Russia. Despite the negative impact Russia’s war has had on PRC interests (including food price inflation and exposing double standards on questions of national sovereignty), Beijing remains reluctant to appear as an unreliable friend. For Russia, there are potential benefits from reciprocal support on issues where their interests align. Writing presciently two decades ago, international security expert Richard Weitz observed that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;from Moscow’s perspective, periodically joining Beijing to denounce U.S.-Japanese defense cooperation elicits, at minimal cost, Chinese declarations against NATO enlargement and other Western policies the Russian government opposes. The appearance of an embryonic Russian-Chinese united front toward Japan also encourages Tokyo to moderate its claims of sovereignty over the Russian-occupied southern islands of the Kurile chain — Habomai, Shikotan, Etorofu, and Kunashiri, known in Japan as the “Northern Territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering Japan has been, as Weitz notes, the target of three treaties between Moscow and Beijing (in 1896, 1924, and 1950), it must be discomforting for Tokyo to observe how “Chinese officials have expressed renewed support for Russia’s position on the Kurile issue.” Russia and Japan both claim sovereignty over the southern chain of the Kuril Islands. Moscow seized them during World War II, but Tokyo views them as Japan’s “Northern Territories.” Given Russia’s current weakened state due to the war with Ukraine and China’s support, Japan may be concerned about Chinese influence over any Moscow-Tokyo negotiations. Ironically, the more Sino-Russian relations align, the clearer it becomes for Asian and Euro-Atlantic partners that they share common security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining international audience is probably next in terms of importance, particularly the broad segment sometimes described as the “Global South” or the “new nonaligned.” China claims moral leadership over this group of countries (albeit a role contested by India) and seeks to cultivate in this group a worldview that supports its strategic preferences on points such as countering American hegemony. Recent analysis suggests that Beijing invests heavily in messaging to African audiences and Arabic- and Spanish-speaking audiences, and the efforts have been relatively successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-chinas-audiences-and-natos-interests-intersect&quot;&gt;WHERE CHINA’S AUDIENCES AND NATO’S INTERESTS INTERSECT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the PRC seems to be giving more attention recently to reaching audiences abroad, when it comes to Euro-Atlantic audiences, its current approach to communications does not appear to be doing much to prevent a general trend of rising suspicion and hostility toward China. From NATO’s perspective, this wider world — particularly those regions where NATO seeks to sustain or develop its global partnerships — is the more important audience. It is when those partnerships happen to be in the Asia-Pacific that PRC narratives seem to come into the most direct conflict with NATO interests. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao has warned, albeit in reference to European enlargement, that “we advise relevant countries to exercise caution when developing relations with NATO.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message may be aimed at impacting support for existing frameworks like the AP4, but also at impeding potentially wider NATO partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region. Some commentators suggest that “what China is really addressing is Southeast Asia and the broader region, and ASEAN [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations] in particular.” India’s preference for nonalignment may not be conducive to implementing the recommendation of the NATO 2030 report that “NATO should begin internal discussions about a possible future partnership with India,” but sooner or later, a NATO more oriented to the challenge of China will naturally look to partner in some form with India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From NATO’s perspective, the international audiences most relevant are likely existing and potential Indo-Pacific partners, especially segments of their public and elite who are sympathetic to the anti-imperialistic, anti-Western, and anti-American elements of PRC narratives. These audiences’ opinions have the potential to limit or reduce the willingness of states in the region to work with NATO and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how much impact PRC narratives have had to date on regional attitudes toward NATO is hard to judge, not least because it is difficult to find relevant studies or tracking efforts. For NATO policymakers concerned about Asia-Pacific partnerships, this might be a blind spot worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natos-vulnerability&quot;&gt;NATO’s Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious NATO vulnerability with respect to PRC narratives is the diversity of views on China within the alliance. NATO allies were able to agree on language about China in the 2022 Strategic Concept, but as the 2022 US National Security Strategy acknowledges, “Allies and partners may have distinct perspectives on the PRC.” For instance, President Joe Biden has repeatedly voiced the United States’ commitment to defending Taiwan if it is attacked, but no other NATO ally has come close to saying this. Also, while the National Security Strategy stresses the need for supply chains that are less dependent on Chinese industry, German chancellor Olaf Scholz conveyed a different message by visiting China with a group of business leaders in November 2022 — the first G-7 leader to visit the country in three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, France has long expressed its wish “to champion a third path in the Indo-Pacific.” In September 2022, French President Emmanuel Macron said, “We must also assert Europe’s independence in the confrontation between China and the United States. . . . We are not willing to have a strategy of confrontation with China in the Indo-Pacific. . . . We do not believe that alliances that have been established to deal with certain opposing interests should extend to the Indo-Pacific.” (Like German chancellor Scholz, President Macron also visited China, in April 2023, with a contingent of business leaders.) The French National Strategic Review 2022 makes it clear that “France is working to strengthen the European pillar of the [NATO] Alliance in a pragmatic approach to its role, which rules out an extension to other geographical areas and in particular the Indo-Pacific.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, these different viewpoints indicate a lack of cohesion on China policy among NATO members; and this makes it easier for the PRC to argue that the United States is driving allies into opposition with China against the will and interests of policymakers or sections of their societies who would naturally prefer cooperative relations with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether NATO gives adequate attention to the power of PRC narratives, despite the recommendation of the NATO 2030 report to “enhance its understanding of China’s capabilities, activities, and intentions that affect Euro-Atlantic security, with a clear-eyed understanding of risk, threat, and opportunity.” If NATO officials monitor Chinese discourse, the outputs are not publicized. Any desire to shape narratives in the region does not appear to be matched by funding or capabilities. NATO communication seems to be mostly aimed at internal audiences, with only limited material designed for and directed at Asian partner audiences, let alone Chinese audiences. Although the inclusion of China in NATO’s Strategic Concept is significant, some observers may have expected a more pointed or operationally focused treatment of the PRC. Indeed, little remains of the practical proposals put forward in the NATO 2030 report. This makes one question whether the alliance has been too slow to act on the recommendation that “NATO must devote much more time, political resources, and action to the security challenges posed by China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s communication in response to the PRC’s actions toward existing or potential NATO partners is not always consistent. As the scholar Jeffrey Michaels noted, NATO has expressed support for partners like Japan and South Korea with regard to their troubles with China and North Korea, but NATO “remained silent” when soldiers of China’s People’s Liberation Army killed Indian soldiers on their Himalayan frontier in 2020. A NATO communications policy might consider how such instances offer an opportunity to more proactively counter PRC narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understandably, at this moment, NATO investment in strategic communications concentrates on Russia. However, it does not appear that the balance of strategic communications resources has been adjusted to make progress on the NATO 2030 report’s recommendations related to the PRC and to respond to the increasing alignment between Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations-of-chinas-narratives&quot;&gt;Limitations of China’s Narratives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRC narratives about NATO have their limitations and vulnerabilities, too. Despite the suggestion in the Global Times editorial that “Washington’s strategic will is increasingly coercing and is kidnapping NATO,” the lengthening list of problems in PRC-Europe relations — the causes for which are independent of the US-PRC relationship — make Beijing’s narrative that NATO is merely a tool of American control over Europe harder to sustain. This is evidenced by the demise of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment. After the EU imposed sanctions on China over the human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region in China’s northwest in March 2021, Beijing imposed sanctions on EU bodies, European Parliament members, and even think tank researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC’s barely muted backing of Putin’s war in Ukraine has only clarified the dangers of Chinese foreign policy for Europeans. Beijing’s moves to cement the Sino-Russian bond have a retro look that appears to contradict the taunt that America and NATO are the ones mired in a “Cold War mentality.” The more PRC messages attack NATO, the more they remind their audiences that Beijing is aligned with Moscow. Beijing and Moscow’s “without limits” friendship and the PRC’s consistent parroting of Kremlin talking points throughout the conflict have damaged China’s relations with many countries in the EU. And the PRC’s refusal to condemn the invasion has surely called into question its commitment to the principles of noninterference, peaceful settlement of disputes, and respect for national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine succeeded in pushing back against Russia’s “special military operation” later in 2022, Beijing’s closeness to Moscow exposed some of the flaws in the logic of China’s strategic communications on NATO. China’s refusal to condemn Russia’s flagrant violation of national sovereignty may be a liability in terms of Beijing’s attempts to pose as a champion of peace and international law and UN Charter principles. As Putin switched strategy from regime change to forcible annexation, siding with Russia continued to put the PRC in an ever-diminishing minority in the UN General Assembly, as demonstrated by the October 12 vote on Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine — 143 members voted to condemn, 5 voted against, and 35 abstained (including China). If Russia’s war runs into further difficulties, Beijing’s embarrassment is likely to increase. Meanwhile, if NATO allies continue to appear to be alleviating the causes of worldwide repercussions of the war (price rises and shortages of food, fuel, and fertilizer), China will find it increasingly hard to convince the world that it can offer a superior model of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thinking-ahead-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Thinking Ahead and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s Strategic Concept expresses concern about the resilience of its allies against PRC actions that could undermine the coherence and strength of their societies, economies, and democratic institutions. NATO’s recent research suggests that the most efficient long-term strategy for dealing with PRC narratives “is to bolster the societal resilience of NATO member states and concentrate on shaping their own strategic narratives, which must transcend mere reactions to Chinese actions and offer alternative positive visions.” While the idea of offering alternative positive visions is sound, the alliance should look beyond the resilience of allies and take steps to better understand and, if necessary, neutralize sources of damage to the alliance inflicted via NATO’s partners and partnerships. The success of the Chinese narrative that the inherent right of collective self-defense and the organizations that uphold that right are illegitimate would represent not just a defeat for the principles NATO stands for but also a more general danger for global peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, NATO should pay close attention to the effects of PRC narratives on the perceptions of Chinese citizens. Failure to do so would be shortsighted. It is not self-evident that the perceptions of the Chinese audience are either accurately represented by the messages of the PRC or beyond the influence of outside actors, including NATO’s own strategic communications. Although Sino-NATO relations are at a low today, channels for influence are not entirely foreclosed. On September 22, 2022, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg discussed Russia’s war against Ukraine during talks with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York. In February 2023, talks between NATO and PRC counterparts restarted after a pause that seemed to have been caused mainly by COVID-related restrictions. Chinese leadership can and will change eventually. NATO should take a long view and use the channels it still has with Chinese officials — and perhaps in a more limited way with ordinary Chinese people — to prepare for a day when the pendulum swings back in a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to external messages, PRC narratives smear NATO largely as a means of blackening the reputation of the United States and undermining strategically inconvenient norms like the inherent right to collective self-defense, including by China’s neighbors but also by countries in the Global South. The following recommendations therefore focus on that wider audience, where NATO has more immediate interests and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO should commission a mechanism for analysis, with support from Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic specialists, to estimate the level of threat emanating from Russian and PRC strategic communications in order to guide the allocation of resources toward countering narratives that undermine or attack NATO in each case. The mechanism should dynamically track trends in PRC strategic communications related to NATO. The scope of tracking should go beyond covering the objectives and methods of PRC narratives by measuring the impact and results of PRC communications, based on differentiated audience analysis. Cooperation between the NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence and nascent counterparts in Asian partner nations may be leveraged to support such a mechanism. Collection of relevant information could be facilitated not just by NATO’s strategic partners in the region, such as the AP4, but also by other friends and partners whose populations are also important targets of influence (for example, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After gaining a better understanding through the above measures, NATO should develop a strategic communications strategy that covers the Indo-Pacific, in consultation with the AP4 and other regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO should explore efforts to influence opinion in China about the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While proposing a NATO communications policy for Asia is beyond the scope of this report, it is possible to suggest some messages that NATO should consider communicating to China and the region more broadly. Some are predicated on a determination of what the alliance wants to accomplish in the Indo-Pacific. The alliance’s objective in the region has not been clearly spelled out. Unlike the European Union and several Euro-Atlantic and Asian nations (for example, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, and Japan), NATO has only produced a two-paragraph China policy (in the 2022 Strategic Concept), not an Indo-Pacific strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the lack of an overarching strategy document, one major theme of a NATO communications strategy for the Indo-Pacific would likely be upholding the inherent right of states to collective self-defense. This right is a particularly important element of protection for smaller states against aggressive hegemony. Notably, this right exists for all states, not just UN members. It is logical that larger or stronger states seeking to intimidate and bully smaller states would try to attack this right or criticize states that are attempting to activate it by forming alliances or looser political or security associations. Steps should be taken to ensure that Russia and China do not succeed in drawing support to the argument that indivisible security effectively delegitimizes moves to put the right into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC’s painting of “ganging up” or bloc formation as unnatural and illegitimate aims to discredit a long-standing right under international law that predates the UN Charter. This suggests a hegemonic mindset, which is ironic, considering one of China’s lines of attack against NATO is that it is a thinly veiled hegemonic project by the United States. When it comes to the Asian audience, themes of anti-hegemony and the sovereign equality of small states to larger states enjoy popular support, particularly among populations raised on a postcolonial narrative of national liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it may be possible to flip the PRC’s narratives by talking about the alliance more from the experience and perspective of smaller allies — for whom the right of collective self-defense offers the best protection against a large and periodically predatory neighbor. In particular, flipping the narrative about NATO might work best if the message about why the alliance continues to exist and why it seeks common cause with partners around the globe comes from more recent members, such as the Baltic states and central European nations, instead of the larger, longer- term allies.&lt;/p&gt;

As biological research and discovery accelerate at an unprecedented pace, they generate new risks that must be managed responsibly. The CSIS Bipartisan Alliance for Global Health Security’s Working Group on R&amp;amp;D Innovation advocates select, commonsense actions to strengthen U.S. and global biosafety and biosecurity: clarify U.S. policies and policy leadership within the White House; increase financial and diplomatic investments; update the rules around synthetic products and viral discovery work; and invest in research on basic lab protections and the new risks of artificial intelligence. Together, these timely, affordable steps can attract broad political support and promote a safer, more secure, and more innovative global bioeconomy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biosafety and biosecurity have become more urgent U.S. priorities in the post-Covid era, tied to U.S. national security interests. They have been visibly elevated in U.S. security doctrines, structured around the risks, threats, and vulnerabilities that arise at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the United States has been in a conventional arms race. Now, that race also focuses intensely on biotechnology that could bring major benefits but, in the hands of nefarious actors, also could cause enormous harm. An alarm has sounded, in part due to heightened awareness of the remarkable speed of scientific and technological changes that are unfolding, including the advance of converging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Furthermore, high-containment laboratories are rapidly expanding around the world, including in low- and middle-income countries — a process that has accelerated dramatically in the post-Covid moment. The sudden proliferation of facilities elevates risks and the demands for improved training, standards, and systems of detection and oversight. Advanced science is now conducted by a highly diverse set of individuals and organizations, including militaries, large biopharmaceutical firms, and countless start-ups that operate quite independent of government. A widely underappreciated dimension is the massive scale of illegal and legal cross-border wildlife trade, often linked with illicit networks transiting people, drugs, and finances. Together, these trends lower the barriers for bad actors to access potentially dangerous biological knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2023, the CSIS Bipartisan Alliance for Global Health Security’s Working Group on R&amp;amp;D Innovation concluded that biosafety and biosecurity should be a priority focus of its efforts for the balance of the year. To that end, five highly productive working group meetings were held between July and early October 2023 (see appendix for details).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important policy reviews are underway within the U.S. government to carefully reassess the evolving threat environment. There is debate over what should be the new balance required between controlling risk and promoting gains in the life sciences that will improve and save lives. There is an urgency to better understand the strengths and vulnerabilities of U.S. biosafety and biosecurity approaches and to rethink how to overcome vexing implementation and coordination challenges across a fragmented government and a complex interface among the U.S. government, industry, foundations, partner governments, nongovernmental groups, and international institutions. Policymakers are also debating what communications capabilities are required to effectively reach U.S. citizens and all entities working in the health security research and development (R&amp;amp;D) community in an age of pervasive mis- and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two important questions remain unanswered: First, who is mandated to set policy and ensure authoritative leadership, including effective coordination and oversight across the U.S. government and with partners outside government, including international partners? Second, will the U.S. government augment staff and programs across multiple departments and agencies with adequate, sustained budgets to ensure they have an effective, sustained capability to implement policy? Far too often, as seen at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and elsewhere, unfunded mandates in the critical areas of biosafety and biosecurity remain so weakly staffed and financed that they create only the appearance, and not the reality, of seriously meeting emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through its deliberations, the working group has engaged with U.S. government experts, industry leaders, international organizations, and other stakeholders to weigh this question: What concrete actions can and should the U.S. government undertake in the coming few months to strengthen U.S. and global biosafety and biosecurity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are eight commonsense actions proposed by the working group that attempt to answer this question. Many imply an increase in staff, programs, and budgets, but in the larger picture these are modest investments. None are excessive or unaffordable. An expedited costing exercise is an important next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What concrete actions can and should the U.S. government undertake in the coming few months to strengthen U.S. and global biosafety and biosecurity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These eight actions can attract political support across the aisle and from industry, foundations, and other partners. They will have meaningful impacts in preventing and mitigating future accidental or deliberate biological events and strengthen approaches aimed at controlling naturally occurring pathogens. No less important, they will clarify who in the White House is in charge of setting national policy and how sustainable implementation capacity will be established and funded across the U.S. government over the long term. Several pending pieces of legislation provide opportunities to advance these actions, such as the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), the Medical Supply Chain Resiliency Act, and the Pioneering Antimicrobial Subscriptions to End Upsurging Resistance (PASTEUR) Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If carried forward through consistent high-level political leadership, these pragmatic reforms hold the promise of generating momentum and common purpose. If successful, they will open the way for deeper structural changes in U.S. policy that will position the United States to continue in its role as a responsible leader in advancing a safe, secure, and innovative global bioeconomy for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-1-the-white-house-should-finish-the-job-on-time-of-updating-and-integrating-the-us-potential-pandemic-pathogen-care-and-oversight-p3c0-policy-and-dual-use-research-of-concern-durc-policy&quot;&gt;Action 1: The White House should finish the job on time of updating and integrating the U.S. Potential Pandemic Pathogen Care and Oversight (P3C0) Policy and Dual-Use Research of Concern (DURC) Policy.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated, strengthened, and unified guidelines for research on enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (ePPPs) are overdue. Combining the two policies is a sound idea. These policies should be consistent with the impressive early 2023 National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity recommendations, take account of the extensive subsequent consultations that have been held, and reflect the valuable input received from the request for information issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in October 2023. As mandated by Congress, this process is meant to be completed by the end of 2023. Hewing as close to that timeline as possible will be consequential in demonstrating resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-2-the-national-security-advisor-should-designate-a-lead-on-biosafety-and-biosecurity-policy-from-either--or-as-a-shared-responsibility-of--the-national-security-council-nsc-directorate-for-health-security-and-biodefense-or-the-new-white-house-office-of-pandemic-preparedness-and-response-policy-oppr&quot;&gt;Action 2: The national security advisor should designate a lead on biosafety and biosecurity policy from either — or as a shared responsibility of — the National Security Council (NSC) Directorate for Health Security and Biodefense or the new White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR).&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, it is unclear to many expert observers who is mandated to lead on U.S. policy on biosafety and biosecurity — a refrain heard repeatedly across the CSIS bipartisan alliance working group meetings. To some degree, this reflects that White House policy on biosecurity and biosafety is not managed or communicated effectively across the U.S. government or to external partners. The mission of transforming U.S. pandemic preparedness and biodefense capabilities should be managed with the seriousness of purpose, commitment, and accountability of the Apollo program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPPR was created to make major contributions in several areas of health security; it is still positioned to do so as long as the White House builds it consistent with the authority, spirit, and vision of the originating legislation. Both the NSC directorate and OPPR need to ensure that there are an adequate number of expert staff to carry out the expanded agenda laid out here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House, in coordination with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and departments and agencies, can and should complete a horizon-scanning exercise and clearly define a hierarchy of risks that identifies and explains the most significant threats for the nation and the world. What are the uncontrollable potential pandemic pathogens and the broad societal implications of greatest concern? How should the United States prioritize those pathogens that pose the greatest societal risks while recognizing new, presently unknown threats likely to emerge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House, working with ODNI and other partners, can and should be responsible for iteratively assessing the threat landscape, accounting for scientific and technological changes along with the reemergence of dangerous pathogens and arrival of new infectious disease threats. A special effort should be made to strengthen U.S. biosecurity intelligence capabilities. The White House is uniquely positioned to direct new capabilities that not only reduce the highest-priority risks but are also beneficial in addressing other bacterial and fungal threats, including drug-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House should work with senior-level, designated, visible counterparts at HHS, the Department of Defense (DOD), and other agencies to harmonize the special capabilities of different departments, prioritize investments, and eliminate redundancies. A subgoal should be to review existing layered biosafety and biosecurity protections with the aim of eliminating those that are ineffectual and elevating those that most effectively address priority risks across life sciences research, biotechnology development, and biomanufacturing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House is best positioned to drive and integrate the capabilities of the security sector — including its ability to analyze signals and manage massive volumes of data — with the health and biological domains. These efforts should also be coordinated with industry and academic partners in support of the U.S. National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan and the vision to create medical countermeasures (MCMs) for all potential pandemic pathogens. It should conduct periodic exercises to evaluate U.S. pandemic preparedness, including preparedness for deliberate and accidental outbreaks, by deploying national capabilities, including rapid product development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-3-the-us-government-should-mandate-universal-screening-of-dna-synthesis-orders-and-create-incentives-to-make-implementation-achievable-it-should-also-extend-the-voluntary-research-norm-of-know-your-customer-beyond-dna-products-to-all-private-sector-biotech-providers-of-goods-and-services&quot;&gt;Action 3: The U.S. government should mandate universal screening of DNA synthesis orders and create incentives to make implementation achievable. It should also extend the voluntary research norm of “know your customer” beyond DNA products to all private sector biotech providers of goods and services.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government needs to strengthen oversight of and safeguards for DNA synthesis providers, particularly as new benchtop synthesis technologies evolve and become far more readily accessible outside of major laboratories. Private industry is reportedly asking for mandated screening of DNA synthesis orders to ensure responsible actors are not financially penalized for implementing safeguards of their own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, President Joseph Biden directed the U.S. government to establish a framework to encourage providers of synthetic DNA to screen orders for potential national security risks. The government will engage with industry partners to refine best practices for technical implementation, clarify reporting mechanisms, and encourage voluntary compliance. It will also mandate compliance for companies that receive federal funding. This important step by the White House should be strengthened through additional legislative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various other incentives for private sector biotech, such as financial offsets or tax incentives, particularly for those who do not receive government grants and contracts, could help expedite the transition by making compliance with such regulatory standards financially viable for DNA providers. Other forms of active support could be valuable, such as improving training on the responsibilities of industry for biosecurity and establishing an advice center to assist in adjudication of orders that have an ambiguous biosecurity risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should expand the guidance that biotech companies “know your customer” to all biotech industry providers of goods and services, including those that create custom molecules, modify strains, and allow for the outsourcing of key lab work. Such companies provide critical scientific resources and knowledge for their downstream customers and therefore serve as important control points to guard against misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-4-all-federal-government-investments-and-grants-in-infectious-disease-research-on-potential-pandemic-pathogens--in-the-united-states-and-internationally--should-require-a-dedicated-and-integrated-investment-in-biosafety-and-biosecurity-safeguards-including-applied-research-and-innovation-by-design&quot;&gt;Action 4: All federal government investments and grants in infectious disease research on potential pandemic pathogens — in the United States and internationally — should require a dedicated and integrated investment in biosafety and biosecurity safeguards, including applied research and innovation by design.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HHS should designate a visible, active, senior-level lead who is responsible for integrating biosecurity and biosafety investments into grants and contracts for life sciences research, biotechnology development, and biomanufacturing, in accordance with Section 9 of the Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an essential step if new norms and standards for biosafety and biosecurity are to be adopted and routinized, if a biosafety and biosecurity innovation ecosystem is to be created, and if a skilled biosafety and biosecurity discipline is to be established. Investments in biosafety and biosecurity research and innovation can also help keep pace with emerging biological risks associated with rapid technological advances by developing effective safeguards and risk management tools. This goal could be realized if a modest percentage (1–4 percent) of the research grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other U.S. government agencies on infectious diseases in the viral families with pandemic potential is dedicated to biosafety and biosecurity, with research and risk assessment built into the initial proposal design. In addition, there should be a separate pool of funding to conduct biosafety research, which could include wet lab work involving pathogens as well as work outside containment settings involving the physical sciences, the life sciences, the social sciences, and human systems research. These investments will deepen the grasp of what it takes to create reproducibility, identify recurrent mistakes, increase efficiency, and move toward embracing a bold target of no lab-linked uncontrolled outbreaks of potential pandemic pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These same requirements should also be built into U.S. global research funding on potential pandemic pathogens, including Pandemic Fund grantmaking, and into the operations of executive agencies carrying out infectious disease work. International norm-setting organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), and the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS) will play an important role. This approach may be modeled, in part, on how the Human Genome Project built in funding for ethical considerations and how the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have pressed for research projects to take account of ethical, legal, and societal implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-5-the-us-government-should-pursue-a-far-more-muscular-diplomacy-to-secure-biosafety-and-biosecurity-safeguards-globally&quot;&gt;Action 5: The U.S. government should pursue a far more muscular diplomacy to secure biosafety and biosecurity safeguards globally.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every area of U.S. domestic policy in biosafety and biosecurity, there should be a conscious and deliberate effort to explain how innovations tie to U.S. diplomacy to strengthen capabilities with external partners. U.S. domestic policy is often developed with little regard for the global context, yet it is frequently, in practice, a de facto baseline for the world. U.S. global programs cannot be treated as an add-on; rather, the U.S. approach to advancing biosecurity and biosafety must be seen as an integral component of a strategy that can be implemented in a wide range of resource-rich and resource-limited settings. The demand for U.S. technical expertise, best practices, and training is rising steeply as middle-income countries in particular invest in an exceedingly swift expansion of high-containment laboratories. Building effective partnerships across the range of areas detailed below requires sustained outreach and engagement; a commitment to equity, access, technology transfer, and strengthening of local and regional capabilities; a belief in combining bilateral and multilateral strategies; and an upgraded communications capability to combat mis- and disinformation against U.S. programs and affirm and promote responsible scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;U.S. global programs cannot be treated as an add-on; rather, the U.S. approach to advancing biosecurity and biosafety must be seen as an integral component of a strategy that can be implemented in a wide range of resource-rich and resource-limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. diplomacy of expanded U.S. global investments in biosafety and biosecurity will strengthen bilateral partnerships and global norms and standards. As several U.S. government agencies and programs already conduct work in these areas, the challenge now becomes how to create far more coherence, vitality, and visible unity of effort through both the newly launched Department of State Bureau of Global Health Security and Diplomacy and the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, particularly the Division of Select Agents and Toxins program; the HHS Office of Global Affairs; the U.S. Agency for International Development; and the DOD Biological Threat Reduction Program, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. diplomacy should prioritize the following activities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Require biosecurity and biosafety investments as integral components across U.S. global health and health security policies and programs&lt;/em&gt;, especially those providing laboratory, surveillance, and workforce capacity to combat infectious disease threats. This work to strengthen and build capacity and standards, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, is critical to sustain, detect, and respond to naturally occurring threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invest in multilateral institutions&lt;/em&gt; to strengthen routine and emergency biosafety and biosecurity efforts and reduce vulnerabilities outside U.S. borders. Activities should include investment in the WHO and close support for the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, including the Biological Weapons Convention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engage systematically with China and the G20 on biosafety and biosecurity norms.&lt;/em&gt; No credible U.S. global strategy can ignore China. That said, this goal will require careful, incremental bilateral efforts to address key challenges and involve navigating existing tensions with China and the deep hostility toward China in the United States. The United States will also need to cultivate a coalition of like-minded global partners, including across the G20, and work with other regional partners — including Singapore, Vietnam, India, and Indonesia — and multilateral institutions to test what pressure points and forms of engagement with China would be most fruitful. The November 15 meeting between President Biden and Chinese president Xi Jinping in San Francisco and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Week that followed may create new opportunities for dialogues in 2024 on biosafety and biosecurity, including under the auspices of new talks on the risk associated with AI. Those possibilities should be systematically tested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also engage with and support promising new lines of international work in biosafety and biosecurity as they evolve, define the gaps they will fill, and demonstrate concrete returns. Two nascent developments are of particular note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)&lt;/em&gt; is working to leverage its laboratory, manufacturing, and preclinical animal model research networks in partner countries to catalyze responsible capacity building with a focus in the Global South. Through U.S. support to CEPI’s vision to develop MCMs for all potential pandemic pathogens, it will be important to ensure that biosecurity and biosafety investments are integrated as explicit priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IBBIS&lt;/em&gt; aims to provide tools and best practices to biotech industry, academia, funders, governments, and other global stakeholders to improve biosecurity and biosafety by safeguarding the tools of modern bioscience and biotechnology. Although IBBIS will be a nongovernmental organization, it will potentially advance key U.S. biosecurity and biosafety goals and raise the bar globally. Support for IBBIS should include using U.S. diplomatic convening power and technical expertise to build international political support for the organization and its work. Under the management of IBBIS, a bio funders’ compact with philanthropic and other private donors could be valuable in strengthening norms and incentives for compliance with biosecurity best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-6-create-rules-of-the-road-for-us-supported-viral-discovery-work&quot;&gt;Action 6: Create rules of the road for U.S.-supported viral discovery work.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both U.S. civilian and military institutions have funded field research in remote settings, often in bat caves, to search for new viruses with pandemic potential. But while research on naturally occurring pathogens remains critical, much more careful U.S. guidance is needed in the form of enforceable and effective rules to assess, permit, and fund this type of work. Clearer standards are needed to weigh the possible scientific benefits, identify the potential dangers, determine whether those risks can be mitigated, and judge whether the work can be pursued responsibly. Protocols should be established for field research and sampling before specimens reach the lab. Once new pathogens are discovered, there should be clearer guidance around the personal protective equipment (PPE) standards required and the biosafety level appropriate to handle such unknown, novel risks. Guidance could also be developed for communities on how to avoid interactions that could lead to zoonotic spillover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post-Covid era, funders and scientists have turned away from funding research on potentially dangerous viruses to a significant degree, in part out of fear of accusations of lab leaks. New, more effective rules will be an essential element in sustaining responsible future research and should be developed based on consultation with experts inside and outside government to ensure standards are reasonable, evidence-based, and not subject to political interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-7-invest-in-research-on-a-rolling-iterative-basis-on-the-risks-of-ai-convergence-with-biotechnologies&quot;&gt;Action 7: Invest in research on a rolling, iterative basis on the risks of AI convergence with biotechnologies.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. civilian and military agencies should invest in an ambitious research agenda to assess the dual-use risks posed by AI-enabled bio design tools, consider what steps will effectively prevent large language models (LLMs) from lowering knowledge barriers to the misuse of biology, monitor ongoing developments in AI-enabled automation of life sciences research, and establish preemptive guardrails to protect data and advance norms and standards for these technologies. This research should be done on an ongoing basis to keep pace with technological advances and identify emerging risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these research priorities are articulated in the new White House executive order on AI, which initiates several reviews on both how AI could increase biosecurity risks and how it could benefit biological discovery and public health. The order directs a variety of agencies and departments to develop guidance and benchmarks for auditing future AI capabilities, including red-teaming and evaluating dual-use models, and for protecting U.S. government biological data, elevating responsibility for implementation to a new cabinet-level White House AI council. It also eases the pathways for AI professionals to join the federal government, which will be critical to ensure that agencies have the staff capacity to monitor advancing capabilities and, when needed, institute new guidance, safeguards, and regulations in an agile way. The executive order recognizes the international nature of these threats and commits the United States to working with other nations to ensure technologies are safe, secure, trustworthy, and interoperable. Partner nations echoed these collaborative intentions at the 2023 AI Safety Summit in the United Kingdom, in the resulting Bletchley Declaration, and in related efforts by the G7 and the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should make clear it will work only with LLM developers who are dedicated to producing safe and secure models — for instance, those who agreed to voluntary commitments with the White House earlier in 2023. It should also support efforts within the science community to establish and implement principles to guide responsible use of AI technologies in biomolecular design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;action-8-research-and-update-basic-laboratory-protections-including-fit-for-purpose-ppe-and-workforce-training&quot;&gt;Action 8: Research and update basic laboratory protections, including fit-for-purpose PPE and workforce training.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should invest in research and demonstration pilots focused on innovative, fit-for-purpose PPE that is better adapted to the diverse healthcare workforce. Actions should include encouraging the uptake of reusable PPE, which has been shown to lower infection rates and increase productivity; adapting the standard for health worker PPE to follow designs for women; creating designs that accommodate religious headwear, beards, and the faces of people of color; and providing workforce training. There should also be a focus on ensuring a warm manufacturing base, options for rapid expansion of domestic production and distribution in the event of an emergency, and improved monitoring of logistics chains of raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, organizations that engage in research on potential pandemic pathogens should have established relationships with regional or national medical centers equipped to provide full-spectrum diagnostic and treatment capabilities and biocontainment in the event of accidental pathogen exposure. This would be a critical step outside the lab to prevent further community spread. Regional relationships could be established through the National Emerging Special Pathogens Training and Education Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-moment-of-opportunity&quot;&gt;A Moment of Opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post-Covid moment, the eight commonsense actions proposed by the CSIS bipartisan alliance lay out a realistic vision for achieving concerted progress in reducing the risks of biological accidents and misuse of dangerous biological agents while providing a safe path for continued research on naturally occurring infectious disease threats. These eminently pragmatic steps are affordable and need not be unduly burdensome, and they will enhance the protection of Americans and others who are vulnerable today. But that protection will only be realized with sufficient political will and a sustained commitment to building adequate staff and programs. An expedited costing exercise is an important next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These eminently pragmatic steps are affordable and need not be unduly burdensome, and they will enhance the protection of Americans and others who are vulnerable today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At their core, these commonsense actions will address two vexing gaps. They will clarify who at the White House is mandated to set national policy and ensure authoritative leadership, including effective coordination and oversight across the government and with partners outside government. They will also enhance the U.S. government’s capability to implement policies in the many diverse departments and agencies that require stronger biosafety and biosecurity approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If carried forward, this package of actions could win support from diverse political perspectives and different institutional interests, deliver results that stir momentum, and open a pathway to U.S. leadership at home and abroad in creating a far safer and more predictable bioeconomy.&lt;/p&gt;

However, it faces several major hurdles to before it can reach its objective of achieving battlefield superiority in selected areas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussing Russia and high technology these days may seem counterintuitive given the images from Ukraine of the Russian army in disarray, in trenches, using primarily massive artillery rather than ultramodern weapons with a high degree of autonomy. Likewise, the typical Russian tendency for overblown rhetoric has created unrealistic expectations among the broader public of what Russia was ready to deliver on the battlefield. Yet, the war is also providing a testing ground for new weapons systems on both sides. Mounting troubles notwithstanding, Russia continues to prioritise AI and selected emerging and disruptive technology (EDT) programmes not merely despite, but because of the weakening of its conventional forces and the growing capability gap with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drivers-behind-russian-interest-in-ai&quot;&gt;Drivers Behind Russian Interest in AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a host of incentives driving the Russian political and military leadership’s continued focus on AI, despite the attention consumed by its war of aggression. AI is seen as a source both of potentially rapid military modernisation and of new vulnerabilities that enemies can exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russian authorities launched a large-scale military reform programme in 2008, they expressed the concern that it would be too time-consuming to catch up militarily with the West the traditional way. EDTs, conversely, seemed to offer a potentially rapid, non-linear pathway to narrow – if not close – the capability gap. This logic still applies. Moreover, given the growing asymmetry in conventional power due to Russia’s extensive personnel and material losses in Ukraine, this reasoning appears even more relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian authorities believe that trends such as the proliferation of autonomous and AI-enabled weapons systems and the convergence between human–machine learning, cyber and AI, coupled with novel operational concepts and force structures, will change the trajectory and character of future warfare and human involvement therein. Consequently, these developments seem to have the potential to undermine fundamental pillars of international security such as deterrence, arms control and strategic balance. Therefore, gaining or losing ground in the contest for cutting-edge military technology appears to have profound consequences for power distribution and Russia’s influence in the international system. Indeed, President Vladimir Putin has consistently spoken about technological development in existential terms: one either succeeds or they will be annihilated. In 2023, he compared AI development to the invention of the nuclear bomb – an event that fundamentally changed the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Putin and other central players anticipate that defence innovation – and AI in particular – will produce dual-use technology that can drive a nationwide economic growth. This is needed now more than ever given the weight of Western sanctions. The hope is that the domestic defence industry will be able to provide technological solutions that Russia can no longer get from abroad. As put by the head of the AI Department at the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD), Vasilii Yelistratov, military-civilian transfer takes place in both directions. Likewise, German Gref, the CEO of Russia’s largest state-owned bank Sberbank and one of the key figures in Russian AI development, argues that the introduction of AI could increase Russia’s GDP by 1% by 2025. He has pointed to Sberbank’s increase in labour productivity as a result of implementing AI. Others are even more optimistic. In July 2023, Russia hosted its first Future Technologies Forum, where Putin promised to transition the whole national economy and governance system to a new management model based on AI and Big Data in order to boost labour productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these promises and benefits are yet to materialise, such statements and assessments clearly demonstrate the importance that Russian authorities attach to AI development, both for the future of the armed forces and the state as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-is-russia-going-about-developing-ai&quot;&gt;How is Russia Going About Developing AI?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian approach to defence innovation is based on a traditional top-down, state-driven model, although with important modifications. The objective is to take advantage of the progress being made in the civilian sector by fostering civil-military cooperation. In this way, Russia aims to maximise the state’s access to talent, resources and ideas, thus shortening the time between the generation of an idea and its full implementation. This approach appears to partly emulate US military-civilian sector cooperation, as well as the Chinese model of military-civil fusion, connecting science and technology parks to the campuses of large military universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defence R&amp;amp;D infrastructure is centrally coordinated by the Russian MoD’s Main Directorate of Innovative Development (GUIR). To further strengthen the MoD’s role as an engine for AI implementation, a special AI department was created in 2021. GUIR’s role is to organise, coordinate and support innovation programmes. Russia’s defence R&amp;amp;D infrastructure consists of several hundred research institutes, design bureaus and testing centres that conduct applied research for the needs of the armed forces and the defence industry. In addition, Russia has created a number of AI centres and laboratories at leading academic institutions, such as the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Lab at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology; the Higher School of Economics; the Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences; the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; and the National Centre for Cognitive Technologies at the Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics University in Saint Petersburg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ecosystem is supplemented with so called “radical innovation centres”, “technoparks” or “technocities” as generators of ideas and dual-use technologies. The Advanced Research Foundation (Fond perspektivnykh issledovanii), created in 2012, focuses on developing new and potentially disruptive dual-use technologies, such as unmanned vehicles (the Marker unmanned ground vehicle and the Udar unmanned tank); autonomous systems and automated decision-making; superconductors (Liman); additive technology of polymetallic products (Matritsa); autonomous deep-submergence vehicles (Vityaz-D); and ultra-thin materials for improving individual camouflage and protection (Tavolga).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, in 2018 Russia established the Era Technopolis, which explicitly seeks to develop technology for the Russian armed forces in cooperation with the military-industrial complex and the civilian sector. Currently, there are more than 100 entities involved in cooperation with Era, including top arms manufacturers such as Kalashnikov, Sukhoi and Sozvezdie and dozens of civilian universities and research institutions, including the Kurchatov Institute – which hosts the largest interdisciplinary laboratory that has received a special role in Era, contributing to its management. The structure is supplemented with military scientific units (nauchnye roty), created first in 2013 on the basis of Russian military research and higher educational institutions. As of 2023, eight units are operating as part of Era within their specialised fields of expertise. Staffed by conscripts, Russia hopes that these units may also provide a recruiting ground, allowing it to retain specialists in the armed forces and defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Among the top priorities is improving command, control, communication and decision-making with AI, seen as critical to gaining and maintaining information superiority&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Era has a cluster of 16 prioritised development fields, including AI, pattern recognition, robotics, small spacecrafts, information security, energy sufficiency, nanotechnology, nanomaterials, information and telecommunication systems, information technology and computer science, hydrometeorological and geophysical support, hydroacoustic object detection systems, geographic information platforms for military use, weapons based on new physical principles, radiolocation and targeting for high-precision weapons, and automated control. As Deputy Head of ERA for Scientific and Educational Activities Andrey Morozov explained, AI technology is not so much a product in itself, but rather a foundation intersecting almost all of the military’s EDT programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-russias-defence-ai-priorities&quot;&gt;What are Russia’s Defence AI Priorities?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a broad spectrum of programmes that are similar to those developed in the US and China, though they are usually smaller in scale. As of September 2022, GUIR has supported over 500 projects, 222 of which were planned for completion and implementation in 2022. Among the extensive list of projects, it is possible to discern several priority areas, including command, control, communication and decision-making; unmanned vehicles; nuclear and high-precision weapons; air defence, early warning, electronic warfare and space-based systems; and cyber and influence operations to shape the psychological domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the list of Russian AI-enabled projects is too extensive for this article, below are some examples that illustrate the areas of Russia’s particular interest in AI for defence applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the top priorities is improving command, control, communication and decision-making with AI, seen as critical to gaining and maintaining information superiority. At a Defence Ministry Board meeting in December 2022, Putin called for the integration of AI technology at “all levels of decision-making” in the armed forces. The National Defence Management Centre, established in 2014 to provide the primary joint all-domain command and control structure, reportedly applies AI to support information collection, analysis and decision-making. Notably, Putin has referred to experiences from the battlefield in Ukraine, which in his assessment show that the most effective weapons systems are those that operate quickly and “almost in an automatic mode.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unmanned systems, furthermore, stand out as a special priority for AI applications. Before the 2022 invasion, Russia had more than 100 types of unmanned vehicles for a broad spectrum of missions at different stages of research, development and deployment. Many have been tested in Syria and are currently being employed in Ukraine. One of them is the KUB-LA kamikaze drone. Its producer, ZALA Aero Group – a subsidiary of Kalashnikov – claims it is able to select and engage targets with the use of AI technology. Another example is the Lancet-3 loitering munition, also observed in Ukraine. According to the same producer, it is highly autonomous given the use of sensors that enable it to locate and destroy a target without human guidance, even being capable of returning to the operator if a target has not been found. Likewise, Russia is testing several Marker unmanned ground vehicles that aim to use AI-enabled object recognition, process data via neural network algorithms, and employ autonomous driving capabilities. It remains unclear at this stage whether these unmanned systems have been used in this way in Ukraine. More data will be needed to verify their actual capabilities. Nonetheless, these claims indicate the areas of interest and the level of ambition when it comes to AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Russian authorities, AI and autonomous elements are also being applied in the guidance systems of other key weapons such as the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile. Yelistratov has claimed that AI is “present in all weapons, especially in high-precision ones”. Russia is also using such technology in experimental weapons systems, such as the Poseidon nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable unmanned underwater vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Aerospace Forces, created in 2015 to integrate defensive and offensive capabilities, have been developed to disrupt or degrade the foundations of US and NATO information technology-enabled warfare, including communications, space-based systems, critical networks and infrastructure that developed countries depend on. Despite claims in the first months of the war that Russia was not using electronic warfare in Ukraine, several systems have been confirmed to be operating in Ukraine, some of which allegedly employ AI. Among them is the RB109-A Bylina, which – according to Russian sources – uses AI to collect and prioritise large amounts of data to efficiently jam electronic signals. In June 2023, Russia reportedly used the S-350 Vityaz mobile surface-to-air defence missile system to shoot down a Ukrainian aircraft while operating in autonomous mode – that is, the system detected, tracked and destroyed a Ukrainian air target without human assistance. To verify such claims, more evidence will be necessary. There are plans to use the system to protect Moscow against Ukrainian drones from the end of 2023, which may provide additional information about the system’s actual capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-the-obstacles&quot;&gt;What are the Obstacles?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of Russian defence AI development varies; some programmes are more advanced than others. Generally, however, Russia lags behind its main competitors, the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia continues to struggle with long-standing structural problems, such as insufficient funding, extensive corruption, inefficient use of resources, poor quality control, low labour productivity across the economy, the reliance of the defence industry on state order, and preferential funding that undermines competition and innovation. Weak rule of law, deficient intellectual property rights, and heavy-handed bureaucratic control are other factors hampering innovation. The education system appears to no longer be a suitable foundation for hi-tech development, as the Soviet system once was. Despite taking a number of steps to improve interest in and the quality of science and IT education, Russia has also been sliding down the Global Innovation Index, going from 43rd place in 2016 to 47th in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also doubts about the efficiency of the Russian defence innovation model itself. The cooperation framework managed by the Main Directorate for Innovation involves more than 1,200 entities including industrial parks, engineering centres, financial development institutions and leading universities and research institutes, and it is growing. One question is whether Russia’s extensive R&amp;amp;D infrastructure can be successfully managed and coordinated centrally by the MoD, not least given widespread corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Statements by Russian authorities indicate that the battlefield advantages provided by AI-enabled weapons systems and infrastructure are among the lessons Russia has been learning in Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These long-standing impediments are aggravated by the circumstantial constraints generated as a consequence of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Despite Russian authorities’ assurances about the benefits of sanctions in terms of reducing Russia’s dependence on Western technology such as microelectronics, Russia is now growing more reliant on third countries – notably China, which is filling Russia’s most pressing technology gaps. Sanctions are likely to have a long-standing impact on the Russian national economy and tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, however, Russia has been able – to some degree – to evade sanctions and exploit loopholes in the exports control regime, using illicit networks to smuggle key components to third countries, from where they can be shipped to Russia. As a result, for instance, Russia has managed not only to continue but to double missile and tank production compared to the numbers before February 2022. Likewise, in August 2023, the Moscow State University launched its new supercomputer, which is to be used for various AI and high-performance computing applications and for training large AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Russia is struggling with other pervasive problems, such as the long-standing decline in professional expertise in the defence sector. The country has witnessed a demographic decline over the past 30 years, further worsened by short life expectancy. The exodus of IT specialists, top scientists and university professors in the wake of the invasion and the high casualties on the battlefield are likely to aggravate the brain drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are likely to impact the culture of defence innovation. On the one hand, the brain drain, economic hardships, and limited access to ideas from and cooperation with other countries may further undermine creativity and aggravate existing structural problems. On the other hand, the Russian leadership is determined to rebuild and modernise its ravaged armed forces, and aims to do so rapidly. This, together with the pressure to deliver technological solutions for immediate battlefield deployment, could accelerate the development of AI for defence applications. Statements by the Russian authorities, including Putin, clearly indicate that the battlefield advantages provided by AI-enabled weapons systems and infrastructure are among the lessons Russia has been learning in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tentative-conclusions&quot;&gt;Tentative Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall deployment of Russian AI-enabled systems indicates that Russian AI appears to be in the early stages of maturity. The primary focus is on incremental evolution: upgrading legacy systems – nuclear, strategic non-nuclear, and non-military methods and means of warfare – with new technologies. Russia is combining conventional warfare and platforms with innovative technological solutions, including AI in data analysis and decision support, loitering munitions, electronic warfare and communication analysis, and as a component in cyber warfare and information confrontation – to name but a few examples. Simultaneously, Russia is experimenting with selected “risky projects” and novel systems, materials and approaches to warfare that can potentially yield battlefield advantages – if not superiority – in selected areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in assessing Russian – and other countries’ – AI-enabled weapon systems is the difficulty of determining when full autonomy has actually been used in a lethal context, as opposed to declarations by authorities or producers that may have agendas other than speaking the truth (such as advertising systems to potential buyers, or portraying the army as ultramodern to impress domestic and international audiences). More data and cross-referencing will be needed to verify such claims. Still, these statements provide important information about the types of capabilities and capacities that the state is interested in and actively pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of Russian defence AI development is further complicated by the ambiguity of the term “AI” in the Russian discourse. According to the official definition provided in the 2019 Russian AI Strategy, AI consists of “technological solutions capable of mimicking human cognition and performing intellectual tasks similarly to, or better than, humans”. The Russian definition distinguishes between “automation” (avtomatizatsiya) – that is, automated, remotely controlled and semi-autonomous weapons systems – and “intellectualisation” (intellektualizatsiya), corresponding to integrated machine learning and other sub-elements of AI technology. However, these terms are often used interchangeably – as are automation and autonomy – and without proper precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extensive Russian failures during the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine are likely to prompt major reassessment and reforms in the Russian armed forces. It remains to be seen whether the experience will also result in a major push to accelerate defence innovation. In any case, the Russian regime is unequivocal about where its priorities lie: despite the deteriorating economic environment, falling living standards and the mounting cost of the war, Russia is doubling down on military spending. According to the draft state budget for 2024, the plan is to increase defence spending by 68% compared to the 2023 defence budget, constituting 6% of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is yet to be seen whether Russia will follow through, and if so, to what extent its military organisation will be able to absorb the funding efficiently, and how much will be devoted to defence AI and R&amp;amp;D. However, as Russia rebuilds its armed forces, it will not necessarily just reconstruct what has been lost in Ukraine. The lessons learned in this war will inform the selection of priorities for military modernisation. Moreover, as a swift miliary-build up in a linear fashion will be hindered by the constrained socioeconomic and industrial environment, AI will likely remain a top priority for selected applications in the pursuit of rapid gains in battlefield advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Vladimir Zarudnitskii, Head of the Russian Military Academy of the General Staff, is right in saying that the ability to adapt AI-enabled systems will have a major impact on the Russian armed forces and warfare in general. However, developing the technology is only the first of many hurdles that Russia has to surmount before it can claim success. To take advantage of AI and other EDTs, Russia has to not only harness technology itself, but also adapt concepts, doctrines, forces structures and recruitment patterns accordingly. The conflict in Ukraine, meanwhile, has exposed a high degree of institutional conservatism in the Russian military. There are indications, nonetheless, that the Russians are adapting, however slowly. To what extent the leadership will be able to draw the right conclusions and increase responsiveness to change across the military organisation under the conditions of an ongoing war remains to be seen. Russia’s symmetric and asymmetric responses will shed more light on the ability of its military to learn and apply lessons – or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

Commercial satellite imagery reveals that China has made significant progress on a naval base it is constructing for Bangladesh’s military. The base houses a pair of submarines that Dhaka received from Beijing two years before ground broke at the facility. China has likewise transferred a submarine to neighboring Myanmar to aid the embattled military regime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s efforts to strengthen ties with Bangladesh and Myanmar are taking place amid growing geopolitical competition with India. As smaller powers in the region seek to shore up their military capabilities, India and China are striving to become the security provider of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, China has increasingly filled that role. Since 2010, more than two-thirds of Bangladesh’s arms imports, and nearly half of Myanmar’s, have come from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military-to-military exchanges also support China’s strategic objectives. Closer defense ties may help the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) secure access to logistics facilities needed to sustain future naval operations in the region. The U.S. Department of Defense includes both Bangladesh and Myanmar on its short list of locations where Beijing has likely considered establishing overseas military facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining a foothold in the Bay of Bengal would significantly level up the PLA’s ability to operate farther from China’s own shores and create new challenges for India, as well as the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of the Forces Goal 2030 initiative designed to modernize its military, Bangladesh ordered its first two submarines from China in 2013 for the bargain price of just $203 million. Both vessels are Type 035G diesel-electric attack submarines, a Ming-class variant first commissioned into the PLA Navy (PLAN) in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China refitted and upgraded the two vessels before handing them over to Bangladesh in 2016, but their capabilities remain far behind modern attack submarines fielded by today’s leading navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one year after handing over the vessels, the giant Chinese state-owned defense contractor Poly Technologies secured a $1.2 billion contract with Bangladesh to build a new submarine support facility on the country’s southeastern coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xw4vYiA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Work on the BNS Sheikh Hasina Naval Base kicked off in the summer of 2018. By 2020, Chinese builders had made significant progress in constructing the foundations of the 1.75 square kilometer facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IQCdJNm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bangladesh inaugurated the new facility in March 2023. The base’s namesake, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, praised the capabilities of the base, calling it “ultra-modern.” Several Chinese officials, including at least two senior PLAN officers, were present at the opening ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery from July 2023 shows that construction continues. Despite the ongoing work, Bangladesh has already stationed its Chinese-made submarines there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once completed, the base will be capable of docking six submarines and eight warships simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ties to the base may go well beyond its construction. A senior Bangladeshi official acknowledged that Chinese personnel would also be involved in training Bangladesh’s submariners on how to operate the submarines and the new base, although few details have been shared publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in her remarks at the base’s opening, Prime Minister Hasina noted that the facility could be used as a service point for ships sailing in the Bay of Bengal—a potential signal that the PLAN may one day call at port there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast with the media fanfare normally associated with China’s overseas infrastructure projects, official outlets have been conspicuously silent on the base. These hushed tones may be intended to avoid antagonizing India, where there are mounting concerns over China’s role in developing the military capabilities of its neighbors. Beijing may also be seeking to avoid stoking additional unease among the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, Bangladesh has sought to balance its geopolitical relationships with both India and China. Even as it courts military support from China, the Bangladeshi military also conducts annual bilateral exercises with the Indian military, including most recently in October 2023. Nevertheless, as China endeavors to strengthen ties with Bangladesh, the PLAN may find it an increasingly receptive partner in the Bay of Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LdE9Kco.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further south along the bay’s coast, China appears to be pursuing a similar strategy in Myanmar. In 2021, it transferred a Type 035B (Ming-class) submarine to the Myanmar navy in a sign of support to the embattled military junta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal was shrouded in secrecy, but China may have provided the submarine for free in a bid to outcompete India’s efforts to gain influence there. Just one year prior, India gifted Myanmar’s then democratically elected transitional government a Russian-built Kilo-class submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media reports revealed that in 2022 Myanmar’s military (the Tatmadaw) docked its new Chinese-built submarine at the Thit Poke Taung Navy Base, which is strategically positioned on a stretch of land jutting into the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal. Satellite imagery from April 2023 provides a bird’s-eye view of the base, with the Chinese-made submarine clearly visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VlpJuYF.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facility lies just 10 kilometers north of Kyaukpyu Port, which is home to one of China’s marquee infrastructure projects in the region. China invested billions of dollars into building liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil facilities and pipelines from Kyaukpyu Port to Yunnan Province in southern China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pipelines can reportedly carry some 12 billion cubic meters of gas and 22 million barrels of oil per year. These projects are aimed, in part, at reducing China’s dependence on the nearby Malacca Strait, a critical maritime chokepoint through which much of China’s energy imports flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese state-owned firms CITIC and China Harbor Engineering Company are also seeking to develop a deepwater port and a special economic zone project at Kyaukpyu, in what Chinese state media have referred to as a “model project in China-Myanmar BRI [Belt and Road Initiative] cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $7.3 billion project is expected to begin construction after an ongoing environmental assessment is complete. Much like other projects developed through China’s favored “Port-Park-City Model” (or Shekou Model, 蛇口模式), the entire zone will be under CITIC control for 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myanmar has long been sharply resistant to foreign interference in its domestic affairs. Yet the military regime’s increasing isolation and growing dependence on China for critical economic and political support has already magnified Beijing’s influence in Naypyidaw. As the PLAN extends its operations to safeguard China’s growing interests in the region, the Kyaukpyu Port or the nearby naval facility at Thit Poke Taung may prove to be attractive options to provide its vessels with logistical support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Fosgug5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s efforts to court countries in the region through submarine diplomacy have not been without their failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, officials in Thailand shelved a deal to purchase three Yuan-class S26T submarines from China. The purchase fell through after Germany refused to export the engines for the vessels to China, and Thailand rejected the option of substituting them with Chinese-made engines. The Thai government, which already paid a roughly $194 million installment on the submarines, is considering purchasing Chinese frigates instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the setback, Beijing’s influence in the region continues to grow, heating up long-simmering anxieties in India. New Delhi has begun to push back against Beijing’s expanding influence by investing in its own naval forces and increasingly partnering with the United States on regional maritime security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts could also pay off for the PLAN. Big-ticket arms sales and infrastructure projects may not inevitably or immediately translate into China setting up its own military facilities in the Bay of Bengal. Yet they could help pave the way for the PLAN to gain access to logistical facilities that it needs to operate with greater confidence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will likely proceed carefully, choosing to gradually deepen its foothold without crossing thresholds that could draw unwanted attention. As the PLAN becomes more entrenched in the Bay of Bengal, Washington and its partners should work in lockstep to maintain a free and open region and ensure that the risk of conflict is kept at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns range from cyber security through to security of energy supply and economic security. The disruption to energy supply chains caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was felt mainly in terms of the physical supply of gas to Europe and the impact this had on the global market. In this context, this paper considers the implications of threats to the physical supply of some of the critical materials and products that the UK requires for its energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has benefited from being an early mover in the processing of many minerals used in net zero technologies, as well as in the production of intermediate goods and, more recently, final goods. In some elements of the supply chain China has a near monopoly (80–100% market share): the rare earths used to manufacture the permanent magnets used in wind turbines and electric vehicles (EVs) are just one example; other examples are connected to the production of battery anodes, high-quality spherical graphite, and the processing of manganese (also used in batteries). In the production of solar photovoltaic modules, meanwhile, China has a near monopoly on the production of polysilicon, silicon wafers and silicon cells. Added to this are very high concentrations (60–80% market share) in many other elements of these supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this dominance, this paper considers what risks China’s position in these supply chains poses to the physical supply of materials, components and final goods in the battery and EV, solar, wind and electricity grid supply chains, and whether China could deliberately leverage its position to impose costs on the UK. These risks are assessed according to whether they could affect the UK solely, a group of countries, or the entire market. The paper argues that risks to the UK specifically are currently limited by low levels of manufacturing of these technologies in the UK: because the UK typically imports final goods – where Chinese dominance is less pronounced – its direct dependence on Chinese suppliers is limited. However, the UK might still be an attractive target for largely symbolic measures intended to send political messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The targeting of country groupings (such as NATO or the EU) by sanctions and counter-sanctions amid geopolitical tensions is potentially more dangerous for the UK. Market concentration in China is likely to persist for the foreseeable future, and alternative supply chains are unlikely to be sufficient to meet the demands of multiple countries. At the same time, protectionist industrial policies in the EU and the US may complicate future access to supply chains (which could become less dependent on China), while markets currently lack transparency and, in some cases, scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest risk for the UK is shortages of critical minerals. Shortages are widely forecast, and China’s control of mineral processing and refining means it would play a central role in the allocation of scarce goods. Leveraging supply chains for political ends has historically been more effective in tight markets – the 1970s oil embargoes came during periods of tight supply – but China is more likely to allocate available supplies according to its own national economic interest. During the Covid-19 pandemic, high-volume contracts with Chinese companies were more likely to be honoured, and if this pattern were to be replicated it could mean that decisions about allocation were passed to companies, which would decide which of their domestic and international operations received scarce materials. However, China’s ban on Australian coal shows that where a security threat is perceived, Beijing will take action, even if it will cause damage to the Chinese economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also risks in terms of defence and international relations. Access to technology for the military is likely to be similar to that for the civilian economy for the time being, with net zero technologies currently most likely to be used for military logistics or for housing/bases. The most immediate risks relate to the secure operation of technologies, but these tend to be associated with cyber risks, which are not covered in this paper. The increased importance of critical minerals as commodities may change geopolitical dynamics and in some cases result in domestic and regional instability, influencing where the military is deployed. In the longer term, there are questions about whether China’s industrial power and growing technological advantage in net zero will be leveraged to create advantages for its own military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s role as the paramount – and in some cases only – investor in and purchaser of mineral ores will clearly be significant for its global influence. China’s role in producer countries, as well as its trading practices, will be important in shaping the character of the global market, with long-term implications for the UK’s defence and security policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is central to the new energy supply chains required for the decarbonisation of the global economy. It is a large investor in the mining of numerous critical materials and metals both domestically and abroad and, more significantly, the manufacture of critical energy-related components is heavily concentrated in China, meaning that many of the mined ores are sent there for processing. As a result, China is central to the production of wind turbines, solar photovoltaics (PV), permanent magnets, batteries and electric vehicles. As the energy transition unfolds and electrification gathers pace, demand for these materials and end products is set to increase. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that a concerted effort to reach the Paris Agreement goals (climate stabilisation at “well below 2°C global temperature rise”) would mean a quadrupling of mineral requirements for clean energy technologies by 2040. An even faster transition, to hit net zero globally by 2050, would require six times more critical mineral inputs in 2040 than in 2020. However, investment so far is falling short of what the world is forecast to need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s own net zero plans imply large increases in domestic demand for critical minerals and end products, as well as greater reliance on complex supply chains. Rapid growth requires stable markets and resilient supply chains, but events over the past few years have highlighted that stability is not guaranteed. The lack of investment in minerals globally suggests that shortages will occur and that costs will rise. In the past, increased pressure on mineral supplies has led to increased investment but, given the time lag for bringing on new supplies, price volatility has also ensued. Similar challenges related to the supply of new materials could delay the energy transition and raise the associated costs. Although cost increases and delays also spur technological innovations, net zero targets are approaching rapidly, meaning that new infrastructure and equipment need to be sourced and deployed. In this context, the UK government must balance the need to move quickly with decarbonisation against the cost and availability of materials and potential security risks from immature and concentrated supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the availability of minerals and metals are compounded by China’s central role in both mining and processing. The Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have highlighted the risks associated with market concentration and “just-in-time” supply chain strategies. Supply chain disruptions during the pandemic led to longer lead times and higher costs for supplies of manufactured goods from China. Lockdowns, combined with factory accidents and floods in China, reduced the availability of polysilicon, the starting material for wafers in solar cells, and as China produced 80% of the world’s supplies in 2020, prices rose by 350%. Some residential solar developers reported that, for the first time, their growth was constrained by the availability of equipment, rather than by sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and gas supply disruptions, energy security has become a top policy priority for many governments. Russia’s dominance in European gas supplies emphasised the risk of reliance on a single large supplier, creating alarm about China’s dominance in the provision of key materials and components for the energy transition. And, in the context of worsening US–China relations, many Western governments and companies are looking to de-risk their China exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government policies aimed at diversifying supply sources and processing facilities are critical, given the need for more materials and end products. But it is important to recognise that, even as China’s share of these processes falls, it will remain central to many energy supply chains. It is important that the UK, which currently has limited production capacity, understands the complexity of new energy supply chains, the risks associated with China’s dominance, and the various implications of diversifying, decoupling or de-risking them. Excluding China completely from the UK’s new energy supply chains is unrealistic and would be counterproductive for the UK’s net zero targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every strategy to diversify new energy supply chains needs to be seen in the context of the broader UK–China bilateral economic relationship, which topped £100 billion in the 12 months to the end of Q1 2023. New energy supply chains are only a small part of this relationship, which raises the question of whether there are risks specific to these supply chains that warrant targeted treatment, what these are, and how mitigation strategies fit into this much larger economic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have analysed different demand scenarios for critical materials and minerals, as well as the supply gap, and have described China’s dominance. But they do not assess how this dominance impacts the UK. This paper aims to fill that gap and asks: how has China become the dominant actor in new energy supply chains; and can China use its dominance in net zero energy supply chains to penalise the UK because of its policy choices? The paper argues that it will be very difficult for China to target the UK directly, given the complexity of the relevant supply chains. Any export controls or embargoes that China imposed on the UK would impact many other consumer countries equally. Similarly, the UK would not be insulated from any bottlenecks or breakdowns in these supply chains, impacting its ability to meet its net zero targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, China’s centrality across the entire value chain raises questions for the UK’s foreign and defence policies, as well as for its industrial and economic policy. These challenges need to be understood and assessed rationally. While this paper argues that it would be very difficult for China to target the UK specifically using new energy supply chains, it also seeks to highlight the different risks associated with market concentration in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is by no means a comprehensive assessment of all these risks and their various international ramifications. Further research and discussion are needed to advance the conversation, but a fact-based foundation is the important first step, and that is what this paper seeks to offer. Similarly, the paper does not assess cyber threats or environmental, social and governance concerns, which represent different categories of risk best covered in separate discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is based on publicly available sources in the English and Chinese languages. Quantitative data is drawn principally from a combination of official publications of national governments and international organisations, and industry and consultancy reports. A key challenge was the lack of consistency in the data between different sources, which is why the quantitative data on China’s share of global supply chain is presented as percentage bands rather than as precise percentages. Sources for qualitative information include policy documents and analyses produced by national governments and international organisations, consultancy and think tank reports, academic papers and online press articles. Finally, this paper is also informed by a closed research event hosted by RUSI, which involved officials from UK government departments, industry figures and think tank representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organised as follows: the first chapter briefly discusses Chinese government policies as they relate to net zero supply chains; the second chapter covers the UK’s need for low-carbon energy infrastructure; and the third chapter outlines areas of Chinese dominance in net zero supply chains. The fourth and final chapter offers a preliminary analysis of the risks in order to guide thinking about the scale and nature of the challenge – identifying foreign policy, defence and economic risks to the UK associated with China’s control over net zero supply chains – before offering some preliminary observations and suggestions for further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-chinese-government-policy-and-supply-chain-dominance&quot;&gt;I. Chinese Government Policy and Supply Chain Dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does not have a critical materials strategy per se, but its dominance in new energy supply chains emanates from a combination of early moves into various industrial applications (rare earths, batteries, solar PV and, to a lesser degree, wind turbines) via central and local government support accompanied by low labour, land and electricity costs. Compounded by the Chinese government’s concerns about energy security, industrial policies have aimed to advance electrification as a means of limiting imports of fossil fuels, mainly through the development of electric vehicles (EVs). While the battery and EV sector developed differently from solar PV and wind turbines (as discussed below), they benefited from similar industrial policies and from the government’s ability to support long-term goals. As such, signals from central government indicating that these were priority industries led to preferential policies for manufacturing, as well as financial support for innovation and (at times) for infrastructure and deployment. In addition, the low input costs that attracted foreign investors were combined with obligations to partner with Chinese firms, which then led to technology transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these industries developed and scaled up in China, the state also supported outbound investments in mining, with varying degrees of success, and with substantial variation in corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. The incentives shifted from focusing on one part of the supply chain to targeting integrated supply chains and, as these industrial activities expanded, to supporting industries and the pools of experienced labour which formed around them. Development of the industries was economically, rather than geopolitically, driven, with China seeking markets where it might gain a competitive advantage in order to generate employment and industrial growth. China’s solar PV development was initially conceived as an export-oriented industry to benefit from feed-in tariffs in countries such as Germany. That said, the Chinese government already recognised in the late 1980s that the availability of critical resources (such as rare earths) offered it a strategic advantage. Deng Xiaoping is reported to have remarked that while “the Middle East has oil, China has rare earths”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preferential policies differed among the supply chains and varied depending on the availability of mineral resources in China. In rare earths, for instance, where China has abundant resources, policies to support mining and processing date back to the 1970s, while foreign investments were confined to joint ventures in the 1990s. From that point, policies focused on limiting exports and encouraging Chinese companies to develop high-end products and devices, while also aiming to limit illegal mining and exports (which had severe environmental and health impacts in China, and which depressed prices domestically).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EV industry in China was born from a desire to foster industrial development and technological upgrading while also reducing the country’s dependence on oil imports. The government adopted supportive industrial policies for EV manufacturing, sales and charging infrastructure, offering tax incentives and subsidies for innovation and R&amp;amp;D as early as the mid-2000s. Much like the situation with rare earths, government policies that made foreign investments appealing were accompanied by cheap input costs, with the quid pro quo of partnering with Chinese car and battery makers. In 2012, as part of the 12th Five-Year Plan, the government issued the “Energy Saving and New Energy Automobile Industry Development Plan (2012–2020)” aimed at developing EV science and technology. The “Made in China 2025” plan, issued in 2015, introduced the development of the new energy vehicle (NEV) industry as a national strategy and, more broadly, encouraged new energy industries such as renewables. This built on the “Strategic Emerging Industries” initiative that was announced in 2006, but broadened it out from a focus on technical innovation to encompass the entire manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over this period, government departments introduced various plans to guide the development of the NEV industry, encouraging the creation of an ecosystem to support these industries. Government policies focused on innovation in EVs and batteries, as well as on encouraging both production and sales of EVs and infrastructure build-out. In 2021, policy guidance also looked to address the use of EV battery packs in other applications after their removal from EVs, including as part of China’s long-term plan to develop smart networks and to achieve vehicle-to-grid integration. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology’s 12th Five-Year Plan for the nonferrous metals sector noted that priority would be given to developing China’s overseas presence. Chinese banks have therefore supported Chinese miners in their efforts to acquire ownership interests in mines and processing facilities in Africa, Australia, Europe, North America and South America, and in signing offtake agreements with operating mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the domestic EV market grew, government policies facilitated and prioritised the development of an integrated battery and EV supply chain. To be sure, some developments, including e-bikes and a burgeoning solar heating industry, have emerged in China due to innovations by local companies that saw new demand emerging, even though they were not formally encouraged (some were even discouraged, as in the case of e-bikes). This is important to note, because not all of China’s initiatives are led and directed by the government, nor are they perfectly implemented. When discussing China, it is important to note that there is a difference between central government’s policy framing on the one hand, and corporate activities and behaviours on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the state-led industrial policy framework has been a key contributor to China’s dominance in these industries of the future. Some of the attributes seen in the EV sector also supported the development of China’s solar industry: manufacturers benefited from local government support such as land concessions, tax benefits, less expensive operating environments and, in some cases, even direct investment. The central government contributed by directing state financing to these projects and even helped to catalyse cost declines in input materials like polysilicon. However, when polysilicon prices plummeted (due to a fall in demand as trade restrictions were imposed on Chinese solar exports, combined with the existence of large stocks of polysilicon) local governments provided further support to shield these industries. That said, solar PV, unlike other industries, did not begin life as a domestic industry. Chinese firms first entered PV module manufacturing through technology acquisition, before gradually succeeding in building their competitiveness and technological capabilities throughout the supply chains, as they saw new opportunities for growth, as well as via local interactive learning networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a somewhat similar vein, the Chinese government has, since the early stage of wind energy development, focused on establishing a domestic wind industry supply chain, initially by financing investments in small wind farms, and through the development of wind projects as early as the 1980s. Foreign expertise was then brought in, but joint ventures were designed to include substantial local content requirements (later abolished). In addition to policies that stimulated renewable R&amp;amp;D and equipment manufacturing, the government also introduced pricing policies to support the integration of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial policies in support of manufacturing, innovation and deployment have had unintended consequences from the Chinese government’s perspective – among them subsidy fraud, illegal mining and negative environmental impacts – while incentive structures have evolved to deal with regulatory gaps, financial stress along the supply chains and other challenges. Notwithstanding the challenges, these policies have, over time, allowed China to become a critical and low-cost supplier of new energy materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to industrial and innovation policies, the Chinese government regulates the mining of critical materials and their processing. China’s 2016 National Plan for Mineral Resources classifies the country’s mineral resources as “strategic”, “advantageous”, “protected”, or “strategic emerging industry” minerals. China does not have a critical minerals list akin to those in place in the US or the EU. For the different categories of minerals, the plan identifies where China needs to encourage exploration of minerals in short supply, regulate the amount of minerals defined as “advantageous”, cut production of minerals with excess capacity, and ensure the supply of minerals in strategic emerging industries. The plan identifies three broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Energy minerals – oil, gas, shale gas, coal, coal-bed methane and uranium.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metallic minerals – iron, chromium, copper, aluminium, gold, nickel, tungsten, tin, molybdenum, antimony, cobalt, lithium, rare earths and zirconium.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-metallic minerals – phosphorus, potash, crystalline graphite and fluorite.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list includes metals and minerals that are not on developed economies’ lists of critical materials, but it also excludes a number of materials often cited by developed economies as “critical” (such as vanadium, tellurium, niobium and others that are used in hydrogen, solar PV or wind turbines). And while advanced manufacturing economies with a high dependency on imported raw materials include supply risk as a key parameter when categorising their lists of materials, Chinese assessments of “strategic minerals” use a broader, more flexible set of criteria, in which some “strategic minerals” are subject to supply risk and others are not. Indeed, according to China’s Geological Survey, the category of “advantageous minerals” includes rare earths and tungsten, and refers to minerals for which China has a domestic resource advantage relative to other countries, allowing it to control or influence global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-demand-for-low-carbon-energy-infrastructure-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;II. Demand for Low-Carbon Energy Infrastructure in the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2023 analysis, the UK’s National Grid estimated that the national electricity supply would treble by 2035, through both domestic generation and imports. This would involve a massive increase in different forms of infrastructure (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u78vM9M.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: National Grid (2023) Projections to 2035 for England and Wales.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: National Grid ESO, “Bridging the Gap to Net Zero”, March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrent global growth in demand will put great pressure on international supply chains. Mining companies in particular face a range of challenges, including high exploration and production costs, environmental and social concerns, access to capital and shortages of skilled labour. Currently, investments in both the mining of new minerals and processing capacity are falling short of estimated demand, notwithstanding the different demand outlooks and uncertainties around the impact of new technologies. The IEA, for instance, notes that “in a scenario consistent with climate goals, expected supply from existing mines and projects under construction is estimated to meet only half of projected lithium and cobalt requirements and 80% of copper needs by 2030”. Thus, if investment in new mine capacity is not accelerated, the pace of the energy transition will be constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises a number of issues for the UK. First, its ability to meet its net zero goals will depend on the availability of new energy supplies. Meanwhile, the UK’s industrial and economic competitiveness will be closely linked to energy costs. Some military systems also use critical materials, and, while the quantities of these are relatively small, they require high-purity, high-value materials. Finally, supply disruptions, however limited, could reduce the UK’s ability to use renewable technology to meet its climate goals, as well as constrain its freedom of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date the UK has relied on markets to satisfy its needs and, where effective and efficient markets exist, government policies suggest this will remain the case. The UK government recognised in its 2022 Critical Minerals Strategy that many critical mineral markets are “incomplete”, having inadequate data and transparency. The Critical Minerals Intelligence Centre was established at the British Geological Survey in July 2022, and the government has committed to convening a dialogue with industry, and to using multilateral engagement to promote market development. But establishing concrete policies to secure necessary supplies will be challenging without an industrial strategy to provide guidance on UK demand for critical minerals at the various stages of the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efforts of the UK and its allies to build out new energy supply chains are likely to involve a lengthy process – one from which China cannot be excluded, at least in the near term. While policy papers do not articulate what level of reliance on China is acceptable to the UK and its allies, the decoupling (now de-risking) narratives indicate that there will be an attempt to rapidly reduce dependence on China. In the US, for instance, the Inflation Reduction Act provides a range of tax credits, as the country seeks to encourage the sourcing of battery materials domestically, or from partner countries with which the US has free trade agreements. From 2025 onwards, EV batteries will only be eligible for US purchase subsidies if they do not contain any critical minerals that were extracted, processed or recycled by a “foreign entity of concern” – including China. Similarly, the European Commission’s proposal for a new Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) aims to achieve a high degree of self-sufficiency by 2030. According to the CRMA, EU capacity should reach at least 10% of domestic demand for mining and extraction and at least 40% for processing and refining, in a bid to address overreliance on China’s supply chains. The European Raw Materials Alliance, announced in September 2020 as part of the European Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials, focuses on developing sustainable and responsible supply chains for critical raw materials and fostering partnerships with resource-rich countries other than China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the paper goes on to discuss the implications of this for UK security, the next chapter offers a brief overview of key net zero supply chains and their complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-chinas-dominance-of-new-energy-supply-chains&quot;&gt;III. China’s Dominance of New Energy Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supply-chain-components&quot;&gt;Supply Chain Components&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply chains for low-carbon energy technologies have several stages and involve many different countries. A supply chain may comprise as many as six steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extraction and beneficiation of mineral ores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Processing and refining of the ores to produce metals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further processing to produce the required alloys or chemical compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manufacture of individual components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manufacture of intermediate products from these components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assembly of final product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, each step can be carried out in a different country. But China, as discussed below, has built a strong position that spans steps one to five in several important supply chains. The basis of this strength lies in China’s dominance of the extraction and, to an even greater extent, processing of certain critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Critical Minerals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticality of a specific mineral is generally assessed on the basis of the risk of interruption to supply and on the economic or security importance to the importing nation or region of such a disruption. One factor that contributes to the assessment of supply risk is the market concentration of the production of a mineral ore or refined metal. Most assessments do not consider the geographic concentration of primary mineral ore resources, as these are – in most cases – abundant and geographically widespread. However, the known high-quality accumulations tend to be geographically concentrated, though future exploration may yield some new high-grade deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal focus of such criticality assessments is the mineral inputs required to produce advanced technologies, notably in the low-carbon and defence industries. Assessments carried out by different organisations result in different lists of critical minerals. This is due to a combination of differing geographic scope and economic/security concerns, as well as different methodologies. This study draws on four such assessments, conducted respectively by: the US Department of the Interior; the IEA; the British Geological Survey; and the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minerals identified as critical by one or more of these assessments, and which are inputs to low-carbon energy technologies, are listed in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EPBI78A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Critical Minerals Relevant to Low-Carbon Energy Technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; Sources: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-02-24/pdf/2022-04027.pdf&quot;&gt;US Department of the Interior, “2022 Final List of Critical Minerals”, Federal Register (Vol. 87, No. 37, 24 February 2022)&lt;/a&gt;, p. 10,381; IEA, “The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions”, May 2021; Paul Lusty et al., UK Criticality Assessment of Technology Critical Minerals and Metals, British Geological Survey, CR/21/120 (Keyworth: British Geological Survey, 2021); Silvia Bobba et al., Critical Raw Materials for Strategic Technologies and Sectors in the EU: A Foresight Study (Brussels: European Commission, 2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing demand for clean energy technologies will sharply accelerate the demand for some of these critical minerals. Table 3 summarises the IEA’s estimates for this growth to 2040.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BfZxfiw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

STEPS and SDS refer respectively to the IEA’s “Stated Policies” and “Sustainable Development” scenarios. 2. * refers to neodymium only. Source: IEA, “The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that China holds a significant or strong global position in the extraction and/or processing of a large number of the minerals listed in Table 2. In most cases, China’s global share of processing is significantly larger than that of ore extraction, as China imports large quantities of ore for domestic processing. The strength of China’s position is enhanced by its growing involvement in mining and mineral processing overseas (Table 4). The scale of overseas investment in this sector accelerated in the first half of 2023, with a focus on nickel, lithium and copper. The countries that host Chinese mining companies will play a growing role in the global energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has no significant mining production of the critical minerals identified by the British Geological Survey, but prospective areas for mineral extraction do exist in the UK, notably for lithium in Cornwall. Whether extraction of any of these deposits can be brought to a significant scale by 2035 is an open question, not least due to social and environmental concerns. Likewise, the UK’s processing capacity for these minerals is very limited. Nevertheless, the UK is home to a number of international mining companies that could, in principle, supply some of the required minerals. Recycling is often seen as having more potential in the UK, but in a rapidly growing market, recycled materials originating in the UK will lag behind demand significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a more detailed look at some of the other key supply chain components that will need to be addressed in any shift away from Chinese dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batteries and EVs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries are the most commonly used form of energy storage for electric and hybrid motor vehicles and are also used for household and grid electricity storage. Their key components are anodes, cathodes and electrolytes. Lithium is the most important metal in this context, as it provides the electrolyte as well as most forms of cathode. The chemistry of the cathode and anode varies, and this results in six main types of lithium-ion battery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NMC: Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NCA: Lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LCO: Lithium cobalt oxide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LFP: Lithium iron phosphate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LMO: Lithium manganese oxide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LTO: Lithium titanate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition of the cathode is the main differentiator between these battery types. The anode is commonly composed of graphite, either natural or synthetic (manufactured from hydrocarbons). The main exception is the LTO battery, which uses lithium titanate for the anode. Tin and niobium are likely to be used in the future to increase the energy density of the anode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 5 illustrates in simplified form the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries, from raw material (in the form of ore) through to final battery assembly. This shows that China’s strong position in mineral ore extraction only applies to natural graphite and silicon. In contrast, China has built a strong – and even dominant – position in mineral processing and in the refining of domestic and imported ores, the manufacture of anodes, cathodes and electrolytes, and in the manufacture of the lithium-ion cells that go into the final battery pack. The import of beneficiated ores from overseas through bilateral offtake agreements has been key to this success (see Table 4). Chinese mining companies have enhanced this advantage through their overseas investments, notably in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for cobalt, in Latin America for lithium and in Indonesia for nickel, in some cases supporting not only mining but in-country refining and processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing technological advances are likely to achieve two things. The first involves cost and efficiency improvements for existing lithium-ion chemistries, which could reduce the unit requirement for critical minerals. The second is the development of entirely new designs that could radically reduce or even obviate the need for critical minerals: these potential designs include solid state batteries, redox flow batteries, sodium-ion and iron-air chemistries, and supercapacitors. Japanese firms have been leading these innovations, but companies from South Korea, the US, China and Europe are also contributing. These advances are not currently being pursued at scale by the UK, but should they be developed and deployed rapidly it remains to be seen whether they could materially change the UK’s demand outlook by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, only 6% of the UK’s EVs were produced domestically, and even now direct exposure to the Chinese supply chain – which is most dominant in refining, components and intermediate products (see Table 5) – is limited. Some 47% of the UK’s battery EVs were imported from the EU in 2022, up from 44% in 2019, followed by China at 32%, up from 2% in 2019. Sales of Chinese EVs in the UK and EU are growing. Moreover, Chinese companies already manufacture batteries in Europe (which are consequently not subject to tariffs), and this capacity could rise to 322 gigawatt hours per year (GWh/yr) by 2031. Chinese car manufacturers will also look to start production in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of August 2023, the UK hosts two operating lithium-ion battery plants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Envision–AESC’s LMO plant in Sunderland, with a capacity of 1.9 GWh/yr and plans to expand to 11 GWh/yr by 2024 and 35 GWh/yr by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AMTE’s lithium-ion battery plant in Thurso, with a capacity of 0.5 GWh/yr.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 18 July 2023, it was announced that Tata had committed to building a 40 GWh/yr plant in Somerset. Other potential gigafactories in Coventry and Dundee have yet to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Faraday Institution, the UK’s manufacturing capacity could, based on current plans, reach a combined 57 GWh/yr by 2030. That falls short of the UK’s estimated requirement of 100 GWh/yr of battery supplies (or gigafactories) to meet demand for batteries for private cars, commercial vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, buses, micromobility and grid storage by 2030, the date at which the UK had intended to end the sale of fully internal combustion engine vehicles and vans, which was delayed to 2035 in September 2023. By 2040, that demand could rise to nearly 200 GWh/yr. According to data from UK Trade Info, the UK currently relies on China for 42% of its lithium-ion battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the UK can become an attractive destination for battery makers in the future given the limited nature of UK incentives (at least compared to support schemes rolled out in the EU and the US) and due to uncertainty about future trading rules with the EU. Lithium mining locally could help attract battery makers, but lithium mining tends to take years to scale up. Even if the UK did increase its battery manufacturing capabilities, it would need to attract both auto assemblers and battery makers – which would likely be Japanese, South Korean or Chinese – or to support local companies in the face of strong international competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the UK will not be able to meet all its battery and EV requirements domestically, it will continue to import both batteries and EVs from Europe and China, with Chinese EVs and batteries looking likely to be more cost competitive than their European counterparts. With more gigafactories opening up in Europe, the UK will be able to diversify its battery and EV imports, but will remain dependent on a limited number of producers who, in turn, will remain reliant on Chinese components and minerals (see Table 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind Power Plants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large, modern wind turbines place significant demands on material supply to maximise their energy output and strength. The respective key components are permanent magnets for the generators and steel for the tower, nacelle and other parts of the turbine. Permanent magnets are also essential components of the traction motors in EVs. The most commonly used form of permanent magnet in wind turbines is the NdFeB magnet (neodymium iron boron), whose production requires neodymium, along with other rare earth metals such as dysprosium and praseodymium. China extracts around 70% of the world’s rare earth metal ores (see Table 6). Moreover, China is responsible for around 90% of the global output of rare earth metals through its longstanding dominance of rare earth ore processing and refining. China has taken advantage of this strength to build manufacturing capacity that now provides nearly 90% of the world’s supply of NdFeB magnets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the other critical minerals shown in Table 6 are additives to steel (manganese, chromium, molybdenum, nickel, niobium) or inputs to other turbine components. As is the case in battery materials, China has a strong mineral processing industry that allows it to import ores to produce refined metals. This has given the country a dominant position in the supply of refined manganese and relatively strong positions in aluminium, copper and molybdenum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These foundations in the production of permanent magnets and in metallurgical industries have given China the basis for achieving a large share of global production of key components such as generators, gearboxes, blades and nacelles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the UK had over 14 GW of offshore wind. Half of the UK’s renewable energy comes from wind, and by 2030, offshore wind will supply a third of the country’s electricity. In its 2022 Energy Security Strategy, the government scaled up its plans for wind to reach 50 GW by 2030, compared to a 40 GW target previously, including up to 5 GW of innovative floating wind. RenewableUK, the country’s renewable trade body, estimates that the pipeline of projects either under construction or highly likely to start construction is on track to exceed this 50 GW target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK hosts plants that manufacture wind turbine blades and towers, but it imports most of the other components. While some of these components can be manufactured in Europe, most of the generators will rely on permanent magnets from China, and even manufacturers of permanent magnets outside China may still be reliant on rare earth metals supplied by China. To address this supply risk, manufacturers are finding ways to reduce or change the mix of rare earth metals in NdFeB magnets, and research is underway to develop entirely new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the likelihood that these developments will substantially reduce the need for rare earth metals or dramatically change China’s centrality in the near term – even as its share of these components falls – is low. This is because of the scale and cost competitiveness of the Chinese industry compared to competitors, and the concentration of the refining of most other rare earths and metals in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CMKGas0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar PV Modules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of PV cells are manufactured from silicon, generally in polycrystalline form. Polycrystalline silicon cells also require germanium and borates. China’s key strength lies in the production of polycrystalline silicon (see Table 7). The country’s domestic manufacturing capacity has grown in recent years, allowing China’s share of global output of polycrystalline silicon to reach 89% in 2022 and the quantity of imports to decline. On this basis, China has achieved almost total dominance (around 95%) in the supply of silicon wafers and a very strong position (around 85%) in the supply for silicon cells. It also makes more than 70% of the world’s solar PV modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also a dominant supplier of germanium, a by-product of zinc ore processing, and has a strong position in the production of metals such as copper, aluminium, lead and tin that are necessary components of solar PV panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other technologies in this sphere include cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) cells. Table 7 shows that China has a moderately strong position in the production of tellurium, indium, cadmium and molybdenum, as well as a dominant position in gallium. All of these metals are produced as by-products of other processes, and their availability depends in part on the production of ores containing other minerals and on the processing of these ores to recover the by-products. Future technological options for solar PV include gallium arsenide and amorphous silicon cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK lacks manufacturing at scale of polycrystalline silicon, silicon wafers and cells, and cells based on other technologies. Facilities for such production are thin on the ground: Power Roll has opened a plant in Durham to manufacture flexible solar film using perovskite technology, and while Oxford PV has developed perovskite-on-silicon cell technology, its factory is in Germany and the company has stated that it is reluctant to build the next factory in the UK due to the lack of incentives. A number of companies in the UK manufacture solar PV modules from imported cells, such as UKSOL, UK Solar Power, Sharp and GB Sol, but imports of modules from China remain significant. For example, up to 40% of UK solar farms were built with Chinese modules in 2021. The supply chains for these modules allegedly involve forced labour in Xinjiang, where the production of polysilicon is concentrated, meaning that companies sourcing panels already face an ethical, reputational and compliance challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WWknnnH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electricity Grids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal metals required for transmission lines and transformers are copper, aluminium, zinc and cadmium, along with iron. None of these metals were considered critical for the UK by the British Geological Survey, although China accounts for between 40% and 60% of some of these metals, and aluminium is considered critical by the EU and the US. The supply of critical minerals such as gallium and germanium for microchips – or the supply of microchips themselves – could increase in significance if China becomes a dominant global supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than raw materials, the main China-related vulnerability for UK electricity grids may be cyber security (not considered in detail in this paper). The IEA estimates that by 2025 there will be 30–40 billion devices linked to electricity grids across the world, and that any of these could be used to attack the grid. This is a major security challenge, and will require governments and companies to act in concert to ensure the resilience of power systems – a process that cannot be discussed in detail here. Instead, the broader responses from government and industry to China’s dominance in the sphere of raw materials are considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-and-corporate-responses&quot;&gt;Government and Corporate Responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of deteriorating relations with China and rising demand for the minerals that are critical to the low-carbon transition has led governments and companies from industrialised countries to take steps to reduce their reliance on China for these minerals. Government actions include imposing import restrictions, incentivising domestic investment and production, stockpiling, and building partnerships with other countries. An additional priority is R&amp;amp;D to develop alternatives to the currently used minerals so as to enhance the efficiency of their use and expand recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government has been among the most active in seeking to decouple from China in this regard, including through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which supports investment and guides procurement along the full length of the supply chain. Resource-rich Australia and Canada are also supporting investment in mining and processing, while in 2023 the EU published its draft Critical Raw Materials Act, which includes 2030 targets for mineral extraction, processing and recycling, as well as limiting over-dependence on a single third country. At the same time, the EU published a draft of the Net-Zero Industry Act, which aims to scale up the manufacturing of new energy technologies in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realising that international cooperation was needed, the US led the establishment of the Minerals Security Partnership in June 2022 to “bolster critical mineral supply chains essential for the clean energy transition”. The first meeting in September 2022 was attended by official partners Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Sweden, the UK, the US and the EU. Mineral-rich countries such as Argentina, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia also attended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the construction of new mines and processing plants outside China, two trends in particular may help reduce dependence on China. The first is reducing or obviating the need for critical minerals in key technologies. Such measures would include the development of sodium-ion batteries for EVs and permanent magnets free of REEs, as well as increasing the efficiency of use and recycling of the materials. However, the time needed to scale up these innovations is uncertain, and China itself may still play a leading role in these technologies. The second trend involves the increasing level of support being given to promote the domestic production of renewable energy equipment and EVs in the US and Europe, which will bolster the growing capacity to process and refine metal ores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these moves mark a potential turning point in international policies to address Chinese dominance in the mining and processing of critical minerals. However, the impact of these measures is likely to be modest over the period to 2035, given the time needed to commission new mines and processing plants and to scale up the use of new technological solutions, not least due to environmental and social concerns, as well as the energy and water requirements of these processes. In light of this, it is important to consider how China could leverage its dominance in these critical supply chains, and what the implications of such leverage could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-what-threat-does-chinas-dominance-pose-to-the-uk&quot;&gt;IV. What Threat Does China’s Dominance Pose to the UK?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter sets out a preliminary analysis of the risks posed to the UK by China’s domination of new energy supply chains. It assesses the extent to which the UK is at risk of being singled out as a target, whether it is more vulnerable to being targeted as part of a broader regional- or alliance-level bloc, and the extent to which it is vulnerable to disruptions to the global market. It ends with a discussion of other risks relating to international relations and defence that the UK should consider in parallel with the China-related risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global energy supply chains are important tools for soft power and greyzone contestation. China’s role in new energy supply chains is already an important factor in great power politics – and the importance of this influence will only increase. The US’s Inflation Reduction Act denies subsidies to EV producers that are dependent on Chinese materials on grounds of security, and not for diversification or industrial reasons, as discussed earlier. Furthermore, supply-chain organisation, both in terms of the location of different activities and in terms of market relationships, may be a significant source of tension and instability. Dependence on digital technologies for the operation of some new energy technologies also raises questions about their use in defence and by the diplomatic and security services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks posed by China’s role in the supply chain must be understood alongside other international developments in the energy industry, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and industrial strategy in the US and the EU. This chapter will offer some initial analysis before recommending useful avenues for further research, and preliminary observations on how the UK might consider its security posture with regard to China and net zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset, it should be noted that the character of the risk from net zero supply chains is fundamentally different from that of fossil fuel supply chains. Disruption to fossil fuel supply chains has immediate and widespread consequences which can be catastrophic for society, the economy and defence. Net zero systems are not primarily based on fuel supply, but most commonly on electricity infrastructure. This makes them by default more resilient to supply chain disruption. Delays and temporary price escalation in new energy supply chains would not have an immediate appreciable impact on energy production or consumption in the UK. That said, prolonged disruption would negatively impact the UK’s ability to meet its net zero targets and its climate action, and could impact energy security in a situation where electricity demand was increasing rapidly and equipment for generation or grid storage could not be sourced. Put simply, the short-term risk to physical energy supply in the UK from China is much less than from fossil fuel markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;could-the-uk-be-individually-targeted&quot;&gt;Could the UK be Individually Targeted?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, China has demonstrated a willingness to leverage the export of critical materials and technologies to achieve domestic and international political objectives, and as a response to sanctions. In 2010, as part of the government’s efforts to clamp down on illegal mining and trade of REEs within China, and coinciding with a fishing dispute with Japan, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce increased the tax imposed on exports of rare earth ores, oxides and compounds, introduced an export tax on end products, and tightened production quotas. These strategies resulted in a reduction of the share of production being exported, from 90% in 2000 to 20% by 2012. While exports to Japan fell, flows to other countries – including Australia and the UK – also declined. The imposition of these export restrictions in 2010 has become the poster child for concerns about China weaponising its dominance in critical materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, China announced export controls on gallium and germanium in response to US, Japanese and Dutch export controls on semiconductor chips. China is the world’s top supplier of these two metals, which are used to make semiconductors, solar panels and fibre optics. In July 2023, citing national security concerns, China’s Ministry of Commerce announced that all exporters of these products must apply for export licences for dual-use items and technologies starting on 1 August 2023. Obtaining the licences can take up to two months, and it is unclear how many will ultimately be issued. The sharp limitation of such export licences by Beijing would give additional impetus to diversification efforts in importing countries, but could also give rise to a wave of illegal production and exports from China, as was the case with rare earths in the past. The timing of the announcement suggests that the ban is a political signal more than an attempt at economic coercion, but the line between the two is dangerously blurred. The announcement of the export restrictions led to higher prices and a rush to stockpile but also, as was the case in 2010, to a diversification of supplies and processing away from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although sanctions and export bans could weaken China’s position in the long term, by accelerating this diversification, China has nonetheless used these tools in response to actions that it perceives as aggressive. China is therefore only likely to manipulate new energy supply chains against the UK in the face of perceived aggression from the UK against Beijing. Indeed, there is currently no indication that China is more likely to use new energy supply chains than any other supply chain in this way, when it can leverage instead either high levels of concentration or high levels of foreign-owned manufacturing in China. In the case of gallium and germanium, restrictions were carefully calibrated in response to restrictions on the sale of defence-related semiconductor chips to China, where gallium and germanium are important inputs. Consequently, other materials with dual military and energy-technology uses appear most likely to be caught in the crossfire of any future trade restrictions. China could constrain parts of net zero supply chains in response to UK policies perceived as hostile to China, but at this juncture, net zero supplies appear unlikely to be the subject of export controls other than in reciprocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exposure of the UK to export controls varies considerably depending on the commodity or product, and is determined more by UK demand than by Chinese dominance. Only limited data is publicly available for detailed trade between the UK and China: the UK does not publish any figures, and data from China is limited. What data is available shows that in areas that are more critical for net zero the UK is not necessarily heavily dependent on direct supply from China: for example, China’s exports of copper to the UK were worth only $145 million in 2022 and nickel exports only $11 million. Aluminium trade was much more extensive, being worth $2 billion. Net zero technologies make up only a small proportion of UK demand for aluminium, but the metal has wider importance for net zero as a lightweight alternative to steel used to improve efficiency, particular for automotives and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imposition of export controls by China would ultimately limit Beijing’s dominance over time and affect its reputation as a reliable supplier, just as infrastructure bottlenecks have already expedited trading partners’ efforts to diversify supply chains (as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic). Additional restrictions would only accelerate these trends. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has already prompted a rethink by governments and international companies that are dependent on China, with many taking action to diversify. This shift emanates from rising tensions between the US and China and from concerns about decoupling, as well as worries about a military conflict between China and the US (and any potential sanctions that could ensue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers are already looking to diversify production to other low-cost countries – a move also incentivised by rising wage and other input costs in China – at the same time as flagship programmes such as the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Net-Zero Industry Act provide new incentives. This reinforces the well-established principle that countries that lose their reputation as reliable suppliers can incur serious economic penalties in the long run. For now, China is unlikely to engage in direct sanctions against the UK, but should it seek to retaliate against UK policies (or in the event of a broader conflict with the UK or the West), China’s control over net zero supply chains offers it considerable leverage over all consumers, including the UK. The short-term impact would be more limited than disruption to the supply of fossil fuels, but would still put pressure on the UK economy and its ability to meet its net zero targets. Using economic coercion would also impact Chinese companies, and the Chinese economy would incur large costs too, especially given the growing importance of new energy exports compared with other exporting sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the UK perspective, efforts to diversify production and supplies should at least partially mitigate China’s ability to individually target the UK in many areas over the medium term. Moreover, UK demand for materials is small by global standards, and will remain so. This means that the development of relatively limited international supply chains, independent of China, would likely be sufficient to rebalance the global market should export controls specifically target the UK. Such a scenario would see production that is not under China’s control redirected to the UK, with China-influenced supply chains redirected to fill the gap, albeit at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the UK’s limited manufacturing capacity shields it from the impact of any potential cut-off by China: taking wind energy as an example, China’s dominance in permanent magnets is unlikely to be an effective sanction, as the UK does not directly import magnets but instead imports generators using those magnets from multinational companies in third countries. However, the threat should not be underestimated, particularly as the UK aspires to increase its manufacture of net zero equipment. The further the UK moves up the supply chain, the closer it moves to direct dependence on Chinese suppliers. But as domestic industrialisation will take time, new supply chains are likely to develop in tandem, particularly given strong government support for alternative supply chains within the EU and the US. Indeed, the UK will require more localisation of supply chains in order for its automotive production to qualify for tariff-free trade with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s ability to coerce the UK is therefore limited, any supply shortages (due to retaliatory measures, blockades or export controls imposed by China for a variety of reasons) will likely impact three main categories of new energy industries – the automotive sector, electricity generators, and UK companies with manufacturing operations in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the automotive sector, the UK government is likely to aim to maintain existing production capacity by converting it to EVs. China’s dominance in battery minerals as well as anodes, cathodes, electrolytes and lithium-ion packs, coupled with the apparent requirement for battery production for automotive manufacturers to be located in the UK, suggests that UK automotive companies will be directly dependent on Chinese suppliers. This would increase the overall vulnerability to restrictions targeting the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, China is actively investing in manufacturing capacity in Europe. In situations such as mineral shortages, this could make the European manufacturing base more resilient, as Chinese companies might maintain supply to their own operations, potentially at the expense of other customers. However, during a major confrontation, Chinese-owned automotive capacity – assuming it would cease to operate – could prove a liability, because of the potential impact of interrupting production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second group of entities that might be vulnerable to export controls targeting the UK consists of large-scale electricity generation project developers, where original equipment manufacturer (OEM) warranties are typically required to finance the purchase of key equipment, and where operations and maintenance may be dependent on the OEM for supply of spare parts and technical support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With many power plants relying on spare parts from China in the event of a breakdown, there may be some risk to their ongoing operation should access to spare parts and OEM expertise be restricted for an extended period of time. A more detailed assessment of exposure and scale may be beneficial in this case to determine whether risk is limited to power plant owners and operators, or whether it might threaten the security of electricity supply – but this assessment is not attempted here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third group vulnerable to sanction is made up of UK companies that have manufacturing operations in China. China’s unique industrial ecosystem means that many UK technology companies manufacture equipment in the country, covering everything from smart meters to EVs and EV chargers. These companies are perhaps the most susceptible to intervention by the Chinese government, since small companies (such as these typically are) can be targeted by domestic legislation which, without risking significant international escalation, still sends a strong political message to Western governments, while big companies are able to pressure home governments to compromise in order to protect their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond these three vulnerable groups, it is likely that Brexit has reduced the potential cost to China of taking action specifically against the UK (as opposed to against Europe more broadly), and this might increase the likelihood of symbolic action being taken against the UK alone in order to send a message to the wider European community. Targeting an individual member of the EU with export control measures would mean targeting the entire bloc, with potentially significant repercussions for China. The UK, by contrast, might be individually targeted, causing relatively little short-term economic damage to Chinese companies while still making a strong political statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the threat of export controls targeting the UK alone appears to be limited. This is because direct UK consumption of China-dominated materials is very limited, due to the lack of manufacturing of net zero technologies in the UK and because alternative sources of supply will emerge over the medium term sufficient to meet UK demand. However, because of the likely scale of future UK demand, particularly as battery production for EVs grows ahead of 2030, more government planning may be advisable to ensure that alternative supply chains are being developed, in the UK and globally, at sufficient scale to keep up with demand. Moreover, protectionist penalties incorporated into industrial legislation in the US and the EU may make supply chains less fungible, and could limit the extent to which the UK can benefit from new supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regional-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Regional Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis above suggests that, if the UK alone were to be targeted by Chinese export controls, the impact under current conditions might be limited by low demand for intermediate products and diverse markets for final goods; and that such action taken in the future would also be limited in impact due to the emergence, over time, of alternative supply chains. This should insulate UK foreign policy somewhat from possible Chinese coercion using new energy supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any confrontation with China over an issue such as the sovereignty of Taiwan would mean the UK facing China as part of a bloc, which could result in retaliatory measures from Beijing that targeted groups of countries. As a member of NATO, Five Eyes, and a group of likeminded nations opposed to Beijing’s aggressive expansionism in China’s immediate neighbourhood, the UK is exposed to geopolitical escalation involving sanctions and counter-sanctions against its allies. The 2022 energy crisis showed the extent to which regional disruption magnifies risks in concentrated markets, since global markets areunable to readjust to meet demand without generating very high prices. It also highlighted the interconnected nature of markets: even though the UK does not import gas directly from Russia, it was not insulated from higher gas prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the automotive sector might be the most immediately affected in the event of multinational action against China, as lack of access to Chinese supply chains would have an immediate impact on the UK economy. If the UK were targeted individually, it is likely that alternative supply chains would be available, whereas these alternatives are unlikely to be sufficient to sustain industries in the UK and the EU or the US concurrently in the event of multinational action. This kind of impact is currently hypothetical, as the UK does not yet produce a significant volume of EVs, but as the production of internal combustion engines is scaled back across the Western world, the potential for disruption grows significantly. That said, the ability to extend the life of the existing vehicle stock and the likely continued use of fossil fuel-powered heavy goods vehicles beyond 2030 means that any impact on the wider economy would likely be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls affecting whole regions would undoubtedly put UK climate targets in jeopardy. As the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated, sudden price inflation or delayed availability of key components for renewable power projects could result in delays and project cancellations. If supply-chain concentrations are not addressed, they could become an energy security challenge over time: the energy transition is set to result in a rapid increase in electricity demand from decarbonised sectors such as heating and vehicle transportation. This demand is not likely to be met by additional fossil fuel capacity, leaving the UK reliant on a steady supply of renewable electricity generation equipment to meet demand. For grid stability and to meet peak demand, the expansion of variable renewable capacity will also require substantial additions of flexible battery capacity. Furthermore, as fossil fuel plants are retired, non-renewable back-up options may become less available to increase output during periods of tight supply, while relying on fossil fuel plants for more of the time will leave less in reserve for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Grid ESO estimates that the UK will need anywhere between 13 GW/44 GWh and 31 GW/118 GWh storage capacity by 2030, up from 3 GW/29 GWh in 2022. Energy security is linked to the UK’s ability to extend the electricity network and to deploy smart technologies whose supply chains currently depend on China. If the ramping up of mutually dependent net zero elements of the grid does not proceed in step with the retirement of fossil fuel infrastructure, energy security issues could emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the timing of any export controls would be critical. The UK will be most vulnerable while dependencies on China remain high and as investment in fossil fuel infrastructure becomes minimal and some assets are permanently retired. The duration of any disruption would also be important, with a short period of export controls unlikely to have a significant impact on citizens, as existing technologies would continue to operate and new projects would only be delayed by temporary price spikes and shortages. An extended period of export controls lasting years – not at all inconceivable in the history of modern sanctions – would pose a more severe energy security challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions about the UK’s vulnerabilities have led to some debate about whether net zero targets jeopardise UK security. But the reality is that trying to slow the energy transition risks worsening energy security challenges.69 Reliance on fossil fuels, coupled with price volatility, creates risks and vulnerabilities, whereas renewable electricity offers secure and affordable supplies – assuming prices continue to fall. A slower transition extends the period during which parallel infrastructures must be maintained, at increasingly high costs, and during which assets intended for retirement see reduced investment and decreasing performance, increasing the risk of unplanned outages and failures. Furthermore, many aspects of the energy transition – such as EV adoption – have a momentum of their own. Creating uncertainty about whether infrastructure will be available on time to meet demand by attempting to slow the adoption of net zero technologies may simply result in inadequate infrastructure due to insufficient investment. Ultimately investors will take their own view on likely demand, and if additional redundancy is desired it will need additional financial incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-exposure&quot;&gt;Global Exposure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant sources of vulnerability the UK faces in terms of China-dominated new energy supply chains are undoubtedly those that have an impact on the global market. These include non-political events such as natural disasters and pandemics, common to all concentrated markets, as well as market risks that are already highly likely, such as shortages of key minerals. In its base case analysis, based on current policies, McKinsey estimates that by 2030, some eight out of 14 minerals essential for net zero technologies will have shortages of more than 10% of demand, with two facing shortages of more than 50%. In a scenario where commitments are achieved, all but two minerals face shortages of more than 10%. Primary production is already largely committed over this period, meaning that forecasts are relatively certain to be realised if demand increases at the expected rate. Recycling might be expedited to reduce shortages, with primary production increases possible over the longer term, but recycling policy and implementation of critical minerals strategy in the UK remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z7JZnFt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 8: UK New Energy Technology Demand and Forecast Supply Adequacy for Related Critical Minerals with High Levels of Chinese Control.&lt;/strong&gt; Projected 2030 mineral supply and demand imbalance figures are based on the current trajectory base case laid out in Patricia Bingoto et al., “The Net-Zero Materials Transition”. Sources for other information in the table: Faraday Institution, “UK Electric Vehicle and Battery Production Potential to 2040”; &lt;a href=&quot;https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgrideso.com%2Fdocument%2F283061%2Fdownload&amp;amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK&quot;&gt;National Grid ESO, “Future Energy Scenarios 2023 Data Workbook”, July 2023&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1096248/electricity-networks-strategic-framework-appendix-1-electricity-networks-modelling.pdf&quot;&gt;Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, “Appendix I: Electricity Networks Modelling”, August 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortages could create allocation problems for China of the kind that are common to all major producers during tight markets. If shortages cause production to fall significantly below global demand, China will have to decide which markets to serve first, and it is probable that the domestic market will be prioritised. This behaviour is common for most producers – for example, oil exports were banned in the US between 1975 and 2015, and some Australian states have legislation allowing export bans under some circumstances. Disruption in battery supply chains during the Covid-19 pandemic tended to result in contracts with the largest volumes and biggest customers being honoured. This would favour larger EV manufacturers, which are then likely to prioritise between their assets across countries according to commercial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With shortages looming, investments in mining by Chinese companies should generally be welcomed and not seen as a threat. Indeed, growing Chinese investment in mining and its increasing share of the market reflects the lack of activity among other actors. While China is working to secure upstream mineral supplies, the UK and other countries around the world are failing to move at sufficient pace to encourage additional sources of supply and incentivise processing capacity outside China. The more important question over the longer term is whether Chinese investments will support the development of a liquid and fungible market. Evidence from sectors such as LNG, which were initially entirely bilaterally contracted, suggests that more actively traded markets are likely to emerge as the number of producing countries proliferates, but this can take a long time. This may not be relevant for some of the speciality minerals that are required in very small quantities, and where stockpiling may be a better solution, but the availability of traded markets in larger commodities can mitigate the impact of supply outages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of China’s dominance of supply chains and the likely persistence of this position for at least the next decade means that UK-based companies will be exposed to sharp tactics and aggressive competition. Aggressive price competition is a periodic feature of commodity markets, and marginal producers tend to be casualties of this dynamic. For example, aggressive competition between Saudi Arabia and Russia for oil market share in 2020 put sufficient pressure on US shale oil producers for then-president Donald Trump to call for OPEC to reduce production and increase prices. In another example, a flood of Chinese steel onto global markets in the mid-2010s as Chinese domestic demand slowed and spare capacity became available resulted in bankruptcies and protectionism across the rest of the world. China has the capacity in many areas of the supply chain to pressurise competitors, but over the next decade this is likely to be mitigated for mining upstream and midstream by shortages, which make sharp commercial tactics much less effective (as all additional capacity will be utilised). As discussed earlier, the situation for manufacturers dependent on scarce Chinese supplies will be different, and state support for underutilised gigafactories is expected by some in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defence&quot;&gt;Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing demand for critical minerals is prompting questions from defence analysts within and outside government. Three questions appear particularly pressing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How secure are defence and security supply chains, and how secure will they continue to be?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How secure is the use of net zero technologies by the military and security services?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How will changing demand patterns for minerals affect where the military is called upon to deploy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper suggests that the risks stemming from China’s role in supply chains affecting access to new energy technologies for military purposes are likely to be similar to those affecting civilian applications: over the next decade, military net zero technologies are likely to use similar materials and components to civilian technologies. Land mobility may be one of the main drivers of demand, which, while deployed in different formats, will likely use the same underlying battery materials and technologies as civilian EVs. The same is true of renewable or hybrid mini-grids deployed at military bases. Targeting military usage specifically would therefore be very difficult to do without targeting the entire civilian supply chain. That said, large-scale military procurements might be vulnerable to delays should aggressive corporate tactics be adopted, which could have implications for military capability by extending the use of outdated equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure operation of net zero technologies is the critical area for military and security services. China already bars EVs from sensitive sites over fears that data could be misappropriated. There are similar fears in Western security services and militaries about how easily the movement of EVs used in covert operations might be tracked. While Chinese-made vehicles may pose a particular risk, this is a concern for all EVs, which tend to transfer large amounts of data on vehicle movement and usage. But the issue is not limited to EVs, with all vehicles being increasingly dependent on software and sending usage data to manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how demand for critical minerals might affect the location of conflicts around the world is an important one, although largely beyond the scope of this paper. China does play a significant role as the primary offtaker of mining for net zero resources internationally. The way that China chooses to behave with respect to the interests of other countries seeking access to mines creates risks, such as ensuring access to logistics and infrastructure, allocation of promising concessions, and contest for political influence should tensions between China and other major mineral consumers escalate. Similarly, opaque contractual structures create uncertainty about the degree of liability of sometimes fragile governments. Externalities from poor mining practices can be a significant source of instability and are by no means limited to Chinese interests, but they highlight the need for more engagement by international and multilateral institutions with miners on best practice and market reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A longer-term question that may not be receiving sufficient attention is what the impact might be should China leverage its industrial and, increasingly, technological advantage in net zero technologies for military purposes. Net zero technologies are still at an early stage in their innovation trajectories, and are receiving much more R&amp;amp;D investment globally than conventional technologies. In many areas, they may ultimately outperform fossil fuel technologies, in terms of both cost and capability, particularly in logistics. It is not yet clear what scope there is for major technological breakthroughs in China to impact relative military advantage, particularly with respect to China’s neighbours. Such innovations might ultimately affect many areas – from the relative efficiency of Chinese industrial defence production and cheaper logistics with superior capability, potentially through to battlefield advantages from developments in areas such as sheet metals and electric drones – and will have their origins in a superior industrial–technological ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that China’s influence in new energy supply chains will expand its already significant global footprint. Similarly, China’s higher risk tolerance compared to many Western actors, combined with companies’ willingness to operate with razor-thin margins, will further enhance Beijing’s control over new energy mineral resources. As seen in other areas, China’s economic and commercial presence in a wide range of producer countries also aids Beijing’s efforts to garner backing in multilateral bodies and global institutions in support of China’s position on a given issue. To be sure, Chinese companies operating abroad have a mixed track record in terms of their ESG practices, and have suffered pushback from host countries. China’s growing global footprint and fear of decoupling with the West is already leading it to rally developing countries to reduce the West’s influence. On a bilateral basis too, China’s involvement in producer countries could have implications for broader UK foreign policy goals. The extent of this influence will, however, depend on the degree of support China is offering, how it is perceived in host countries, and how alternative influences are perceived. The UK should review its foreign policy approaches in this context too. China’s foreign policy is closely linked to new energy supply chains, but is not defined by it. At the same time, foreign policy initiatives can support commercial and strategic objectives, including expanding and deepening China’s dominance of net zero supply chains. These interconnections deserve further research and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China holds dominant or strong positions along several global supply chains for the clean energy products that are critical to the net zero energy transition in the UK and elsewhere. Examples include lithium-ion batteries, wind turbines and solar PV modules. China’s strength in this regard encompasses the extraction of raw mineral ores, through the processing and refining of the ores to produce the final metals, to the manufacture of intermediate and final products. China’s dominance is particularly pronounced in the processing and refining of ores. Significant quantities of some of these ores are imported to China from overseas, often from mines in which Chinese companies hold a significant or majority share, or with which they have secured offtake agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale of dominance:&lt;/strong&gt; In lithium-ion battery supply chains, for example, China is responsible for more than 80% of global supplies of spherical graphite and refined manganese, and of anodes and electrolytes. For wind turbines, it controls more than 80% of refined rare earth metals and manganese, as well as NdFeB magnets. Finally, in solar PV modules, it accounts for more than 80% of refined germanium, polysilicon, wafers and silicon cells. Elsewhere in these supply chains, China is responsible for more than 60% of global output, pointing to very high degrees of market concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing and refining:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese dominance pivots on its control of the processing and refining of minerals. This rests on economies of scale built up over many years, government financial incentives, and on an increasingly strong stock of intellectual property. Chinese companies’ importance in upstream mining is further reinforced by control of the midstream, but also by a relatively high degree of risk tolerance, which backstops upstream mining investments, ensuring access to the highest-value parts of the supply chain. This position will not be usurped over the next decade, and potentially will only be to a limited extent in the decade afterwards. Any inroads into reducing Chinese market share willcrequire heavy public investment and protection from dumping and aggressive state-backed competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential leverage:&lt;/strong&gt; China could potentially exploit its strength for coercive purposes: it is already using export quotas and administrative processes to complicate access to supplies of gallium and germanium, as well as graphite, which in turn has impacted costs. Arguably, infrastructure bottlenecks in China during the Covid-19 pandemic or outages due to floods and power cuts have had a more material impact on the cost and availability of new energy supplies to date. Going forward, the lack of critical materials will also have an inflationary effect on new energy supply chains. Market concentration in China will clearly give it commercial advantages, but the extent to which Beijing will use it for geopolitical leverage remains uncertain. For now, Beijing is more likely to use its leverage in response to perceived aggression – but this could change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons to Russia’s importance in terms of gas supplies have been made frequently since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, there are important distinctions to be made. First, Russia accounted for 40% of European gas supplies before the invasion, whereas market concentration in China is vastly more significant. Second, the impact of an oil or gas outage is different to curtailment of sales of critical materials or components. A direct oil or gas shortage imposes costs on a country’s economy and can limit activity in certain sectors if no alternatives are available; shortages of critical materials, on the other hand, do not cripple economic activity immediately. Third, given the existence of fungible traded markets for oil and gas, supply outages can be mitigated at a cost, which in turn has implications for the entire global economy. Even though the UK does not import Russian pipeline gas, the impact of higher gas prices was also felt in the UK. Equivalent market mechanisms for critical materials are nascent or immature, making it harder to offset shortages. Overall, supply outages for materials and components have a longer-term inflationary impact and risk slowing the energy transition. A simple comparison to oil and gas is not enough. The risks associated with market concentration for new energy supply chains must therefore be assessed more holistically, as should the trade-offs associated with de-risking or decoupling from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks to the UK:&lt;/strong&gt; The coercive risk for the UK is related to the degree of separation between the stage of the supply chain dominated by China and the stage at which UK consumers enter the market. The likelihood that China would be able to target the UK exclusively is small, as the UK today is principally an importer of final or near-final products. As the UK’s capacity to manufacture these products grows, its vulnerability to Chinese coercion increases, and will require a diversification of supply chains. However, even with more diverse supply chains, the UK’s access to materials and components (as well as their cost) would be determined by industrial policy choices made in the EU and the US. Conversely, given the wider tensions between China and the West, any action taken by China to restrict exports of clean energy metals and products would more likely impact the UK, the EU and the US together in response to a perceived provocation, either economic or military. If prolonged, such an embargo would have a profound impact on the UK’s low-carbon transition (alongside other economies’ transitions), but only a modest effect on the wider economy. The greatest risk for the UK stems from events that have a global impact. These could arise from a natural disaster or pandemic, or from a general shortage of critical materials that forces China to prioritise its domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery supply chains:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK is likely to be most heavily exposed to China’s dominance in battery supply chains. This is because China is dominant across most elements of the battery supply chain, and UK automotive manufacturers and the UK electricity grid are expected to rapidly increase demand for batteries. Wind is another area of concern, but the concerns are currently mitigated by a degree of separation between Chinese suppliers and UK users. Nuclear power is not discussed in this paper, but is another supply chain where China is increasingly influential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China’s political/economic calculus:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s ability to leverage its position in net zero supply chains for political ends should be neither overstated nor underestimated. The reason it should not be overstated is because China could use other supply chains to impose coercive pressure on the UK: the total value of UK trade with China in the year to end Q1 2023 was £107.5 billion, with £69.5 billion of imports. China was the UK’s fourth-largest trade partner over this period. This shows that, in circumstances that might give rise to a serious ratcheting up of pressure on UK–Chinese trade, the UK would have much more immediate concerns than net zero supply chains. The reason that China’s ability to leverage its dominance should not be underestimated is that the relatively limited (but symbolically important) role of net zero technologies – as well as China’s unusual dominance in those industries – might make them a useful target should China wish to make a political statement. This paper shows that there may be ways for China to use net zero supply chains in this way without provoking a major escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military considerations:&lt;/strong&gt; The risks to new energy technologies for military purposes stemming from China’s role in supply chains are likely to be similar to those facing the wider population. However, in a time of actual or potential shortage the military could be vulnerable to aggressive corporate strategies and, meanwhile, the military faces the same data security risks as civilian users of Chinese equipment. The extent to which China will be able to use its technological and manufacturing strengths in net zero products to yield military advantage is not clear. In contrast, China’s growing international sales and investment in net zero minerals and products is already boosting its soft power in ways that will impact the UK’s foreign policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk mitigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Mitigating China-centred risks will require action across the entire supply chain: accelerating investments in upstream mining developments, diversification of processing and refining, and recycling of critical minerals and materials. International efforts should aim to engage all actors, including China, to align objectives as far as possible towards the development of open markets which will ultimately benefit everyone, at least economically. Involving China directly in UK projects may mitigate some risks related to shortages, but may also hamper longer-term efforts to develop alternative supply chains that are fully independent of China, and so a mixed approach might be optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fallacy of delay:&lt;/strong&gt; Risks related to China are not likely to be significantly reduced by delays to the transition to net zero. Energy security during the transition is most closely associated with delay and uncertainty as systems are simultaneously scaled up, ramped down, or repurposed. Abandoning national targets would simply increase uncertainty about government commitment to putting in place the infrastructure that will underpin future energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research needs:&lt;/strong&gt; Internally consistent public data is not available on China’s market position in most minerals and products, with multiple reputable sources giving significantly different figures. Better publicly available data on the following issues would help improve analysis of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s domestic extraction capacity for critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s domestic processing capacity and annual output of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Capacity and annual output of critical mineral mines and processing plants outside China that involve Chinese investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data around prices of critical minerals and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Details of China’s international trade (import and export) in critical mineral ores and refined metals, including routes through third countries (in terms of quantity and value).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Detailed information on China’s international trade in intermediate and final products of net zero energy technologies, including routes through third countries and products manufactured by Chinese companies in third countries (in terms of quantity and value).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries do not need to be close allies to be close trading partners. Political or ideological alignment is similarly non-essential. China is deeply embedded in new energy supply chains and its long and steady cultivation of these industries has been essential for the progress made towards reducing the cost of new energy technologies worldwide. Despite some risks, the UK should not seek to exclude China from its supply chains. Instead, the country should seek to communicate effectively with China about the need for diverse supply chains as a point of principle for robust markets and to make the case clearly that this is both in the UK and China’s interests. Bigger, more reliable markets will result in a larger and more diverse client base for China and more supply chains for large-scale new energy technology consumers in the UK and allied countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its domestic policy, the UK should aim to encourage consumers to invest in diversity at all stages of the supply chain, without seeking to exclude China from any of them. Likely shortages in critical minerals offer an opportunity to do this as more mining and refining capacity will probably be required, some of which might usefully be located outside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals have become strategic inputs for a successful clean energy transition, as well as for economic development and national security. A future powered by low-carbon energy sources and protected by a technologically advanced military is one that will be heavily dependent on minerals. As such, demand for minerals is expected to grow over the coming decades, and mining will become a central theme in international development discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to different clean energy scenarios modeled by the International Energy Agency, the demand for each of the five most important critical minerals (i.e., lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and neodymium) will likely increase between 1.5 and 7 times by 2030. Meeting this rising demand will require scaling existing operations and developing hundreds of new projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, Latin America — which holds considerable reserves of copper and lithium, supplying 40 and 35 percent to the global market, respectively — has attracted significant investments in mining. Between 13 and 19 percent of foreign direct investment in the region has gone to the mining sector. Unfortunately, many of the mining projects have been associated with environmental destruction, corruption, dubious economic returns, and the unfair distribution of benefits. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the region has the most mining-related socioeconomic conflicts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these minerals are found in areas that are environmentally sensitive, with important biodiversity and sources of water. Closing the gap in mineral demand will have to be carried out in a manner that empowers local communities around the mines and does not exploit natural resources. As the race to secure critical minerals continues, there should be careful consideration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-esg-standards-in-mining&quot;&gt;The Importance of ESG Standards in Mining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international community has developed an assortment of toolkits and guides to inform projects. The Group of Twenty, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund offer resources that detail how to avoid disputes, build trust, and properly secure access to essential resources. The private sector has also developed their own guidelines. For instance, the International Council on Mining and Metal has released many practical resources to help the industry in this area. The principles observed throughout such products strongly emphasize upstream planning, good governance, and enabling conditions. These same elements stress the importance of positively impacting environmental, social, and economic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying best practices is not merely a nicety but a cost-saving endeavor. When there is a failure to adopt advisable practices, there is a greater potential for costly conflict. A 2014 study by the University of Queensland’s Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining attempted to quantify the cost of conflict with local communities. One case study saw an estimated $20 million loss in net present value for every week of delayed production. Consulting with local communities early on and incorporating best practices throughout the mining process can mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One positive development is the June 2022 announcement of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), an initiative by Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union to increase mineral production. Its goal is “to promote responsible growth across the critical minerals sector via a shared commitment to high [ESG] standards; sustainability; and shared prosperity.” The MSP will be an important conduit to bolster mineral supply chains in a manner that meets high ESG standards. However, implementing these high standards will require the efforts of both the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-conflict-in-mining-operations&quot;&gt;Sources of Conflict in Mining Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict surrounding mining projects primarily derives from insufficient consultation with affected communities, the inequitable distribution of socioeconomic benefits, and environmental objections (see Box 1). The communities that live near mineral deposits are often poor and experience their own a set of unique socioeconomic problems. A report by the Inter-American Development Bank cites “deficient planning” as a consistent source of setbacks for mining projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several typical stages in the mining value chain: exploration, extraction, processing, transportation, and sales. Ideally, closure and remediation conclude the mining lifecycle. Conflict, malpractice, and missed opportunities can occur at any point in the minerals value chain, so thoughtful planning is necessary at each stage to account for all potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having clear and detailed ESG standards is insufficient to protect Indigenous groups and the environment. Without the participation of both the public and private sector, conflicts will continue to arise throughout the value chain, costing both the mining companies and the local communities affected by their actions. The enforcement of these principles cannot be the sole responsibility of the mining company; commercial pressure and empowered regulators also have their roles in leveraging mining as a development tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutional capacity, which varies widely, determines the degree to which suggested or required practices are administered. Regional and local governments tend to lack the technical capacity, personnel, and budgetary resources to effectively address illegal activity and provide adequate land governance, law enforcement, and public services. In many instances, the process of land titling and registration at the subnational level is not well defined, leading to land grabs and clashes with local communities and Indigenous people. Often, areas that are delimited for Indigenous ethnic groups and natural parks are not safeguarded. This is partly because laws and governing principles are typically created at the federal level, not in the municipalities charged with enforcing the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to a lack of institutional capacity, local governments are often unequipped to enforce laws or combat illegal mining. This creates a low-risk environment that enables legal mining entities not to adhere to espoused ESG guidelines and encourages illegal mining activity (any such activity that takes place without receiving state permission, such as land rights or exploration permits). This has resulted in illegal mining into protected areas and the displacement of Indigenous people in many regions. For example, Interpol found that Bolivia and Colombia are major sources of illegal gold, while Ecuador, Panama, and Peru are both sources and processing centers for illegally extracted ores. Illegal mining is highly associated with transnational criminal activity, as well as with human rights violations, environmental degradation, and corruption. Like many illicit activities that exist where rule of law or enforcement capacity is weak, it is a symptom of inadequate governing authority and a lack of alternate employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abandoned or improperly closed mines are attractive to illegal mining operations. Proper closure protocols have not always been common practice and remain underutilized. Nearly a quarter of jurisdictions globally do not require mine closure plans, according to a 2019–2020 survey conducted by the Intergovernmental Forum on Mining, Minerals, Metals, and Sustainable Development. Only 45 percent of the IGF member governments that responded to the survey require companies to provide adequate financial assurance for rehabilitation and other closure costs. Failure to effectively manage a post-mining transition can result in unnecessary, lasting damage to local communities and the environment around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rio Blanco, located in the lower Andes of Peru, is owned by Hong Kong’s Junefield Mineral Resources and the Hunan Gold Corporation. The mine has faced criticism for ramping up production despite expert warnings that such endeavors could release heavy metals and increase the risk of acid drainage from the mine to local water sources.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Mirador and San Carlos Panantza copper mines, located in the Ecuadorian Amazon, have become infamous for the tensions between the Chinese mining consortium CRCC-Tongguan and the local Indigenous community. Natural sites around the mines are ceremonially significant to the Shuar Arutam people, who have grown increasingly frustrated by the mine’s misuse of sacred areas in the Arutam region. The Ecuadorian Constitutional Court found in September 2022 that the Shuar were not sufficiently consulted before Chinese investors opened the San Carlos Panantza mine, thereby delaying its opening. In response to criticism, Chinese investors have tried to co-opt local leaders, avoid cultural and environmental guardrails, and force residents to relocate. According to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, CRCC-Tongguan worked to turn Ecuadorian national elites against the Shuar and employed divide-and-conquer tactics among Indigenous communities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Brazil’s Juruti Mine, run by Alcoa World Alumina, has been assessed as having 700 million metric tons of bauxite, the raw material used to make aluminum. To address its environmental impact, the Juruti Mine has put forward a biodiversity action plan that aims to make mining operations carbon-neutral by 2030 via offsetting the land used for mining each year by an equal acreage of rehabilitated land. Alcoa partnered with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to explore how to best contribute to biodiversity. The Juruti mine is also employing a new reforestation method called nucleation to replenish destroyed fauna. In their efforts, they are mindfully creating non-timber forest jobs, such as harvesting Brazil nuts or cultivating honey, as well as developing small-scale farming projects for locals.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;great-power-competition-in-mining&quot;&gt;Great Power Competition in Mining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political leaders in Latin America are eager to unlock the potential of their natural resources, even if it means awarding bids to China’s state-controlled mining operations. China has experienced undeniable success in the region. According to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker, 21 percent of the $148.9 billion Chinese entities invested in Latin American and Caribbean countries between 2005 and 2022 was in the mining and metals sector. In January 2023, a consortium of the Chinese firms, Contemporary Amperex Technology, Guangdong Brunp Recycling Technology, and CMOC Group, won the rights to extract Bolivia’s lithium deposits. The $1 billion investment is estimated to yield 50,000 metric tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate per year. Moreover, China has invested over $10 billion in Peru’s mining industry and now owns two of Peru’s five largest copper mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s mining advancements in Latin and South America should concern environmentalists and humanitarians as much as it worries national security policymakers. Chinese companies frequently fail to conduct adequate environmental impact assessments or consult with local Indigenous communities. A 2023 report presented to the UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights documented 14 cases in Latin America where Chinese companies committed environmental destruction or violated human rights. Western firms are certainly not all without incidents and controversies, but none of the top ESG performers, according to trade publication Mining Technology, are of Chinese origin. Western firms are ESG leaders in the industry and should continue innovating and implementing towards that end to better offer alternatives to Chinese investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies are competing against Chinese state-subsidized companies that do not adhere to the more stringent ESG standards or anticorruption requirements Western firms must abide by. Though Chinese regulators are working to standardize corporate ESG disclosure reporting, the Guidance for Enterprise ESG Disclosure that took effect in June 2022 mostly requires data reporting and complying with (often weak) local regulations. Rather than doing the minimum required by the host country, U.S. companies usually maintain high standards wherever they operate. Western firms are more likely to incorporate community engagement and consultation, while Chinese firms had 23 allegations of insufficient consultation from January 2021 to December 2022. It was not until May 2023 that the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals &amp;amp; Chemicals Importers &amp;amp; Exporters (CCCMC), launched a pilot consultation mechanism. It is in U.S. companies’ interest to build the capacity of local governments, which would give these companies a comparative advantage over Chinese state-subsidized firms. The United States cannot make China’s offers less financially attractive for host nations. A level playing field will never be achieved so long as there is the possibility of a firm underbidding others by cutting corners on ESG best practices. Navigating the stakeholder landscape to achieve this will require collaboration among government officials, corporations, and local communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in instances where companies do not self-regulate, government authorities could develop traceability programs. Accessibility leads to transparency, which improves adherence to best practices. While traceability is not a substitute for good governance and strong rule of law, increasing transparency does support and improve governance. Western companies and the U.S. government cannot do due diligence if knowledge of relevant supply chains is lacking. Moreover, as global consumers and investors become increasingly conscious of ESG goals, companies that demonstrate their dedication to these principles can attract more capital. Traceability may give consumers and end users the information needed to shape the market in a way that rewards ESG best practices even when host countries lack the capacity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing ESG best practices will make the Latin American region more stable and prosperous. The sooner such practices are well established, with all stakeholders in the mining value chain adhering to them, the less exploitation and environmental conflict there will be. In this regard, U.S.-based companies should view responsible mining and the implementation of ESG standards not as a burden, but as a selling point. Fortunately, many firms already share this perspective, and aim high by going beyond the minimum standards. Yet there is still work to be done throughout the entire mine-to-market value chain to enhance the comparative advantage of firms that are ESG-conscious. Companies, regulators, and end users need to collaborate to continue moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

They need specific protection from harm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that the whole world could be said to have agreed on and united around, surely it is International Humanitarian Law (IHL), as encapsulated in the Geneva Conventions. They were signed by every single state, a feat only replicated a handful of times, mostly around another world-unifying issue: climate change. Even the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Chemical Weapons Convention have not reached that milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite this universal rejection of attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure – especially, in the context of this Commentary, hospitals and healthcare workers – they occur daily. The World Health Organization monitors the extent of the problem, and at the time of writing, its dashboard stands at 855 attacks in 18 countries this year. This is almost certainly a gross underestimate, and only paints a broad-brush picture – while documenting 1,180 such attacks in Ukraine since January 2022, it does not convey that 190 of those facilities were completely destroyed. The vast majority of these attacks are intentional. During a period of analysis of attacks in Syria, 22% of all infrastructure damaged was healthcare-related, compared with only 3% for schools. This has led some to assert that the Red Cross is now the “Dread Cross” – a target rather than a protection – and that protecting hospitals requires a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important question is whether this is a problem for the international community at all. After all, the Geneva Conventions do not rule out an attack on a hospital. The law itself is simple – hospitals are protected – but this is caveated by “provided they are not military objectives”. The Conventions do not define all the circumstances in which hospitals lose their protection, but the International Committee of the Red Cross commentaries give illustrations: combatants setting up a firing position there; storing ammunition; sheltering troops; or using it as a “human shield”. This last is especially problematic. It is the nature of hospitals, when surrounded by fighting, to occupy a liminal space; they serve the health needs of anyone in need. Critically, they also have no power to reject combatants – so they can lose their protection because of an action over which they have no agency. This is something that current legal frameworks struggle to manage. Even when there are prosecutions, they are rarely successful. Indeed, some argue that focusing on accountability for war crimes through International Criminal Law may even be weakening some elements of the harder-to-prove IHL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Indeed, some argue that focusing on accountability for war crimes through International Criminal Law may even be weakening some elements of the harder-to-prove International Humanitarian Law&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider also the realities of military necessity. Close quarters fighting to rid a hospital of a prepared enemy force will be extremely challenging and costs many soldiers’ lives. It may significantly slow an advance (that may itself be time critical). It may allow the enemy to escape, regroup and attack elsewhere. These specific dangers may be overcome by a heavy bombardment that simply destroys the facility – but they are not the only relevant risks. The tactical advantage of an overwhelming attack comes with long-term operational and strategic costs that may be far greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commander may legally strike the hospital that has lost its protection only if the military advantage achieved will outweigh the expected collateral damage. But how well-informed are commanders about the extent of that collateral damage? They know of course that it will involve civilian casualties, as hospitals in conflict-affected areas are typically overcrowded with the most vulnerable sections of society, seeking either treatment or refuge. There will also be the staff tending to them. These represent the direct harm of the attack. But is that it? Hospitals take years to build, require enormous resources to stock, and replacement staff for those who have been killed, injured or driven away by the violence take time to train or recruit. The health economy loses a critical node and so, for years after, those who seek care may not be able to access it effectively. People will sicken and die from perfectly treatable conditions, for lack of ongoing management of their long-term health conditions and for loss of capacity to treat their new ones. This is the indirect harm and it is vast; for every one killed by the attack itself, at least 11 die of these indirect harms. The groups most affected by both are the children, women, elderly and ill – the same groups least able to flee to access healthcare elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other costs that are harder to quantify, but militarily may be even more apposite. It could conceivably be the best military solution, if the objective is to win the war, but it makes no sense at all if the objective is to win the peace. Victory achieved by destroying the capacity or will of the enemy to continue the fight only brings negative peace: the absence of fighting. It rarely lasts, because the capacity and will to fight can be regrown. As US counterinsurgency doctrine notes, “Kill[ing] 5 insurgents is counterproductive if collateral damage leads to the recruitment of 50 more, and loss of local support”. The rubble of a hospital is guaranteed to alienate the population, engendering a lasting sense of grievance that will fuel the will to fight again. Positive peace, where the factions share a sense of social justice such that neither wants nor needs to fight, is far more likely to persist. Access to healthcare is a key component of positive peace. If the commander knew that cumulative harms and grievance resulting from the hospital attack would also inspire their enemy to rise up again in five years and attack them even harder, would they still call in an airstrike? Or would they take the harder option and target the enemy at close quarters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you still bomb a hospital, while somehow mitigating these problems? We often hear that IHL-compliant warnings are given to evacuate areas before they are attacked. The reality is that this is a normally a facade. A UK hospital, such as the one in which the author works, could undoubtedly be evacuated completely – for example if there was a major fire – but patients would come to harm. New patients would die waiting for ambulances, as frontline vehicles were diverted to moving existing patients. The frail or critically ill may well die from interruption of their care. The entire regional health system would have to slash routine and emergency care to cope, which would severely degrade it for weeks or months. And all of this in a stable, developed, interoperable health system. If it were the only functioning hospital in a region, where would the patients go? If the ambulance system were weak and overwhelmed by conflict casualties, who would move them? For a significant number, these notifications will simply give advance warning of their death – either in the hospital, or without adequate care nearby. No one should ever believe that you can bomb a hospital in a way that does not have extensive, enduring impacts on the population served by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nor is this simply about influencing tactical decision-making. Degrading the health of a population has international consequences too&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is this simply about influencing tactical decision-making. Degrading the health of a population has international consequences too. People who are unsafe and cannot access basic services will try to move. Mass refugee flows negatively impact health and stability in surrounding countries and so are generally detrimental to the interests of the wider international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it may be the approach of the international community that lies at the root of this problem. Evaluation of the ICRC Healthcare in Danger project suggests progress against its objectives of engagement, preparation and legislation; this is not a failure of advocacy on the part of such organisations. Nor is it (generally) the result of malfunctioning munitions, or human error. As then Médecins Sans Frontières International President Joanne Liu told the UN Security Council in 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the third of May, this council unanimously passed Resolution 2286. You, the Council Members, pledged to protect civilians and the medical services they need to survive. You passed the resolution in the wake of the obliteration of Al Quds Hospital, in Aleppo by the Syrian government and its allies … Five months later, the resolution has plainly failed to change anything on the ground. This failure reflects a lack of political will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting international laws that allow commanders to determine military necessity for themselves, using ill-informed collateral risk assessments to decide what is subjectively proportionate, may be facilitating attacks on healthcare rather than stopping them. Increasingly it seems more likely to be used as a framework for the subsequent justification of an attack, than as a protection to prevent one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as conflicts affecting healthcare rage in 18 countries this year, what can be done to break this pattern? First, the international community can acknowledge the reality: healthcare is openly attacked during wars, and IHL does not currently offer meaningful protection to hospitals in high intensity conflict. Then it can ask how that can be changed. Perhaps the clue to one simple measure lies in the Chemical Weapons Convention, itself so close to complete international agreement. There are some weapons that must not be used. An additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions could, at the stroke of a pen, simply preclude the use of explosive weapons on hospitals. Hospitals could still be targeted if there was military necessity – and their use as command posts or ammunition dumps could still justify that – but it would have to be done by small arms, and line of sight. It would be bloody, but it would be the blood of combatants, not civilians. The infrastructure would remain, to treat the population afterwards. The staff will be alive to undertake their duties. Perhaps most importantly, it would not harden the will of the entire population against the attackers; it would leave space for lasting peace, rather than sowing the seeds of the next generation of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
