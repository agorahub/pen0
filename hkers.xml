&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK’s new Labour government conducts its national security review, its approach to nuclear modernisation will send a crucial message to the US. The UK’s nuclear deterrent is not just a national asset; it is a cornerstone of NATO’s collective defence strategy. How Labour navigates this issue will have far-reaching implications for transatlantic relations and the future of the Western alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of the UK’s nuclear capabilities was recently underscored by the US Strategic Posture Commission. In its comprehensive report, the Commission emphasised the critical role of the UK’s nuclear forces in maintaining NATO’s deterrence posture. The report explicitly states: “The United Kingdom and France provide important nuclear forces that contribute to the NATO Alliance. The United Kingdom, in particular, contributes to deterrence and complicates adversary planning with its independent nuclear arsenal.” This assessment highlights how the UK’s submarine-based deterrent enhances the credibility of NATO’s nuclear policy and presents additional strategic challenges for potential adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly emphasised the importance of maintaining the UK’s nuclear deterrent. In a recent speech, he stated: “A strong, modernised nuclear capability is not just a pillar of our national defence – it’s a cornerstone of our commitment to NATO and global security.” This clear stance from the former opposition leader underscores the cross-party support for nuclear modernisation in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment to nuclear modernisation was recently strengthened by the UK’s 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. In a bold move, the review announced an increase in the UK’s nuclear weapon stockpile cap from 180 to 260 warheads. This decision demonstrated the UK’s resolve and ability to be flexible in the face of evolving global threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer has expressed support for this decision, noting: “In an increasingly unpredictable world, we must ensure our deterrent remains effective. The increase in our stockpile cap is a necessary step to safeguard our national security and uphold our NATO obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A clear and unambiguous commitment from the UK to a fully resourced nuclear modernisation programme would serve as a powerful demonstration of burden-sharing and alliance solidarity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s commitment to nuclear modernisation was further reinforced in March 2024 with the publication of “Delivering the UK’s Nuclear Deterrent as a National Endeavour”. This strategic document reaffirms the critical importance of the nuclear deterrent to UK national security and outlines a comprehensive approach to resourcing and upgrading the country’s nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the paper emphasises several key points that underscore the UK’s unique position in global nuclear deterrence. Firstly, it highlights that the UK is the only power besides the US that has pledged its nuclear deterrent to NATO, underscoring the UK’s indispensable role in the alliance’s overall deterrence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the document recognises the UK’s critical role in helping the US confront what it terms a “two peer problem” – referring to the challenge posed by simultaneously deterring both Russia and China. It stresses that with the right support from the US, in line with historical agreements, the UK can play a pivotal part in addressing this complex geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the paper acknowledges the significant challenges ahead and outlines a comprehensive response. Under the banner of a “National Endeavour,” it proposes mobilising a wide set of measures to ensure the continued effectiveness and credibility of the UK’s nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer has praised this document, stating, “The March 2024 strategic review provides a clear roadmap for ensuring our nuclear forces remain cutting-edge and capable of meeting future challenges. Labour fully supports this forward-looking approach to our nuclear policy, recognising it truly as a national endeavour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Labour now conducts its own national security review, it must carefully consider these key points and translate rhetorical assurances into concrete policy decisions and resource allocations. The review should build upon this foundation, exploring ways to further enhance the UK’s nuclear capabilities and its contribution to NATO’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the UK could demonstrate its commitment to a robust nuclear deterrent is by considering the adoption of a nuclear capability outside its current Continual at-Sea Deterrent construct. Currently, the UK relies solely on its submarine-based Trident missiles. While this system has proven effective, diversifying the nuclear arsenal to include a second delivery method could enhance flexibility and resilience. The original Polaris Sales Agreement could serve as a model for future engagement and additional capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signals sent by Labour’s ongoing review will be particularly significant in the context of an increased emphasis on allied burden-sharing. A clear and unambiguous commitment from the UK to a fully resourced nuclear modernisation programme, to include a second delivery platform, would serve as a powerful demonstration of burden-sharing and alliance solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a strong UK nuclear posture would help maintain strategic stability in an era of renewed great power competition. As Russia continues its aggressive behaviour and China rapidly expands its nuclear capabilities, the deterrent value of Western nuclear forces has only grown. The UK’s nuclear arsenal, though smaller than that of the US or Russia, plays a vital role in this broader deterrence landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high, and the world will be watching closely. Translating the new prime minister’s rhetoric on nuclear modernisation into action and resources will help ensure the continued effectiveness of the Western deterrent and the stability of the transatlantic alliance for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of forces are promoting reindustrialization of the United States. Concerned about the fragility of long supply chains, some firms are reinvesting in U.S. production. They are enabled by government support ranging from tax subsidies for capital investment to active support for strategic industries that will keep the United States at the technological frontier or that relate closely to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding manufacturing in the United States inevitably raises questions for energy policy. Energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. Companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. Gas supplied 43 percent of U.S. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. As policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing from a carbon-intensity perspective. This paper presents the key findings from CSIS’s research — including from a literature survey, data analysis, workshops, and stakeholder interviews — and policy recommendations on how the United States can maintain competitiveness while furthering decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshoring-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Reshoring Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, investments in new manufacturing facilities have accelerated in the United States, driven by two key sectors: semiconductors and electric vehicles (EVs). Remarkably, real spending on construction of computer and electrical manufacturing facilities, including semiconductor and EV battery manufacturing, has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2022. By April 2024, project announcements reached $367.9 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and $84.4 billion for EV manufacturing. These industries now account for nearly 60 percent of all manufacturing investment in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both market and strategic imperatives are driving these investments. Chipmakers aim to diversify supply chains beyond East Asia and move closer to the U.S. market, while automakers and their suppliers are investing to meet growing demand. Federal government support, driven by the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, is accelerating these trends. Supply chain vulnerabilities for semiconductors increase national security and economic risks, while reshoring and rerouting the EV battery supply chain helps advance the nation’s decarbonization efforts and supports the tactical and operational demands of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration aims for the United States to produce 20 percent of global leading-edge logic chips and for EVs to comprise 50 percent of new vehicle sales by 2030. Taking into account uncertainties in future sales and value chains, forecasts of battery manufacturing capacity vary widely. The Rhodium Group estimates that if all investments announced since 2018 are realized, they would create 1,062–1,288 gigawatt hours (GWh) of domestic cell and module production capacity in 2030. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts a more modest 588 GWh of domestic battery production capacity in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Energy and Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, energy consumption by the semiconductor and EV sectors in the United States is a small fraction of the total energy consumption by U.S. manufacturing. According to 2018 U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, energy consumption in the semiconductor and EV sectors is far lower than in sectors such as chemicals and petroleum refining (Table 1). However, such comparisons predate the active U.S. policy for reshoring and could change as these sectors grow in significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pCemZas.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: U.S. Manufacturing Energy Consumption by Sector, 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public data on energy consumption by the semiconductor and EV sectors is scarce because new facilities are only being announced and built now and anticipated energy use is commercially sensitive. The data average derived from multiple papers surveyed by CSIS suggests the need for 44 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of average energy consumption to produce 1 kWh of EV battery capacity. At that intensity, the 1,000 GWh of potential battery manufacturing capacity forecasted for 2030 would require 44,000 GWh of energy consumption, or approximately 150 trillion British thermal units (Btu). However, energy usage estimates vary across studies due to different methods and data sources. Many rely on data that is over a decade old and that likely differs from current usage, given industry growth and efficiency improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to a 2021 regulatory document, a new Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) fabrication site in Arizona is estimated to use 1,200 megawatts (MW), which at 99 percent capacity would be equivalent to about 30 trillion Btu. That is roughly equivalent to the peak power output of a Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactor or one-tenth of the installed capacity of natural gas combined-cycle plants in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the dearth of authoritative energy use estimates, both the administration’s goals and the $452.3 billion (actual and planned) invested in the semiconductor and EV manufacturing sectors combined through April 2024 suggest significant energy demand growth. Moreover, the expansion of strategic manufacturing will expectedly induce additional energy demand in other sectors, such as steel and aluminum production. Even with efficiency advancement in manufacturing processes, increased demand from reshoring will be happening at the same time as pronounced load growth nationally, creating supply risks for energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, projections over the next 10 years are already pointing to a higher electricity growth forecast than at any point in the past decade, including summer peak demand growth of 79 gigawatts (GW) and winter peak demand growth of 91 GW, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natural-gas-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Natural Gas and Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, the role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has risen dramatically. Enabled by shale production, U.S. dry gas production has grown from 18 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2005 to 38 Tcf in 2023, with consumption increasing from 22 Tcf to 33 Tcf over the same period. For most of that period, the Henry Hub natural gas price has been below $5 per million Btu (MMBtu), easing the cost of higher consumption throughout the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pl6ECoC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: The Major Role of Natural Gas in Electricity Generation and the Industrial Sector, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low energy prices are associated with manufacturing competitiveness. In general, economic studies find a small positive effect on manufacturing output and employment from lower gas prices enabled by U.S. production. A working paper for the Federal Reserve first released in 2014 found that the decrease in natural gas prices between 2006 and 2013 contributed to an increase in manufacturing output by 2 to 3 percent across the whole manufacturing sector. The increase appears to be higher in more energy-intensive sectors, such as fertilizer production. A similar study published in 2021 found roughly similar effects, verifying a larger body of literature produced in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry players expect that natural gas will continue to play a key role in meeting growing energy demands. In the most recent long-term reliability assessment, published in 2023, NERC sees natural gas remaining a “critical resource” for the U.S. electric power supply in many areas. Particularly in winter, natural gas power plants will provide “necessary reliability attributes . . . as traditional generators retire and inverter-based renewable resources take their place in the resource mix.” Goldman Sachs expects natural gas to meet about 60 percent of additional load growth from expanding data centers and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilities in states attracting manufacturing investment are re-elevating natural gas in resource planning. Arizona is one of the major destination states for actual and planned investments in both EV batteries ($3.7 billion) and semiconductor manufacturing ($100.7 billion). One of the leading utilities in the state, Arizona Public Service (APS), projects the energy needs through 2038 in its service territory to increase at 3.7 percent annually to 23,700 GWh — about 55 percent from data center expansions and 24 percent from large industrial activities (inclusive of demand-side management and efficiency gains). This projected growth translates into about 3,400 MW of capacity needs in the next 15 years. Particularly in light of its planned exit from coal-fired generation in 2031, APS views natural gas — including hydrogen-capable natural gas combustion turbines — as a means to ensure reliability while expanding renewables and energy storage resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story in Georgia is similar. A massive economic expansion since January 2022 led Georgia Power to file an update to its 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP) in October 2023. The utility projects electricity load growth of 6,600 MW through 2030–31, which is about 17 times larger than what it anticipated in its 2022 IRP. During the first half of 2023, the manufacturing sector — including solar, EVs, and aerospace — was leading the state’s economic growth, representing 67 percent of job creation and 81 percent of the capital investment. Georgia Power views natural gas as crucial for a cost-effective and reliable low-carbon transition, complementing energy storage resources that have limited time duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prices&quot;&gt;Prices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present forecasts for U.S. gas production show that rising consumption will be accompanied by rising prices. The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 forecasts a 0.5 percent growth in the domestic supply of dry gas and a price level increase of 0.4 percent through 2050. While the trajectory for production growth is relatively linear, the forecasted price increase of 0.4 percent, from $6.52 per MMBtu in 2022 to $7.23 in 2050, is accompanied by a notable dip to below $3.50 in the late 2020s (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ofhSsKQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Outlooks for U.S. Natural Gas Supply and Henry Hub Prices through 2050&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, natural gas consultancy Wood Mackenzie’s forecasts show that large increases in gas consumption — from data center operation, chip manufacturing, and liquefied natural gas exports — will not lead to a significant price increase. Corresponding to its upward revision in the U.S. gas demand projection for the early 2040s from 13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) under the 2022 version to 30 Bcf/d, Wood Mackenzie’s latest forecasts are for Henry Hub to reach $4 per MMcf by the mid-to-late 2030s, and closer to $6 per MMcf through the 2040s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emissions&quot;&gt;Emissions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural gas plays a significant role in the energy system, and expanding gas consumption raises potential challenges for meeting ambitious zero-carbon targets for the power sector. The continued use of coal-fired generation and changes in the dispatch order for generations make evaluating the emissions impact of additional capacity challenging to estimate outside of a modeling framework. In the meantime, about two-thirds of the states where strategic manufacturing is on rise are below the national average in terms of the carbon intensity of their electric power supply. The map below shows the top 10 recipient states of actual and planned investments in semiconductors and EV manufacturing, as well as the carbon intensity of associated power generation and the percentage contribution from natural gas in each state (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/w4mBwTj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Natural Gas Reliance and Electric Power Supply Carbon Intensity in the Top 10 U.S. States for Semiconductor and EV Manufacturing Investments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;carbon-competitiveness&quot;&gt;Carbon Competitiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world moves toward net-zero emissions, how much CO2 emissions companies and industries produce will affect their competitiveness. More firms must now report direct and indirect emissions as part of their Scope 1 and 2 emissions accounting. As carbon pricing or similar regulations spread, lower-emissions production will be more profitable, as prices will reflect emissions intensity. Even if the United States delays implementing national climate regulations, markets will value lower-emissions production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) now exposes U.S. exporters to climate-related trade rules for certain goods. While these measures will not immediately affect semiconductors or EV batteries, they will apply to commodities such as steel, aluminum, and chemicals. In these areas, U.S. producers have some carbon advantage over international competitors such as China but may trail producers in Europe. For products crucial for decarbonization, such as EV batteries, the carbon output of manufacturing will remain important in life-cycle analysis and could soon affect commercial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, both Democratic and Republican leaders see benefits in highlighting how efficient the U.S. economy and manufacturing specifically are with respect to emissions. In April 2024, the Biden administration formed a climate and trade task force to address the neglect of emissions from imported goods in current trade policies. Announcing the task force, U.S. climate envoy John Podesta cautioned that ignoring these emissions unfairly advantages countries with high-carbon manufacturing, such as China. This echoes a frequent Republican claim that lax regulations overseas award foreign manufacturers an unfair advantage. Legislators are drafting proposals to study the relative carbon intensity of production and install carbon border adjustments across different product categories. At their most expansive, these proposals would apply beyond the small set of commodities covered by the European Union’s CBAM and include battery materials and other goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where carbon emissions matter in competition, U.S. manufacturing has a mixed advantage. U.S. industry produces semiconductors and EV batteries with less carbon than China thanks to cleaner energy generation, but it still trails Europe (Table 2). Although both the U.S. and Chinese power grids rely on fossil fuels, China’s higher use of coal power — 63 percent of its power generation compared to 23 percent in the United States as of 2021 — makes its manufacturing more carbon intensive, particularly as coal is more than twice as carbon intensive as natural gas. The European Union uses more emissions-free sources (deriving 37 percent of its power generation from renewable energy and 25 percent from nuclear energy) than the United States, reducing its emissions output. The degree of reliance on natural gas within power systems varies notably across the three economies: 38.4 percent in the United States, 19.9 percent in the European Union, and 3.3 percent in China as of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qaq8AW4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Emission Intensity of U.S. Semiconductor and EV Battery Manufacturing Compared to Europe and China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of strategic manufacturing demands construction, which requires raw materials such as iron ore and aluminum. In supplying these resources, the United States has a relative advantage over major competitors such as China. A 2019 report comparing steel industry emissions across the 15 top steel-producing countries found that U.S. production is one of the least carbon intensive, while China ranked last. Similarly, North American aluminum production emits about half the global average rate, according to industry data. An industry report found that “the current emission intensity of aluminum products produced in China is 2.5 times [that] of [North American] domestic products, and the global aluminum product carbon intensity is 1.9 times [that] of [North American] domestic products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;abatement-opportunities&quot;&gt;Abatement Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the expansion of gas in the power sector has reduced emissions as it has displaced coal. Using gas in the power and industrial sectors contributes to the relative emissions advantage of U.S. manufacturing. However, a path to net zero will require emissions abatement for all use cases of natural gas, as other emissions abatement opportunities will be exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three general options for reducing emissions from natural gas consumption. The first is reducing the emissions intensity of natural gas by producing renewable natural gas (or biomethane) or synthetic methane via clean hydrogen production. These methods are presently limited in potential scale and cost, respectively. The second option is using carbon capture and storage (CCS) on point sources where gas is combusted for power or heat, which can be costly but is scalable. The last option is reducing gas use to the point where remnant emissions can be offset using carbon removals. Of these three, the deployment of CCS on existing or new facilities is most likely to help square near-term energy demand growth and long-term climate ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy modeling indicates that deploying CCS can achieve rapid emissions reductions and the continued utilization of natural gas. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 2023 Standard Scenarios Report found that gas capacity continues to expand across different scenarios, adding 200 GW through 2050 under current policy and 130 GW in the case that achieves a 95 percent emissions reduction in 2050. But in scenarios with strong and immediate emissions policies (net-zero electricity by 2035), natural gas with CCS can grow significantly — even after the emissions standards are in place — and provide as much generation in 2050 as it does today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of capture and a lack of pipeline infrastructure for CO2 are commonly cited reasons for not deploying CCS today. Even with subsidies, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) assesses combined-cycle natural gas generators to be a longer-term opportunity for deployment of CCS, meaning that it will be commercially viable after 2030. In the meantime, deployment of capture technologies in other sectors will help reduce costs and support infrastructure. The post-2030 timeline makes CCS a relevant consideration for utilities, power plant operators, and regulators today. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has already identified CCS as the best means of emissions reduction for natural gas generators in its rule for new emissions sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accelerate progress toward commercial deployment, the DOE has sponsored front-end engineering and design studies for retrofitting natural-gas-fired power plants with CCS technologies. Capital and finance costs dominate the total cost of retrofitting natural gas generation for carbon capture. In a DOE-sponsored study of the retrofit costs for a 750 MW gas plant in Texas, capital costs accounted for 70 percent of the cost of the retrofit, which totaled $477 million, or about $115 per ton of CO2 captured over 15 years. At present, there are reportedly eight planned or in process deployments of CCS on gas plants in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stakeholder-considerations&quot;&gt;Stakeholder Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong outlook for energy demand growth introduces a range of qualitative considerations and concerns for energy planners and firms. Reliability, affordability, accessibility, and carbon intensity are some of the key considerations that shape stakeholder approaches to energy requirements from the strategic manufacturing sectors. What stakeholders value in addressing energy requirements may not vary significantly, but there is some diversity in how different stakeholders prioritize key attributes of energy supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturers:&lt;/strong&gt; Along with factors such as the availability of a skilled labor force, logistical infrastructure, and local political support, local energy resources shape manufacturers’ siting decisions. Energy considerations extend beyond securing large, low-cost supplies, though this remains crucial for manufacturers’ profitability. Energy reliability is a key priority for semiconductor manufacturers, as a “stoppage at any of its manufacturing stages can result in wasted batches.” The cost of a supply disruption can be significant. For example, Samsung reportedly incurred a $43.3 million loss in 2018 when a regional transmission cable failed, leaving its chip plant without power for 30 minutes. The need for an uninterrupted supply of electricity could accelerate interest from manufacturers in these sectors to seek on-site power generation assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon intensity is another major interest of manufacturers. Leading companies in EV battery and semiconductor manufacturing, as well as data center operators, have corporate sustainability commitments that include greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments and energy conservation targets. EV battery manufacturers seem eager to procure clean power to produce the goods whose primary objective is to decarbonize the transportation sector. For example, Panasonic, LG Energy Solution, and SK hynix have pledged to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2030 or 2040. These commitments may amount to a future where half of batteries would be made at factories that source at least 50 percent of their power demand from renewable energy sources by 2030. Battery manufacturers’ interest in a low-carbon supply chain has also manifested in exploration of the option of leveraging investment interests to facilitate a regional power supply mix, including coal plant closures. Also, leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturer Intel has pledged net-zero emissions by 2040 for both direct emissions from chip fabrication and purchased electricity, steam, and heating/cooling equipment, while semiconductor end users such as Microsoft and Amazon are committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2030 and 2040, respectively. However, a recent media report highlights the difficulty in accelerating, let alone maintaining, the pace of emissions reduction as AI business expands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Electric and gas utilities need to ensure the provision of energy to various customers — ranging from households to large-scale industrial users, including semiconductor and EV battery manufacturers — while sustaining a profitable business. The economics of various energy resources are important factors that utilities watch in planning what generation and transmission infrastructure is needed where and at what increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of stranded assets is a major concern for utilities. They make plans for resource procurement (including by trade with neighboring states) and new infrastructure based on the best available energy data. Some view energy data availability as a primary challenge, whereas others find data analysis a bigger challenge. Some factors necessary for sound modeling are dynamic and difficult to analyze. Consumer preference in the case of modeling the growth of EV battery manufacturing capacity may be one such example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another complicating factor is the misalignment of the pace of decisionmaking among different stakeholders. For example, investment decisionmaking by manufacturers is generally much faster than the pace of planning by utilities, whether they operate in regulated or unregulated markets. Even when utilities recognize the demand growth, they often face delays in obtaining the permits required to build the necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Utility Regulators:&lt;/strong&gt; The principal mission of state utility regulators (e.g., public utility commissions, or PUCs) includes ensuring that energy supply is reliable, affordable, and accessible. Another key concern of state regulators is who pays for infrastructure that will be required to meet energy demand from expanding manufacturing. Conveying the net economic benefit for the state could be a challenge, as ratepayer interests can be more geographically segmented even within a state or such benefits may not be immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean energy use, including measures such as renewable portfolio standards, can also be part of oversight and regulatory consideration where the state legislature so mandates a state regulatory body. The impact of rapid growth in energy demand on clean energy mandates warrants close regulatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the level of concern regulators have regarding the risk of stranded assets seems to vary depending on whether utilities in each state operate as vertically integrated monopolies under PUC oversights or in unregulated markets. Regulators in regulated markets are likely more concerned with an overbuild of generation and transmission assets by utilities, as the economic loss from a stranded asset can be passed on to ratepayers. At the same time, a state PUC could be less concerned with a utility’s ability to build generation to meet the state’s energy demand, as investment decisions are made in close consultation with utilities, including through the IRP process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-observations-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Observations and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining economic competitiveness over higher-carbon manufacturers such as China and narrowing the intensity gap with Europe will require emissions reduction efforts throughout supply chains. The United States needs policies that help unlock the strategic value of natural gas to reestablish its industrial competitiveness while furthering decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, neither the CHIPS Act nor the IRA impose energy use or emissions-intensity requirements for tax credit eligibility on strategic manufacturing sectors, such as the semiconductor and EV battery sectors. An approach that imposes firm guidance on power procurement similar to the one proposed for hydrogen under the IRA (i.e., hourly matching, incrementality, and deliverability under the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit) is likely unfeasible in many strategic manufacturing cases. At the same time, it would incur significant costs and thus undermine project economics in most cases. The policy needs to be designed to foster the commercial feasibility of emerging strategic manufacturing while making material progress in emissions reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several areas are ripe for action by industry and government stakeholders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage strategic manufacturing sectors to collect and share energy usage data with a federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Energy usage data for emerging strategic sectors is currently scarce, largely due to the sectors’ nascence in the United States. Also, manufacturers may be concerned that energy usage data could reveal certain proprietary manufacturing processes. Such data is essential for a multitude of stakeholders, however. It would help utilities and energy regulators improve their ability to identify future energy requirements and infrastructure needs, especially as the regulators strive to ensure the reliability, affordability, and accessibility of energy against the fast-evolving investment and manufacturing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In particular, a greater amount of quality data could help reduce the risk of overbuilding or underbuilding. The risk of stranded assets is a major concern for utilities and regulators, as it could incur significant costs to ratepayers. Yet, the risk of underbuilding energy infrastructure has a consequence, too. Failing to meet the energy demand could stymie industrial redevelopment of a state or the country. Ultimately, collecting and sharing more energy data — qualitatively and quantitatively — is also in the interest of strategic manufacturers as a better understanding of energy usage and estimating future needs can help regulators and utilities plan better, thereby cultivating a policy environment that enables such manufacturing activities. Industry associations in leading strategic manufacturing sectors are well positioned to take the lead in collecting and sharing energy usage data with the public, potentially through a federal agency such as the U.S. Department of Commerce or the EIA, as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accelerate the reduction of emissions intensity from manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Manufacturing is intensive in both energy usage and GHG emissions. Electrifying as much of the manufacturing processes as possible while facilitating low-carbon fuel use could help reduce manufacturing emissions. For example, in EV battery cell manufacturing, the process of drying electrodes is a leading source of non-electricity-related emissions. Several technologies, including near-infrared drying and laser drying, are under development to help reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Emissions reductions in manufacturing associated materials, such as steel and aluminum, are also crucial. Areas for proactive consideration include greater use of lower-emitting electric arc furnaces over blast furnaces and complementing natural gas use with hydrogen use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage CCS readiness at new gas power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CCS is likely the best path for emissions reductions from new gas plants, but it is not ready to meet growing demand today. Utilities and developers could prepare for the deployment of CCS in the future to create option value for all stakeholders and opportunities for natural gas to continue to provide baseload power at decreasing emissions intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Active planning and forward engineering studies at the project development stage can encourage CCS readiness, even when CCS will not be immediately deployed. By considering future retrofit, developers could assess the costs of facilities and site design for accommodating flue gas treatment, solvent regeneration, CO2 compression, and additional power and water requirements. Avoiding designs and facility layouts that would make future retrofit prohibitively expensive should become an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage infrastructure permitting reform.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The importance of enabling infrastructure is one of the key considerations that was underscored throughout the stakeholder interviews. Infrastructure under consideration ranges from natural gas pipelines to electric power grids.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The federal processes for infrastructure permitting merit modernization that will enhance efficiency and reduce uncertainty while protecting the environment and local communities. Permitting reform could help alleviate the misalignment of the pace of decisionmaking that confronts manufacturers, utilities, and regulators. Having infrastructure in place where and when needed is crucial if government support and business investments are to catalyze reindustrialization that strengthens U.S. leadership in strategic industries and manufacturing competitiveness in the global market, where carbon-intensity is under increased scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, on the eve of then U.S. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at CSIS conducted a formal survey of Taiwanese companies’ views and activity related to the international geostrategic environment. What most stood out was the high percentage of firms that already had begun to move some of their business from Mainland China or were considering doing so. A smaller, yet surprising number also reported either already moving or considering moving some of their business from Taiwan. These levels of reported movement of operations far outstripped such activity by their American, European, and Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, in part due to two summit meetings between the leaders of the United States and China and the launching of over a dozen dialogues, geostrategic tensions have modestly tempered. In that context the Trustee Chair conducted a second survey of Taiwanese firms in November 2023 to assess how companies’ views and behavior may have shifted during the intervening period. The new survey was slightly modified to take into consideration changing circumstances, and the sample size was increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching conclusion from the latest survey is that although worries about the risks of doing business with China remain high, Taiwanese companies are engaging in a variety of diversification strategies rather than decoupling from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies’ worries about the geostrategic environment have receded somewhat, but they still favor a variety of coping strategies, including expanding involvement in regional trade arrangements, broadening commercial ties with the United States, expanding research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and nurturing a talented workforce to protect Taiwan’s technology advantage, and shifting some of their operations from China and Taiwan. Although the total proportion of firms considering or actually moving some of their business from China and Taiwan fell slightly, the proportion reporting they have already moved some operations rose significantly (from 25.7 percent to 34.3 percent from China, and from 13.0 percent to 17.9 percent from Taiwan). Companies report that Southeast Asia is still their number one destination, but interest in South Asia has risen dramatically. Companies are motivated to move from China for a variety of reasons, including high labor costs, fears of supply chain disruptions, changing investment policies, and worries about the possibility of war. Industries vary significantly in their interest in moving, which may be affected by the extent of their investment and the purpose of their existing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the proportion of firms moving remains high, they are moving as part of a variety of diversification strategies, not outright abandoning China altogether. China is still seen as an important trading partner; Taiwanese businesses are still not convinced India and Southeast Asia are sufficient substitutes; and companies are only moving a portion of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results have important implications for policymakers in Washington, Beijing, Taipei and elsewhere. In the face of similar risks faced by Taiwanese industry, the U.S. government has launched a range of initiatives to address a list of economic security concerns, including dual-use technologies, supply chain resilience, economic coercion, and human rights abuses. If Washington’s approach becomes overly focused on imposing restrictions and shifts from a goal of managing risks to decoupling, it could very well find itself out of step with Taiwan, and most likely with other like-minded partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Beijing has taken a variety of steps over the past two years to address the concerns of companies and investors, including from Taiwan, it has simultaneously increased military pressure against Taiwan, carried out an investigation into Taiwan’s potential violation of ECFA, and imposed a variety of tailored restrictions. At a minimum, these steps send a mixed signal to Taiwanese businesses and propel them to explore alternative opportunities. Beijing will need to adjust its policies if it wants to achieve progress on both political issues and economic ties. For Taipei, the survey results suggest that policy steps to radically expand restrictions against Mainland China would not be welcomed by local industry, which instead still sees China as an important location for production and a large market. The continued anxiety about a possible war and supply chain disruptions means Taipei still must work to reassure local industry about the island’s commercial environment and economic future. Strengthening business confidence is central to maintaining the island’s economic vibrancy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwanese-industry&quot;&gt;Taiwanese Industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-potential-canary-in-the-mine&quot;&gt;A Potential Canary in the Mine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views and actions of Taiwanese companies provide invaluable insights into both cross-strait relations and trends in the geoeconomic environment. Firms from Taiwan are deeply embedded in supply chains that traverse the West, the People’s Republic of China, and the Global South, operating along the most complex geostrategic fault lines in the world. Moreover, Taiwanese industry may be the “canary in the mine,” with its views and conduct providing a preview of how global industry may behave when faced with competing forces to either shift business away from China or stay put. On one hand, the growth of restrictive trade and investment policies, the rising possibility of military conflict, climate change, increasing labor costs, pandemic restrictions, and other risks have created pressures for firms to move from China to other locales. On the other hand, China’s large domestic market, its sophisticated infrastructure and manufacturing value chain, and its growing innovation ecosystem act as incentives for firms to remain there or even expand their footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational companies and financial institutions trying to assess their options, as well as policymakers attempting to evaluate the efficacy of their economic policies, will gain a deeper understanding of this landscape by examining the views and behavior of Taiwanese industry. Although trade and investment data and individual case studies are useful gauges, surveys provide an intermediate bridging tool, as they allow for the assessment of a large number of firms’ subjective evaluations of their circumstances, their actual behavior, and the factors shaping their future choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, on the eve of then U.S. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at CSIS conducted a formal survey of Taiwanese companies’ views and activity related to the international geostrategic environment. As a group, the polled companies believed that Taiwan was overdependent on China, and they were worried about a possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the consequences of China’s zero-Covid policies, and other risks. Many of those polled advocated for expanding Taiwan’s economic ties with the United States, becoming more involved in regional arrangements, and strengthening the island’s technological edge through greater research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and investments in human talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what most stood out was the high percentage of firms that already had begun to move some of their business from China (25.7 percent) or were considering doing so (33.2 percent). A smaller, yet surprising number also reported already moving some of their business from Taiwan (13.0 percent) or were considering doing so (20.8 percent). At the time, roughly two-thirds of those moving from either locale were shifting some of their operations to Southeast Asia. These levels of reported movement of operations far outstripped such activity by their American, European, and Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then the geostrategic environment has continued to evolve. In early 2023, China ended its zero-Covid policies and reopened to international travel. Around the same time, the United States and China took a range of steps to stabilize their relationship, including leadership summits in October 2022 and November 2023 and the launch of over a dozen bilateral dialogue mechanisms. In the process, the sense of imminent conflict in the Taiwan Strait receded, as the United States and China sought to reassure the other about their motivations and to clarify their red lines. It is in this somewhat less tense geostrategic context that the Trustee Chair conducted a second survey of Taiwanese firms in November 2023 to assess how companies’ views and behavior may have shifted during the intervening period. In addition to remeasuring their assessment of risks and coping strategies, a second survey could also evaluate whether steps by China to normalize inward and outward international travel and by Beijing and Washington to stabilize ties had any effect on firms’ intentions to move business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new survey was slightly modified from the original. There were fewer questions about the Covid-19 pandemic. In their place, new questions were added to more directly understand why companies would potentially move from Mainland China and Taiwan, and if so, how much of their operations they were moving. The survey also placed greater attention on the relevance of companies’ industries to more fully capture variation in patterns of views and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 1.1 shows, the average size and overall profitability levels of companies in the latest survey sample are similar to 2022, but firms in the new survey skew substantially younger. The proportion of firms with investment in China is slightly higher (61.6 percent compared to 60.8 percent), and the companies in the new survey depend somewhat more on the Mainland for their revenue than those polled in 2022. The 2023 survey has a somewhat higher percentage of firms in agriculture and industry but still has roughly 25 percent of firms in manufacturing, which is very similar to the island’s overall average. The size of the sample was increased intentionally (to 610 firms from 525) so that it would be more feasible to analyze how firms’ sectoral identity shapes their responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference in this year’s sample is that the proportion of respondents in favor of Taiwan’s independence was much lower, 13.9 percent compared to 23.2 percent. The general population’s support for independence did drop over the same period, with 3.8 percent in favor of immediate independence and 21.5 percent in favor of maintaining the status quo for the moment but eventually moving toward independence, but was still higher than this sample. In the 2022 survey, pro-independence respondents were more likely to favor moving their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the timing of this new survey — coming after a general stabilization in U.S.-China ties — and the skewing of the sample in a pro-unification direction would, all else being equal, suggest a lower proportion of companies would be moving their operations, whether from Mainland China or Taiwan. As will be explained below, the actual results indicate that a high proportion of Taiwanese companies are still moving. That said, it appears that the vast majority are engaged in one form or another of diversifying rather than fully decoupling their business from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next chapter of this report presents the key findings of the survey with regard to how Taiwanese companies evaluate the various geostrategic risks they face and how best to respond, both in terms of government policies as well as their own behavior. The third chapter delves further into Taiwanese firms’ decision to move operations from the Mainland and explores why they are more prone to move than their counterparts from elsewhere. The final chapter evaluates the policy implications for the various actors with a stake in these geopolitical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching conclusion from the latest survey is that although worries about the risks of doing business with China have modestly receded — in part due to the thaw in U.S.-China relations and the end of zero-Covid — anxieties remain high. As a result, companies still favor a variety of coping strategies, with an even higher proportion than in 2022 having already started to move some of their business out of Mainland China and Taiwan. As in the 2022 edition, the full survey and results are included in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Anxieties about China and international affairs remain high but have attenuated in a few ways, reflecting slightly less alarmist expectations about the likelihood of a U.S.-China military confrontation and a subtle shift in views regarding China’s Covid-19 policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable change is a drop in the proportion of those expecting a U.S.-China military conflict in the next five years, falling over 10 percentage points, from 38.7 percent to 28.2 percent (see Figure 2.1). At the same time, the proportion believing Taiwan’s semiconductor industry serves as a disincentive to Beijing to attack or as an incentive to the United States to come to Taiwan’s aid both fell somewhat, to slightly under half of those polled. Those who believe China’s zero-Covid policies had a negative impact on their business did not change — 45.7 percent in 2022 and 45.5 percent in 2023 — but the proportion who said zero-Covid had either a somewhat positive or very positive effect on their business rose from 15.0 percent to 24.3 percent, perhaps reflecting a reevaluation once the tensions of the moment had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Taiwanese companies seek to reduce dependence on China and expand cooperation with others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these continuing worries, the proportion of polled companies that believe Taiwan should reduce its dependence on China is still high. But the overall proportion that agree with this statement — either strongly or somewhat — fell almost 10 percentage points, from 76.3 percent to 66.9 percent (see Figure 2.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GKliDmE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.2: Taiwan Should Reduce Its Dependence on China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first approach to reducing dependence is to expand involvement in regional trade arrangements. As Figure 2.3 shows, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which regulates cross-strait commercial relations, is still regarded as the most important regional agreement for Taiwan; however, support for this view dropped substantially, to just over 21 percent. Evaluations of other major East Asia arrangements — the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional and Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) — are also still among the top tier but fell as well. Rising in the assessment are new arrangements such as the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), Taiwan’s own New Southbound Policy, and the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). DEPA was launched in 2020 and as of May 2024 had four members: Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. Taiwan’s interest ostensibly originates from the arrangement’s focus on issues central to the island’s economy and from the fact that efforts by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reach a new pact on digital trade have faltered. Interest in the New Southbound Policy, geared toward expanding ties with Southeast Asia, India, Australia, and New Zealand, also modestly rose. Finally, recognition of IPEF rose even though the prospects for Taiwan to formally join have been very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rWyrRc7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.3: Preferred Regional Arrangements.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component is to expand commercial ties with the United States. Although the United States and Taiwan recently successfully negotiated the first part of the Initiative on 21st-Century Trade, whose components mirror those in IPEF, Figure 2.4 shows that Taiwanese firms’ primary interest is still in three other arrangements. Leading the way is a formal bilateral trade agreement, but interest in that dropped somewhat (especially when ranked among the top three), likely because prospects for such a deal have remained low. Similarly strong support exists for two arrangements that have been in operation for some time, the Technology Trade and Investment Collaborative Framework and the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for a bilateral double-taxation agreement with the United States still does not rank as highly as other arrangements but did rise from 7.8 percent to 14.3 percent as the top option of respondents and increased to be among the top three, from 26.1 percent to 35.4 percent of respondents. Moreover, when specifically queried about a double-taxation agreement, a full 70 percent consider it important, with almost a quarter describing it as “extremely important” (23.0 percent), “fairly important” (24.9 percent), or “important” (22.1 percent). Only 7.4 percent said the agreement is “completely unimportant.” The Biden administration, Congress, and Taipei have made progress on creating parallel double-taxation measures, but final adoption, as of September 2024, is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Consensus solidified over the importance of offensive technology policies to maintain the island’s technological advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original 2022 survey, Taiwanese companies reported that the most important steps needed to protect Taiwan’s technology advantage were expanding R&amp;amp;D and nurturing a talented workforce. These “offensive” steps drew more support than “defensive” ones such as rigid export controls and investment restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new survey, these views were further strengthened. When asked how Taiwan should maintain its technological edge on China, 37.9 percent of respondents said that R&amp;amp;D in Taiwan should be expanded, compared to 35.4 percent in 2022 (see Figure 2.5). Jumping up to second, with 14.9 percent support, is expanding the number of university undergraduate and graduate students in science and technology (S&amp;amp;T). By contrast, support dropped for every kind of “defensive” policy meant to limit China’s access to technology — such as export controls on dual-use technology, inward investment restrictions, outward investment restrictions, and limits on Taiwanese working in Mainland Chinese high-tech companies — with each attracting just above 10 percent support. This sentiment is consistent with the respondents’ analysis, discussed further below, that one of the main constraints on their firms’ competitiveness is insufficient talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Tum4OZE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.5: How Should Taiwan Keep Its Technological Edge?&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. More Taiwanese companies are following through on their plans to move some operations from Mainland China and Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most surprising finding from the 2022 survey was the high percentage of companies that were considering moving or were actually starting to move some of their business from both Mainland China (58.9 percent) and Taiwan (33.8 percent). Despite the tempering of U.S.-China tensions and less alarmist worries about war, companies in the latest survey still report that they are considering or already moving, from both China (57.4 percent) and Taiwan (37.6 percent), as Figure 2.6 shows. The biggest shift is from thought to action, with a jump in actual moving from China (from 25.7 percent to 34.3 percent) and Taiwan (from 13.0 percent to 17.9 percent), indicating that the original consideration of moving was more than baseless speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a jump in those already moving, there was also a change in the pattern of destinations. In the original survey, over 63 percent of companies moving from China and 67.8 percent of companies moving from Taiwan were going to Southeast Asia, far more than any other location (see Figure 2.7). By contrast, by late 2023, companies reported that Southeast Asia was still their number one destination from China (50.9 percent) and Taiwan (48.9 percent), but by a smaller margin than before. For those moving from China, the second most common destination was, as in 2022, Taiwan. However, the third most common destination, and biggest change from 2022, was South and Central Asia, by which respondents most likely meant India. There was still interest in moving to Northeast Asia (South Korea and Japan), while North America, and Australia and New Zealand, still garnered low levels of interest. For those moving from Taiwan, there was a substantial jump in those moving to the Mainland, while South and Central Asia moved up to attract as much interest as Northeast Asia. And like those moving from Mainland China, there was still only limited interest in North America and in Australia and New Zealand. This suggests that large individual investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) fab in Phoenix, Arizona, are not being followed by a wave of other Taiwanese companies. By contrast, momentum to move to India has gained substantial steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide greater insight, the new edition of the survey also asked companies to indicate the proportion of their operations that they are considering or actually moving from the Mainland and Taiwan. As Figure 2.8 shows, the plurality (39.4 percent) of those in Mainland China are moving 26–50 percent of their business, and just over 30 percent of companies are moving 11–25 percent. Only 7.9 percent are moving the vast majority of their business (over 75 percent) out of China. For those leaving Taiwan, the data skews somewhat lower, with the plurality (36.7 percent) moving 11–25 percent, and 31 percent moving 26–50 percent. These are not insignificant portions of their business, but very few are leaving either locale outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BCz2YO1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.8: Shifting, Not Leaving: Proportion of Investment Being Moved from Mainland China and Taiwan to Elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some important insights to be gained by looking at the responses of different industries (see Figure 2.9). First, industries vary substantially in the share of firms with investment in China that are considering or actually moving. In five sectors (public administration, real estate, finance and insurance, human health and social work, and manufacturing), over two-thirds of firms are moving or considering doing so. In another 10 sectors, it is 50–60 percent of firms, and in four sectors it is less than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complete explanation for the variation across sectors awaits more refined statistical analysis, but there are a couple of findings that stand out at first glance. Sectors with firms that report China’s market is a relatively higher share of their overall revenue appear to move somewhat more of their operations than those less dependent on China. Additionally, in sectors where a higher proportion of firms report moving, they tend to be moving a slightly lower proportion of their business compared to sectors where a lower share of firms are moving. Put another way, in some sectors a high share of firms are moving, but they are moving less of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an important contrast in terms of destinations. Over half (52.8 percent) of firms in manufacturing are moving to Southeast Asia, whereas only 22.6 percent in that sector were returning to Taiwan. Other likely movers to Southeast Asia were in health and social work and hotel and food services, all services that could support the people who are in manufacturing firms. The most likely sectors to return to Taiwan were public administration, finance and insurance, and hotel and food services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in around 40 percent of sectors, firms most commonly were moving a moderate proportion of their operations (26–50 percent). In five sectors, firms were mainly moving 11–25 percent of their operations. And in another five industries, the proportion of operations that firms reported moving was widely distributed, with no one dominant pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yPuUH8f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.9: Industry Patterns of Moving from China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these broader patterns of shifting investment decisions, there are some distinctive regional patterns that suggest Taiwanese companies are pursuing a diversity of approaches. The largest plurality of companies are not moving at all, either from the Mainland or Taiwan. Of those that are moving, three groups are significant. The first is the group of 22 companies that are moving from China and Taiwan and going only to Southeast Asia. The second group is composed of 25 firms that are moving from both China and Taiwan to at least three other destinations. The final group is made up of 30 firms reporting that they are simultaneously moving only from Mainland China to Taiwan and from Taiwan to Mainland China. The “Southeast Asia movers” are focused on shifting production to a single locale; the “diversifiers” appear to be spreading risk across a range of regions; and the “cross-strait movers” appear to be reorganizing their production within the company, with a clearer delineation of their “China for China” activities in the PRC and their other activities directed for Taiwan and the rest of the world back on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader point is that although most companies are moving or planning to move their business, there is substantial variation in where they are moving to and how much of their operations they are moving. Understanding these patterns is aided by analyzing the reasons why companies are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-taiwanese-companies-are-moving&quot;&gt;Why Taiwanese Companies Are Moving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only surprising that such a high percentage of Taiwanese firms are moving from Mainland China and Taiwan despite the stabilization of U.S.-China relations, but that the inclination for Taiwanese firms to move is so much higher than for their counterparts from the United States, Europe, and Japan (see Figure 3.1). Whereas over 57 percent of Taiwanese companies are considering or already moving, just under a quarter of U.S. firms in China are, and only around 10 percent of European and Japanese firms report that they are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no direct evidence to explain why Taiwanese companies have a stronger propensity to move than their American, European, and Japanese counterparts. But we can evaluate what differentiates the Taiwanese firms that choose to move from those that do not, and then more closely analyze the various reasons for moving. This may then help provide insights across different investors in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to distinguish movers and non-movers is to compare their answers to other questions in the survey. These patterns are not necessarily statistically significant, because the potential effect of other factors is not simultaneously accounted for, but such “crosstabs” are nevertheless suggestive. The first survey from 2022 found that several factors — companies’ backgrounds, the Covid-19 pandemic, firms’ evaluation of the international economic situation, the respondents’ political leanings, and their views about security — were related to how likely they were to have considered or actually begun to move some of their business from China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the 2022 results, companies in manufacturing are more likely to have already moved than to either be just considering moving or have no plans to move (see Figure 3.2). A company’s current profitability does not appear to shape their relocation decisions. Unlike in 2022, however, older companies are now more likely to leave rather than younger firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at economic ties, while revenue reliance on China did not seem to matter in 2022, it does in the latest survey. Companies that depend more on China for their profits are less likely to move than those that are less dependent. A total of 69.2 percent of those who did not move generated more than 25 percent of their profits from China, while only 51.7 percent of those considering moving and 36.4 percent of those who have not moved depend on China for a quarter or more of their profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, those who already started moving strongly believe that the island should reduce its dependence on Mainland China. In short, while exposure to China may be synonymous with higher opportunity costs, fears of overdependence still shape relocation decisions. Finally, those who believe that Southeast Asia and India are sufficient substitutes for China were, as in 2022, more likely to have already started moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of political and security views did not change much between the two surveys. In 2023, 21.3 percent of those who moved away supported Taiwan’s independence, compared to 9.5 percent who were considering moving and 2.8 percent who were not moving at all. Moreover, companies that left were less concerned about China’s military action given Taiwan’s strength in semiconductors and were most likely to believe that the United States and others would provide military support in the event of a contingency for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the focus turns to reasons for moving from or staying in Taiwan, because the pandemic subsided in 2022, the 2023 survey did not ask how Covid-19 cases affected business or whether respondents were satisfied with Taiwan’s Covid-19 policies. Instead, as Figure 3.3 shows, basic company characteristics and views about the semiconductor industry mattered. Companies that are older, larger, and in manufacturing showed a greater propensity for moving. Unlike in the 2022 survey, the belief that Southeast Asia and India are sufficient substitutes for both Taiwan exports and investments with Mainland China now appears positively correlated with the decision to move from Taiwan. In addition, companies that believe Beijing is less likely to take military action because of Taiwan’s strong semiconductor industry were also more inclined to move. Respondents’ views about Taiwan independence, their companies’ relative dependence on China for revenue, and the likelihood of war in the next five years did not seem to differentiate movers and non-movers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5hBDgxc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more recent survey, from late 2023, went one step further and directly asked only those companies that are moving or considering moving to choose the top three reasons from a long list of reasons why. Although not posed to those who did not move at all, this approach lets firms themselves clearly explain their decision to move as opposed to looking for patterns between separate questions. As Figure 3.4 shows, this approach yields some similarities but also reveals some differences from the crosstabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jMbUqgB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.4: Why Companies Are Moving from China and Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of the top five reasons concern China’s business environment, including high labor costs, the possibility of supply chain disruptions, changing investment policies, and lack of policy transparency. Although Taiwanese firms are worried about the possibility of war, that ranked fourth among the various factors affecting their decision. At the other end of the spectrum, issues that were much less important included a general desire to diversify production or reduce ties with China, the need to follow others in the same supply chain, China’s Covid-19 policies, and reputational risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons firms gave for moving some business from Taiwan shared similarities with those moving from China but also revealed some differences. As with China, the top issue is the rising cost of labor. Other issues related to Taiwan’s business environment were also cited, such as the investment environment and the possibility of supply chain disruptions. By contrast, the fear of war vaulted to second place, cited by 37.1 percent of respondents as a reason to move from the island. At the other end of the spectrum, general reasons to diversify or follow other firms in one’s supply chain were cited much less often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Taiwanese firms seriously consider moving from either China or Taiwan when they believe it will make a tangible difference to their business and substantially reduce their risks, and not because of vague worries and fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diversifying-not-decoupling&quot;&gt;Diversifying, Not Decoupling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data reflect a high degree of anxiety among Taiwanese firms, and a substantial proportion are moving some of their operations from China and Taiwan as a result. That said, it does not appear that these adjustments add up to a plan to decouple from China by entirely rerouting their supply chains, or a complete loss of interest in the Mainland Chinese market. Instead, several signs point to these changes adding up to an effort to diversify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked how important various countries and regions are as economic partners for Taiwan, although the United States was most often identified as “extremely important” in both the 2022 and 2023 surveys, China’s position rose significantly in 2023. The proportion of those identifying China as an extremely important trading partner for Taiwan rose from 28.4 percent to 35.6 percent, placing it ahead of Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Europe (see Figure 4.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as noted earlier in Figure 2.3, Taiwanese businesses still see the ECFA deal with China as the single most important agreement for expanding their international business opportunities. And in 2023, the ECFA received almost as many mentions among the top three as the CPTPP and the RCEP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a belief that India and Southeast Asia could collectively be sufficient substitutes for trade and investment ties with China is still high, but has fallen, with those answering “strongly agree” falling from 20.8 percent to 17.4 percent and those answering “somewhat agree” dropping from 44.0 percent to 39.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UteTeHS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.1: Who Are Taiwan’s Important Trading Partners?&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the ways in which the firms are moving also do not point to decoupling as the primary motivation. As noted above, Taiwanese companies that are moving or considering moving are only shifting a portion of their operations from China, most often somewhere between a quarter and a half, with very few moving more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as previously mentioned, those moving display a range of regional patterns, each shaped by a distinctive rationale. Some firms are simultaneously moving some operations from China to Taiwan and from Taiwan to China, what the authors call “cross-strait reorganizers.” These firms appear to be relocating their business for China’s market entirely in China and their business for the rest of the world in Taiwan. Every company in this group believes that U.S.-China cooperation is in their interests. This group also appears more confident that Taiwan’s semiconductor industry would act as a “silicon shield” to deter Beijing from an attack but should there be a conflict, the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense. Those moving to multiple locations (“diversifiers”) also seem to be reshuffling their operations into a “China for China” strategy and “elsewhere for the world.” It is the “Southeast Asia movers” (those moving from China and Taiwan only to Southeast Asia) who are most concerned about the business environment on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and are adjusting accordingly, with companies in this group moving a higher proportion of their operations in China and Taiwan than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, actual cross-strait trade and investment is still quite high. There’s been a reduction in China’s dominance as a destination for outbound investment but very little change in the direction of trade, with China still being the destination for a quarter of Taiwan’s exports (see Figure 4.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these various pieces of evidence point to diversification but not abandonment of China as a location for production or as a market. Even with all of these changes, China is still an extremely important economic counterpart for Taiwan, substantially higher than the United States and far higher than Europe. There is little indication this reality will fundamentally change in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese industry’s anxieties about the geostrategic environment tempered slightly between mid-2022 and late 2023, yet there are still concerns about U.S.-China tensions, the possibility of war, and China’s business environment. As a result, Taiwanese companies advocate reducing dependence on China and expanding business ties with others in the region and beyond. As in 2022, Taiwanese companies are still moving some of their operations out of China and Taiwan, and they are doing so at a greater level than their counterparts from other countries. That said, they appear to be motivated by a desire to hedge their risks and diversify their regional and global production footprint, not outright decouple from China. Firms from the island still see China as a key economic partner and generally favor advancing their own capabilities instead of restricting ties as a method to handle the various security and competitive risks from across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for policymakers in Washington, Beijing, Taipei, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of similar risks, the U.S. government has launched a range of initiatives to address a list of economic security concerns, including dual-use technologies, supply chain resilience, economic coercion, and human rights abuses. At the same time, U.S. industry has slowed new investment into China, while adding incremental capacity in other locales. The data from these surveys suggest that although Taiwanese firms are moving at a higher rate, they broadly recognize that interdependence with China is impossible to fully eliminate, and that while “defensive” measures are necessary, so too are “offensive” steps to advance their own competitiveness. If Washington’s approach becomes overly focused on imposing restrictions and shifts from a goal of managing risks to decoupling, it could very well find itself out of step with Taiwan, and most likely with other like-minded partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications for Beijing are even more challenging. Although the Mainland’s zero-Covid policies are no longer a concern, Taiwanese firms still lack sufficient confidence in China’s business environment and are nervous about geostrategic tensions. Beijing has taken a variety of steps over the past two years to address the concerns of companies and investors, including from Taiwan. As a result of cross-strait political tensions, however, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan, while also carrying out an investigation into Taiwan’s potential violation of ECFA and imposing a variety of tailored restrictions. These steps at a minimum send a mixed signal to Taiwanese businesses and propel them to explore alternative opportunities. Beijing will need to adjust its policies if it wants to achieve progress on both political issues and economic ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Taipei, the survey results suggest that policy steps to radically expand restrictions would not be welcomed by local industry, which instead still sees China as an important location for production and a large market. Although the New Southbound Policy has borne some fruit in encouraging diversification of investment to Southeast Asia and India, further steps are needed to make these destinations more credible as long-term options for global business operations. Finally, the continued anxiety about a possible war and supply chain disruptions means Taipei still must work to reassure local industry about the island’s commercial environment and economic future. Strengthening their confidence is central to maintaining the island’s economic vibrancy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan encountered problems with overreliance on Chinese mineral supply chains over a decade ago, long before it became a critical issue for other countries. Following a territorial dispute in 2010, China implemented an export ban on rare earth elements (REEs) that specifically targeted Japan. This ban only lasted two months, but encouraged Japan to change its approach for key mineral-dependent industries and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s export controls on minerals needed for the green energy transition become more indiscriminate – exemplified by last year’s graphite restrictions – other countries can learn from Japan’s experience. Groups like the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) have prioritised alternative producers and processors, but there is also value in stockpiling. This approach could be particularly effective because China’s relative economic weakness means that it is unlikely to be willing or able to sustain onerous or lengthy export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that, despite all its efforts, Japan still gets more than half its REEs from China and remains heavily reliant on Chinese processing for other raw materials. Urgent action is required to reduce concentration risks, but China will nonetheless remain an important part of mineral supply chains for the foreseeable future. It should also be underlined that China is set to play a leading role in attempts to push forward recycling and technologies that reduce material reliance. Ongoing engagement with China is therefore imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-lessons&quot;&gt;Key Lessons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article sets out to profile four of Japan’s high-level responses to the REE export ban in 2010. Some of these responses, particularly stockpiling and diversification, could be mimicked easily by other countries. Importantly, these strategies are even more effective when adopted by alliances like the MSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Investing in alternative producers and processors:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese companies and investors have been instrumental in the emergence of Lynas, an Australia-based REE producer and processor. Similarly, they have supported the emergence of Malaysia as a major processor of REEs. They have also encouraged allies like the US to promote domestic REE production, such as at the Mount Pass facility. This initiative has enjoyed government-level support, but at a local level met opposition to mining operations that are seen as dirty and destructive in the US and developed democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Urgent action is required to reduce concentration risks, but China will nonetheless remain an important part of mineral supply chains for the foreseeable future&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan empowered the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security to act as a one-stop shop that coordinates the country’s minerals strategy. This has been instrumental in its diversification success, which has helped to reduce the proportion of the world’s REE mining that takes place in China from 95% to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China still accounts for nearly 90% of REE processing, underlining the limitations of the strategy and the importance of a holistic approach to supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Stockpiling:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan immediately started to stockpile REEs in 2010/11, and its experience underlines the need for consideration and coordination: Japanese companies were in such a rush to stockpile REEs both during and after China’s embargo that they exacerbated a price bubble that lasted for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, stockpiling can offer a good way to manage price spikes and resource scarcity (e.g. in the oil and gas markets). China has demonstrated its own capacity to stockpile critical minerals while prices are low. More recently, several countries have started to stockpile graphite and other critical minerals following China’s controls. Examples include the US’s National Defense Stockpile of various metals and South Korea’s expanded critical mineral stockpile. The UK is considering a strategic stockpile, and France is set to conduct a stockpile of mineral resources located domestically and in its overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpiling is most effective as a response to relatively short or limited trade disputes or supply chain disruptions. This is important because China’s economic fragility suggests that it may be unable to sustain trade disputes that have significant impacts on its core industries, including minerals and electric vehicles (EVs). So far, China’s controls on gallium and graphite have been closer to a skirmish than committed economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpiling would be more powerful still if groups like the MSP could work on shared stockpiles. This approach would also help to mitigate the risks to transition mineral supply chains outside China and/or those driven by external forces (such as climate impacts). It is therefore unfortunate that the EU appears to be walking back its plans to establish such stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Promoting technology alternatives that reduce material reliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan has attempted to develop technologies that use fewer REEs or alternative materials. It has also been more hesitant than the EU and US to increase reliance on Chinese supply chains for products like EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part for this reason, Japanese automakers have shown greater support than their counterparts for technologies like hydrogen. This has put them in a weak competitive position given the growing dominance of EVs and has left a gap for Chinese automakers to fill, particularly in servicing regional demand. Japan’s approach has therefore increased China’s control over EV supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this strategy would be more successful in collaboration with other countries. For example, replacing graphite with other anode materials (such as silicon, tin and lithium) or developing new battery technologies (such as solid state) will take time but is achievable in the next few years, particularly with concerted effort. But material substitution would take place faster if this concerted effort included China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Supporting recycling:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan has accelerated the development of technologies for recycling REEs and other key materials, but reuse is still very limited outside base metals like copper, nickel and steel. Recycling of REEs, for example, is unlikely to be commercialised until the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Engaging with China is just as important as reducing reliance on it, and the two approaches should not be mutually exclusive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other transition materials like lithium, cobalt and manganese face several significant barriers to recycling at scale, including technology shifts (such as in battery chemistry), price uncertainty for virgin material, lack of standardisation in battery design/construction processes, and lack of available feedstock at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, recycling can reduce reliance on China in the medium term (that is, post-2030) but not the short term. Again, China is currently leading the way with much of this technological development. Expanding recycling at the rate needed by global markets and standards will likely mean learning from China. This argues for greater engagement as well as concentration risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of transition mineral supply chains in China creates substantial risks for other economies and their green transitions. China can weaponise its control of these supply chains, but is unlikely to do so unprovoked. Engaging with China is therefore just as important as reducing reliance on it, and the two approaches should not be mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s experience can help other countries to get the balance right, but as ever, the devil is in the detail. Stockpiling is a particularly effective response given the nature of the risk posed by China’s dominance and in the context of its weak economy. As with other approaches, stockpiling is more effective when countries collaborate. But this should be framed to manage supply chain risks in general, rather than as a way of combatting Chinese control of transition minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of yet another strategic review – the third in just four years – presents an opportunity for the new government to outline a roadmap for securing the UK’s innovation ecosystem, a crucial backbone of its economic and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous strategic reviews outlined the UK government’s goal of becoming a technology superpower. Any advances in key areas of emerging and deep technology will undoubtedly require cultivating a thriving innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entails promoting research in a higher education sector that is experiencing profound financial challenges, supporting the commercialisation of research, and developing a more informed approach to industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is already easier said than done. However, in addition to these policy challenges, the UK also faces determined adversaries that are seeking to steal its intellectual property and otherwise disrupt its innovation ecosystem. Ensuring the security of the ecosystem and its resilience against these threats without stifling innovation is an epochal challenge for the UK government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-of-innovation-under-threat&quot;&gt;Security of Innovation Under Threat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological innovation is a key strategic battleground between great powers. Accordingly, organisations that are engaged in technological innovation will be targeted by well-resourced, persistent threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic espionage is not a novel phenomenon. However, Western governments are increasingly open in their assessment of the scale and breadth of China’s theft of innovative technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Organisations that have an IT-focused information security function may not have organisational policies and processes to address threats to physical, supply chain, personal and personnel security&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research institutions, university spinouts, startups and larger enterprises are all at risk. Greater public awareness of this issue has also increased the pressure on companies to address the threat. However, efforts to strengthen the security of some organisations have run into practical and cultural challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of technologies and companies considered relevant to national security, and therefore falling under the scope of UK government efforts to counter threats, is expanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organisations innovating in emerging technologies, which are often small startups and spinouts, are unfamiliar with security and do not have well-established connections with the security services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat extends beyond the comparatively familiar domain of cyber security. Organisations that have an IT-focused information security function may not have organisational policies and processes to address threats to physical, supply chain, personal and personnel security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also cultural challenges in introducing security controls in some institutions, not to mention opposition to working with government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-government-response&quot;&gt;The UK Government Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Security and Investment Act (NSIA) was enacted in the UK in 2021. The act provides the UK government with enhanced powers to scrutinise and intervene in business transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, over 17 sensitive areas of the economy that are relevant to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSIA is notable for the breadth of its coverage, permitting scrutiny of transactions in catch-all categories such as communications, defence and transport. Other categories cover entire fields of research and development, such as AI, quantum technologies and synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests that the startup ecosystem has not always appreciated the NSIA. There remains uncertainty among businesses over the scope and applicability of the act, likely leading to unnecessary delay in mergers and acquisitions. The impression that emerges is that both government and the private sector are finding their way at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the NSIA approval process is set out in a legally binding decision called a final order. In addition to prohibiting a proposed deal, or unwinding one that has taken place, these final orders can also impose conditions on the parties involved, pending the acceptance of which the deal can go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysing these final orders shows that, rather than blocking deals entirely, the government is increasingly using final orders to mandate changes in companies’ approach to security. These changes emphasise a holistic approach to protective security, with a focus on security governance, personnel security and vetting, and assurance functions. This suggests a direction of travel in terms of broader requirements for protective security for companies working in sensitive areas of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TYYcmwW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ NSIA Final Order Actions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government offers some support to industry through the National Protective Security Authority (NPSA), which focuses on economic security and the protection of science, technology and research. The NPSA runs a campaign called “Secure Innovation” that offers guidance to organisations operating in this space. An online survey allows organisations to assess their need for protective security, and the NPSA has also launched a pilot programme with UK Research and Innovation which covers some of the costs for companies seeking protective security assessments from a list of approved providers. This is a positive move towards a more collaborative approach to mitigating risks in this area, but still leaves the onus on companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-innovation-security&quot;&gt;The Future of Innovation Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more – and more diverse – organisations are asked to introduce security controls to protect their work, the ability of the UK government to provide guidance and support will be increasingly strained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenge is to promote the adoption of security controls in a way that does not stifle innovation or undermine the commercial viability of companies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are pockets of expertise and capability across the private sector and within public institutions such as universities, think tanks and research institutes. Nonetheless, given the UK government’s limited capacity to directly support companies at risk, there is a pressing need for the development of collective responses within industry. This will involve bringing together companies that address different aspects of security, such as cyber security and physical security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also challenges around security awareness and culture, and around the incentives of different actors. Companies operating in this highly competitive space are unlikely to spend on security measures unless the costs of not doing so are immediate and unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broad statements from government about the criticality of science and technology to national security may resonate with some individuals, but are unlikely to drive organisational behaviour in companies that do not already have a more mature security function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing organisational behaviour around security will likely involve the promotion of forums for sharing information and best practices. It will also involve recognising that this is a diverse and heterogeneous space with existing pockets of expertise and collaboration. The government should focus on building and supporting a system of systems, rather than attempting to impose a single body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to promote the adoption of security controls in a way that does not stifle innovation or undermine the commercial viability of companies. As with the security of academic research, such efforts also need to find a balance between the necessity of international collaboration and the need to protect sovereign capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it may take more high-profile company failures resulting from adversary actions before this issue gains significant attention, prompting companies to seek best practices and benchmarks to justify security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, it triggered an influx of material to Ukraine from Kyiv’s Western partners. This assistance enabled Ukraine to prevent Russia from toppling its government, but it also depleted Western stockpiles and pulled equipment out of service to be shipped to Ukraine. Replenishing these stockpiles with technologically updated material is not an easy task. Since the end of the Cold War, responding to governments’ demand levels, Western defence industries have shifted to just-in-time production models, reducing their output capacity. Meanwhile, many of the systems sent to Ukraine are legacy designs from the last century. Replacing them like-for-like would delay the necessary modernisation of Western forces and in many cases would not be feasible. As a result, industry and military planners face a dual challenge: they must decide how to meet immediate needs for restocking, while also enabling industry to develop new platforms that meet future battlefield requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war in Ukraine also rekindled the value of defence industrial independence in defence procurement policy circles. For instance, Germany was unable to supply ammunition for the Gepard tank as Swiss neutrality laws prevented Rheinmetall’s factory in Switzerland from exporting arms to Ukraine. This situation drew further attention to the need for indigenous supplies of critical products that the Covid-19 pandemic had already emphasised. Geopolitical factors have also heightened this concern. Donald Trump made US support within NATO conditional on increased European defence spending. This made European leaders wary of relying on US supply chains and encouraged them to prioritise spending on their domestic defence industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-risks-being-the-odd-one-out-in-the-long-term&quot;&gt;UK Risks being the “Odd One Out” in the Long Term&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has been pushing structured integration of its defence industrial base. The European Defence Fund (EDF) launched in 2021, and the European Defence Industrial Programme (EDIP) is under consultation in Brussels. The EDF endows research grants to consortiums of companies from at least three different EU member states, especially incentivising the inclusion of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Non-EU-based companies are excluded from the funding. Meanwhile, the annual work programmes are agreed across member states, necessitating requirement harmonisation that could make national European programmes more accessible to cross-EU industry. The EDIP will enact the EU’s defence industrial strategy that seeks to pool defence procurement with the aim that, by 2030, 40% of national defence procurement budgets go towards pan-European programmes. It also envisages that EU members will spend 50% of national procurement budgets within the EU. Thus, the two programmes aim to future-proof European industry by investing billions in research and development. This enables them to satisfy their European market through indigenous development and creates a level playing field with less national favouritism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The continental European market enjoys long-established links with UK industry and brings the benefit of working with the similar operational requirements of NATO’s eastern flank&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents a strategic challenge to the UK defence industrial base, which is at risk of becoming the “odd one out” between the biggest Western defence markets – Europe and the US. The EDF and EDIP and their likely successors will develop a more consolidated industrial base exclusive of UK industry and a more coherent domestic market landscape. Meanwhile, the UK defence industry is deeply intertwined with the continent. Airbus, Leonardo, Thales, MBDA and RBSL are examples. Sharing intellectual property from EDF initiatives will be complicated and so will the UK side’s access to European tendering. This presents a challenge for the highly integrated UK-European defence industrial landscape. Earlier negotiations on access to the EDF and PESCO led to no conclusions other than on PESCO’s Military Mobility project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the UK experience of cooperating with US programmes to keep and develop industry skills has been lukewarm. It managed to maintain key aerospace competence in the country through its cooperation with the US on the F35 striker as a junior partner, but it received less attractive workshares in the programme. Indeed, its relatively competitive effectors industry faces the challenge of being excluded from the programme, as the closed software architecture of the platform prevents effective integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bi--and-minilateral-cooperation-should-complement-structured-cooperation&quot;&gt;Bi- and Minilateral Cooperation Should Complement Structured Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government hopes to overcome this challenge through a series of “minilateral” collaborations on major projects, such as the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the US-Australian cooperation on nuclear submarines. The GCAP programme with Japan and Italy retains competency in airframe design and production and includes a dual software architecture allowing effector integration. This makes it more attractive for export markets with an existing effectors industry while boosting the participants’ own effectors industries’ exports to markets without one. Yet, the question remains to what extent these programmes can provide the UK defence industrial base with the necessary resources to not only maintain its current competencies but also develop its competitiveness. As the F35 has shown, the established links with the US bear the danger of being overpowered by the significant advantages of extensive resources and market potential that US industry enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continental European market enjoys long-established links with UK industry and brings the benefit of working with the similar operational requirements of NATO’s eastern flank. Yet, these links are at risk of being decoupled as the EU extensively funds research and, in the future, procurement from EU-based industry. Thus far, bilateral cooperation has been the UK’s preferred approach to remain connected with the continent. An example of this is the Lancaster House treaty with France, which served as a platform for deepening defence relations. The new Labour government seems eager to expand this approach, signing a joint declaration on “Enhanced Defence Cooperation” with Germany and envisioning a revised relationship with the EU. So, what opportunities lie ahead for the UK defence industrial base in such an expansion of ties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “low-hanging fruits” for UK-German cooperation are in the land domain sector. There is already an established legacy of successful cooperation with the M3 bridging capability, the modernisation of the Challenger 3 tanks as well as the UK’s embrace of Rheinmetall’s Boxer programme, encompassing various mechanised infantry variants and a 155mm howitzer on a Boxer basis. Thus, industry has already been intertwined in this sector, with the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) being the most visible example of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Franco-German ambition of a joint future tracked main ground combat system (MGCS) has seemed beset by handwringing. Industry and politicians had been upset about the workshare on the combat air equivalent, FCAS. Yet, this spring, MGCS regained momentum as both countries agreed on an equal distribution of work across eight capability pillars and set up a joint venture to manage the project. The bad news is that the programme is currently closed for potential partners. However, this will likely be reconsidered at some point during the conceptual stage: Italy has expressed interest in the project, while pressing ahead with Leonardo and Rheinmetall’s strategic partnership to develop a main battle tank. To reduce European platform diversity, this project will eventually have to be merged with MGCS, and it could provide Italy with the necessary arguments to gain a satisfactory workshare for Leonardo. It also seems unlikely – especially in the crowded tracked armour market of the 2040s (when these concepts are planned to be introduced), with likely new competition from India and South Korea – that the Franco-German project can afford to ignore important Northeast European markets for much longer. Thus, the established UK-German cooperation in the land sector may provide a longer-term entry route into the MGCS and set the stage for a strategic partnership on land systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UK military capabilities will have to play a significant part in long-term planning for European defence, even with Brexit and EU ambitions in that area&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aerospace sector, meanwhile, the fruits hang a little higher. Here, the continental FCAS and GCAP are fully established, and a reconsideration of the programmes’ compositions other than to include major exporting partners, such as Saudi Arabia, seems unlikely. This is because of the implied costs of including further requirements, language barriers and the diplomatic costs implied in any structural shake-up of either programme. Future related programmes concerning effectors and uncrewed wingmen concepts may be an area for cooperation, especially considering the high levels of cross-border industry integration in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, bi- and minilateral defence cooperation initiatives lack the strategic security that UK industry needs to maintain and develop its design and manufacturing capabilities. The uncertainty caused by the Strategic Defence Review over some key programmes underlines this point. Broader research and development investments ensure this competitiveness. National research programmes are fiscally limited and may struggle to access the continental expertise they have previously enjoyed. Labour’s more relaxed stance on the UK’s relationship with the EU might be an opportunity: over the next five years, the European Commission will be looking to reconsidering its current defence procurement policy instruments, as the EDF’s funding and the EDIP end in 2027. The UK government should re-explore the benefits of having a Norway-like role as a non-EU participant, not only to secure funding for innovation but also to enable industry to build on its extensive relationships with continental partners and, therefore, maintain access to that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical arguments for such a setup are strong. The European component of NATO must become less dependent on US capabilities as the long-term US commitment to the continent seems destined to fade independent of the short-term political outlook. UK military capabilities will have to play a significant part in long-term planning for European defence, even with Brexit and EU ambitions in that area. A UK attempt at access to EU structures may find some supporters within the Union: research on the priorities in the European programmes has shown a split between member states that prioritise NATO capability planning and those that prioritise national industrial concerns. With its thorough commitment to NATO and highly capable and Europe-oriented industry, a UK attempt at accessing European programmes may find partners in those European states that seek to adapt and augment NATO capabilities, rather than replicating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（3日）續處理參選新東的呂智恆和林景楠求情。代表呂智恆的大律師陳世傑，指呂在案中角色次要，從無意圖推翻政權、只是企圖阻礙運作，屬「其他參加者」。陳又呈上呂親撰的求情信，呂從小志向成為社工，但因本案而失去社工資格。求情信亦提到，呂參加初選為由人民授權行使否決權，以非常無奈和間接的方式罷免特首，望當權者回應民意；他當時無知相信議員行使否決權是合法，現已明白想法錯誤，深感後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，接受違反《國安法》須判處阻嚇性刑罰，但本案阻嚇性效果已是眾所周知，眾被告心靈受創，「我們現在需要的，是法庭判處『療癒式刑罰（healing sentence）』」，令被告和社會可從創傷中復原。罪成45名被告全部求情完畢，法官表示會另行通知判刑日期。原獲保釋的呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，還柙候判，他今早並在 Facebook 發布與養母 Elsa 的合照，表示：「期待在遙遠的那天重聚，大家珍重。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的楊岳橋、陳志全及范國威今無到庭，其餘6人分成三排就坐，由7名懲教人員看管。呂智恆穿米白色長袖裇衫，林景楠穿白裇衫、白口罩、深藍西裝外套。穿粉紅色裇衫、黑色西裝外套的林卓廷微笑向旁聽席揮手，穿軍綠色上衣的鄒家成，與女友以手勢交流。劉頴匡穿深藍色西裝和打深藍領帶，何桂藍綁短馬尾、穿白背心，坐下後與劉及鄒談天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呂角色次要因對法律無知犯案-屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：呂角色次要、因對法律無知犯案 屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表呂智恆的大律師陳世傑認為，呂屬刑期3年以下的「其他參加者」，指他在案中沒有主要角色，只是支援性質、頗為次要，對整個謀劃沒有任何重要或實質的貢獻。陳接納，呂競選時曾批評制度，但那是他為爭取選民支持而說的話。若法庭拒納，辯方亦望考慮呂為「積極參加者」較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又接納，呂同意無差別否決預算案的協議，但強調他只是企圖「阻撓」議會運作，從未企圖「推翻」政權；而否決預算案本身沒有違法，呂因對法律無知、真誠誤信合法而犯案，加上涉案謀劃不可能實現，望法庭給予及時認罪的呂，全數三分一刑期扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂撰求情信稱因本案失社工資格明白否決向政府施壓屬錯誤&quot;&gt;呂撰求情信稱因本案失社工資格、明白否決向政府施壓屬錯誤&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續呈上呂親撰的7頁求情信，呂提及成為社工是他從小志向，但因本案令他失去註冊社工的資格。呂來自破碎家庭，童年悲慘、受貧苦和孤獨所困，其父母離婚後撫養權歸父親，其後寄居不同人家中生活，直至被領養才頭一次獲得關心和愛護，生活慢慢改善。呂其後努力向上考入大學，成為全職社工貢獻社區，亦是一名虔誠的基督徒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續引述呂指，案發時受誤導，參與否決預算案的謀劃，以向政府施壓回應訴求，但現時已知道是錯誤，他深感後悔，承諾不會再犯。陳又指，呂在首次提堂後獲得保釋，自保釋以來，他珍惜其自由並更盡力幫助有需要的人，強調呂來自這樣的背景，能努力向上，有所作為，是值得讚揚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;求情信稱參選望當權者回應民意無知相信行使否決權合法&quot;&gt;求情信稱參選望當權者回應民意、無知相信行使否決權合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《獨媒》取得呂智恆求情信（全文見文末），呂提到成年後幾經挫折實現夢想成為社工，但終成為被告，永遠失去社工資格。他童年在不同人家寄居、曾被迫做童工和失學，至中四被領養，獲養母無私的愛和包容，終獲城大社工系取錄，老師莫慶聯激勵他立志「以生命影響生命」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂指，2008年畢業後成為社工，服務邊青，至2014年逐漸不覺可幫到街頭青少年，因學生時代察覺和倡議過的社福界制度問題在入職多年後全無改善。呂2018年入讀中大修讀基督教研究文學碩士，望尋找改變社會的答案，至2019年發生反修例引起的民主運動，心痛多人輕生、失蹤，深感這代青年絕望感遠超他童年所受痛苦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂續指，2020年疫情初期派防疫物資，深感市民無力，望當權者可回應民意，並形容他參加初選為了由人民授權行使否決權，「以非常無奈和間接的方式罷免特首，希望當權者回應民意」，沒有從政經驗和法律專業知識的他，當時無知地相信議員行使否決權是合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂指，自保釋後數年經常失眠和感到巨大壓力，他現已明白否決預算案對政權帶來衝擊和影響運作是錯誤想法，感到後悔抱歉。呂指保釋期間小心遵守保釋條件，珍惜平凡生活的時光，想到即將入獄增家人負擔，萬分痛苦和歉疚，日後定會想起曾服務的小學生、露宿者等，亦相信常與養母唱詩歌是日後最珍貴和暖心的回憶。呂最後指，最喜歡電視劇《秘密森林》的對白「請堅信一絲希望，勝過無數絕望」，他深知罪名嚴重，不敢低估刑期，但會心存盼望，望未來報答親恩和服務弱勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方本案阻嚇效果眾所周知-法庭現需判處療癒式刑罰&quot;&gt;辯方：本案阻嚇效果眾所周知 法庭現需判處「療癒式刑罰」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑指，呂十分善良，是一個好人，他是具天真理念的政治新人，對社區有深厚貢獻，望法庭判刑時能展示「憐憫」，令呂可盡快重投社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳最後指，接受任何違反《國安法》的行為須判處阻嚇性刑罰，但本案的阻嚇性效果已是眾所周知，「我們現在需要的，是法庭判處『療癒式刑罰（healing sentence）』」，因所有被告心靈飽受創傷（spiritually broken），是時候療癒。陳重申，望法庭判處「療癒式刑罰」，讓被告可以從此創傷中復原（healed from this trauma），社會亦同樣需要復原。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告求情完畢，呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，即時還柙，林景楠則繼續以原有條件保釋。法官陳慶偉表示，當有決定後會再通知各方判刑日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（3日）續處理參選新東的呂智恆和林景楠求情。林景楠一方望法庭考慮他遲參選、無簽「墨落無悔」等，參與程度低而視為「其他參加者」，又指林錄取口供和成為控方證人，其證供有用，可獲50%減刑，並望為林索取社會服務令報告。法官庭上多次質疑，指林僅在證供提及出席沈旭暉主持的協調會議，但沈並非本案共謀者、亦無因此被捕；法庭在裁決時也完全無依賴林的證供。對於辯方望索社服令報告，法官亦指是不現實、不合理，拒絕辯方要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出林景楠親撰的求情信節錄，林提到候審時通過接觸不同觀點的資訊，明白當初參選是「非常幼稚及愚蠢」的行為，「中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀」，又引述國家主席習近平七一講話，指深切反思後發現很多港人包括自己，一直受到海外勢力或網絡傳媒渲染，間接成為反中亂港一分子。林主動聯絡警方認罪，感謝控方讓他成為證人，讓他可把所知所聞一一供出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最後真誠向中央、特區政府及所有受影響市民真誠道歉，望法庭讓他履行作為父親的責任，陪伴三個子女成長，及予他機會，重新投入中港泰三地，用實際行動抓住香港由治及興的機會，說好香港和國家故事，促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。罪成45名被告求情完畢，法官押後通知判刑日期。呂智恆撤銷保釋還柙，林景楠則准續保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林景楠遲參選無簽墨落屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：林景楠遲參選、無簽「墨落」屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林景楠的大律師范凱傑認為，林屬於刑期分級制最低程度的「其他參加者」，指他並非組織者，不曾出席協調會議和初選記者會，也沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，是初選的「遲到者（latecomer）」，與大部分其他被告不同，他於6月尾才參加初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林證供有用可獲減刑-官屢質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指林證供有用可獲減刑 官屢質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續指，林對警方的協助，可根據《國安法》33條獲得減刑，並呈上林於2023年錄取的兩份無損權益口供，指林以控方證人身分作供，指證其他串謀者，其證供有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指兩份證供主要談及林本人對初選的參與，問哪部分談及其他人參與。劉頴匡一度望向鄒家成點頭發笑。范指提到沈旭暉，惟李運騰指，沈並非本案共謀者，林景楠雖稱曾參與沈舉行的協調會議，但「那不是串謀的一部分，不是『35+計劃』的一部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nR2tBXb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 沈旭暉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范再指，林的證供亦指證其他串謀者，包括區諾軒和趙家賢。法官李運騰反問，有任何爭議區是組織者之一嗎？法官陳仲衡亦問，辯方是否說區諾軒和趙家賢認罪是因為林的證供？范否認。李運騰續指，林證供唯一提到區諾軒的地方，是林發現已錯過初選的報名日期，並因知道區和趙是組織者，故聯絡區望讓他可參與，獲區回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林指證沈旭暉-惟認資料無致沈被捕&quot;&gt;辯方指林指證沈旭暉 惟認資料無致沈被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范同意，指林證供的有用性，在於談及參加者如何參與串謀和初選，並在法官追問下，再指林為警方提供情報（intelligence），提及沈旭暉的參與。惟法官李運騰再指，沈無被指控為本案共謀者，問此資料有否導致警方拘捕或任何事情發生，范答沒有，被告欄的林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後說，「你看，你要求50%減刑，50%是很多」，法官李運騰亦指，困難是沈旭暉並非本案共謀者，辯方基本上是叫法庭就有關一宗懷疑的事件（suspected event）、而非林認罪的案件的資料而減刑。范指沒有補充，強調林庭上是就他真實所知而作供。林景楠聽到相關對答時，數度搖頭，又低頭望地下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林求情信受渲染成反中亂港一分子-參選乃中別有用心人士計謀&quot;&gt;林求情信：受渲染成反中亂港一分子 參選乃中別有用心人士計謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後讀出林求情信「由不認罪到認罪的轉變」下的內容（求情信節錄全文見文末），提到被捕後他一直未認清真相、不明白初選對社會的負面影響，但候審期間「通過接觸其他朋友不同觀點的資訊和評論」，明白到當初參選是「非常幼稚及愚蠢的行為」，只是令社會更撕裂和混亂，甚至造成危害國安的後果。林又指，認識到參選令特首可能下台，「其實是中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀」，他作為「黃色經濟圈領頭者」亦深深悔疚和反省，認為自己要為社會撕裂負上責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林又引述國家主席習近平2022年七一講話，指「香港不能亂也亂不起」，林自言聽到此「呼喚」，深切反思後發現很多港人包括自己，「一直受到很多海外勢力或網絡傳媒的渲染，間接成為反中亂港的一分子。」林指因此他主動聯絡國安處認罪，感謝控方讓他成為證人，「讓我可以把我的所知所聞一一供出」，展現真誠認罪。辯方讀出求情信時，劉頴匡一直點頭，林景楠則一度低頭俯身。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林成為證人對家人及生意構成巨大壓力&quot;&gt;辯方：林成為證人對家人及生意構成巨大壓力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，林景楠引述習近平2022年7月1日的講話，但在數個月後，於2023年1月才表示願成為控方證人。辯方同意，指求情信提及林為何如此遲認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范又指，在公眾知道林或會成為控方證人後，對其生意和家人構成巨大壓力，並呈上阿布泰被公眾破壞等新聞片段。李運騰追問有無證據林作供令他或家人面對風險，范指有，重申有公眾破壞其店舖，部分被捕及被控；林亦因安全考慮，安排家人搬到泰國居住，望法庭考慮林成為控方證人有重大的負面影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林曾參與課程認識國安疫情進行慈善工作&quot;&gt;辯方：林曾參與課程認識國安、疫情進行慈善工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續指，在林改變主意成為控方證人後，曾參與課程認識國安，希望知道中國公民在港的義務，以及他作為公民維護國安的責任。而在疫情期間，林景楠的公司阿布泰曾為港人和海外人士提供大量醫療物品和資源，望法庭考慮其良好品格、慈善工作而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林望陪伴三子女成長向中央特區政府道歉&quot;&gt;林望陪伴三子女成長、向中央特區政府道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續讀出求情信最後，提到林知道罪行非常嚴重，望法庭讓他履行作為父親的責任，照顧三位小朋友及家人，陪伴他們成長。他也望法庭予他機會，重新投入中港泰三地用實際行動抓住香港由治及興的機會，說好香港和國家故事，促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。他最後向中央和特區政府，尤其海關、警方和所有被他影響的市民朋友真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，求情信顯示林對所有受他錯誤行為影響的人的真誠道歉，顯示他真誠的後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望索社服令報告-官明言拒絕&quot;&gt;辯方望索社服令報告 官明言拒絕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，不論現實與否，望法庭能考慮在判刑前，為林景楠索取社會服務令報告。法官陳仲衡即指，認為辯方應向法庭就判刑量，而非判刑的方式陳詞（“I think you should address us on the quantum of sentence, not the form of sentence.”）。范回應，明白或要向法庭就判刑量陳詞，但仍希望在法律的界線內，判刑越寬大越好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，認為辯方要求「有點不現實（a bit unrealistic）」，亦不是妥善運用公眾資源，又認為辯方有很大的難處說服法庭，索取社服令報告是妥當。法官陳慶偉也向范說：「要求一個過於寬鬆的刑罰，是對你當事人的損害。（“Asking for a too lenient sentence, is doing a disservice to your client.”）」林卓廷聞言再發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范指，望法庭考慮《國安法》22條，法官陳慶偉指他讀過很多次，知道「其他參加者」可拘役或者管制。法官陳仲衡問，辯方是否仍要求索社服令報告，范回應他的指示是，法官陳慶偉即身體傾前，手指着范大聲說：「讓我告訴你，Mr. Fan，那已被拒絕。（“Let me say to you, Mr. Fan, that is refused.”）」法官陳仲衡也說：「你在三位法官前作出一個如此不合理的要求，是三重不合理。（“An unreasonable request like the one you are making before a bench of 3 judges, triples the unreasonableness.”）」林卓廷聞言呵呵發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范欲繼續陳詞，法官李運騰表明，本案太嚴重，已清楚表明法庭不會傾向索取社服令報告。法官陳慶偉笑說：「他（李）很有禮貌，他說『傾向』」，並指自己剛處理入屋犯法（burglary）案，案例中只有最特殊的情況才會可判社服令，而「那是一個入屋犯法案，這不是一個入屋犯法案」，「不要要求不可能的事，拜託。（“Don’t ask for the impossible, please.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指林開審始認罪僅減20判詞無依賴林證供&quot;&gt;官指林開審始認罪僅減20%、判詞無依賴林證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范最後指，認為林屬「其他參加者」的最低程度。法官陳慶偉指，林只是於開審當天才認罪，根據案例只能減刑20%。法官李運騰亦指，即使考慮林的證供有用，法庭仍有酌情權考慮是否降低其刑罰等級；但辯方會留意到，法庭在裁決理由完全沒有依賴林景楠的證供，辯方同意。雙方對答期間，林景楠一度低頭俯身良久。散庭後，他走到庭外角落，背對在場人士以手揹拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告求情完畢，呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，即時還柙，林景楠則繼續以原有條件保釋。得悉呂的決定後，林景楠一度向呂微笑點頭。法官陳慶偉表示，當有決定後會再通知各方判刑日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;庭上讀出的林景楠求情信節錄&quot;&gt;庭上讀出的林景楠求情信節錄：&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021年1月，因本案被捕後，我一直未認清真相，沒有意識到參加初選的嚴重性，不明白初選的舉行對社會帶來的嚴重負面影響。我在等候審訊期間，通過接觸其他朋友不同觀點的資訊和評論，透過反覆論證，明白到自己當初參加初選是非常幼稚及愚蠢的行為，其效果不會令香港這個社會變得更好，而只是會令到社會更加撕裂和混亂，甚至乎會造成危國家安全的後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認識到我參與初選而最終可能會令到行政長官下台，其實是中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀，我更加認識到作為一名商人，應該努力透過國家的支持和經濟聯繫，使香港的經濟更加繁榮和社會更加發展，而不是參與政治裡面，企圖令香港成為反中分子的基地。透過深切的自我反省，我意識到自2019年起，社會上的撕裂我確實要負上不少責任，因為我是黃色經濟圈的領頭者，我深深悔疚和反省。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2022年7月1日，國家主席習近平在七一講話中提到，「香港不能亂也亂不起，更深感香港發展不能再耽擱，要排除一切干擾聚精會神謀發展。香港居民，不管從事什麼職業、信奉什麼理念，只要真心擁護「一國兩制」方針，只要熱愛香港這個家園，只要遵守基本法和特別行政區法律，都是建設香港的積極力量，都可以出一分力、作一份貢獻。」簡單來說，就是團結一切可以團結的人，我正如聽到這個呼喚，深切反思過去所做的一切，發現很多香港人包括我自己，一直受到很多海外勢力或網絡傳媒的渲染，間接成為反中亂港的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因為以上的反省，所以我主動聯絡警方國安處希望認罪，因為認罪才是最真誠的認錯，讓我可以在日後繼續為社會、為國家作貢獻。我亦感謝控方讓我成為證人，讓我可以把我的所知所聞一一供出。雖然因為我在比較後期才參加此初選，參與程度較低，但我仍選擇把所知所聞一一說出，希望展現我真誠的認罪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我知道顛覆國家政權是非常嚴重的罪行，但我希望法庭能寬大考慮，讓我履行作為父親的責任，照顧三位小朋友及家人，陪伴他們成長。我希望法庭考慮我是初犯，我坦白承認罪行，及我在案中參與程度較低給予機會，讓我重新投入中港泰三地用實際行動抓住香港由治及興、疫情與世界接軌的機會，說好香港故事，說好國家故事，繼續促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。最後我希望在此求情信的結尾，向中央政府、特區政府，尤其是香港海關和香港警隊以及所有被我影響到的市民朋友真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

Russia’s dirty bomb signaling in the fall of 2022 is an important reminder about the threat of nuclear escalation in regional conflicts involving U.S. partners or allies.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The scare also highlights an enduring feature of nuclear crises: uncertainty about adversary intentions. To prepare for the next nuclear crisis and the uncertainty that it will entail, the United States should develop detailed plans for a wide range of nuclear contingences, including those short of nuclear use. A close examination of Russia’s dirty bomb signaling in October 2022 offers three principles for doing so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fall 2022, the United States faced what may have been its most dangerous nuclear crisis in decades. Confronted by intensifying Russian nuclear rhetoric and intercepted conversations about nuclear use in the Russian military, Western leaders were deeply worried about escalation risks. President Biden warned that Putin was “not joking . . . about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,” and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan asserted that the United States took the threat of nuclear use “deadly seriously.” Behind closed doors, the United States and its allies urgently planned for a Russian nuclear strike. Of particular concern were Russia’s dirty bomb claims. At the end of October, amid a string of battlefield setbacks, senior Russian military and political leaders began a coordinated messaging effort claiming that Ukraine planned to use a dirty bomb. U.S. officials worried that this narrative was an effort to establish a pretext for nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident illustrates a critical and unresolved challenge: nuclear crises are likely to continue, and the United States will be forced to respond to cryptic signals and escalatory rhetoric with imperfect information. Even today, the true purpose of Russia’s dirty bomb claims remains unclear. While Russian signaling may have been related to planned nuclear use, there are a variety of other plausible explanations, including that the narrative aimed to sway domestic audiences or reflected genuine Russian concerns. U.S. policymakers have faced uncertainty in past crises, but the ambiguity that they faced in October 2022 was fundamentally different. Whereas U.S. leaders have often broadly understood the adversary’s objectives and the connection between the adversary’s signaling and those objectives, in October 2022, U.S. leaders were unsure how the dirty bomb narrative connected to the Kremlin’s broader objectives in Ukraine or whether it was even intended as a nuclear signal. As tensions with nuclear rivals persist, the United States may face similarly ambiguous signaling in future crises over areas such as the Taiwan Strait, Korean Peninsula, or Eastern Europe. This uncertainty is increasingly likely due to U.S. adversaries’ growing reliance on nuclear threats, the sometimes confusing nature of their signaling, and the challenges that the United States faces in collecting intelligence about their decisionmaking. The United States should therefore prepare for future crises by developing plans for a wide range of nuclear contingencies, including those short of nuclear use. An analysis of the October 2022 crisis offers three guiding principles for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This incident illustrates a critical and unresolved challenge: nuclear crises are likely to continue, and the United States will be forced to respond to cryptic signals and escalatory rhetoric with imperfect information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuclear-signaling-in-the-ukraine-war&quot;&gt;Nuclear Signaling in the Ukraine War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues recently published a study cataloguing and analyzing Russian and NATO statements about nuclear weapons during the first 18 months of the war in Ukraine. The study found that Russia’s nuclear signaling initially focused on deterring direct Western intervention in Ukraine. Putin issued the first threat against Western intervention in his February 24 announcement of the “special military operation in Ukraine,” and he and other Kremlin officials echoed the threat in the following weeks. Russian officials often warned broadly against “interference” in the war and made repeated, ambiguous references to Russia’s nuclear doctrine writ large but were generally clear that direct Western intervention in Ukraine would likely prompt a nuclear response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian signaling changed in two important ways in the early fall of 2022. Beginning in September, Russian officials warned that Russia could use nuclear weapons to defend annexed Ukrainian territory. The motivation for these threats was unclear. Some analysts assessed that the Kremlin sought to deter Ukrainian counteroffensives, but this rhetoric instead may have been related to efforts to legitimize the annexation referendums that Putin announced on September 21. Also in September, Russian officials began warning about nuclear risks created by Western aid to Ukraine. Russian officials specifically targeted the U.S. supplying of long-range missiles to Ukraine, warning that the delivery of those weapons would cross a “red line” and make the United States a party to the conflict. Other officials cautioned more broadly against continued military aid for Ukraine and the risk such aid carried, namely direct conflict between the two nuclear powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;six-days-in-october&quot;&gt;Six Days in October&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian signaling took a dramatic shift in late October 2022. Russian state media reported that Ukraine was close to completing work on a dirty bomb, whose use would enable Ukraine to accuse Russia of using a nuclear weapon and thereby “trigger a powerful anti-Russian movement in the world aimed at undermining trust in Moscow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These accusations followed a series of Russian battlefield setbacks over the preceding two months. In late August, Ukraine launched an offensive to liberate Kherson Oblast, including Kherson City — the most populous and economically significant prize that Putin had captured in his invasion. This push made slow progress but put Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River in an increasingly precarious position as the fall progressed. In early September, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive in Kharkiv Oblast that made rapid gains, having caught Russian forces off guard. Beyond retaking territory — which Russia claimed as its own on September 30 — Ukraine’s push in the south threatened to trap approximately 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond retaking territory — which Russia claimed as its own on September 30 — Ukraine’s push in the south threatened to trap approximately 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By October 22, Ukrainian gains in Kharkiv had slowed and Russian forces had begun to withdraw across the Dnipro, though it remained unclear whether they would be able to complete the evacuation in good order. It was in this context that Kremlin officials began to warn about a Ukrainian dirty bomb. What follows is a brief chronology of these warnings from their introduction on October 23 to their conclusion on October 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-23&quot;&gt;October 23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 23, the same day that Russian state media first reported Ukraine’s dirty bomb plans, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu called his U.S., UK, French, and Turkish counterparts to discuss the alleged threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly following Shoigu’s calls, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France rejected Russia’s claims in a P3 foreign ministers statement: “Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-24&quot;&gt;October 24&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, October 24, Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov called his U.S. and UK counterparts to discuss the alleged threat. Separately, the chairman of the lower house of the Duma posted on Telegram that Ukraine’s supporters were sponsors of nuclear terrorism. Russia’s UN ambassador wrote a letter to the UN secretary general warning that Russia would view Ukraine’s use of a dirty bomb as an act of “nuclear terrorism.” The head of Russia’s radiological, biological, and chemical defense forces, meanwhile, delivered a briefing in which he stated that Russian forces were preparing to operate in a radioactive environment. In response to the P3 statement the day prior, presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted that the dirty bomb threat was real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western officials continued to reject Russian officials’ claims. State Department spokesperson Ned Price described the claims as a pretext for escalation, and NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg cautioned that Russian claims could signal preparations for a false flag attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-25&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Western officials’ continued rejection of the dirty bomb narrative, Peskov and Russia’s ambassador to the United States reiterated Russia’s claims and criticized the West’s response to Russian warnings as “far from serious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to a reporter’s question about whether Putin was preparing to use a dirty bomb, Biden warned that it would be an “incredibly serious mistake” to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-26&quot;&gt;October 26&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin echoed the dirty bomb claims during an October 26 meeting of security and intelligence heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Earlier in the day, he had overseen Russia’s annual Grom nuclear drill, which simulated the delivery of a “massive” nuclear strike and involved the launch of an SLBM and an ICBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same day, Shoigu called his Indian and Chinese counterparts to discuss the alleged dirty bomb threat. India’s defense minister, Rajnath Singh, warned Shoigu that neither side should resort to using nuclear or radiological weapons, since their use would violate “the basic tenets of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking with reporters, Stoltenberg asserted that Russian leaders understood there would be “severe consequences” for nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-27&quot;&gt;October 27&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin reiterated his claims that Ukraine would use a bomb to accuse Russia of detonating a nuclear weapon at an October 27 meeting of the Valdai Club. At the same time, he asserted that Russia did not need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, saying “there is no sense in it for us, neither political nor military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin, speaking at a press conference, explained that the United States was concerned about escalation in Ukraine and warned that nuclear use would be met with a “very significant response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-28&quot;&gt;October 28&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations — Dmitry Polyansky — issued the last explicit warning about a Ukrainian dirty bomb on October 28, asserting that Ukraine sought to use the bomb to trigger direct Western intervention in Ukraine. Russia’s warnings about an imminent Ukrainian dirty bomb attack then abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;denouement&quot;&gt;Denouement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next statement by a senior Russian official about nuclear risks came on November 1, when Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Telegram that Ukraine’s declared aim of liberating all of its occupied territory posed a threat to the existence of the Russian state. The following day the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on preventing nuclear war, which reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to avoiding nuclear war and called on the five permanent members of the UN Security council to cease “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces successfully completed their withdrawal from Kherson City on November 9. While Russian officials have occasionally referenced the possibility of Ukraine building a dirty bomb since October 28, these statements have lacked the urgency and coordination that characterized Russia’s October warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-nuclear-close-call&quot;&gt;A Nuclear Close Call?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. officials dismissed Russia’s dirty bomb claims as an effort to establish a pretext for nuclear use, they appeared uncertain of the narrative’s true purpose. Biden, for example, admitted on October 25 that he did not know the purpose of the narrative, saying “I’m not guaranteeing you that it’s a false flag operation yet. I don’t know.” Subsequent reporting about the crisis also pointed to confusion about the rationale for the narrative. The New York Times and CNN’s Jim Sciutto both wrote that some officials were concerned that the narrative could have been a pretext for nuclear use or as preparation for a false flag, suggesting that there was no consensus on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, one can identify at least five plausible explanations for Russia’s dirty bomb signaling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation for nuclear use:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin was considering or had already decided to use nuclear weapons in October 2022 and sought to use dirty bomb claims to establish a pretext.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coercive threat:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin intended the dirty bomb narrative as a veiled nuclear threat to influence the behavior of Ukraine and its Western backers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincere belief:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin and Russian national security officials genuinely believed that Ukraine might use a dirty bomb and sought to deny Ukraine a pretext, generate international pressure against the threat, and turn global opinion against Ukraine and its Western supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic signaling:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin sought to use the threat of a dirty bomb to instill fear in the Russian population and thereby boost support for the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin sought to use dirty bomb claims to distract from other military or political activity in which Russia was concurrently engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these explanations are mutually compatible and it is impossible to definitively determine which are relevant from open sources. Nonetheless, some explanations are stronger than others. The “preparation for nuclear use” and “sincere belief” explanations, for example, both align with much of the available evidence, including public statements and international outreach about a dirty bomb and Russia’s announcement of preparations to operate on a radioactive battlefield. The “coercive threat” explanation, on the other hand, is comparatively weaker; the dirty bomb narrative did not feature clear threats or demands and U.S. officials did not observe any unusual movements of Russia’s nuclear forces — behavior that one might expect if the Kremlin sought to credibly threaten nuclear escalation. While it is more difficult to assess the “distraction” and “domestic signaling” explanations from open sources, the latter has historical precedent. Putin has fabricated foreign threats to rally support for his wars in the past and had planned to do so to justify his invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crisis-management-under-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Crisis Management under Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 2022 crisis underscores an enduring dilemma the United States is likely to face in future nuclear crises: how to make decisions about escalation and de-escalation based on ambiguous signals from adversaries. While uncertainty is not new for U.S. policymakers, in October 2022, the Biden administration fundamentally did not understand if or how the dirty bomb narrative related to the Kremlin’s broader objectives in Ukraine or if it was intended as a nuclear signal. The causes for this unusual degree of ambiguity are not fully clear, but heightened nuclear tensions and sustained Russian nuclear signaling in the weeks and months prior were important pieces of context that muddied the waters and raised questions about the purpose of subsequent Russian narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and the looming threat of conflicts in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula point to the risk of another nuclear crisis in the coming years. Given the growing frequency with which key U.S. adversaries rattle the nuclear saber, the sometimes ambiguous nature of their signaling, and the difficulties that the United States faces in collecting intelligence about their decisionmaking, U.S. leaders should prepare to navigate future nuclear crises with limited understandings of adversary intentions and objectives. The context and specifics of future crises will differ but, as in October 2022, there will be a range of plausible explanations for adversary signaling. Given this, three principles apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Continued tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and the looming threat of conflicts in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula point to the risk of another nuclear crisis in the coming years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beware-inadvertent-escalation&quot;&gt;Beware Inadvertent Escalation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When facing uncertainty about the motivations for adversary nuclear rhetoric or posturing, U.S. leaders should refrain from actions that the adversary may misinterpret and respond to with escalation. Measures that the United States has taken to demonstrate resolve in past crises, such as bomber patrols, alerts, and missile tests, can carry unseen risks when the adversary’s motivations are unknown. If, for example, an adversary’s nuclear signaling is driven by concerns about U.S. or allied intentions, they may interpret U.S. nuclear posturing as confirmation that that an attack is imminent. The United States’ response to Russia’s dirty bomb allegations consisted almost entirely of verbal statements and back-channel diplomacy, thus avoiding actions that could have provoked inadvertent escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-adversary-can-be-wrong&quot;&gt;The Adversary Can Be Wrong&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to assume the worst when faced with deep uncertainty about adversaries’ intentions. U.S. leaders should keep in mind that U.S. adversaries are fallible, and that their confusing behavior might be the product of faulty assumptions or poor information. The dirty bomb scare may have reflected sincere concern on the part of Russia’s leaders resulting from flawed intelligence; it is impossible to be sure. U.S. policymakers should resist the urge to interpret adversary rhetoric and posturing through the lens of worst-case thinking and should consider all possible explanations when weighing how to respond to ambiguous signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-is-cheap&quot;&gt;Diplomacy Is Cheap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building international pressure against nuclear use is a relatively cheap, risk-free tool to pressure adversaries to either de-escalate or clarify their signaling. The United States made good use of this tool during the October 2022 crisis, when it encouraged India and China to publicly oppose nuclear use in Ukraine. U.S. officials later asserted that Indian and Chinese pressure helped to deter Putin from using nuclear weapons. Going forward, diplomatic outreach to influential third parties should be a tool of first resort during periods of heightened nuclear risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-for-the-next-nuclear-crisis&quot;&gt;Preparing for the Next Nuclear Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To crystallize the lessons of the October 2022 crisis, the incoming administration should establish an interagency planning group — modeled after the Ukraine Tiger Team created in 2021 — to game out whole-of-government responses to a wide range of nuclear contingencies. The group should consider potential crises in both the Indo-Pacific and Eastern Europe, and should plan for scenarios short of nuclear use, including periods of acute nuclear tension and ambiguous adversary signaling. Further, the group should consider the challenges posed by opportunistic aggression and plan out responses to scenarios involving multiple simultaneous or successive nuclear crises across different theaters. Given that future nuclear crises will almost certainly involve allied forces, territory, or interests, it will be crucial to involve allies in the planning process. While the circumstances of future crises will vary and contingency plans developed today will inevitably lose relevance over time, a rigorous planning process may yield durable crisis management insights that can help future administrations avoid the planning crunch that the Biden administration faced in the fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

The shock represented a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but of the resilience of Europe’s democratic political system and market economies.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Europe’s strong response has demonstrated that an accelerated energy transition is possible amid strong political and economic headwinds when backed by a broad popular consensus for ambitious action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Europe’s actions have been remarkable. The European Union has reckoned with the false promise of its long-standing energy interdependence with Russia, as the energy sector has been central to Putin’s consolidation of power inside of Russia and has been weaponized in the Kremlin’s engagement with neighboring countries. In 2022, Russian fossil fuels supplied 1 in 5 units of energy consumed in the European Union; in 2024, that figure fell to 1 in 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As imports of Russian fossil fuels fell precipitously after Russia’s invasion, EU members took ambitious steps to enhance domestic energy supply capacities and develop alternatives to Russian imports. Coal-fired power plants were temporarily revived, policies to phase out nuclear power were revisited, Norwegian piped gas flows into the European Union increased significantly, transatlantic coordination redirected liquified natural gas volumes toward Europe, and renewables were dramatically expanded. EU institutions were instrumental in overseeing a unified response and set the direction for its member states, from creating collective agreement on the need to decouple from Russian energy over time to setting targets for demand reduction and ensuring that Europe would not abandon its climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe emerged from the crisis as a stronger energy actor, challenges remain in areas spanning electricity market reform to hydrogen diplomacy to protecting critical undersea infrastructure. From a supply perspective, Europe has found a way to replace Russian gas. But this energy is largely coming from sources external to the European Union, and the costs of these alternative sources will be higher and therefore impact Europe’s economic competitiveness. Furthermore, as Europe accelerates its green transition, it must address the risk posed by increasing import dependencies in clean tech supply chains, particularly from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis spawned many lessons relevant for experts and policymakers in a variety of fields. Most of the lessons are positive. Europe’s democracies and markets proved resilient to shocks, Russia failed in its attempt to blackmail EU member states into ceding support for Ukraine, and the European Union proved its geopolitical mettle amid a potentially devastating crisis. However, the crisis also left a significant fiscal mark on European economies and, through price shock and inflationary effects, gave rise to more anti-establishment parties, many of which may seek to roll back aspects of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered an energy crisis in Europe unmatched in severity since the oil shock of the 1970s. The energy shock became a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but of Europe’s union and the resilience of its democratic political system, market economy, and free and open societies. How Europe responded to this crisis explains much about the European project, the energy transition, and the nature of energy security in a new era of profound geopolitical competition and upheaval. Europe has demonstrated that a rapid energy transition is possible in the face of an urgent need and when backed by strong political consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the more than two years since the start of the war, Europe’s energy mix and energy map have changed dramatically. Europe today appears not only more energy resilient than before the crisis, but also just as intent on achieving an energy transition that will be responsive to climate change and that will reduce its external dependencies and improve competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Europe’s actions have been remarkable. The European Union has reduced Russian fossil fuel imports from $16 billion per month in early 2022 to around $1 billion per month by the end of 2023, with cuts to oil imports representing the main driver of the decline. In 2022, Russian fossil fuels supplied 1 in 5 units of energy consumed in the European Union; in 2024, that figure fell to 1 in 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Russia has decisively proven itself to be an unreliable supplier of energy, that will choose to weaponize its energy resources as a tool of political coercion. . . . Today we’re in an environment where Russia is never again going to be seen as a reliable supplier of energy. And where Europe’s transition away from Russian energy has progressed much faster than predicted and marks a really permanent shift in the international energy map.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that European leaders did everything right or that this transition was inexpensive. The loss of Russian supplies amid the war disproved decades of belief that interdependence would secure peace. Disbelief in Europe’s capacity to manage the crisis may also have prevented even bolder action against the Russian energy sector in the early stages of the war, blunting the effects on the Russian economy. Even today, Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) and piped gas are still part of Europe’s energy mix, and Europe remains dependent on Russia for nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive fiscal outlays were deployed to keep industry afloat, particularly in Germany. According to Bruegel estimates, from the beginning of the crisis in September 2021 until June 2023, €651 billion was allocated and earmarked across European countries to shield consumers from rising energy costs. The loss of a relatively cheap and seemingly stable supply of Russian natural gas has significant implications for industrial competitiveness, and for the German economy in particular. Longer-term issues related to persistently elevated prices and the implications for the European Union’s competitiveness will still have to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is no doubt that geopolitics and political stability is a prerequisite for energy security, and vice versa. This was a hard lesson we learned in Europe from the recent geopolitical and energy crises and came at high cost. It pushed us to reconsider the definition of security of supply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, there were fears that the shock of energy costs would turn Europeans against supporting Ukraine; however, these were unfounded. As European households turned down their thermostats in the winter of 2022–23 and paid, on average, 14 percent more for electricity and 114 percent more for gas to heat their homes from the first half of 2021 to October 2022, they knew Russia was to blame for the crisis, and support for Ukraine remained high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European project has advanced in this crisis. European governments worked together through the European Union to adopt sanctions and construct a crisis energy plan. The European Union leveraged the resources it borrowed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic to help countries cope and established an effort to procure LNG on behalf of the bloc. As a result, the European Union is a much more prominent energy actor than before the crisis. The situation demonstrates not only that the European Union is forged in crisis but also that the union enables Europe to respond to crises much more powerfully and effectively than if countries operated independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic relations also strengthened as U.S.-EU cooperation on energy and sanctions significantly increased. U.S.-EU engagement and coordination in these sectors have become much more robust and have laid the groundwork for a stronger U.S.-EU relationship — a relationship that historically has been strained or limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reviews Europe’s response to the energy shock following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Chapter 1 sets the stage by examining the European energy system and approach to energy security prior to the invasion. Chapter 2 outlines how Russia weaponized energy and details the challenges posed to Europe’s energy supply in 2022. Chapter 3 outlines Europe’s response to the crisis, including the steps it and its partners have taken, and its effort to decouple from Russian energy. Chapter 4 examines the postcrisis policy landscape and identifies current and future challenges for Europe. Chapter 5 offers some thoughts on lessons learned from the crisis. Chapter 6 provides some concluding thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-perspective-on-european-energy-strategy&quot;&gt;Historical Perspective on European Energy Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link between energy and security has been at the heart of the European project since its inception after World War II. The creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952 — involving France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — marked the first attempt at integrating European markets after the war. Coal and steel were the focus because these sectors were critical to waging war. Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister and the ECSC’s principal architect, noted that “the solidarity in production” from pooling coal and steel production would make “any war between France and Germany . . . not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.” As a catalyst of European integration, energy is core to the conception of the European Union as a project that brought peace to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while energy was an initial focus for European integration, it was largely pushed to the side as European integration marched forward through the decades. Although energy market integration was continuously discussed over the following decades, the focus for policymakers was squarely on the security of supply. That meant European energy integration made limited advances relative to the extensive economic and political integration Europe would experience; energy policy would remain the domain of Europe’s national governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not until the 1980s, when policymakers shifted their focus to forging a single European market, that European energy integration was considered. A 1988 European Commission working paper conceptualized the idea of a functioning internal energy market, recognizing the need to harmonize rules and technical norms, liberalize public procurement, and remove fiscal barriers such as diverging tax laws. However, the recommendations set forth in the working paper were met with widespread opposition, as they sought to uproot markets with entrenched incumbents enjoying both national and natural monopolies. Although the commission continued developing plans for greater energy integration and liberalization in the 1990s, once again no energy chapter was included in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which formed the European Union. Member states vetoed efforts to include energy in the treaty, wishing to retain control over their national energy policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following decades, the European Union took incremental steps to create an internal energy market. Between 1996 and 1998, the European Parliament passed its First Energy Package directives on the electricity and gas markets, which were weaker versions of the commission proposals that member states in the European Council had rejected. However, according to Joseph Dutton, “Nevertheless they substantially bolstered the moves towards an internal marketplace and attempted to remove ‘legal monopolies’ and obliged vertically integrated companies to grant third party access to networks.” Yet the range of transmission systems and lack of cross-border infrastructure linkages hindered formation of an internal European market. In the 2000s, environmental policy became much more of a focus, and the European Union continued to pass regulations to address friction in the internal market. In 2019, the European Union adopted its Fourth Energy Package, which strengthened the role of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators in facilitating cross-border cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some progress, Europe entered the 2022 energy crisis, 50 years after the Middle East oil embargoes of the 1970s, far from achieving a true energy union. From a regulatory point of view, the energy sector had been liberalized by eliminating monopolies, implementing unbundling rules, and opening access to infrastructure to competitors. However, implementation of these rules often had limited success due to strong resistance. Legacy monopoly companies still had a dominant market position, and the development of interconnections, both gas and electricity, was in many cases insufficient to guarantee an integrated and functional cross-border market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-false-promise-of-energy-interdependence-with-russia&quot;&gt;The False Promise of Energy Interdependence with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the main threat to European security was seemingly gone. Not only could Europeans enjoy a peace dividend and shrink their defense budgets, but engagement with Russia could seemingly strengthen Europe’s energy security as well. There was vast potential in the Russian energy sector, not only to strengthen links with Europe’s advanced economies but also to invest and modernize these Russian industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from Europe’s postwar experience, the hypothesis of change through trade (Wandel durch Handel) — mostly associated with German foreign policy — gave a strategic rationale for deepening European energy integration with Russia. EU leaders believed interdependence would bring trading partners closer to European values and practices. Thus, buying Russian energy and investing in the Russian energy sector not only were good for Europe economically but also would serve to keep Russia on the democratic path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaws in the “change through trade” strategy became apparent well before Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The energy sector has been central to Putin’s Russia since he came to office in 2000; it was essential to his consolidation of power inside Russia and a key part of Russian foreign policy. Upon becoming president in 2000, Putin sought to exert control over the energy sector, leading to confrontations with Russian oligarchs such as the head of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was arrested after questioning the illiberalism of the Putin regime. Putin has personally selected the heads of Russian energy companies, such as Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft. There are numerous accounts of Putin demonstrating to Western officials and businesspeople his in-depth understanding of energy markets. For example, Daniel Yergin writes in The New Map that Putin “understood the power that came from Russia’s oil and gas. Western interlocutors would be consistently surprised by his detailed knowledge of the energy industry and energy markets and the fluency with which he discussed the intricacies — as much like a CEO, they would say, as a head of state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia repeatedly weaponized energy resources in its engagement with neighboring countries. Gazprom threatened to cut the supply of gas to Ukraine in 2005 when Ukraine refused to accept a fivefold price increase. Prior to Russia’s invasion of Georgia, disruptions in gas flows forced the Georgian government to ration supplies. In the week following Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, Gazprom hiked the price of gas exports to Ukraine from $268.50 per thousand cubic meters (mcm) to $385.50 per mcm, and ultimately to $485.00 per mcm. Russia has also provided gas cost-free to the breakaway region of Transnistria in Moldova since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s energy blackmail of former Soviet countries failed to induce a serious reassessment of European energy security. On the one hand, Russia’s tactics were not seen as applicable to Europe given its market size. On the other hand, many European leaders and businesses struggled to see an alternative, especially since U.S. LNG exports to Europe were insignificant in volume, renewables were still largely aspirational, nuclear power suffered from deep negative connotations, and coal had stark climate ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s faith in mutual interdependence, however, failed to recognize that Putin’s Russia had consistently prioritized geopolitical advancement over the health of its economy. Yet Russia believed Europe’s priorities were the opposite: European leaders and societies would put their economic well-being ahead of geopolitics. The long-held Soviet-era perception of the decadent, capitalist West caring only about profit remains deeply rooted in the Kremlin today. As such, as Russian forces amassed on Ukraine’s borders, Putin likely believed he had leverage. Russia could absorb the economic and political hit caused by an energy shock, whereas European leaders could not; therefore, Europe’s response to the invasion would be performative and limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-european-gas-markets-and-integration-with-russia&quot;&gt;Development of European Gas Markets and Integration with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has consistently been dependent on energy imports, particularly oil, petroleum products, and natural gas. The data shows that energy import dependency has grown since 1990 (see Figure 1). In 2021, 91.7 percent of EU energy demand for oil and petroleum products and 83.4 percent of demand for natural gas were covered by extra-EU imports. By 2021, a significant share of EU imports came from Russia, including 45 percent of total gas imports and nearly half of total coal imports. At that time, more than half of Russia’s oil exports were also directed to Europe, which accounted for about one-third of Europe’s total oil imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the gas infrastructure connecting Russia to Europe has been the clearest symbol of Russia’s status as a fossil fuel superpower and its influence over Europe. The geopolitics of these gas pipelines has historically been complex for the European Union and its member states, given their diverging interests and outlooks as well as historical ties to Russia (the first pipelines date to the 1960s). After the Cold War, and thanks to an effective commercial diplomacy campaign, Gazprom established new infrastructure projects (TurkStream and Nord Stream), which made it possible to circumvent transit countries identified as problematic — mostly Ukraine and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No energy infrastructure project reflected this development better than the Nord Stream gas pipelines connecting western Russia with Germany via the Baltic Sea. Established by a consortium led by Gazprom and operational since 2011, Nord Stream 1 had a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters (bcm), equivalent to roughly a third of EU gas imports from Russia in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine occurred in March 2014 when it annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Despite these evolving security and geopolitical realities, Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, and Engie reached a commercial agreement roughly a year later over Nord Stream 2, a second gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany. However, extensive legal battles and U.S. sanctions beginning in 2019 significantly delayed construction of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backers of the pipeline projects, which included the Russian government and high-profile German politicians from the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party argued that they would ensure stability of supply by connecting Europe with the world’s largest gas reserves in Russia while supporting the continent’s sustainability goals as a less carbon-intensive complement than coal to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opponents, which included the United States, various environmental groups, several other German politicians, and many of the Eastern European countries most exposed to Russian aggression, claimed that the projects would lock in dependence on Russia, enable Russia to extort Ukraine, be harmful to marine ecosystems, and undermine Europe’s green transition. Despite attempts by supporters to frame the projects as a strictly commercial undertaking, opponents argued that an overreliance on Russian gas would leave Europe at the Kremlin’s mercy and susceptible to energy blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You should probably underscore that Europe is not as uniform as we might often think. . . . There’s the UK versus EU, but there’s also the Western versus Eastern Europe, or the post-Soviet Europe, which in my view has seen energy security, from the perspective of dependence on Russia, very differently than the West.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nord Stream pipelines were thus largely a German story. Germany is the largest EU country in terms of the size of its population and economy. Its economic weight is disproportionate, representing a quarter of overall EU gross domestic product (GDP). While efforts were made (and sometimes are still made) to portray Nord Stream 2 as a European project, it was driven by German commercial, economic, and political interests. During a visit to St. Petersburg in November 2017, German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel affirmed German support for the project. He stated, “Now is a good time for us to intensify our economic cooperation. We’ve always known Russia as an especially reliable gas supplier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the interconnected European gas network and markets meant that Russian natural gas could also make its way to France, the Netherlands, and other European states and influence their energy systems. The availability of low-priced supply made it easier for the Netherlands to close its Groningen gas field given local earthquake concerns. While the United States undertook a shale gas revolution, European gas production declined dramatically in the last decade, in large part due to the perceived stability and low cost of Russian supply. Private investment in European gas production made little sense given the economic headwinds of Russian gas and the political headwinds of climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Germany’s broader energy policies compounded the energy security risks of a strategic bet on Russian piped gas. Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear power stands out. While nuclear power supplied a quarter of Germany’s electricity demand a decade ago, today no nuclear power plants remain operational. Availability of cheap Russian gas enabled the economic feasibility of this nuclear phaseout as gas generation and renewables replaced lost nuclear generation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large contribution by nuclear power was controversial, as public support for it has eroded since the 1980s. By 2002, public pressure brought forth a law mandating the closure of Germany’s entire fleet of nuclear power plants. The 2011 Fukushima accident unleashed significant blowback on German chancellor Angela Merkel, until then a staunch supporter of nuclear power, and catalyzed previously stalled implementation of the 2002 law. For example, Merkel ally and long-time defender of atomic energy Stefan Mappus lost the state premier position as an incumbent in Baden-Württemberg, an otherwise conservative state, to a challenger from the Green Party. Three months later, the Bundestag agreed to phase out nuclear energy by 2022. Although the shutdown was delayed in October 2022 for several months due to energy security concerns related to the war in Ukraine, Germany’s last nuclear power plant disconnected from the electricity grid in April 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, Russian gas pipelines supplied 41.5 percent of total EU gas imports, with a dominant position in many captive markets through long-term contracts and situations of quasi-monopoly (see Figure 2). Gazprom’s influence also extended to the commercialization and storage of its gas on European soil. Through its subsidiaries (Gazprom Germania and Gazprom Marketing and Trading), it managed a dense network of underground gas storage facilities, distribution networks, and trading companies. In 2020, Gazprom Germania had total assets of €8.4 billion and equity of €2.2 billion. In particular, Gazprom Germania had the largest gas storage capacity in the European Union, with infrastructure in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and the Netherlands, which gave the company a dominant position in the EU gas market. Gazprom’s influence was not limited to energy. The company’s clout extended from politics to sports through funding and sponsorship, making it a recognizable brand to many European citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1j55ce3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has exerted significant diplomatic pressure on Germany and consistently framed the Nord Stream projects in geopolitical terms. In December 2019, U.S. president Donald Trump signed a law that would impose sanctions on any firm involved with helping Gazprom finish the pipeline into the European Union, describing the project as a “tool of coercion.” Even then, the U.S. Department of State highlighted the adverse implications for Ukraine, noting that Nord Stream 2 “would enable Russia to bypass Ukraine for gas transit to Europe, which would deprive Ukraine of substantial transit revenues and increase its vulnerability to Russian aggression.” However, critics of Washington’s approach often interpreted U.S. geopolitical pressure as partly a cynical effort to advance the U.S. LNG industry. The administration of U.S. president Joe Biden continued opposition to Russian gas. In March 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the pipeline as “a Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nord Stream 2 was one of the most prominent issues in Chancellor Merkel’s final visit to Washington in July 2021. On that visit, President Biden agreed not to sanction German companies participating in the project, stating, “Good friends can disagree . . . but by the time I became President, it was 90 percent completed. And imposing sanctions did not seem to make any sense.” This was seen as a major concession to the chancellor and drew significant political blowback from both sides of the aisle in Washington. By September 2021, the construction of Nord Stream 2 had been completed, awaiting only certification from German regulators to begin operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this was not simply a case of the dependence of Germany, Europe’s largest economy. Given its position in Europe, Germany was effectively imposing dependence on the rest of Europe. Eastern European countries, whose energy systems were built to integrate with Russia’s, were also heavily dependent on Russian energy supplies. Poland, one of the most vocal countries about the threat posed by Russia, received 46 percent of its natural gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia in 2022, according to the think tank Forum Energii. Latvia was 100 percent dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. Changing course in Europe’s broader energy strategy would become too costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as more than 100,000 Russian forces surrounded Ukraine in the autumn of 2021, Europe found itself utterly dependent on Russia for its energy security. For example, at the time Germany lacked any LNG import capacity. In 2022, Germany imported 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and with Nord Stream 2 set to open, that dependence was likely to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precrisis-energy-transition-plans&quot;&gt;Precrisis Energy Transition Plans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decade before Russia’s invasion, European energy policy prioritized the energy transition over energy security considerations. In 2019, the European Commission unveiled the European Green Deal, organized around the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The new climate strategy sought to transform the European Union into a “modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of the Green Deal’s ambitious climate objectives in the energy sector took the form of the Fit for 55 package presented by the European Commission in July 2021. The package translated into law the Green Deal’s goal of reducing EU-wide emissions by 55 percent by 2030. This package increased renewable energy targets, approved the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and expanded the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conspicuously missing were provisions advancing energy security. Arriving just prior to the start of the crisis, these policies effectively demonstrated the EU policymaking community’s underweighting of energy security in favor of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEBATES OVER NUCLEAR, GAS, AND COAL: PHASEOUTS AND GREEN TAXONOMY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricity-generation resource mix naturally impacts policy considerations in both climate and energy security. However, precrisis European policy debates on the subject primarily revolved around climate. Policymakers generally favored renewable energy expansion in the form of wind and solar as the primary locus for energy investment and as the primary vehicle for Europe’s green transition. Implicit in this model was a large, albeit eventually declining, role for natural gas as a balancing resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first half of 2021, as Russia was laying the groundwork for its invasion, European energy policymakers were engaged in a fierce political debate over the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities. This labeling system, commonly referred to as the “green taxonomy,” guides investors toward economic activities that are compatible with EU climate goals. Such labels are significant given that the European Union intends to mobilize at least €1 trillion in public and private sustainable investments over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many member states were staunchly opposed to nuclear power’s inclusion in the green taxonomy despite its zero-emissions profile. Austria and Luxembourg threatened legal action to block the commission’s proposal to include nuclear power. The German governing coalition was fractured on the issue: the Greens pushed heavily to reject nuclear power and sought to follow Austria’s example by also filing suit. The antinuclear position was opposed by France and other states heavily reliant on nuclear power. Meanwhile, Germany was keen to include natural gas in the taxonomy given the heavy role it plays in its energy system at present and over the long term as a balancing resource in a renewables-heavy grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This debate revealed that much of Europe, with German policymakers at the head of this coalition, did not value the ability of nuclear power to provide firm (nonintermittent) carbon-free electricity in place of natural gas–fired generation. It was believed that a renewables-heavy mix paired with natural gas was the optimal system design for Europe and did not consider the security and economic risks of reliance on Russia to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, well into the energy crisis, the European Parliament backed the inclusion of investments in gas and nuclear power plants in the green taxonomy. In the case of gas, this inclusion was predicated on quite strict emissions intensity standards and low- or no-carbon fuel (e.g., hydrogen) readiness. The move was widely seen as an attempt to placate both Germany’s attachment to natural gas as a transition technology and France’s view that nuclear should be classified as a green technology. In the end, no legal moves were taken to block this settlement; only a minority of countries, including Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and Spain, voiced criticism at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green taxonomy debate highlights the deep division in Europe over the role of nuclear power despite its emissions-free profile. In the years preceding the energy crisis, many member states laid out plans to phase out or reduce the share of nuclear energy in their electricity mix, with some even imposing bans on new nuclear generation. Broadly, precrisis Europe saw a limited role for nuclear power in the energy transition. Most notable, of course, was Germany’s long-running commitment to eliminate all nuclear power. Even France, the continent’s leader on nuclear energy, had been considering a cap on the contribution of nuclear energy to its electricity supply, a policy that would lead to early plant retirements and effectively stunt the build-out of new reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal-fired power, once the starting point for European integration, was broadly expected to be phased out of the European energy system. The Green Deal’s renewables deployment targets, coupled with the bloc’s price on carbon and tightening pollution regulations, have exerted economic pressure on coal power plants, forcing many to shut down. At the EU level, there are no direct mandates to phase out coal consumption, although many member states have established their own timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of June 2024, a total of 23 countries had announced their intent to phase out coal — with four of them (Austria, Belgium, Portugal, and Sweden) achieving the phaseout. France expected to see all of its coal plants close by the end of 2022, barring a loophole that would have allowed coal plants to burn a mix of coal and biomass to stay online. While 12 countries aimed to be coal-free before 2030, another seven countries had set their goals to phase out coal after 2030. The least ambitious targets were set by Bulgaria, which aimed to exit coal between 2038 and 2040, and Germany. Berlin’s goal of a coal exit by 2038 has been heavily criticized as “too weak” and deemed incompatible with the Paris Agreement by German civil society groups. In July 2021, Germany’s supreme court ruled that the government would have to strengthen its 2030 climate targets — including its coal exit — by the end of 2022. A few months after the ruling, the ascendant ruling coalition released a proposal to bring forward Germany’s coal exit to 2030. At the other end of the spectrum, some European countries (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Poland, Serbia, and Turkey) have not entertained a coal phaseout target at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preinvasion-gas-market-disruptions&quot;&gt;Preinvasion Gas Market Disruptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European energy crisis began in August 2021 with the first signs of Russian manipulation of natural gas. In August, Gazprom dramatically cut gas flows through the Yamal pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Poland, ostensibly due to a fire at a gas processing facility in western Siberia. Through 2021, Gazprom’s deliveries of natural gas remained at minimum levels despite the recovery of both gas demand and prices in the European Union following the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In another example of targeted supply restrictions, Gazprom booked only 4 percent of the additional guaranteed transit capacity Ukraine offered for September. With a return of healthy demand for gas, these supply limitations sent prices surging across European gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of its long-term contracts and its traditional role as a low-cost swing supplier allowed Gazprom to effectively manipulate the European gas market. Gazprom contracts were usually governed by a take-or-pay clause, which ensured very high compensation to the seller from the buyer if gas deliveries were not accepted as set out in the long-term agreement. These contracts offered both buyer and supplier a degree of discretion in the total volumes to be delivered, allowing a percentage of gas supplies to be adjusted according to circumstances, mainly demand and price outlooks. As the Covid-19 crisis faded in 2021, Russia consistently delivered the minimum volumes allowed in the long-term contracts, a legal maneuver that reduced supplies throughout the European Union and forced procurement from higher-priced import sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The throttling of gas flows into Europe through 2021 left analysts perplexed. A CNBC story from August 2021 ran with the headline “Russia Is Pumping A Lot Less Natural Gas to Europe All of Sudden — and It Is Not Clear Why.” Tom Marzec-Manser, the lead European gas analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, hypothesized that Russia was applying pressure on Europe to certify the Nord Stream 2 pipeline: “Gazprom is readying itself for starting Nord Stream 2 and it is hoping to exert an element of leverage in terms of trying to make sure that when all the regulatory t’s get crossed and i’s get dotted, that that process is as swift as possible. . . . If there is less gas around than normal and the price is high then it may streamline that process.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German government also saw little reason for concern. A now declassified October 2021 top-secret security assessment of Nord Stream 2 by the German government found little risk of certifying the pipeline: “Overall, the assessment comes to the conclusion that the granting of certification [for Nord Stream 2] does not jeopardize the security of gas supply in Germany and the European Union.” It added that “for both the German and neighboring markets, the risk of serious impairments to supply security due to the failure of individual import supply infrastructures is very limited.” When assessing the chance that flows from the pipeline could give Russia leverage, it found that “gas deliveries from the Soviet Union and later from Russia to Germany have been reliable and contractual for decades, even in times of political tension.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WLOJPdE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Natural Gas Prices across U.S., EU, and Asian Reference Indexes, 2016–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imf.org/en/Research/commodity-prices&quot;&gt;“IMF Primary Commodity Prices,” International Monetary Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gazprom initially claimed that the reduction in deliveries was due to technical reasons associated with drilling well closures sourced from the period of lower demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the systematic emptying of Gazprom-controlled gas storage facilities in Europe was, in retrospect, likely part of a geo-economic coercion strategy to prepare for the invasion of Ukraine. By exporting the minimum quantity of gas permitted by long-term contracts and suspending sales on the spot market, Russia placed the European market under significant duress, resulting in record-high pricing in August 2021. Furthermore, the natural gas price differential between the U.S. Henry Hub index and the European TTF index had already reached record highs (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, U.S. intelligence agencies sounded the alarm that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent. Russia had moved significant forces and sophisticated weaponry near its border with Ukraine. American analysts cited by the New York Times suggested that Putin saw the coming months as a unique window of opportunity, with rising gas prices making Europe more dependent on cheap Russian supplies and Merkel’s imminent departure from the chancellorship limiting the future pressure on Ukraine to make concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-invades&quot;&gt;Russia Invades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 initiated the worst security crisis in Europe since World War II and indicated that the unusual gas market developments of 2021 were not merely due to commercial or engineering causes. The invasion caused a major economic and political upheaval in European capitals and elevated the security of Europe’s energy supply to the top of the political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days after the invasion, German chancellor Olaf Scholz gave his now famous Zeitenwende speech, which not only called for a massive increase in German military spending but also suspended the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipelines. Additionally, the United States and European Union responded quickly with surprisingly robust sanctions, which included the dramatic step of freezing Russian assets in the global financial system. In June 2022, the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs Task Force, comprising top finance and justice officials from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Commission, announced it had blocked $30 billion in assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and officials and immobilized $300 billion owned by the Russian central bank. Notably, no sanctions on Russian energy imports were included. Furthermore, Russian gas continued to flow into Europe via Nord Stream 1 and other pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of energy market sanctions, the market feared that sanctions would come, and forward gas and power prices soared on March 7. Seeking to ease market impacts, European leaders quickly downplayed the likelihood of such a sanctions package. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte noted that cutting off Russian oil and gas supplies would be unsustainable for EU member states “because we need the supply and that is the uncomfortable truth.” Chancellor Scholz also vigorously pushed back on calls to ban imports of Russian gas and oil. While Berlin agreed to halt the Nord Stream 2 project following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Scholz emphasized that importing energy from Russia was an economic necessity. In a statement, the German leader noted, “At the moment, Europe’s supply of energy for heat generation, mobility, power supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Social Democratic Party’s junior coalition partner, the Green Party, supported Scholz’s position. In other words, fears of widespread economic calamity among many of Europe’s most powerful countries resulted in a cautious approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One quickly emergent issue for European policymakers was the difficulty in correctly assessing the impact of the crisis due to a lack of Europe-wide data. As Bruegel found, “Technical questions on the EU’s ability to survive without Russian natural gas and oil were clouded by an absence of data on the volumes and routes through which Russian fossil fuels were entering the EU.” European businesses were also sounding the alarm. A report from the Kiel Institute predicted a “sharp recession” if Germany were to cut itself off from Russian gas. German businesses reacted with horror at the prospect of a potential European embargo on Russian fossil fuels. At the end of March 2022, the head of German chemicals giant BASF asked rhetorically, “Do we knowingly want to destroy our entire economy?” There was a prevailing sense that the German economy might suffer a dramatic economic contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several economists disputed these concerns in a prominent paper produced in the weeks after the invasion. They concluded that ending European purchases of Russian energy would entail “substantial but manageable” economic cost for the German economy. This assessment was prescient, as Russian pipeline gas flows would dramatically decline that summer due to sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. In a retrospective analysis, two of the original authors, Benjamin Moll and Moritz Schularick, and Bruegel senior fellow Georg Zachmann concluded, “The German economy successfully adapted to the cut-off of natural gas from Russia last year, suggesting that Germany could have moved more swiftly to sanction Russia after it invaded Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was also wary of energy sanctions. A total embargo on Russian oil exports would likely lead to a surge in global oil prices, drive U.S. domestic gasoline prices up, and accelerate the inflationary pressure hampering the global economy. There was also clear concern among certain Central and Eastern European states, whose energy infrastructure was less integrated with their European neighbors and therefore more dependent on Russian energy. For example, when EU import bans on Russian coal, seaborne crude oil shipments, and refined oil products eventually went into effect in August 2022, December 2022, and February 2023, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia secured exemptions to certain oil products. Without these exemptions, reaching consensus at the European Union, which is required for sanctions, would have been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the European Union ended up passing two sanctions packages on February 23 and February 25, 2022, which focused on limiting technology transfers and disrupting the Russian financial system but did not directly target imports of Russian fossil fuels. The rationale behind these sanctions was to limit Russia’s access to funds derived from hydrocarbon sales while maintaining its supply to the European Union in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Kremlin announced in March 2022 that hostile countries would have to pay for gas in rubles in a two-phase payment system (euros and rubles) using Gazprombank. The European Commission opted for flexibility, allowing European companies to choose between continuing with their long-term contracts using this new mechanism or unilaterally rescinding them. As a result, many European utilities suspended their contracts, provoking a decrease in gas flows from Russia. In particular, Poland and Bulgaria refused to pay for imports in rubles, leading to the closure of the Yamal gas pipeline running through Poland to Germany and ceasing Russian exports of gas to Bulgaria, which was particularly dependent on Russian supplies. The Bulgarian economy was especially exposed to the energy shock given its heavy reliance on fossil fuels — specifically, coal for electricity generation and crude oil products for transportation. After the state-owned domestic gas supplier Bulgargaz refused to accept a rubles-based payment scheme, Gazprom unilaterally suspended deliveries in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the summer of 2022, Gazprom increased its pressure on the EU gas market, intermittently reducing flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Again, Gazprom gave cover explanations, this time stating that technical disruptions to key equipment repairs were due to Western sanctions. By June, surging energy prices (Figure 4) were beginning to cause a cost-of-living crisis affecting people and businesses across the European Union. The economic impacts placed political pressure on European leaders. In a televised interview marking Bastille Day, French president Emmanuel Macron warned his constituents to prepare for a complete cutoff of Russian natural gas, advanced initiatives to diversify the French energy mix, and spoke of a national “sobriety plan” to conserve energy. German economy and climate minister Robert Habeck said in June 2022, “It’s a tense, serious situation. . . . It must be acknowledged that Putin is reducing the gas supply to Europe bit by bit, also to drive up the price, and we must respond with our measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NORD STREAM SABOTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 26, 2022, two underwater explosions damaged three of the four pipelines that constituted the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines off the Danish island of Bornholm (the latter was completed in 2021 but was not in operation). The sabotage, whose perpetrators have not yet been identified, left the infrastructure inoperable, closing the main gas supply line between Russia and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evidence warranting conclusive attribution, two schools of thought have emerged pointing to either Russian- or Ukrainian-backed groups as the perpetrators. The circumstantial evidence in the immediate aftermath pointed toward the Kremlin. Russia’s Baltic fleet, capable of deploying divers and miniature submarines, is based in Kaliningrad, just 300 kilometers from the sabotaged pipelines. The incident occurred a day before a new pipeline was completed to connect Poland with Norwegian gas via Denmark in an effort to reduce Warsaw’s reliance on Russian gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another narrative that subsequently gained traction centers on Ukrainian involvement. Ukraine has carried out a number of dramatic intelligence operations since the war began, some of which have roiled Ukraine’s backers, such as the assassination of Russian television commentator Daria Dugina. Kyiv, which long opposed the pipelines, may have feared Russia could successfully blackmail Germany and others to reduce their support for Ukraine. In March 2023, German media carried a report that German police had traced a yacht thought to have been used to transport explosives to the sabotage site to two Ukrainian nationals. These reports aligned with New York Times reporting that U.S. intelligence officials suspected involvement by renegade pro-Ukrainian groups. Although German authorities are still investigating the explosions, Denmark’s and Sweden’s public prosecutors closed their inquiries into the explosions in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever was responsible, the attack eliminated Russian gas flows to Germany, led to sharp increases in energy prices, and firmly demonstrated that Europe’s energy links to Russia could not be isolated from the broader geopolitical conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-perfect-storm-overlapping-crises-in-electricity-markets&quot;&gt;The Perfect Storm: Overlapping Crises in Electricity Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis in the European natural gas sector intersected with two incidental factors — a severe continental drought and the poor performance of the French nuclear fleet — to cause a matching crisis in the European electricity sector. Electricity markets saw prices reach historic levels, which devastated consumers, destabilized energy companies, and raised serious resource adequacy concerns. Heading into the winter of 2022–23, system planners and political leadership publicly warned of the risk of load shedding, a process by which consumers are intermittently disconnected to preserve overall system stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DROUGHT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, severe drought, characterized as the worst in 500 years, simultaneously affected the Mediterranean basin, Central Europe, and the Nordic countries. Lack of rainfall severely reduced the generation output of many hydroelectric dams, which represent roughly 16 percent of total European generation capacity. In 2021, these generation assets produced 805 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, representing 17 percent of all production; only gas-fired generation (26 percent) and nuclear-fired generation (23 percent) contributed a larger share. Drought conditions in 2022 caused hydroelectric generation to fall 15 percent year over year to only 687 TWh, the lowest level since 2011, despite the very strong financial incentive of record-breaking spot prices to produce at maximum capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drought further affected the electricity sector by reducing water levels in European rivers. The conditions restricted navigability by barge and, in some cases, interrupted delivery of fuel to coal-fired power plants on the Rhine, taking additional generation capacity out of the system. In France, low water levels caused restrictions on the discharge of cooling water by nuclear power plants, causing Électricité de France (EDF), the French nuclear operator, to take plants offline or reduce output. Eventually, this problem was partially mitigated when the relevant environmental agency granted waivers at the government’s behest on the basis of public necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FRENCH NUCLEAR OUTAGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France possesses the largest nuclear power fleet in Europe by a wide margin: 61 gigawatts (GW) of production capacity spread out over 56 reactors, dwarfing the next-largest fleets in Ukraine (14 GW) and the United Kingdom (8 GW). This fleet typically supplies over 70 percent of France’s electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As gas and electric prices surged through early 2022, the French nuclear fleet was rocked by the discovery of widespread stress corrosion cracking. Problems similar to those initially identified at a single plant were soon discovered at numerous others, forcing EDF to take several plants offline. These events coincided with prescheduled and unavoidable 10-year maintenance outages. In total, an unprecedented number of nuclear reactors were taken offline just when the French and broader European electric grid needed them most. The nadir of French nuclear output occurred in July–August 2022, when only 18 TWh was generated out of a possible 45 TWh, a 40 percent capacity utilization rate. On an annual basis, 2022 was the worst performance in decades, with output falling over 22 percent versus 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although France typically exported electricity to its neighbors, the combination of drought and nuclear outages made it a net importer of electricity for the first time in 42 years. Rather than support supply deficits in neighboring nations such as Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, it drew on power from these nations, exacerbating supply shortages and high prices in those countries. However, this result demonstrated the value of an integrated electricity system linked both physically with transmission capacity and commercially with liquid and dynamic market mechanisms. Such integration allows the sharing of generation resources, which improves overall system reliability and brings down the cost of achieving that reliability. Without this integration, France would likely have been forced into economically and socially painful cuts to electricity in the summer of 2022 and winter of 2022–23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HISTORIC PRICE VOLATILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices in the European electricity market reached record highs through 2022. Drought and nuclear outages knocked low-priced baseload capacity out of the supply stack. The crisis in the gas market meant gas-fired generation capacity struggled to secure fuel. Plants that could secure fuel did so at exorbitant prices, which meant that the electricity they produced was offered on electricity markets at a steep premium. Additionally, carbon dioxide prices in the EU Emissions Trading System market traded to historic highs, reaching a peak of €100 per ton equivalent in February 2023. Higher carbon dioxide costs borne by fossil-fired generation (i.e., coal and gas) likewise translated into higher prices offered in electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hxdMSMN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: France Becomes Net Importer of Electricity between 2021 and 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2023/#supporting-material&quot;&gt;Dave Jones et al., European Electricity Review 2023 (London: Ember, January 2023)&lt;/a&gt;. Reproduced under CC-BY-SA 4.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of electricity markets is crucial for understanding how these factors translate into higher electricity prices. Electricity markets are settled on the margin: Generators offer their electricity into the market and are dispatched to meet demand in order of lowest to highest offer price, a process called merit order dispatch. The offer price of the last unit dispatched, the marginal unit, is the price received by all generators (supply) and the price paid by all buyers (demand). This price formation model is used in all restructured electricity markets around the world, most notably in U.S. electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has made substantial progress on deploying renewables that produce electricity at zero marginal cost and are therefore first in merit order dispatch. However, demand levels almost always reach beyond the generation output of renewables, causing merit order dispatch to move deeper into the supply stack and dispatch fossil-fired generation to balance supply with demand. Renewables are therefore rarely the marginal unit and therefore rarely set the market-clearing spot price. Nonetheless, they play a key role in reducing overall system costs by reducing how often and deep the market must go into the supply of high-priced fossil-fired generation to reach equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With large volumes of low-cost hydropower (first to be dispatched in the supply stack) and nuclear power out of the supply mix, gas-fired generation units priced at steep premiums set the margin in almost every country. Through this mechanism, the historically high price of natural gas translated directly into historically high prices for electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years before the crisis, average annual wholesale prices for most European countries were generally €30–€50 per megawatt-hour (MWh). By early 2022, electricity prices, tracking the movement in gas prices, had reached monthly averages of over €200 per MWh in most countries. Pricing surged higher through the summer as the combined effect of nuclear and hydroelectric underperformance drove increasing reliance on extremely high-priced gas generation. Increased power burn — or gas consumed by power plants to produce electricity — intensified pricing pressure in the gas market as buyers sought to fill gas storage facilities for the upcoming winter. This drove gas prices, and by extension electricity prices, ever higher through the summer. Peak pricing occurred in August, with most countries averaging well over €400 per MWh. Italy fared the worst, with a monthly average of €543 per MWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yearly averages for 2022 for most countries settled at triple the typical annual average of the recent past or more. The impact of such pricing on households, businesses, and the overall economy is enormous. A rough estimate serves to demonstrate the scale: In 2022, Germany consumed 540 TWh of electricity priced at an annual average price of €237 per MWh, representing an annual spend of €128 billion. Priced against the preceding five-year average of €35 per MWh, the same demand results in an annual spend of only €19 billion. Despite the introduction of various subsidy mechanisms, Greece’s electricity prices also spiked by 40 percent for industries and 24 percent for households in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gaj7JME.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of extreme pricing was not uniform. Nordic countries fared better because their power mixes relied less heavily on natural gas in favor of hydro and nuclear generation. Poland likewise has relatively low reliance on natural gas in favor of heavy reliance on coal-fired power. Portugal and Spain were notable exceptions because they introduced a gas price-capping mechanism, known as the Iberian exception, which the European Commission approved after tough discussions. This gas price cap limited the price of natural gas used for electricity generation to €40 per MWh, with the government compensating gas-fired power plants for the difference, thus successfully lowering overall electricity prices for consumers during 2022, despite indirectly increasing Spain’s gas consumption for power generation and, especially, electricity exports to France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European electricity demand historically peaks through the winter months. The winter of 2022–23 posed a worrisome risk for the overall reliability of the electric power system, and officials within the European Union, national governments, and grid operators all issued warnings on the risk of load shedding or, far worse, uncontrolled blackouts. One area where Europe was fortunate is that both the winters of 2022–23 and 2023–24 were relatively mild, enabling lower energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-market-interventions&quot;&gt;Energy Market Interventions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports of Russian gas into the European Union fell precipitously from 150 bcm in 2021 to 78 bcm in 2022 and then again to 42 bcm in 2023. To enable and respond to these changes in fuel imports, EU member states took a wide range of steps to enhance domestic energy supply capacities and seek alternatives to Russian imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS BRIEFLY TURN TO OLD COAL POWER PLANTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis led to a temporary reactivation of coal-fired power plants to provide resource diversity and additional capacity given that gas combined-cycle plants were heavily fuel constrained. According to a report by Ember, an estimated 13.5 GW of coal-fired plants were reactivated from recent retirement or otherwise placed on standby in supply reserve facilities, increasing the EU coal fleet by 12 percent. These units contributed to increased coal burning through the crisis. For the first time since 2015, coal-fired generation output increased year over year in 2021 and again in 2022, reaching 448 TWh compared to 352 TWh of output in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, due to fortuitous winter weather outcomes and effective policy intervention at the EU and national levels in other areas, these reactivated plants saw relatively marginal utilization. By the spring of 2023, the European Union had experienced an overstock of coal in its ports, which was resold to Asia and other emerging markets. In 2023, coal-fired power generation fell relative to 2022 and returned to its long-term pattern of decline and a new EU-era low of 335 TWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS SEEK TO PRESERVE THEIR NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with coal generation, the energy crisis forced policymakers to revisit nuclear power policy. In the short term, postponing imminent reactor shutdowns was an option for policymakers. In January 2023, Belgium opted to extend the life of two nuclear reactors slated to close in 2025 by 10 years, until 2035. In Germany, considerable debate over the status of three recently shuttered nuclear reactors and three others in operation but scheduled for closure did not ultimately lead to policy changes. In April 2023, Germany took its last three remaining nuclear power plants offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crisis impacts on the nuclear power sector will likely play out over the long term as countries plan investments that shape the overall direction of their generation resource mix. French nuclear policy is demonstrative. Precrisis plans proposed phasing down nuclear power’s contribution to the overall electricity mix from over 70 percent to below 50 percent — a policy that effectively eliminates new plant builds. Postcrisis French policy has inverted the 50 percent target from an upward limit to a minimum threshold, and the government has announced plans for a new reactor-building campaign. France has also organized a coalition of European countries interested in pursuing expanded nuclear power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, nuclear power accounts for about a quarter of European energy, with about half of that coming from France. At present, France and Slovakia are the only European countries with nuclear reactors currently under construction. In March, Belgium hosted a Nuclear Energy Summit with 30 countries, a sign of the newfound political interest in nuclear power. Poland signed a $40 billion agreement with U.S. companies to construct two nuclear power plants, with three reactors each, the first opening in 2033. Polish and South Korean companies have also agreed to build additional nuclear plants in Poland. The Czech Republic is advancing plans to construct multiple new reactors for delivery in the mid-2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NORWEGIAN GAS STEPS UP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Norwegian piped gas flows into the European Union increased about 8 percent year over year. In 2023, Norway provided 109 bcm of natural gas from the Norwegian continental shelf to Europe. In December 2023, Norwegian gas deliveries provided 11.1 bcm (121.7 TWh) in one month, the largest amount ever provided to Europe in a single month. Norway now provides approximately 30 percent of EU natural gas and has become the largest EU gas supplier, with the United States second at approximately 19 percent. Norway has also replaced Russia’s leading role in providing gas to Germany. In 2021, Norway provided under 20 percent of Germany’s natural gas; in 2023, that figure stood at 48 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the European Union, Norway is a far more secure partner. Although Norway is not a member of the European Union, it is part of the European single market. Further, Norway is a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and is deeply embedded in the transatlantic efforts to counter Russian aggression. Substituting Russia for Norway as Europe’s dominant supplier indicates a significant improvement in European energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precrisis preference for Russian gas was based on price. Thus, the improvement in energy security comes at a cost, as Norwegian gas is structurally more expensive. The new equilibrium is therefore not without its detractors. Some European commentators have accused Norway of profiting off of the war and Europe’s economic pain. Europe’s newfound dependence on Norway and the Norwegian energy giant Equinor has created some market concern that any disruption, such as from maintenance needs, would lead to price spikes. As a Bloomberg report surmises, “So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.” Other suppliers of piped gas, such as Algeria and Azerbaijan, have not seen a comparably significant increase in supply to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vi9tHk5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most surprising is a lack of concerted effort to increase Europe’s domestic gas production. Despite the ongoing crisis of gas supply and price, domestic gas production within the European Union has continued its downward trajectory. Between 2016 and 2023, EU gas production more than halved, primarily due to the natural depletion of fields and challenges related to political and social acceptance. Since the invasion of Ukraine, natural gas production in the European Union has experienced a significant decline of approximately 13 percent due to the May 2024 closure of the Dutch gas field in Groningen, the bloc’s major gas source. One positive indicator for supply is in Romania, which foresees a rise in gas production thanks to upcoming projects in the Black Sea. Denmark’s gas output is also expected to receive a boost with the delayed return of the Tyra field in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPE TURNS TO LNG, PARTICULARLY FROM THE UNITED STATES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of transatlantic cooperation has been securing LNG volumes for Europe. A March 2022 U.S.-EU announcement featured prominent commitments by the United States to expand LNG exports to Europe to at least 50 bcm per year by 2030. The agreement started with a goal of achieving 15 bcm of increased exports in 2022, a target that was swiftly met and surpassed by September of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bBCpSXi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surge in U.S. LNG exports to Europe is stunning. In 2021, total U.S. LNG exports to Europe stood at 29 bcm; 2022 saw exports more than double to 70 bcm. These flows played a critical role for Europe as it sought to replace lost Russian pipeline volumes. In total, U.S. LNG grew to 15 percent of all EU gas imports in 2022. Policymakers and officials on both sides of the Atlantic have touted this result as a demonstration of the ongoing strategic partnership between Europe and the United States. In June 2022, in a joint statement on European energy security, President Biden and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “While Russia has cut supplies of natural gas to several EU Member States, the United States and other producers have stepped up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In remarks at the North American Gas Forum in October 2023, U.S. assistant secretary for energy resources Geoffrey R. Pyatt noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I travel around the world, especially in Europe, the message I always hear is hurray for American LNG producers. There is great appreciation for the role that American producers have played, especially in this period of Russia-caused disruption. From a strategic and foreign policy standpoint it’s a good thing that our export capacity, our liquefaction capacity is going to grow as much as it is over the next couple of years as we look out towards 2025, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines of communication and coordination afforded by the task force were crucial in enabling ad hoc diplomatic efforts on energy matters. A notable example of this occurred in February 2022 when Japan agreed to divert LNG cargoes to Europe following determined diplomatic engagement with U.S. and EU officials. However, much of the result was independent of direct government action. The United States has no institutional mechanisms by which to direct LNG exports to specific markets, countries, or customers. Instead, decisions on long-term investment, production, and export destinations are market-informed and taken by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduction and then abrupt cutoff in Russian pipeline volumes were, in effect, an exogenous, outward shift in the LNG demand curve and have resulted in a new, far higher equilibrium point for European LNG prices. This created the price signal, as reflected by the historic highs of the TTF European gas price index, for firms to redirect LNG shipments to the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. LNG export industry possesses unique flexibility to respond to price relative to the rest of the global LNG market. Most U.S. export volumes are sold through a free-on-board contract model that gives buyers ownership of cargoes at the export terminal and offers destination flexibility. This leaves buyers free to send cargo wherever they wish based on commercial considerations — typically the market that can command the highest price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contracting structures have facilitated a shift from long-term point-to-point contracts toward a “portfolio player” model in which firms buy up a large pool of contracts for their own procurement needs and resell to whatever market commands the highest premiums. Portfolio players make up a growing share of U.S. supply deals and have played a key role in shifting LNG volumes to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortuitous market conditions have also created spare capacity and have made redirection of LNG volumes to Europe feasible. In China, slowed economic growth and Covid-19-related restrictions reduced energy demand, driving LNG imports 20 percent lower year over year and thereby freeing up over 20 bcm of LNG for other destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K08sxto.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 13: U.S. Export Destinations by Region, 2018–23.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_move_expc_s1_a.htm&quot;&gt;“U.S. Natural Gas Exports and Re-Exports by Country,” U.S. Energy Information Administration, June 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dramatic shift of volumes away from Asia to Europe highlights how the European energy crisis cascaded effects globally. From the global perspective, successful transatlantic partnerships to redirect LNG volumes are viewed less positively. The primary Asian gas price index, JKM, effectively traded at parity with the TTF European gas price index throughout the energy crisis (see Figure 4). Many Asian buyers of LNG, both private and government buyers, were exposed to price volatility and energy insecurity sourced ultimately from the European crisis. Lower-income countries such as Pakistan suffered from energy shortages even as Europe largely succeeded in averting such shortages. These outcomes undoubtedly have consequences for future energy strategy and wider geopolitical developments in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LNG Infrastructure Construction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most relevant measures to substitute Russian gas is the construction of new LNG terminals. The majority of these projects have involved the rapid and cost-effective construction of new floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), totaling 16 projects, in addition to the expansions of 11 existing LNG terminals. Germany did not have any LNG terminals when the war erupted; it pushed through FSRU permitting and “onshore connections in record time,” with the first FSRU coming online in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NIlLxAC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14: Existing and Planned EU LNG Infrastructure, 2021–27.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieefa.org/european-lng-tracker&quot;&gt;“European LNG Tracker,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, February 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise in LNG imports positioned the European Union as the world’s largest LNG importer in 2023, ahead of other traditionally bigger importers such as China and Japan. One of the fears of this rapid development of LNG terminals is the risk of building overcapacity that is eventually not used, as happened on the Iberian Peninsula in recent decades. The disparity between Europe’s LNG capacity and demand is widening in a context of significant infrastructure expansions and LNG imports plateauing since late 2022. The utilization rate of Europe’s LNG terminals averaged 58 percent in early 2023, prompting questions about the necessity of further infrastructure expansion, projected until 2027. However, as noted by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, around 80 percent of capacity additions between 2022 and 2024 were FSRUs, which allow for the repurposing or relocation of floating infrastructure at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are plans to establish four onshore conventional plants, with construction timelines scheduled between 2023 and 2027. Germany has been the main player in this expansion following the approval in record time of the LNG Acceleration Act, which involves the federal government in infrastructure development. This approach has marked a significant departure from prior policies, with the state actively engaging in project implementation, including direct involvement in financing and operational oversight. Most operators of the new Germany LNG plants are expected to switch to climate-neutral hydrogen by 2044 at the latest. But the exact timing, techno-economic feasibility, and adherence to these timetables remain to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Croatia, Greece, and Italy have also been very active in the construction and expansion of new LNG terminals and hope to serve as a gateway for gas to neighboring landlocked countries such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. Two infrastructure initiatives stand out. First, the Vertical Corridor, presented in January 2024, will make it possible to transport natural gas from Greece and Bulgaria to Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. The pipeline is expected to extend to Moldova and underground storage facilities in Ukraine, increasing natural gas import and storage options for one of Gazprom’s remaining export markets in Europe. Both Greek and EU subsidies have enabled the construction of pipelines that span the country and connect to a new import terminal that will provide Central and Eastern Europe with gas for decades to come. Greece’s ambition to become a key European LNG import hub has been aided by forceful lobbying efforts from U.S. officials for European nations to use Greece’s new terminal and pipelines. Second, the Adriatica pipeline will allow Italy to reconfigure its gas flows, traditionally designed to go in a north-south direction. With this improved transmission network, Italy will be able to export gas entering from the south (i.e., from Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Libya), in addition to exporting LNG to northern neighbors, especially Austria and, subsequently, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPE DRAMATICALLY CURTAILS DEMAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the significant supply-side shocks, natural gas demand in the European Union declined by 55 bcm, or 13 percent, in 2022 — the steepest year-over-year fall in history. By March 2024, gas consumption in the European Union had decreased by 24 percent compared to March 2021. There was a robust public campaign to save electricity, encouraging Europeans to turn down thermostats, take shorter showers, and turn off nonessential lighting. The lights on the Eiffel Tower, for instance, were turned off at night. These efforts had considerable impact, as EU-wide electricity demand declined by 3.4 percent in 2023 compared to 2022 and was 6.4 percent lower than its pre-crisis level in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest decline in natural gas use was among the three main consumers: EU households to generate heat, the energy sector to generate electricity, and the industrial sector to manufacture final products such as ammonia, fuels, ceramics, and paper. Although gas demand in the electricity sector temporarily increased during 2022 due to the decline in nuclear and hydroelectric power, this trend reversed in 2023 thanks to a significant increase in renewables, lower electricity consumption, and improved nuclear and hydro output. The buildings sector experienced a reduction of almost 20 percent in the winters of 2022 and 2023, attributed to milder weather, behavioral changes in response to high prices, increased fuel poverty, efficiency improvements, and record heat pump installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the industrial sector, gas consumption has fallen by around 25 percent between 2021 and 2022, mainly due to reduced production and, to a lesser extent, fuel switching. Some factors, such as price-sensitive fuel switching in the refining sector or weather effects, are expected to be temporary. Others, such as increased renewable capacity, improved efficiency, the adoption of heat pumps, and permanent industrial plant closures, are structural and lead to lasting, sometimes undesired reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RENEWABLES DRAMATICALLY EXPAND AND INCREASE EUROPE’S RESILIENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s expansion of renewables prior to the crisis helped reduce the impact of the crisis and gave Europe greater energy resilience. Renewable energy played a considerable role in meeting shortfalls in the electricity sector from lower hydroelectric and nuclear output. Renewables output increased by 80 TWh year over year in 2022 and another 87 TWh in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, wind and solar represented 22 percent of EU electricity generation, overtaking natural gas for the first time. Solar capacity was rapidly deployed during the crisis, pushing installed capacity to 256 GW in 2023, a 56 percent increase versus 2021. Wind capacity also grew, albeit far slower than solar, even as the sector struggled with considerable supply chain and financial difficulties (Figure 16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n7LH8fw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid deployment of renewables, primarily solar, has been fueled by record-high wholesale prices improving the financial attractiveness of renewables, by member state and commission efforts to ease permitting processes, and by the continuing fall in solar costs due to expanding Chinese solar manufacturing capacity. The development of distributed solar, especially rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems in households and businesses, has been one of the great social responses to the energy crisis, becoming a widespread phenomenon in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside trade challenges, the massive expansion of solar has created new internal challenges for electricity markets. In Germany, the expansion of solar has created price cannibalization “leading to destruction of solar hour prices and solar profitability,” a result that should lead to slower expansion, according to an SEB Research report. With installed solar capacity in Germany now over 82 GW, output on a typical sunny day far exceeds the average demand of roughly 52 GW. Spain is having a similar situation, where power is at times “almost free” due to solar production. For countries with deep solar penetration, the only conceivable path for continued expansion in the solar segment is matching investment in energy storage and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biogas is a small, easily overlooked but significant area of renewable energy expansion. The anticipated increase in domestic biogas and biomethane production is projected to partially offset the decline in conventional gas production. Over the past decade and supported by generous subsidy packages, the European Union has witnessed a doubling in its production of biogas and biomethane, reaching approximately 19 bcm in 2022, which equates to around 6 percent of final EU gas consumption. The REPowerEU plan aims to achieve a combined volume of 35 bcm by 2030, nearly doubling current production levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKET INTEGRATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, European resilience has been greatly boosted by existing cross-border infrastructure networks and markets. Gaps in supply or infrastructure in one country can be offset by the capabilities of another — a result physically enabled by pipeline and electric transmission networks and commercially enabled by common market systems. For example, Germany did not possess any LNG import terminals until its first FSRU came online in December 2022. Before this, Germany was nonetheless able to access LNG supplies through shipments arriving at EU ports in countries such as the Netherlands. Europe benefited from the continued operation of infrastructure and markets because, on the whole, European countries refrained from hoarding energy, nationalizing energy supplies, or restricting outbound sales. This unity was matched on the demand side as Europeans collectively cut demand for gas and electricity in more or less similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We had some strong reserves in the form of gas which we could capitalize on. . . . We looked at how we could, first of all, handle our own needs and then how we could play a significant role in enabling neighboring countries to get out of this situation. . . . At the same time, renewables was where we doubled down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was rapid movement to complete new interconnection projects, where possible, to create greater resilience. By May 2022, the Baltic states had enabled new interconnections with Poland. By September 2023, the Baltic Pipe was completed, connecting Poland to Norwegian gas supplies through Denmark, which was crucial for improving the energy security situation of the most exposed eastern EU members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;country-level-fiscal-and-regulatory-response&quot;&gt;Country-Level Fiscal and Regulatory Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis and the increase in wholesale energy prices in Europe prompted governments to put in place measures to shield consumers from the direct impact of rising prices, protect strategic assets, and secure the energy supply. There were fears of a deep European recession as well as concerns about inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many European governments relied on fiscal spending to keep industries afloat and alleviate the costs to the public. According to a Bruegel report, the national fiscal policy responses to the energy crisis in the European Union reached €540 billion, of which €158 billion was earmarked by Germany alone. Separately, the United Kingdom provided €103 billion in fiscal support. The different fiscal capacities of member states within the European Union, both in terms of revenue levels and indebtedness, resulted in an overall unbalanced response that created tensions among member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank also found that the crisis contributed “to a deterioration in the current account balance of the euro area, from 2.2% of GDP in 2019 to –1.0% of GDP in 2022. Both deficit and surplus countries were affected.” This has limited Europe’s fiscal capacity to invest in defense, support Ukraine, and further fund the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these financial outlays demonstrate that European states had the fiscal and policymaking capacity to shield their economies from the worst effects of the crisis. As noted, both before the crisis and in the early stages, there was a widespread assumption that the loss of access to Russian natural gas would plunge the European Union into a deep recession. Some economists predicted a 10 percent decline in German output and the loss of 2–3 million jobs. Fiscal outlays, effective substitution to other energy suppliers, and demand reduction measures prevented a deep economic recession. Instead, as Moll, Schularick, and Zachmann concluded in a Brookings study in September 2023, “Overall, while the German economy is stagnating and faces substantial long-run headwinds, the direct economic costs of the end of Russian energy imports proved moderate and manageable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight other EU countries were more dependent on Russian energy than Germany in 2022, including Finland, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovakia Greece, for instance, spent about 5 percent of GDP, or about €10 billion, on energy support measures, with most of the funding directed at subsidizing household energy bills. Yet despite the price shock, Greece reduced its energy imports from Russia by more than 70 percent, much more than the EU average of 37 percent. Despite the costs and the price shock, industrial production grew by 2.3 percent in 2022, with the economy growing overall by nearly 6 percent. In the Netherlands, consumption of natural gas dropped by roughly 30 percent, but overall industrial output increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the summer of 2021, European governments have implemented various policies aimed at alleviating the impact of rising prices on consumers and businesses, including temporary reductions in energy taxes for transport fuels, natural gas, and electricity; retail energy price caps; energy tariff regulations; and support programs for energy-intensive industries. Europe also experienced a wave of energy utility nationalization, including Russian-controlled companies such as Gazprom Germania (now SEFE) and those overly exposed to Russian energy supplies and market volatility and in need of a bailout, such as Uniper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Germany’s €200 billion aid package allowed large-scale consumers to apply for a gas block tariff and pay 70 percent of their gas use, calculated over the previous year’s consumption, at a subsidized cost of €0.70 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Additionally, governments made efforts to stabilize wholesale prices and ensure energy security by promoting energy savings and capping energy costs, particularly for wholesale electricity and gas. Some countries also attempted to reform energy markets, while windfall taxes targeted inframarginal power generators, crude refiners, and upstream producers in a temporary and exceptional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries also implemented direct transfers, such as discounts at gas stations or vouchers — frequently for vulnerable households — often at high cost for a dubious return. One widespread practice, often by regional or local authorities, was to reduce public transport fares, encouraging the use of public transport instead of private vehicles as a fuel-saving measure. However, criticism arose due to the failure of many measures to specifically target vulnerable groups, instead focusing on mitigating social and political unrest. The prevalence of untargeted price-distorting measures contradicted the need to incentivize energy conservation and honor existing commitments to the energy transition and to curve fossil fuel subsidies. However, despite some of these measures, demand declined significantly in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fiscal costs, the energy crisis further fueled inflation in Europe. The European Central Bank found that “high energy and commodity prices and supply bottlenecks have driven strong inflation in the euro area and higher inflation differentials between euro area countries.” Countries with greater dependence on Russian energy, such as Latvia, suffered inflation rates above 10 percent. Unlike the United States, where inflation was mainly demand driven, the supply shock in the European Union generated by the higher energy prices and the significant import dependency was responsible for the lion’s share of inflation in 2022–23. For example, headline inflation averaged 9.3 percent in Greece in 2022, driven largely by surging energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-policy-response&quot;&gt;EU Policy Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine caught the European Union off guard. The EU institutions had largely focused on the climate dimensions of energy policy and not on the security of supply, which was seen as the responsibility of member states. Yet Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demanded a collective EU response. The European Union helped ensure a unified response and set direction for its member states, from creating collective agreement on the need to decouple from Russian energy to setting targets for demand reduction and ensuring that Europe would not abandon its climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe demonstrated its unity in the Versailles declaration of March 11, 2022. Although the declaration was an informal and nonbinding document, it demonstrated the political will of European leaders to take a step forward and reinforce the bloc’s strategic autonomy, especially in three directions: bolstering defense capabilities, reducing energy dependencies, and building a more robust economic base. On the energy front, the declaration called on the European Commission to present REPowerEU, a plan to address the energy shock and ensure that the need to decouple from Russian energy would not undermine the climate ambitions embodied by the EU Green Deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU, primarily a declaratory document of the European Commission, provides the states with the tools (e.g., budget and legislative mechanisms) to implement the proposals it contains. While some of the measures and targets set out in REPowerEU have subsequently been incorporated into the EU acquis (EU law), such as the 2030 renewable energy targets, others have been ignored or rendered obsolete, such as those related to imported renewable hydrogen. The REPowerEU budget was set at approximately €300 billion, with around 75 percent funded through loans from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (NextGenerationEU funds) and the remaining 25 percent coming from grants funded by the auctioning of additional Emissions Trading System allowances and other EU sources. Member states could access this funding by including REPowerEU measures in their national recovery and resilience plans, which the European Commission then evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU outlined an ambitious strategy aimed at accelerating the deployment of renewable energy across power generation, industry, buildings, and transport sectors, and proposed raising the 2030 renewable energy target set under the Fit for 55 packages from 40 percent to 45 percent. These included a dedicated EU solar strategy to double solar PV capacity by 2025 and reach 600 GW by 2030, alongside the Solar Rooftops Initiative mandating installation of solar panels on new public, commercial, and residential buildings. REPowerEU also highlighted efforts to double the deployment rate of heat pumps, integrate geothermal and solar thermal energy into modernized heating systems, and streamline the permitting process for major renewable projects. Additionally, the commission aimed to establish a target of 20 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030, half of it to be imported, and launched a Biomethane Action Plan to boost production to 35 bcm by the same date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU also catalyzed a legislative proposal to establish the minimum gas storage mandate. This storage mandate set the target for 80 percent filling by November 1, 2022, and 90 percent filling by subsequent winters. In addition, gas storage infrastructure is now considered critical infrastructure and is under scrutiny from EU authorities to avoid external interferences. The new gas storage regulation establishes coordinated gas refueling operations, including joint procurement, aggregation of orders and supplies, and optimization and improved transparency of gas infrastructure. REPowerEU proposed coordinated demand reduction strategies and a solidarity mechanism in the European Union in case of gas supply disruptions. It was accompanied by a recommendation for member states to take voluntary measures to maintain a collective reduction in gas demand of 15 percent, compared to average demand between April 2017 and March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the natural gas side, REPowerEU established a framework for collective procurement of non-Russian LNG, extending participation to all interested member states, as well as Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and the Western Balkans. The idea behind this platform, which is already functioning, is to increase transparency in the EU gas market, complementing the existing hubs to bring as many gas consumers as possible closer to the wholesale market and attract new operators to the growing European LNG market. In particular, the platform hopes to increase the bargaining power of landlocked European countries, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, in their process of energy diversification and access to import terminals in other member states. The European Union’s joint gas purchasing platform, AggregateEU, has shown some initial success in matching gas supply with demand, attracting significant participation from companies and suppliers in its first rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, its overall effectiveness remains uncertain due to limited transparency on the contractual outcomes and prices achieved through the platform. While the initiative has facilitated connections between buyers and sellers, the added value over existing market mechanisms is questionable, as the current EU gas market already supports effective demand aggregation and access to LNG supplies for landlocked countries thanks to EU rules on third-party access to pipelines. Despite this, AggregateEU, originally designed as a temporary mechanism, is now a permanent facility incorporated into the EU gas and hydrogen package. Similar schemes are expected in the future to aggregate purchases of hydrogen and critical minerals at the EU level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transatlantic-cooperation&quot;&gt;Transatlantic Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the magnitude of the security and energy crisis Europe faced dawned on leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, they quickly initiated effective transatlantic cooperation on energy matters. Yet the energy dimension of the crisis meant that the United States needed to engage with the European Union as opposed to NATO. Relations between the United States and EU institutions have occasionally been fraught, and the United States has rarely prioritized them. Yet the crisis changed the dynamic, with the United States and European Union engaging extensively, especially on energy and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A March 2022 joint U.S.-EU announcement established a new Task Force on European Energy Security. This grouping has since met 11 times and has been an effective vehicle for transatlantic communication and coordination on energy issues, enabled by high-level leadership and participation on both sides. Task force members include Björn Seibert, head of cabinet for the European Commission president; Amos Hochstein, U.S. senior adviser for energy security; Ditte Juul Jørgensen, European Commission director general for energy; and Sarah Ladislaw, special assistant to the president and senior director for climate and energy at the White House National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force has enabled much more robust U.S.-EU engagement in relation to the energy dimension of this crisis. U.S. LNG has been a major topic of the task force, including discussing “global LNG markets and market projections, the regulatory environment and permitting outlook in the United States and the EU, the development of U.S. LNG export capacities, the reinforcement of EU LNG infrastructure, and the EU Energy Platform and Joint Purchasing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-sanctions-on-the-russian-energy-sector&quot;&gt;EU Sanctions on the Russian Energy Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has phased in sanctions on the Russian energy sector (Figure 17), seeking to minimize the negative impact on EU member states while still affecting Russian finances. EU law mandates that member states in the Council of the European Union unanimously approve sanctions, requiring the acquiescence of all EU states in order to come into force. The mandate has substantially limited the ambition of this instrument, holding back sanctions on Russian gas or nuclear fuel and requiring several country-specific exceptions when sanctioning crude oil or oil products. Sanctions have sought to reconcile national interests within the European Union and have run parallel to the unfolding war and the energy crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u91j3Fo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 17: EU Sanctions on Russian Imports Evolution, 2022–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first round of sanctions focused on limiting the access of Russian banks to the international financial system and the transfer of technology to the Russian energy sector. Coal was the first Russian energy source that the European Union sanctioned. The ban on imports of all Russian coal was agreed to in April 2022 as part of the fifth package of sanctions against Russia, granting a four-month grace period for existing contracts. Coal sanctions were relatively easy to agree upon thanks to a high level of self-sufficiency in Europe (75 percent in 2021), the short-term nature of coal contracts (around 90 days), and the relative availability of alternative suppliers in the Atlantic basin (e.g., Colombia, South Africa, and the United States).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case for EU sanctions on Russian oil was more complicated. Sanctions on seaborne oil imports were agreed to in June 2022, with a six-month grace period and an opt-out provided for Bulgaria, exemplifying the complexities of negotiations in the Council of the European Union. At the time of the negotiations, Russian state-owned Lukoil’s refinery in Burgas, Bulgaria, was the largest industrial complex in the country, originally designed to process exclusively Ural-grade crude oil. Following sustained negotiations, Bulgaria obtained a “‘special derogation’ from the measure until the end of 2024 due to its ‘geographical exposure’” as a means to achieve unanimity in the council. The exception subsequently proved a loophole for sanctions evasion, and Bulgaria voluntarily withdrew from the exemption. Bulgaria is now seeking options to sell the Lukoil refinery to new owners willing to inject the investment necessary to allow the facility to process non-Russian crude varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian oil pipeline imports have also been temporarily exempted from EU sanctions. Central European countries, especially the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, citing their landlocked geography and the difficulties of switching their refineries to different crudes, obtained a temporary allowance for imports from the Druzhba pipeline. These countries, which continue to import Russian crude oil through this infrastructure, state that they will continue to do so in the medium term while building new import pipelines and upgrading their refining capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany and Poland agreed to eliminate their temporary exception and cease imports of Russian crude oil by pipeline on January 1, 2023. In exchange, the commission allowed Kazakhstan to export oil to Germany through Russian pipelines. Although this technically is a move to eliminate Russian crude imports, Kazakhstan’s oil, which must be supplied through the Russian transmission system, inevitably mixes with Russian oil, and Moscow receives oil transit fees. The temporary measure allows inland German refineries to operate at full capacity and avoid bottlenecks in the pipeline transportation system from the seaports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An embargo on Russian-refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and kerosene) came into force in February 2023 and curbed EU imports of most Russian petroleum products. However, non-EU countries can import Russian oil, refine products, and export these to the European Union, in effect creating a loophole for indirect imports of Russian oil. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air has called China, India, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates “laundromats” for Russian oil, importing larger quantities of crude oil since the EU embargo while also growing export volumes of diesel and jet fuel to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to banning seaborne crude oil imports, the European Union has imposed several prohibitions regarding maritime services and access to its ports in relation to the oil trade between Russia and third countries. EU operators are barred from providing maritime services and insurance unless the trade adheres to the Group of Seven (G7) oil price cap. Vessels engaging in ship-to-ship transfers suspected of violating the Russian oil import ban or the G7 price cap are denied access to EU ports, as are vessels that manipulate or deactivate their navigation tracking systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These restrictions have not been applied to LNG shipping services and transport. European terminals are offering transshipment services to Russian gas tankers. From November to June, during the Arctic winter season, most Russian LNG coming from the Yamal region needs icebreakers to access international markets. To optimize the routes of these specialized vessels, the natural gas they transport is transferred to conventional LNG vessels, principally at the terminals of Zeebrugge in Belgium and Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, for subsequent export to non-European markets. The eleventh round of European sanctions on Russia included transshipments of petroleum and derivatives that did not comply with the maximum price stipulated by the G7, but it deliberately omitted transshipment of LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPLAINING THE LACK OF NUCLEAR SANCTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the drop in oil and gas trade between the European Union and Russia, imports of nuclear fuel products have steadily increased since February 2022. The absence of sanctions may be explained by the European Union’s unique dependence on Russian nuclear fuel products and, secondly, by the limited impact that sanctions have had on Russia’s trade balance and the Kremlin’s budget. According to Eurostat, the European Union imported only €572 million of Russian nuclear-related products in 2022. The European Union has continued purchasing nuclear technology and fuel from Russia for the 19 Soviet-designed water-water energetic reactors (VVERs) operating in five member states: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Slovakia. Replacing Russian fuel is not a simple task: it is not an easily substituted commodity, and it requires adapting capacities in nuclear power plants and obtaining alternative suppliers in a very tight market. EU countries have increased Russian nuclear fuel deliveries from 314 tons of nuclear fuel in 2022 to 573 tons in 2023, a result that may be due to stockpiling in case of expanded conflict or supply disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hungary is the only member state without explicit plans to transition to alternative fuel suppliers. The rest are pursuing alternate suppliers. The Czech Republic is poised to begin receiving Western-manufactured nuclear fuel from Westinghouse and, potentially, Framatome starting in late 2024. Slovakia, through its nuclear plant operator Slovenské Elektrárne, aims to introduce Westinghouse fuel by 2027 following a licensing agreement, although a newly elected Russia-friendly government may negatively affect the implementation of these plans. Finland is preparing to shift its Loviisa reactor units to non-Russian fuel between 2027 and 2030, having engaged in discussions with Westinghouse about fuel supply even before the onset of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPLAINING THE LACK OF GAS SANCTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of May 2024, the European Union has not imposed specific sanctions on Russian natural gas. While pipeline gas imports have fallen by four-fifths from 2019 levels following Russia’s weaponization of gas supplies, LNG imports from Russia remain above prewar levels. Sanctions on Russian gas have been a politically sensitive issue in Brussels. The unanimity required to impose sanctions is difficult to achieve due to the threat of further disruption of supplies disproportionately affecting countries most dependent on pipeline imports. Hungary’s opposition is an example of a significant obstacle to agreement in the Council of the European Union. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has sought to engage and work with the Kremlin even after the invasion, reaching an agreement for the purchase of additional volumes of gas and the diversion of its Russian gas imports away from Ukrainian pipelines to the TurkStream pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its recent Regulation on Gas and Hydrogen Networks, the European Union has implemented a mechanism which allows member states to temporarily block Russian and Belarusian exporters from reserving infrastructural capacity for natural gas shipments via pipeline and LNG. This mechanism, which has to be implemented voluntarily at the state level, would allow European companies to terminate their contracts by invoking force majeure clauses and protect themselves against possible arbitration. Because this mechanism does not constitute an EU-wide ban or sanction, it circumvents the unanimity standard. While European commissioner for energy Kadri Simson has urged member states to use this mechanism, it is uncertain whether the mechanism will be implemented in a coordinated and effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe actively sought to decouple from Russian coal and oil, it did not collectively seek to decouple from Russian gas. Instead, Europe has been forced to scramble due to the collapse in supply. Europe has not sanctioned Russian gas, though it is now considering sanctioning LNG. The reduction in purchases of Russian natural gas has been mainly due to lower volumes shipped through Nord Stream (out of operation) and Yamal (closed due to the Kremlin’s requirement to make payments in rubles). The transit contract through Ukraine for Russian gas expires on December 31, 2024. Its future is unknown. Although Ukraine has announced its refusal to negotiate bilaterally with Gazprom, it has opened the door to possible contracted volumes on the spot market for interested European countries — mainly Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia. This uncertainty about the future of Ukrainian pipelines and the creation of a possible European mechanism to block Russian LNG imports should help to further reduce Russian gas imports in 2025 and 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-european-energy-security-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a New European Energy Security Strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe came through the crisis, but challenges remain. From a supply perspective, Europe has found a way to replace Russian gas. But these are largely from sources external to the European Union, and the costs of these alternative sources are higher and will therefore impact Europe’s economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electricity-market-reform&quot;&gt;Electricity Market Reform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricity sector emerged from the 2022 energy crisis as a major locus of energy security considerations for policymakers. The surges in electricity pricing devastated consumers, both households and businesses, and cascaded shocks from the natural gas sector throughout the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status of marginal pricing sits at the center of the debate. During the crisis, numerous ad hoc interventions into the electricity market were proposed; some were implemented to reduce consumer exposure to spot prices set by marginal pricing. After the crisis, the sector emerged with newfound political relevance, which catalyzed widespread interest in reforming markets based on the lessons of 2022. Nonetheless, widespread consensus on the need for review and reform in the sector does not imply widespread agreement on the substance of that reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key objectives appear in conflict. On one hand, reform seeks to limit the exposure of electricity consumers to volatile pricing sourced from gas-fired generation and their ability to benefit from the low prices of new renewable generation. This implies limiting consumer exposure to prices set via marginal pricing in the market. On the other hand, massive volumes of investment must be attracted to the sector to make continued progress on decarbonization. This includes investment in wind and solar generation, but expanded investment is of increasing importance in technologies such as battery storage and hydrogen-fired generation, which can help balance the intermittency of renewables. Broadly stated, price signals, free of regulatory risk and reflective of overall system scarcity, are the best way to attract private capital at scale. Furthermore, price signals are the crucial incentive for demand response programs, the expansion of which is a crucial objective for overall sectoral efficiency and managing the intermittency of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We are moving from a fuel-based system to a technology based one, but this change is not happening overnight in the sense that you need to manage the risks and the complexities. . . . And as we are planning our transition to a technology-based system where materials, equipment, manufacturing capacity, critical raw materials are key in this sense, we . . . are trying both in terms of technologies and in terms of geographies (to find) complementarity that we can leverage if we operate in different systems. And of course, this has a big impact on the energy security of a . . . region like Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initial package of reforms was proposed in March 2023, and following a sustained period of negotiations, the Council of the European Union approved a final package in March 2024. Overall, this package yielded considerable incremental reform while resisting more radical changes that sought to move away from a single marginal market clearing price determined by merit order dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package empowers EU member states to deploy fixed-price and fixed-term contracts, which can come in the form of power purchase agreements or contracts for differences (CFDs). Both contracts are already in use across EU member states to varying extents, but the new rules direct member states to make these contract arrangements available to consumers and project developers and, in particular, allow for contracts that cross national borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule also creates room for member states to deploy new capacity support mechanisms. In U.S. electricity markets such as PJM, capacity markets are a well-established mechanism to manage long-term resource adequacy. They create a second vector, independent of spot marginal pricing, by which funds can flow from consumers to generators organized around the principle of availability at periods of peak demand. Germany has proposed exactly such a mechanism to attract investment into the hydrogen-fired thermal power plants it needs to build to balance out renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty remains over how member states will interpret and implement the EU reform package. The proposal invokes various design principles, with which both capacity mechanisms and CFDs should comply. The exact technical limits of these principles and the enforcement of these limits remain to be seen and will determine the overall impact of the reform package. Overall, the package seeks a tenuous balance between further integration of a competitive European electricity market to the benefit of efficient decarbonization and the need to preserve member states’ ability to procure generation resources in line with their specific national strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banking-on-hydrogen-the-eu-hydrogen-strategy-and-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Banking on Hydrogen: The EU Hydrogen Strategy and Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to Europe’s energy security and climate ambitions are the development and deployment of green hydrogen. Hydrogen was already an essential component of the EU decarbonization strategy before Russia invaded Ukraine. However, it took on a renewed and more prominent role in EU energy plans as the bloc sought to diversify away from Russian fossil fuel resources after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in previous chapters, REPowerEU was conceived at the height of the energy crisis to diversify the European Union away from Russian fossil fuels. By updating the Fit for 55 targets published only a year before, the initiative further galvanized the bloc’s clean energy ambitions. For hydrogen, it brought about two landmark changes. First, the European Union began targeting a market of 20 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030, doubling its initial commitment of 10 million tons produced by member states by importing 10 million tons from reliable suppliers across the globe. Second, support for low-carbon hydrogen derived from natural gas was tacitly phased out, and plans for government funding were scratched. This lack of support was a ramification of natural gas supply disruptions during the energy crisis jeopardizing hydrogen-dependent industries, such as ammonia producers and refining operations, as well as the premise that high gas prices made low-carbon hydrogen obsolete as a transitional stand-in for renewable hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To match the doubling of supply targets, demand targets for end-use sectors received a commensurate boost (Figure 18). Industry saw an increase in the share of renewable hydrogen consumption in the sector from 35 percent to 75 percent by 2030. Meanwhile, the transport sector nearly doubled its 2030 target for consumption of renewable fuels of nonbiological origin. The Hydrogen Valleys initiative also had its funds topped up in hopes of doubling the number of hydrogen valleys in the European Union by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bVr45c9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 18: Hydrogen Consumption 2030 Targets by End-Use Sector.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=SWD%3A2022%3A230%3AFIN&quot;&gt;“Commission Staff Working Document: Implementing the REPowerEU Action Plan: Investment Needs, Hydrogen Accelerator and Achieving the Bio-Methane Targets,” European Commission, May 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these objectives have faced substantial criticism due to the unrealistic targets on both the supply and demand sides. A recent report warns that the European Union is not on track to deploy enough renewables or electrolyzers to meet its production targets by 2030, while the outlook on imports is still uncertain. Meanwhile, consumption targets rely on unconsolidated end uses and lagging adoption in existing demand sectors. Industry executives have pointed out that the high cost of renewable hydrogen proves a major barrier to wider adoption, warranting a reassessment of initial targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SECURING SUPPLIES THROUGH HYDROGEN DIPLOMACY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already a core component in the EU hydrogen strategy, the international dimension has become central to achieving REPowerEU’s goal of importing up to 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen. Through so-called “green hydrogen partnerships,” the European Union will not only seek to meet its import quota while supporting clean energy project development in partner countries but also unlock the generational opportunity to rewire its energy partnerships and diversify its resource dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU envisions the development of three hydrogen corridors via the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, and through Ukraine, once conditions allow. This ambition has led the European Union through the development of strategic partnerships with Azerbaijan, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Namibia, Norway, and Oman, among others. The European Commission has also held talks with Saudi Arabia to increase energy cooperation, with hydrogen as a central pillar. On the transatlantic front, the European Union has already developed a hydrogen partnership with Canada and is looking to expand those partnerships into Latin America. Lastly, the United States is poised to become one of the leading renewable hydrogen markets, thanks to the incentives and tax credits contained within the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In a bid to share this cornucopia, the Mission Possible Partnership is looking to spur U.S.-EU hydrogen trade opportunities by enabling Europe’s first shipment of clean hydrogen from the United States in 2026. All of these partnerships offer the European Union plenty of avenues for renewable hydrogen import supply diversification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-dependencies-risks-posed-by-clean-tech-supply-chains&quot;&gt;New Dependencies? Risks Posed by Clean Tech Supply Chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Europe seeks to further accelerate a clean transition that improves its overall energy security position, it faces new dilemmas in the domains of trade and economic security. The rapid expansion in renewable energy development has been characterized as merely shifting dependencies from Russia to China. As described by U.S. assistant secretary for energy resources Geoffrey R. Pyatt at the 2024 CSIS Energy Security and Geopolitics Conference, “We need to make sure that we don’t replace an era of dependence on Russian fossil fuels with dependence on critical minerals and critical mineral processing in the People’s Republic of China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new dependencies are real. Europe is 95 percent import dependent on China for solar PV panels. The European wind sector, which has for a long time been self-supplied, is coming under intense competitive pressure from Chinese firms and could be competed out of existence in the way German solar manufacturing was by Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actual and potential import dependencies pose challenges for policymakers. However, analytical clarity demands they be classified as trade or economic risks rather than energy security risks. Unlike gas or other fuel imports, there is very little risk to the short-term stability of the European energy system from a hypothetical interruption in access to Chinese solar panels. In short, Europe is currently trading reduced energy security risk for increased trade and economic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of trade and the economic risks are complicated. The availability of ultra-low-cost (and increasingly cheaper) Chinese solar panels and wind turbines lowers the overall investment cost of Europe’s climate ambitions. The value here should not be overlooked given the massive fiscal outlays the energy crisis imposes; for the European Union, the efficient use of public funds and subsidy capacity are ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversely, allowing Chinese imports to overwhelm and destroy the viability of European clean manufacturing companies has economic, social, and political costs. Expanding the manufacturing employment base associated with climate technologies to improve the overall standing of climate politics is the central political-economic thesis of the IRA and is a model with considerable support in Europe (especially in the European Commission). Allowing Chinese imports to displace extant industries and jobs is likely to cause political backlash that undermines EU climate ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Trying to define an industrial strategy in Europe of what we want to produce and how we want to produce it in this global competition between America and China . . . is a really hard thing to do [when you need] unanimous agreement among 27 EU member states. And in my mind, that’s the kind of shaping energy and climate question of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ben-mcwilliams-affiliate-fellow-bruegel&quot;&gt;— Ben McWilliams, Affiliate Fellow, Bruegel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade and economic competition concerns extend beyond China. The IRA implemented subsidies for clean energy manufacturing and successfully attracted large volumes of private capital investment. These subsidies apply to countries that hold a free trade agreement with the United States (e.g., Canada and Mexico). Notably, the European Union lacks any such free trade agreements. Thus, European-based manufacturing cannot participate in these subsidies — most notably, the electric vehicle tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade and economic risks of clean energy supply chains extend past technology and into the domain of raw materials. Europe is structurally short of the minerals critical to most modern clean technology. For example, the European Union is solely dependent on one country for heavy rare-earth elements (100 percent supplied by China), boron (98 percent supplied by Turkey), and platinum (71 percent supplied by South Africa). Recognizing that the bloc will never be self-sufficient but should diversify its supply of critical raw materials, the European Council adopted the European Critical Raw Materials Act in March 2024. Again, the direct comparison to fuel dependencies is inappropriate and represents a trade and economic risk rather than an energy security risk. Although Europe has some domestic mining and processing capacity — notably in the Nordic states — it is heavily dependent on raw materials and, more extensively, on processed materials used as inputs in higher-value manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vector of risk arrives through expanded Chinese clean energy investments in Europe. On a recent trip to Europe, Chinese president Xi Jinping traveled to Hungary, where it was recently announced that China would be opening new battery factories. China appears to be cultivating Hungary as a bastion of support in the European Union in the hopes that it will shield China from potential joint EU measures, akin to the role Hungary has played vis-à-vis Russian sanctions. Hungary has frequently blocked EU statements condemning or opposing Chinese action. In this respect, although clean energy supply chains can help reduce European energy security risks, they invite considerable risks in the domain of trade policy and, perhaps more troubling, undermine Europe’s ability to form coherent foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-and-different-gas-risks&quot;&gt;New and Different Gas Risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Russian gas “weapon” is unlikely to ever pose the energy security risk to Europe that it posed before the crisis. This holds true even though Russian gas continues to flow into the European market, albeit at greatly reduced volumes, through both pipelines and LNG imports. Commercial developments, infrastructure investments, and political commitments have structurally reduced European reliance on Russian gas, and volumes are unlikely to ever return to precrisis levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many businesses may be open to a return to Russian gas, political endorsement or support for this strategy by European policymakers today appears unlikely so long as Putin remains in the Kremlin. For Europe to reengage Russia as an energy supplier, major political change in Moscow or a favorable end to the war that preserves Ukraine’s path to Europe is likely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversification is the most reliable principle by which to measure energy security, as established most famously by British statesman Winston Churchill in 1920: “Safety and certainty in oil lie in variety and variety alone.” Today, the diversification of suppliers, import vectors, and regional exposure of natural gas imports has to some extent structurally improved European energy security. However, it would be naive and simplistic to think Europe is free of gas-derived energy security risks. Today, European exposure has shifted elsewhere. Norway’s leading role in European gas markets makes sabotage against Norwegian undersea infrastructure a risk; such an event, timed with winter or storage-filling season, could drive gas shortages and price spikes in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Europe continues to rely on imports from states in North Africa and the Middle East, which could easily present diplomatic complications and provide leverage against European objectives. While recent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have demonstrated the vulnerabilities of sea lanes and LNG supply from the Persian Gulf, pipeline supply remains the most complex to manage. Gas from Algeria and Libya, accounting for more than 10 percent of EU imports, faces problems of flat or declining production, rapid growth in domestic consumption, and geopolitical risks. At least since the Arab Spring, the European Union has demonstrated profound limitations in influencing the Maghreb and building an attractive neighborhood narrative. In the case of the Southern Gas Corridor, Azerbaijan’s bellicose attitude in its conflict with Armenia presents a risk to EU interests and the defense of its principles in the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Europe now relies heavily on energy imports from the United States. Although the recent approval pause of a U.S. LNG export terminal does very little to affect current LNG flows and may very well do little to affect future flows, the development highlights how LNG exports have become a pawn in domestic politics. A hypothetical future with a climate-ambitious president in the White House with control of Congress could easily see scaled-back U.S. LNG exports, a result European climate advocates likely will applaud even as it may hurt European energy security. The nature of shale gas, based on short-cycle projects, means that without constant upstream investment, production may plateau or decline, jeopardizing the viability of continued expansion of LNG exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Europe is structurally exposed to global LNG markets in a way it never was before the crisis. Developments anywhere in the world that affect global LNG markets will affect the price and availability of LNG for Europe. This new exposure demands new, sustained, and serious attention from European policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-new-connective-midstream-and-integrating-europes-energy-market&quot;&gt;Building New Connective Midstream and Integrating Europe’s Energy Market&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has demonstrated the considerable reliability and efficiency value of integrated infrastructure and market networks. It also demonstrates how much further integration is possible and needed. The combined pressure of an ongoing energy decoupling from Russia and an accelerating energy transition requires Europe to invest in physical infrastructure — both electric transmission and pipeline networks — and advance the integrated market systems that extract maximum value out of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSMISSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric transmission played a crucial role in enabling European member states to avoid load-shedding situations through the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2022–23. Variable renewable energy (e.g., wind and solar) allows for reduced reliance on Russian gas in the power sector but requires greatly expanded intra- and intermember state transmission infrastructure to reduce curtailment rates and price cannibalization effects and allow for continued rapid deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We found ourselves in is this situation where suddenly NATO is having to police interconnector wires between different countries in Europe. . . . Managing the geopolitical complications of making a system where everybody has to have a certain amount of backup generation — and we’re going to utilize it strategically as an entity — [entails] data and physical challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-amy-myers-jaffe-research-professor-new-york-university&quot;&gt;— Amy Myers Jaffe, Research Professor, New York University&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 REPowerEU plan targets expanded electricity interconnection projects that cross member state boundaries and improve European electric integration. In November 2023, the European Commission proposed an action plan aimed at accelerating transmission project development and announced a list of 166 Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), 88 of which involved the electric system. The PCI designation grants projects considerable permitting advantages and makes them eligible for EU funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Notable examples of projects underway include the France-Spain interconnection and the Baltic synchronization project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmission projects, especially large, high-voltage interstate projects that deliver the most system value, are very costly and difficult to plan, permit, and build. Cross-border projects require difficult political coordination among member states and the ever-present challenge of social acceptability. Although planning and policy are improving and overall investment in grids is growing, research by Ember indicates that the grid investment plans of many European utilities fail to match member state renewable energy policy targets. Cost is the primary brake on expanded investment for both utilities and member states because the investment dollars are paid by rate payers who are already reeling from greatly elevated electricity prices. The CEF is funded at €5.84 billion through 2027, but the commission estimates €584 billion in investments are needed in the electric grid by 2030. The French-Spain interconnection project costs €2.8 billion alone, and Europe needs dozens of such projects if targets are to be met. In short, expanded funding at the EU level is likely necessary to achieve the European Commission interconnection target of 15 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIPELINES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fuels side, the considerable investment and expansion needed in pipeline networks pose a unique challenge. Many member states continue to rely on Russian piped oil and gas due to infrastructure constraints. Investment in new and expanded pipeline networks will help member states decouple further from Russia and improve overall European energy security and market stability. At the same time, if EU climate ambitions are to be realized, Europe must transition away from these fossil fuel networks. Right-sizing investment to achieve near- and medium-term energy security objectives without jeopardizing long-term climate targets is a difficult needle to thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has compelled the European Union to quickly invest in new gas infrastructure — both import terminals and internal transport capacity. However, these investments come with risk of carbon lock-in, as existing infrastructure tends to be used, thus delaying European energy transition objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generally agreed-upon solution is in dual-use infrastructure: today’s gas infrastructure should be built such that it can be used for the hydrogen networks of tomorrow. Although reasonable in concept, the engineering in practice is more complicated. LNG terminals in particular face challenges related to adaptation to low-carbon gases, such as hydrogen or low-carbon ammonia. The technical and economic feasibility of such conversions is still at an exploratory stage, with significant uncertainties surrounding the costs and efficiency of the conversion processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In delivering a substitute for Russian fossil-gas, the European Union’s strategic bet on decarbonized hydrogen has clear geopolitical and energy security benefits alongside obvious climate benefits. But the development of a functional hydrogen market and industrial ecosystem requires dedicated infrastructure to connect production and consumption centers, similar to the expansive existing gas transportation network. EU transmission system operators have proposed a hydrogen backbone to repurpose existing infrastructure dedicated to natural gas and complement it with new hydrogen-specific pipelines and storage sites. A major challenge is the unknown scale, composition, and geographic distribution of future hydrogen production and consumption centers. Investment of public or private dollars is therefore difficult to justify. Some mega projects, such as H2med, connecting Barcelona to Marseille via an undersea pipeline, have already been criticized for their lack of economic realism, sheer technical difficulty, and weak climate credentials. The sum of technology and market uncertainty and member state policy coordination challenges means that development of a European hydrogen infrastructure network and market will likely take longer and be more costly than assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protecting-critical-energy-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Protecting Critical Energy Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Nord Stream sabotage revealed the vulnerability of Europe’s critical energy infrastructure in the undersea domain. In October 2023, a group of undersea pipelines and telecom cables linking Finland to Estonia were also damaged and taken out of operation. In this case, the cause was identified as a Chinese ship dragging an anchor, although explicit motives have not been established. Europe is structurally exposed to hybrid threats such as these against the extensive undersea infrastructure networks in the Baltic and North Seas. Oil and gas pipelines are the traditional class of infrastructure in these waters. With the increased importance of Norwegian gas flows, the energy security imperative to protect these assets has grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One of the big lessons that came out of the energy crisis, and that still is coming, is that we did not have enough resilience in terms of our energy infrastructure. . . . Things could very easily come down. And that’s not energy security. . . . So, we need to build overcapacity. And to do that, we need to convince the private sector and insurers to keep building these assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-emily-holland-assistant-professor-us-naval-war-college&quot;&gt;— Emily Holland, Assistant Professor, U.S. Naval War College&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian ground forces have been depleted in Ukraine and Russia’s military industrial base has been stretched, the country’s capacity to inflict damage on European energy infrastructure remains intact. While Russia’s navy has been underfunded for years and consists largely of Soviet-era platforms, its underwater capacity continues to grow. Russia’s submarine program has been a noteworthy priority, exemplified by the Kremlin authorizing 13 new nuclear and conventional submarines since 2014. A CSIS report from 2023 notes, “Russia’s ability to target critical infrastructure short of war and impose economic costs to deter external intervention in regional conflicts is an important component to Moscow’s doctrine and thinking on escalation management.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the energy transition implies massive investment in offshore wind and undersea transmission in the Baltic, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Attacks on undersea electric transmission cables have not been observed to date but could create power grid disruptions that cascade failure across the network. Thus, the energy transition toward clean energy assets in many ways expands undersea critical infrastructure exposure. NATO has established a new operational group, the Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, to manage these risks. Appropriate levels of risk management likely require increased funding, as Europe and NATO will need to procure more operational assets to expand coverage, including traditional surface fleet assets alongside new technologies such as sea drones, sensor networks, and the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-transatlantic-energy-cooperation&quot;&gt;Expanding Transatlantic Energy Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has demonstrated the value of sustained transatlantic cooperation and coordination. During the crisis, European access to U.S. LNG was critical. After the crisis, Europe will remain reliant on U.S. LNG volumes over the medium term as it seeks to cement its energy decoupling from Russia. The U.S. LNG permitting pause has further demonstrated the value of established and close working relationships; policy decisions and impacts on both sides of the Atlantic can be accurately communicated and discussed, and diplomatic rifts can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of reliable partnerships in energy trade highlights the need and potential for greater U.S.-EU cooperation when it comes to broader clean technology and climate policy issues. Despite considerable U.S.-EU engagement in this area, there have been few breakthroughs. Sustained efforts to negotiate a green steel agreement have been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage of the IRA in the United States caused considerable diplomatic backlash in Europe, as it was felt that the policy unduly discriminated against European suppliers. The Biden administration has sought to soften the impact of the IRA on European suppliers, but there has been no movement on either side of the Atlantic toward a new U.S.-EU trade agreement despite the extensive engagement established through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are major energy and climate issues that require transatlantic partnership. The implementation of the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will put in place tariffs on carbon-intensive imports into the European Union. The European Union and United States should consider this an opportunity to coordinate on carbon-linked trade. They would also benefit from close coordination on climate and trade policies focused on China, such as with regard to electric vehicles, batteries, or critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis spawned many lessons relevant for experts and policymakers in a variety of fields. Most of the lessons are positive. Europe has come out of the crisis more energy secure and has demonstrated the resilience and strength of its European project. However, the crisis left a significant fiscal mark on European economies and, through price shock and inflationary effects, gave rise to more antiestablishment parties, many of which seek to roll back aspects of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracies and markets are resilient and durable and can survive shocks.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe showed tremendous strength and resilience in response to the energy shock. The energy shock became a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but also of Europe’s union and the resilience of its democratic political system, market economy, and free and open societies. Europe’s markets responded, creating incentives for action, and Europe’s allies and partners stepped up. In the face of strategic coercion, Europe took drastic action, leveraged its wealth and fiscal capacity, and demonstrated the resilience of its market-based economies. That response depended critically on the creativity of its democratic political system. Instead, a Eurobarometer survey from 2023 showed that 58 percent of EU citizens believed that the bloc should accelerate the green transition in view of the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The strength of the European Union and its ability to act should not be underestimated.&lt;/strong&gt; Heading into the crisis, all major actors underestimated the strength and resilience of the European Union, including Russia, the United States, and Europeans themselves. The bloc’s fiscal firepower could be mounted at scale, with speed, and with great effect. European fiscal capacity was leveraged just as it was during the Covid-19 pandemic to protect European consumers, businesses, and the European way of life. As a result, the European Union is a much more prominent energy actor than before the crisis, demonstrating that not only is the union forged in crisis, but it enables Europe to respond to crises much more powerfully and effectively than if countries operated independently. In that sense, the European Union is a source of Europe’s resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia failed in its attempt to blackmail EU member states.&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately, Russia lost the energy war with Europe. Russia now has significant stranded gas assets, leading to significant losses for Gazprom. While Russia has benefited from high energy prices and has found ways to keep its oil on the market, it failed to leverage its dramatic reduction in gas flows into Europe before the Nord Stream explosions. Europe progressively increased its aid to Ukraine and expanded its sanctions efforts against Russia, including placing an embargo on Russian oil, which has had a more significant impact than the oil price cap mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. LNG was critical to mitigating the crisis and can play an important role in U.S. foreign policy.&lt;/strong&gt; The export of U.S. LNG filled the huge gap left by Russian natural gas supplies. In an era of great power competition in which energy can be weaponized, the ability of the United States to supply countries with LNG through market forces can reduce the ability of Russia or other autocratic states to use energy to coerce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The market shock served to supercharge renewables deployment, particularly solar energy.&lt;/strong&gt; While the shift to LNG and alternative gas imports was central to maintaining energy security in the wake of the crisis, the expansion of renewables was equally remarkable and demonstrated that the rapid deployment and expansion of renewables is possible. However, there is also a need to simultaneously integrate and modernize grids, as well as expand storage to better cope with the intermittency of renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is economic urgency for Europe to accelerate the green transition.&lt;/strong&gt; The loss of access to lower-cost Russian piped natural gas in exchange for imported LNG has affected European economic competitiveness, with significant implications for Germany in particular. Thus, accelerating the energy transition for Europe is essential not just to meet climate goals or enhance Europe’s energy security but also to ensure its economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-EU partnership is vital and must be strengthened.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S.-EU engagement and coordination in these sectors have become much more robust and have laid the groundwork for a stronger U.S.-EU relationship. Historically, this relationship has been strained or limited. Different policy approaches to climate action, exemplified by the United States relying heavily on subsidies and the European Union pursuing a more balanced policy mix centered on carbon pricing, complicate the harmonization of transatlantic energy and climate policy. However, the importance of issues at the intersection of energy, climate, and trade will increase in the coming years, as the clean-tech revolution unfolds and becomes critical to the economic model of both blocs as well as to their wider geopolitical positioning vis-à-vis China. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council is a promising forum for closer coordination but has so far failed to resolve tensions stemming from each side’s parochial interests on technology regulation and state aid rules. Finding policy alignment between the two blocs will thus continue to be a challenge but must be prioritized to achieve shared transatlantic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crisis has added to Europe’s fiscal strains.&lt;/strong&gt; Massive fiscal outlays were deployed to keep industry afloat, particularly in Germany. The inflationary impacts of higher energy costs had a deeply negative impact on European households and the European economy. The European fiscal response, which came after the massive fiscal outlays in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, has created a more difficult fiscal environment for European policymakers that presently limits their freedom of action. For instance, the dramatic policy ambitions of the government under UK prime minister Liz Truss were strongly repudiated by markets, forcing a policy retreat and her eventual resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political backlash came primarily against incumbents rather than Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2022, there were fears that the shock of energy costs would turn Europeans against supporting Ukraine. That did not happen, and support for Ukraine remained high. Nevertheless, although European publics were aware of the cause of the energy crisis, political leaders have felt blowback. Discontent with economic conditions had negative repercussions on policymakers across Europe; even if there was only limited initial political blowback, the energy crisis was not politically cost-free.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The rise of far-right parties ahead of the 2024 European parliamentary election and the surge in farmer protests railing against environmental policies suggest that European leaders have limited latitude for ambitious climate action. However, public polling figures paint a very different picture. A 2023 Eurobarometer survey indicated that 86 percent of respondents found it important to take initiative at the European level to limit the immediate impact of rising energy prices on consumers and companies during the prior year. In terms of future action, 86 percent thought that gas storage within the bloc should be padded to avoid the risk of shortages, 85 percent believed that the manufacturing of clean technologies should be boosted, and 79 percent believed that EU measures should aim at reducing energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy story that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not ended. In the more than two years since the invasion, Europe has demonstrated its strength and resilience by emerging more energy secure, with the green transition relatively on course, and avoiding economic recession. But challenges still loom, as the rise in energy costs has created a systemic challenge for European industry and competitiveness. While European solidarity behind Ukraine has been maintained, and the threat of Russian energy extortion has been largely extinguished, the political fallout from the shock is still being felt. Anti-incumbent political sentiment remains high, leading to a surge in far-right parties. Opposition to Europe’s climate agenda has grown and will likely result in a new European Parliament that is less supportive of strong climate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Europe faces cross-cutting pressures. On the one hand, there is a strong economic need to increase Europe’s domestic energy supplies. For most European countries, aggressive deployment of renewables will be the most cost-effective course, balancing cost with climate ambition. But rising pressures could lead to backsliding. If high energy costs are blamed on the transition to low-carbon energy, they could inspire populist opposition to the “green agenda” and stall bolder action in the coming years. And the establishment of secure supply chains for clean energy technology remains a challenge, so that Europe does not swap one form of dependence for another.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;唯一罪成被告賴振邦求情：非主腦角色、僅提供協助&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IfSdgGM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴7名被告。陪審團上周四裁定6人罪名不成立，僅「無名小隊」賴振邦的交替罪「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立，他今（2日）於高等法院求情。辯方希望法庭接納賴並非本案主腦，他僅在某些方面提供協助。辯方又指，無證據證明賴知道爆炸品的重量。法官張慧玲根據裁決結果推斷，陪審團應未能肯定賴知道炸彈重20公斤，亦不接納彭軍壕稱賴有去華仁書院協助組裝炸彈，因此未能肯定賴知道炸彈的擺放位置。張官押後判刑，以待其餘認罪被告完成求情。為「污點證人」的黃振強將於本月26日求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴振邦（案發時29歲，現時33歲）被裁定屬交替罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴已還柙4年，他今身穿黑色西裝，由懲教押解出犯人欄，出庭時一度向旁聽親友揮手。被判無罪的張銘裕亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴由大律師是香媛及余承熹代表。控方讀出其經歷口供，指他於2020年1月17日被捕，19日獲准保釋，同年9月5日再因本案被捕。辯方透露，賴希望能夠在今日判刑，惟法官張慧玲指不會於今天判刑，因要待其餘認罪被告完成求情，預計會在10月判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴無參與小隊會議試爆亦非他負責操作&quot;&gt;辯方：賴無參與小隊會議、試爆亦非他負責操作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，罪成的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，與「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪絕對不相同，兩者在最高判刑上有分別。辯方指，希望法庭接納賴並非主腦，他只是在某些方面提供協助。他亦沒有參與小隊的會議，即使是在其工作室後樓梯進行的試爆，均是由策劃者吳智鴻負責攜帶炸藥以及操作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方未能證明賴知道爆炸品重量&quot;&gt;辯方：未能證明賴知道爆炸品重量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指無證據證明賴知道爆炸品的重量。張官表示，根據裁決結果推斷，陪審團應該未能肯定賴知道炸彈重20公斤，亦不接納彭軍壕稱賴有去華仁書院協助組裝炸彈，因此未能肯定賴知道炸彈的擺放位置。陪審團只能肯定賴有份參與試槍，以及他是 Telegram 帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」的使用者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴為人孝順還柙期間進修增值&quot;&gt;辯方：賴為人孝順、還柙期間進修增值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，賴在獄中有寫求情信予法官，而賴的胞姊及家人亦有撰寫求情信。辯方表示，家人認為賴是一名孝順的兒子，他待人接物真誠友善，並樂於助人。賴在還柙期間並無放棄自己，更進修增值，希望出獄後成為有用的人。辯方亦指，稍後會補交與本案相關的案例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪亦不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（2日）處理最後一批被告、9名新界東初選參與者的求情，包括何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠。庭外續現排隊旁聽人龍，有市民稱因721事件認識何桂藍，因此通宵排隊支持她，並稱讚何「硬淨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，何桂藍的偶像黃耀明（明哥）今日亦有到庭旁聽，曾與她一同看達明一派演唱會、在何入獄後代她送花予明哥的友人Louis說：「會等佢出嚟，同佢一齊追返咁多樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;罪脫李予信第三度現身旁聽-望港人續關心法庭案&quot;&gt;罪脫李予信第三度現身旁聽 望港人續關心法庭案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;獲裁定罪脫、曾參與超區初選的李予信，今早再席排隊入席旁聽。他指關心法庭正審訊的案件已成其日常，望港人能繼續關心各法庭案件，並照顧好自己的心情，「我都係做緊呢樣嘢，係我嘅日常」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZnYkcO3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾代何桂藍送花予明哥-友人等佢出嚟一齊追返咁多樣嘢&quot;&gt;曾代何桂藍送花予明哥 友人：等佢出嚟一齊追返咁多樣嘢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis今早約七時半前來排隊旁聽。Louis早在數年前的學運已認識何桂藍，難忘2020年亦曾與其看達明一派演唱會，並一起送花；惟後來何因47人案被捕，到了2021年只有他獨自送足六場花。他說，「會等佢出嚟，同佢一齊追返咁多樣嘢」。另外，「慢必」陳志全為Louis相識超過十年的同志平權朋友，近年亦會與在獄中的劉頴匡交流流行曲歌詞心得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis說，今次並非首次前來旁聽，而前來旨在聽審，不一定是要與被告們見面，「心態反而係想聽返成個過程」，指雖然會有熱心人在網上作文字直播，但始終認為「自己聽到先係最真」。他留意到「長毛」梁國雄等人陳情時，也帶出不少訊息，他鼓勵香港人將訊息消化，再加以實踐，「去消化返啲message，喺今時今日、咁嘅環境下，仲有咩好做，多過係覺得佢好慘，或者好勁」，寄語香港人反思當下自己仍然可以做的事，「去諗返我哋嘅身位可以做到啲咩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;因721認識何桂藍-市民讚硬淨&quot;&gt;因721認識何桂藍 市民讚「硬淨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70後市民蘇太昨晚凌晨約12時到達法院外，希望能進入正庭聽審。她向《獨媒》表示，今日前來主要為支持何桂藍和鄒家成。她在721事件認識何桂藍，其後曾聽聞何在獄中過得很辛苦而感到心痛，欣賞她即使身陷牢獄，仍能在艱難時期堅持發聲，認為何是個很「硬淨」的女生。蘇太亦稱欣賞鄒家成敢於追求公義，慨嘆自己這代人享受了由年輕人背負重擔所得來的成果，故此希望「幫佢哋行未行完嘅路」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂智恆養母不在港-朋友代撐場&quot;&gt;呂智恆養母不在港 朋友代「撐場」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiffany約7時半來到，她是呂智恆養母Elsa的朋友，因Elsa目前不在港，她希望到場支持呂。她說自己一向有關心在囚人士，並有做一些支援工作，因此認識呂。她形容，呂是個執着公義的人，「這是優點也是缺點」，又指今次案件是對他的人生課題，希望他能應付這課題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;旁聽市民respect何桂藍仲可以咁講&quot;&gt;旁聽市民：respect何桂藍「仲可以咁講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李先生則表示，特別記掛何桂藍，對她很「respect」，形容她早前在庭上作供是「難得囉，仲可以咁講」、在被告中很優秀（outstanding）。他認為被告「只係講返個truth（真相）咋嘛，truth is out there」，「雖然都知個outcome（結果）係咩，都要做」，至於如何詮釋則是法官的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在大學從事研究的李，曾與郭家麒共事，他上周來旁聽新西被告求情時，也在延伸庭看到何桂藍，認為她比想像中活躍、精神不錯。被問想對被告說什麼，李指「冇乜特別嘢，辛苦晒佢哋」。李今亦帶同「想和你到水塔上看星星」的黑色環保袋，他說平日也有用，非今天特別攜帶，但也覺得「幾有意思」：「就算你唔係咩，我都覺得你都想同你someone去水塔睇星星。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上近8時，現場有旁聽人士起衝突，有市民指戴口罩的女士是「排隊黨」，高呼：「惠州新動力！逢一三五喺度排隊！」、「收錢知唔知可恥、有冇良心呀」，「排隊攞錢，食咗腸穿肚爛」，警員一度上前了解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】新界東初選參加者今日求情，歌手黃耀明今早現身法庭旁聽。其中一名被告、前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍是他的粉絲，何在早休散庭時向旁聽席雙手擺頭做「大心心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃今日身穿黑色上衣，上面印有荷蘭阿姆斯特丹大學的字樣，何曾在該大學讀碩士課程。黃稱今日前來不止是支持何桂藍，亦是來支持「慢必」陳志全等人，「畀佢哋知道我哋仲喺度支持緊佢哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於何桂藍沒有求情，黃耀明說：「佢一路都係好堅持佢自己嘅立場，我希望佢可以繼續stay strong……（有無咩想同佢哋講？）我真係唔知點講，因為其實真係好艱難，我希望佢哋無論作出決定，佢哋都堅強地繼續落去。同埋希望佢哋平安。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】9名新界東初選參與者今日求情，其中包括前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍。她在獄中還柙三年半，今早表明不作求情，不過她仍有多名好友特意到法庭旁聽。前西貢區議員陳嘉琳說，想讓何知道「佢仲有好多朋友，佢啲朋友都會認真生活」，又相信她「直到呢一刻都冇後悔及願意為自己所做的事承擔」；前民陣召集人楊政賢則說，因從前接受何訪問而認識她，希望何知道自己很掛念她，亦「持續被佢inspire」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳嘉琳今早9時左右到法院，特意穿上粉紅色衫，「Anson Lo（何的偶像）代表色嘛」。她說早前在何接受審訊期間亦有到場，當時沒有「排隊黨」，因此順利進入正庭，今日則可能要在延伸庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳嘉琳與何桂藍因初選認識，當時何參選新界東，而陳是時任西貢區議員，在何擺街站時會「幫吓手」。陳嘉琳說，過去都有定時探監，每月見何一次，指她每次上庭前都會「備戰狀態」，上個月見她時已經「好認真、有準備」：「有啲人可能覺得，呢啲程序嘢走完就算，但對阿藍嚟講，每一庭都好重要，因為一日個trial（審訊）未完，呢個運動未完。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊政賢則曾接受何桂藍訪問，認識約十年：「可能再之前係網友，以前鍾意上網鬧交（笑）」。他對上一次見到何是她接受審訊時，形容她sharp（醒目）、很有原則和有強烈的人本精神：「對於佢寫嘅人同事都有好多關懷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成友人盼讓被告知我哋一路冇遺忘&quot;&gt;鄒家成友人：盼讓被告知「我哋一路冇遺忘」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成友人、作家「薯伯伯」與鄒相識近三年多，過去亦有採望和寫信給他，交流佛學想法。他形容鄒為人真誠，清晰知道自己的理念，並會用實踐方式進行修為：「而唔係得口講，而係有積極態度面對佢身處嘅環境。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒早前因七一案判刑，薯伯伯對上一次見他已是他判刑前。他覺得，初選案是香港歷史上關鍵的事，今日前來是想讓被告和大家都知道「有香港人在見證，我哋一路冇遺忘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LsXtdYk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。其中代表何桂藍的大律師Trevor Beel表示確認何的定罪紀錄，並指除此以外沒有求情。沒有律師代表的劉頴匡則自行陳詞，指他參選主要望為示威者發聲、否決預算案並非重點，亦認為35+並不可能，望法庭考慮他為「積極參與者」的低至中程度。劉現正就七一立會暴動案服刑，他指該案與初選案時間、背景和目標相近，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉在庭上又讀出女友黃于喬撰寫的求情信，黃指以劉的天資和才能，本能走一條「正常」的路，但他選擇從政，是出於對社會關懷、對民主化追求、望為港貢獻，不料因本案身陷囹圄，「人生最黃金時期」於獄中渡過。黃指劉還柙3年多每日風雨不改探望，正因不認為他是「作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙」的罪犯，而是值得她繼續關心和付出的人。黃又指，劉過去未曾妄想顛覆國家，亦不再是當初天真的少年，不再妄想能投身政治改變社會，只盼盡快重獲自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉亦呈上親撰的求情信，提及真誠相信初選不違法，如果知道參加初選會入獄，他不會參加，而是選擇其他方式為社會變得更好而戰。劉又指服刑是懲罰他所愛的人，對女友感到愧疚，明白除政治外有很多其他方式貢獻社會，望法官能寛大處理，令他能盡快履行作為男友和香港公民的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9被告今求情-歌手黃耀明等旁聽&quot;&gt;9被告今求情 歌手黃耀明等旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今處理求情的被告，包括經審訊後罪成的何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷，以及認罪的劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠。至於同參選新東、經審訊後罪成的梁國雄及柯耀林，則已於上周完成求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。何桂藍由大律師Trevor Beel代表，楊岳橋由資深大律師蔡維邦代表，陳志全由大律師馬維騉代表，鄒家成由大律師陳世傑代表，林卓廷和呂智恆由大律師沈士文代表，范國威由大律師吳靄儀代表，林景楠由大律師范凱傑代表。劉頴匡則沒有律師代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，分成三排，由6名懲教看管。獲保釋的林景楠穿黑色西裝、戴黑色格仔領帶和深藍口罩，呂智恆穿淺藍色長袖裇衫。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的陳志全戴眼鏡，穿黑色上衣。鄒家成則穿白色上衣、卡其色短袖外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其餘被告還柙逾3年半，劉頴匡穿深藍色西裝、打深藍色領帶，慢必陳志全穿深藍Polo上衣、黑西裝外套。林卓廷穿粉紅色裇衫、深藍色西裝外套，楊岳橋穿白裇衫、深藍色外套，不時翹手。范國威穿白裇衫、灰色西裝外套。何桂藍則穿白色背心，戴高的短馬尾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後沒有律師代表的劉頴匡親自以英文求情。他表示，採納法律代表早前呈交的書面陳詞，包括因及時認罪減刑三分一，今再就其參與程度等作補充。劉指，判詞清楚指出參與初選並非違法，違法的是無差別否決預算案的協議，認為法庭判刑時應集中於他推動否決預算案的參與，而非論壇發言等。劉並認為自己屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」，但並非最積極，而是屬中至低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無轉發墨落抗爭派記者會無發言&quot;&gt;劉稱無轉發「墨落」、抗爭派記者會無發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉解釋，其名字出現在「墨落無悔」聲明，但與其他被告不同，他沒有在個人社交平台再轉發，亦無在選舉論壇提及。他指該聲明對其他候選人來說，是很好的機會強調否決財案的決心，如果他更加積極參與，應會在庭上質問其他人為何不簽署、以及轉發帖文，但他沒有這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，即使他參與7月15日的抗爭派記者會，而會上有人提及對否決預算案的想法，他也沒有提出反對，但他在會上沒有說過任何一句話、沒有回答記者問題或就否決發言，大部分時間如背景般站在後面，唯一做的只是與其他人「攬頭攬頸」拍照。劉指，他當然同意否決預算案，亦曾簽署組織者準備的文件，因此屬積極參與者，但並非最積極。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱參選主要望為示威者發聲否決財案非重點&quot;&gt;劉稱參選主要望為示威者發聲、否決財案非重點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續引述在新東初選論壇的發言，提及自己因七一立會案身負暴動罪，但無怨無悔，望能用選票授權最有堅定意志的抗爭隊伍，向世界宣告「沒有暴動，只有暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，由此可見他參選的目的，是望進入立法會，為像他一樣被以暴動罪拘捕的示威者發聲，對他來說，否決預算案並非重點、也不重要。法官陳慶偉指，但特赦示威者是五大訴求之一，而要令政府回應的唯一方法，就是要以無差別否決預算案威脅政府。劉表示，認為五大訴求並不可能。法官李運騰總結，即劉同意參與無差別否決的協議，但否決並非他主要關注，劉確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後再問，如政府回應五大訴求，劉作為暴動案被告也會得益。劉指有可能會、也有可能不會，指不知道政府如何回應五大訴求；而且作為合理的人，他不期望政府會回應全部訴求，即使非常努力，可能最多只回應三數個，甚或一個也不回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱政府能dq不信35是可能&quot;&gt;劉稱政府能DQ、不信35+是可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續提到論壇被問及，為何選民要投票予可能坐監的他，他回答「完全唔覺得35+係一個切實嘅目標嚟」，相信是「天空樓閣」。劉指，其意思是如選民希望有人在議會否決預算案，就不要投選他，因他很有機會入獄，強調他在案發時，已明確表示自己不相信35+是可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指劉於今年就暴動案判刑，關注他何時認罪。劉指他現時沒有資料，但是在2020年初選論壇之後，他亦無預計會隔這麼久才判刑。法官李運騰追問他何時認罪、能否舉出年份，劉此時轉身望向同涉立會暴動案認罪的鄒家成，鄒發笑，其後笑着指向劉：「我2023，你唔知。」控方其後確認，劉是於2021年9月表示擬認罪，並於2023年5月認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，否決計劃不可能實現，政府只需DQ一至兩個人，計劃便不可能。法官陳慶偉問為什麼，劉指因最樂觀的情況，也只能拿到35或36席。陳慶偉說，「戴耀廷不是這樣想（not according to D1）」，劉同意，但指他不同意戴，並說「戴耀廷是一個有趣的人，他總是能將客觀不可能的事，變成看起來有威脅性的事」，林卓廷、楊岳橋等被告發笑。陳慶偉說，但被告決定跟隨戴耀廷行事，劉回應，因他有自己的議程，認為參與計劃能幫助他實現。劉又說，本案涉及所有市民、特區甚至中央政府，當局有很多方法能阻礙他們成功，望法庭考慮情況特別，給予額外折扣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉指計劃公開-望給予額外扣減&quot;&gt;劉指計劃公開 望給予額外扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，除非其案情很特別（extraordinary），否則不會額外扣減，舉例額運大量危險藥物，即使被攔截、計劃不能實現，但主腦被捕時，也不會因其計劃不可能而給予扣減。劉表示明白，但強調「從未聽過任何一個串謀是如此公開」，沒有毒販會舉行記者會說自己販毒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉另涉立會暴動案-望考慮整體量刑減刑&quot;&gt;劉另涉立會暴動案 望考慮整體量刑減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續確認，預計今年12月11日就暴動案服刑完畢。他承認在暴動案保釋期間干犯初選案，但指他是因涉暴動案，才選擇參與初選。劉解釋，涉暴動案保釋期間，他盡力信守對法庭的承諾，不去參與非法集會和暴力活動。但他當時仍想找方法追尋其信念如「五大訴求」，故考慮了最安全、合法的選擇，即戴耀廷提倡的35+計劃，指戴作為法律學者，表示這是最安全的計劃。劉說，他最終因對法律的無知而參選，望法庭即使因他保釋期間犯案而加刑，也不會加刑太多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，他所涉的兩宗案件，案發時間和背景相近，均源自2019年反修例運動，目標同樣是「五大訴求」；兩案亦同樣涉干預立法會的運作，只是方式不同，暴動案涉武力、本案則涉憲制手段，但如法官所指，手段暴力與否或非最重要。劉指，若非身負暴動案，「我可能根本不會站在這裡」，而他就暴動罪已被重判7年（認罪扣減後判監54個月20天），是同類最嚴重，望法庭能考慮「整體量刑原則（totality principle）」而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，因其暴動案刑期於12月會服畢，提議法庭可直接在現有刑期減刑。法官李運騰指，現時未知劉的刑期，但可能比他暴動的刑期更長，又指不是說能在劉另案服刑完畢前判刑，但法庭會有方法考慮該原則減刑。李又指，不會承諾考慮該原則，又指劉在保釋期間犯案，或抵銷因整體量刑原則而減去的刑期。劉表示明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上讀黃求情信從政非為私利非作奸犯科偷呃拐騙罪犯&quot;&gt;庭上讀黃求情信：從政非為私利、非「作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙」罪犯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後表示，呈交了來自他本人、朋友、女友、傳道人、前僱主的求情信，同意以其過往紀錄，他或不被視為良好品格。劉續指，「有時最親近我們的人，可能比我們更了解我們自己、比我們更好觀察我們自己」，故他選擇讀出女友的求情信節錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉引述求情信，黃指她是一名性別議題倡議者，也是劉的女朋友，「2024年是我與劉相識的第10年」。黃指，在她眼中，劉是一個「聰明、能言善辯、具領導天賦、不斷渴求知識、思維敏銳、語言能力強、充滿好奇心嘅人」，在他以前，黃交往的男生「出身傳統名校、中產、規規矩矩」，但劉卻不一樣，他出身基層、其中學黃無聽過、「都唔係好靚仔」，「但他身上卻有一種不一樣嘅光芒」。說到「唔係好靚仔」時，劉表示他不同意（which I do not agree），庭上多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續引述求情信，指以劉頴匡的天資和才能，他本來絕對有能力走一條「正常」的路，成為律師或教師等專業人士，過安穩舒適的中產生活。但他有志從政非為一己私利，完全是出於對社會人⺠的關懷、對香港⺠主化的追求、望能為港貢獻其才能，卻不料因此捲入此案、身陷囹圄，「人生最黃金嘅時期都喺牢獄中渡過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續說，認識劉頴匡時19歲，現在已29歲，十年的關係中，有三年多隔著監獄高牆，要透過限時電話筒、隔着探訪室玻璃見面對話。「還押三年多，我每日風雨不改到收押所探佢，正正因為我認為佢唔係作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙嘅罪犯，係個值得我繼續關心同付出嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6C9kT2z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃于喬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃指三年多來，香港改變很多，亦知道一直被收押的劉已得到莫大懲罰。他過去固然未曾妄想要顛覆國家，亦不再是當初天真的少年，不會再妄想能夠投身政治改變社會、不會再沾邊任何有可能被定性為危害國安的行為。黃指，只望劉能盡快重獲自由，透露劉獄中攻讀學位，也自學多種語言、運動強身健體，望離開監獄時「他已是更好、更強、更成熟的人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後說，認為無人能比女友更好地見證他的成長。黃聞言眼眶泛紅，並用手拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉親撰求情信稱如知初選會入獄不會參加&quot;&gt;劉親撰求情信稱如知初選會入獄不會參加&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉亦向法庭呈上親撰的求情信，但無在庭上讀出。據《獨媒》記者取得的信件（英文全文如下），劉在信中提到很清楚因嚴重罪行面臨長期監禁，但對他來說仍然有點不真實，他一直被教導成為一個關心和參與社會的好公民，盡力做好自己的角色，但最後卻入獄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，他並非在2019年社會不穩後才從政的機會主義者，自2013年已參與社區事務，他承認知悉並同意戴耀廷提出的計劃，但從非其競選活動重點，他真誠相信初選不違法，而且如果知道參加初選會入獄，他不會參加，而是選擇其他方式為社會變得更好而戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，他現時30歲，應是建立家庭和事業的黃金時代，但他在獄中3年，可能要服刑更多年。劉指這並非對他的懲罰，也是懲罰他所愛的人。他特別對一直照顧她的女友感到愧疚，又指獄中裝備自己，他明白除政治外有很多其他方式貢獻社會，望法官能寛大處理，令他能盡快履行作為男友和香港公民的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。大律師陳世傑庭上讀出鄒家成的求情信節錄。鄒的社交媒體發布信件全文，當中提到他在15歲時首次參與七一遊行，令他明白社會不公，他參政望為民發聲，實現真正民主化，雖從未信35+可能，但始終深信民主的價值，即使今天為爭民主而身陷囹圄，仍相信「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，他由始至終無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身已構成危害國安，《國安法》生效後他一度想退選，但自覺身為政治人物肩負對人民的責任而繼續，「我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去」。鄒指他初心始終不變，依然相信民主與公羲、關懷弱者、望香港變得更好，獄中數年他努力讀書、修身修心，雖不知何時重獲自由，但盼出獄時能自豪說：「這些年我都沒有枉過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑陳詞指，鄒屬於「積極參加者」，但他基於錯誤法律意見犯案；而鄒現正就立會暴動案服刑，望法庭避免判處壓毀性刑罰。陳最後又特別提到，本案被告是好人，只是不幸在錯誤的地點和時間出現，當中包括醫生、律師等，懷着良好意願參選、非為私利，並非真正意義上的罪犯，望法庭能法外開恩，「在這宗案，寬容是有必要的」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;七一遊行雨傘運動為關心社會契機-盼建更公義社會&quot;&gt;七一遊行、雨傘運動為關心社會契機 盼建更公義社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑讀出鄒求情信部分內容。據《獨媒》取得的求情信（全文見文末），鄒家成指自己出身基層、一家七口靠綜緩渡日，15歲時照顧患病的父親，令他培養出對弱者的關懷和同理心。父親病逝後，他奮發圖強讀書，最終如願入讀大學修讀護理，準備日後成為護士，幫助社會上像其父親那樣無法自理的病者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同是15歲那年，鄒跟隨師兄首次參加七一遊行，自言「我深深為人們對公義的追求及對弱勢社群的關懷所震撼」，也覺醒到其家庭的困境是數十萬家庭共同面對的問題，現象背後是社會結構性不公。鄒形容，那次遊行成為他關心社會、積極參與公民事務的契機，「只要有能力，我就希望幫助弱勢，令香港成為一個更好、更公義的社會」，他之後每年也會參與遊行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，因着對社會的關懷，2014年雨傘運動亦不時抽空到場支持。有段時間，他每天放學便到金鐘由示威者搭建的自修室讀書、與其他人談及對香港未來的想像。鄒說，運動雖然失敗，未有爭取到港人渴求的民主政制，但卻更堅定他參與政治的決心，因為唯有建立到如美國前總統林肯所言真正「為人民服務的民選政府（government of the people, by the people, for the people）」，才有機會終結對弱者的壓迫、為社會帶來公義。而雨傘運動也令他相信透過公民參與，「我們的確有改變社會、推動公義的能力」。鄒直言：「這份信念，就是我當年參選的初衷，並無異心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;無意違反國安法基於對人民責任繼續參選&quot;&gt;無意違反《國安法》、基於對人民責任繼續參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續表示，他參政「就是希望為民發聲」，加強在野民主派在議會內的實力，制衡非民選的行政機關，為實現真正民主化帶來可能。他從未相信35+的可能性，但始終深信民主的價值，即使為爭民主而身陷囹圄，仍信「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，「由始至終，我根本無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身原來已構成危害國安。」《國安法》生效後他一度萌生退選念頭，驅使他繼續參選的，「是自覺身為政治人物所肩負對人民的責任」，「我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去。」因此在刪去所有有機會被視為違反《國安法》的宣傳內容後繼續「與民同行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指今天的他與15歲相比，起了不少變化，但自言初心始終不變，「我依然相信民主與公羲，依然關懷弱者，依然希望香港能變得更加好，大家能過上更有尊嚴的生活。」鄒指在獄中的幾年，「努力讀書，努力修身，努力修心」，學習改善跟家人的關係，學習降伏憤怒與不滿，學習何為無條件的愛，「這一切，都只為貫徹15歲以來所走的道路，毋忘初心」。鄒最後說，不知道距離重獲人身自由還有多久，「我只盼在踏出監獄的一刻，能自豪地跟大家說：『這些年我都沒有枉過』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒基於錯誤法律意見犯案-屬積極參加者&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒基於錯誤法律意見犯案 屬「積極參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑陳詞指，鄒家成被錯誤的法律意見所誤導、基於對法律的無知犯案，有人甚至說，戴耀廷作為一個法律學者，可能比律師有更好的法律意見，但《國安法》後對初選是否合法存有不確定性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳接納，法庭判刑時可參考刑期分級制，並可視鄒家成為刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。陳指，鄒在案中非關鍵人物、可有可無，對計劃無真正幫助；他不迴避鄒發起「墨落無悔」聲明，但強調文件屬多餘（superfluous）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒犯案時年輕不成熟&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒犯案時年輕、不成熟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續提到鄒的背景，指形容他為激進是太過嚴苛和錯誤，認為鄒提倡香港民族理念，不應被視為加刑因素。陳又指，鄒並非提倡暴力對抗中國，只是對抗因殖民時代遺留下來的不公制度，望法庭考慮犯案時他只是20多歲，在2019年社會不穩下，作為「熱血青年」，不知道世界現實上如何運作，只以他所知的對錯向前衝如蠻牛（mad bull），但他並非為個人私利，而是為香港人的利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，考慮到鄒的愚蠢、不成熟、沒有足夠資訊（ill-informed），社會當時又經歷多人參與的示威，鄒很容易被社會的高漲情緒所蒙蔽，但他已得到了教訓。陳又指，鄒之所以在協調會議和社交平台大聲疾呼（vociferous），均顯示他對他所相信是對的事的決心和渴望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒另涉立會案-辯方指同出於對基本法不滿-望考慮整體情況減刑&quot;&gt;鄒另涉立會案 辯方指同出於對《基本法》不滿 望考慮整體情況減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，鄒雖因七一立會暴動案被捕，但於本案提控後，才於2021年3月就立會案提堂，並於2023年8月去信表示認罪。陳指，兩案性質均是政治，表達出鄒家成對《基本法》的不滿，鄒在立會案的行為包括撕毀《基本法》，因認為沒有妥當落實，以此表達他的沮喪，這亦是他參選的原因。陳又指，鄒於該案刑期逾5年，已服出代價，並預計於一年半內服刑完畢，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則而減刑，避免判處壓毀性（crushing effect）的刑罰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指本案被告是好人-寬容是有必要&quot;&gt;辯方指本案被告是好人 寬容是有必要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後指，經歷近120審訊、及過去一個月的求情，他希望說，「在正常情況下，本案被告是好人，只是不幸地在錯誤的地點和時間出現（In normal circumstances, these are good people, unfortunately, they found themselves in the wrong place, at the wrong time.）」。陳指，本案被告來自社會不同界別，具有重要和成功的地位，像是醫生、律師、航空業、衞生界、立法會議員、社工和有抱負的學生，他們懷着良好意願參與運動，非為私利，但突然全變成非法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳比喻，《國安法》生效時，被告就像在一架失控的車上，以其自身動力高速前進，所有人都需要面對很長的刑期，也對個人生活有很毀滅性的後果，不僅影響他們自己，也影響他們身邊的人。陳續說，這是他個人的看法，並望法庭考慮，「35+計劃」是由一班業餘人士（amateur）聚起來，嘗試如專業人士般行事，計劃若不是注定失敗、也只有很少機會實現，甚至可說是「蠢得可笑（farcical）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又說，除了首5名被告，沒有任何其他被告有資格停止「35+計劃」，只有組織者有資格和責任這樣做，但最後沒有這樣做。法官李運騰說，他們選擇「跳船（jump）」，陳同意，指他們只是自己跳船。陳又說，法官對處理嚴重罪犯有經驗，但本案被告不是真正意義上的罪犯，望法庭能法外開恩，「寬容是本案的關鍵，尤其在這宗案，寬容是有必要的（mercy is warrant）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒女友鄒正直善良身陷囹圄仍努力學習思考&quot;&gt;鄒女友：鄒正直善良、身陷囹圄仍努力學習思考&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦呈上鄒家成女友求情信（全文見文末）。據《獨媒》取得的信件，女友指與鄒相識三年多，鄒是她遇過「最正直善良、堅韌和有承擔的人」，她過去一年抑鬱症病發，鄒在探訪和書信靜心聆聽她的經歷，分擔其苦痛，即使被高牆阻隔，「我依然從他身上獲得沒間斷的正念，他成為我拼命活著、提升自己的一大動力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，即使鄒身陷囹圄，但從不鬆懈，仍努力學習、保持思考，每天看書、讀報、唸經、打坐等，讀過的每本書都有筆跡和讀後感，信件很多關於對生命和學習的反思，亦依舊關心社會和世界，近至安達臣道塌天秤意外的遺孤，遠至加沙戰火中受苦的人民，都看見他們的苦痛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女友鄒投身政治非為私利學佛盼實踐無條件的愛&quot;&gt;女友：鄒投身政治非為私利、學佛盼實踐無條件的愛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，鄒2020年末起篤信佛教，在牆內一直專注修行，變得比以往更慈悲、強大，也學會從容地接受苦難、放下貪執和仇恨，鄒指當下最希望可以實踐「無條件的愛」，由伴侶出發，繼而愛家人、身邊的朋友，乃至理念不同的人。而鄒因無法從護理系學士畢業，望出獄後赴外國進修取得學位，彌補遺憾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，鄒投身政治從來並非為一己私利，僅是因為他無法離群眾而去、無法離自己心愛的城市而去，真誠盼着她終有一天變好。女友表示，感激這個美好的相遇，會繼續堅定地在路上陪鄒面對每個難關、互相扶持，一起成為更好的人，善良如初。她由衷希望鄒和他所愛的人能早日重聚，懇請法官能予他及早重啟人生的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成求情信全文&quot;&gt;鄒家成求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今日我希望向閣下分享我在15歲那年發生的兩件事情。它們對我的生命有著深刻的影響，能協助閣下更透徹地理解今日站在你們面前的第37被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首先是我父親的病逝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我出生自基層家庭。自我有記憶以來，父親一直惡病纏身。失去經濟支柱，我們一家七口很長一段時間只能依靠綜援度日。然而，由於他早年經常對其他家庭成員暴力相向，弄得家中永無寧日，即使後來他病情惡化要人院，家中除了母親之外也沒若麼人會去探望他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在我15歲那年的某一日，醫生批准他出院。踏進家門的一刻，看到昔日那個動不動就大發雷霆的家暴者，如今卻成了一個駝著背、瘦骨嶙峋、每走一步都相當吃力的老病人，我曾經內心對他的恨意頓時全消，只想讓眼前的人在生命最後的時光能過上更有尊嚴的生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一方面是為了父親，另一方面也是為了分擔母親的辛勞，自那一天起，我每日放學便會幫忙照顧他，砌病床，分配菓物、餵食飯、幫忙洗澡…..大概就是這段日子，我漸漸培養出對弱者的關懷和同理心。只要尚有一絲餘力，我都希望盡我所能使他們少一點痛苦，過上更好一點的生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不久，他就病逝了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不再需要回家照顧父親，每日放學後我改到自修室讀書。發奮圖強，只為成為一個更有能力的人，幫助更多弱者。最終，我如願入讀大學，修讀護理，準備日後成為一名護士，幫助社會上無數像我父親當年那樣無法自理的病者。我還記得收到大學錄取通知的那一天，母親笑得特別燦爛。我知這，我正走在上對的這路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一件對我影響深遠的事情是我首次的公民參與。15歲那年，在忙於照顧父親的期間，機緣巧合之下我跟隨一位中學師兄第一次參加「七一遊行」。在遊行隊伍中，縱使天氣炎熱、人群擠擁，我深深為人們對公義的追求及對弱勢社群的關懷所震憾。我覺醒到我家庭所面對的困境絕非我們一家七口獨有，而是數以十萬計家庭所共同面對的問題。現象背後，更是有著社會的結構性不公。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當時我年紀尚小，未懂得有條理地分析社會問題，更遑論是提出具建設性的解決方案。但那一次遊行卻成為了我關心社會，積極參與公民事務的契機。亦是在那一天開始，我對弱者的關懷更進一步拓展為對香港弱勢社群及被壓迫者的責任感。只要有能力，我就希望幫助弱勢，令香港成為一個更好、更公義的社會。自那天以後，每一年我都會參與遊行，風雨不改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;亦因這份對社會的關懷，當香港在2014年爆發雨傘運動，即使忙於準備翌年的公開試，我也不時抽空到現場支持運動。有段時間，每天放學就身穿校服背著書包，走到金鐘由示威者搭建的自修室讀書，再與其他示威者聊天談著對香港未來的想像，就成了我每天的日常。就結果而言，運動是失敗的，我們未有爭取到香港人渴求的民主政制。但對我而言，這場運動卻是更加堅定了我參與政治的決心，因為唯有建立到如美國前總統林肯所言的一個真正「為人民服務的民選政府」(government of the people, by the people, for the people)，才有機會終結對弱者的壓迫，為社會帶來公義。更重要的是，這場運動使我相信透過公民參與，我們的確有改變社會、推動公義的能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這份信念，就是我當年參選的初衷，並無異心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如我作供時所說，我參政，就是希望為民發聲，加強在野民主派在議會內的實力，制衡非民選的行政機關，為實現真正民主化帶來可能。或許與其他人不同的是，我從未相信35+的可能性，但與不少香港人一樣，我始終深信民主的價值。即使今日我為爭取民主而身陷囹圄，但我仍然相信，這個「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由始至終，我根本無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身原來已構成危害國安。《國安法》生效之後，我一度萌生退選念頭，驅使我繼續競選的，是自覺身為政治人物所肩負對人民的責任。我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去。於是，在刪去所有有機會被視為違反《國安法》的宣傳內容後，我決定重新上路，與民同行，走完最後一段初選之路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今日的我跟15歲時相比，歷練固然多了，對自身及世界的理解也因此有了不少變化。但我的初心始終不變。我依然相信民主與公義，依然關懷弱者，依然希望香港能變得更加好，大家能過上更有尊嚴的生活。在獄中的這幾年，我努力讀書，努力修身，努力修心。我學習改善跟家人的關係，學習降伏憤怒與不滿，學習安忍，學習懺侮，學習和諧與平靜，學習慷慨，學習何為無條件的愛。這一切，都只為貫徹15歲以來所走的道路，毋忘初心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我不知這自己距離重獲人身自由還有多久，我只盼在踏出監獄的一刻，能自豪地跟大家說：「這些年我都沒有枉過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024年7月15日&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成女友求情信全文&quot;&gt;鄒家成女友求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本人與鄒家成相識三年多，並發展成情侶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成是我的伴侶，是我最好的朋友，也是我遇過最正直善良、堅韌、謙卑和有承擔的人。他富有同理心，善於感受他人之苦，也從不吝嗇對受苦的人的關懷，眼裡皆是眾生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為伴侶，他尊重我的每一個選擇，鼓勵並支持我出國進修、增值自己，期許我們再遇之時皆能成為更強大的人。他曾對我說：「我想和你一起面對內心和世界的挑戰。」而他說到做到。他在我人生最壞的日子穩穩地接住我一去年我的抑鬱症復發，他在探訪和書信中靜心聆聽我的經歷，分擔我的苦痛。他更鼓勵我偕他一起研讀佛教思想，學習修行。他願意包容我的不足，也時常提醒我要多作反思一一學習慈悲、安住正念、觀照內心、心存規律、活在當下，這都是我從他身上學會的事情。這段日子，儘管被高牆阻隔，但我依然從他身上獲得沒間斷的正念，他成為我拼命活著、提升自己的一大動力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為兒子，他為人顧家、孝順。他就讀中四那年，父親因病離世。而在其父患病臥床的那段日子，他為母親分擔作為照顧者的重擔一一洗澡、餵食飯、分配藥的份量，從而建立對護理的興趣。後來，他入讀香港都會大學護理系，立志成為一名護士。2021年還押期間，他申請保釋就是為了圓滿母親的心願—重尸難日卜在她面前戴著四方帽接過證書，走完一場畢業禮。保釋那段時間，他為家裡添置新傢俬，為自己安排好入獄的事宜，免讓家人操心。作為朋友，他博愛、慷慨、真誠待人。他時常關心朋友近況，善於將佛學思想套入生活，以自身經歷為朋友紓憂解困。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家成身處牢獄已經三年。即使身陷囹圄，但他從不鬆懈，依然努力學習、保持思考，在泥濘中一步步前行。在獄中的日子，他堅持生活規律：每日看書、讀報紙、唸經、打坐、懺悔；每周做反思，總結學習目標、檢視進度。他著重自身改進，同時積極汲取及鑽研知識一一佛學、政治哲學、經濟、歷史、英語、寫作。他在監倉讀過的每本書，每頁都有筆跡，還有用間尺劃下重點的橫線；之後他會寫低十多頁筆記，再寫讀後感；有不理解的地方，他會把握每次探訪時間虛心向前輩請教。我們的信件中，很多也是關於他對生命和學習的反思，有時他更會向我分享閲讀感想，並邀請我給他反饋，不會放過每一個進步的機會。他依舊關心社會、關心世界：近至安達臣道塌天秤意外的遺孤，遠至加沙戰火中受苦的人民，他都能看見他們的苦痛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;三年前他因為官司纏身，最終無法以護理系學士身分畢業。他希望在出獄後能赴外國升學進修，取得一個自己心儀的學位，彌補當日的遺憾。而他在獄中勤於自學多種知識、專注鑽硏佛學，就是為離開監獄這一天做好準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家成由2020年末起篤信佛教，至今三年多。對他來說，佛是智慧、慈悲和力量。佛教中有一句話：「菩薩不住相布施，其福德不可思量」，他矢志以「無分別心」幫助別人，不計較付出和回報。身處牆內三年，他一直專注修行，變得比以往更慈悲、強大，也學會從容地接受苦難、放下貪執和仇恨。他告訴我，當下最希望的是可以實踐「無條件的愛」一一由伴侶出發，繼而愛家人，愛身邊的朋友，乃至愛理念不同的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;生於斯，長於斯。家成和很多年輕人一樣，於香港土生土長27年，與這片土地一起歷盡高低跌宕，也會關心社會時政。不同的是，他將自我實踐扣連社會公義，奮不顧身地站到浪尖上。他投身政治從來並非為一己私利，僅僅是因為他無法離群眾而去，無法離自己心愛的城市而去，真誠地盼著終有一天她能變得更好，這點並無因為時間流轉而改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我和鄒家成由相識到相戀，大部分相處時間都是隔著高牆、探訪室的玻璃，對話只能透過會計時倒數的電話筒，或需要等候多時的書信一一思念變得具體而殘酷。儘管如此，我依然感激這個美好的相遇。我會繼續堅定地在路上陪伴他面對每個難關、互相扶持彼此，在他出獄之時一起成為更好的人，善良如初。而我深信這天到來時，他擁有的會比失去的多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;愛別離苦，我由衷希望家成和他所愛的人能早日重聚，亦懇請法官能夠給予他及早重啟人生的機會，不要讓他失去希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024年7月9日&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zmWCVFP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。其中楊岳橋由其師傅、資深大律師蔡維邦代表求情，指楊在90年代舉家移民加拿大，在當地大學畢業之後，便前往北京修讀法學碩士，因為熱愛中國文化和歷史。蔡指從立法會投票紀錄可見，楊並非主張阻撓議會運作的議員（obstructionist），並提到楊在較早階段表達認罪意向，其後在警方的邀請下提供證人口供，顯示楊完全的悔意。蔡庭上讀出楊親筆撰寫的求情信，稱作為一名大律師，為自己干犯刑事罪行而感到難堪，犯案是完全錯誤和不理智；他強調自己日後不會再涉足公共事務，沒有任何重犯機會。至於陳志全，其代表大律師馬維騉指他在本案參與程度低，過往是一名勤奮和盡責的立法會議員，在任期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋求情稱赴北京升學因熱愛中國文化和歷史&quot;&gt;楊岳橋求情稱赴北京升學因熱愛中國文化和歷史&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前公民黨立法會議員楊岳橋由其師傅、資深大律師蔡維邦代表作求情。蔡指楊出生於1981年，現年43歲，他在90年代跟隨家人移民到加拿大，並於2002年在當地的大學畢業，之後赴北京大學升學，修讀法學碩士。就當時而言，相比起到西方國家如美國和英國，前往中國內地讀書並非20年前人們的優先選項，惟楊願意踏出安舒區，在北京研習憲法及行政法學，不是為了建立有價值的事業，而是因為對中國文化和歷史的熱愛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，事實上楊十分欣賞中國文化和藝術，每逢農曆新年都會替人寫揮春，而且品質不錯。楊回到香港後，繼續修畢法律專業證書（P.C.LL.）課程，其後於2009年成為大律師。他最終於2016年的立法會補選中當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋求情稱非主張阻撓議會或激進派別&quot;&gt;楊岳橋求情稱非主張阻撓議會或激進派別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，從立法會投票紀錄可見，楊並非主張阻撓議會運作的議員（obstructionist）。在2018年8月，他與時任立法會（資訊科技界）議員莫乃光到訪美國矽谷灣區考察，事後收到感謝信。蔡指楊相信香港政府具透明度和有效率，會使香港成為一個合適外國投資的城市，楊亦向國際宣傳香港，鼓勵美國機構駐守香港及投資，指香港有法治制度、實行普通法，香港會在數碼時代裡擔任電子產業的軸心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續指，雖然楊作為政治人物，屬於泛民主派，但是他並非主張阻撓議會或激進派別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露楊曾提供證人口供予警方&quot;&gt;辯方透露楊曾提供證人口供予警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，楊於2021年2月因本案還柙，他隨即在同年3月退出公民黨，並與黨友溝通指公民黨應該解散。楊日後不希望再涉足政治，只想做一個平凡公民，顯示他的重犯機會是零。在他過往擔任議員期間，他致力服務不同市民，即使在工餘時間也會協助不同社群解決法律疑難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡強調，楊在較早階段表達認罪意向，是最大求情因素。其法律代表早於2021年9月去信律政司表達認罪意向，之後於同年11月向法庭表示會認罪。在2022年6月，楊在交付高院的聆訊中承認控罪，乃表示悔意的典型表現。蔡並提到，楊在警方的邀請下提供口供，雖然最終控方未有傳召他為證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，楊協助警方這項因素會被納入在認罪扣減之中。蔡則回應指，這顯示楊完全的悔意，並會用盡一切方法去協助警方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋親撰求情信對自己作為大律師干犯刑事罪行感到難堪&quot;&gt;楊岳橋親撰求情信：對自己作為大律師干犯刑事罪行感到難堪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡呈上由楊岳橋於今年8月16日親筆撰寫的求情信，他在信中表示，作為一名大律師，為自己干犯刑事罪行而感到難堪。他有機會在還柙期間回望自己的從政生涯，當初從政是為了使香港變得更好，惟盲目的反政府心態，導致當時的政治境況惡化。他又表示，很後悔未有及時從否決財政預算案的計劃抽身，而且自己的錯誤行為亦導致公民黨黨友加入這個錯誤和無望的計劃，相信案件為黨友的家人帶來焦慮和壓力，他為此感到抱歉，並強調自己犯案是完全錯誤和不理智。他強調自己日後不會再涉足公共事務，沒有任何重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於蔡強調被告的參與程度應取決於他們在2020年7月1日之後的行為，法官李運騰則表示，雖然控罪時期乃由7月1日開始，但是楊在7月1日之前頗為積極參與「35+」計劃，這點辯方不能否認，而法庭可由此考慮楊意志堅決。辯方則指，在7月1日，即國安法生效之後，楊的參與行為就只有3項，包括在初選中投票、擺街站及提交立法會參選提名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡又指，雖然楊岳橋在2020年3月已擔任公民黨黨魁，但是他在黨內仍然是年資較淺的立法會議員，所以崗位上只屬政黨的發言人，而不是黨內的主要推手。法官陳慶偉則明言，不會接受這方面的陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡總結指楊屬「積極參與者」，量刑起點應介乎3至10年的幅度，並且應該採用該幅度的中間點，冀法庭給予認罪的全數三分一扣減，亦希望能基於楊長期服務社群而給予進一步扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳志全參與程度低任議員期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲&quot;&gt;辯方指陳志全參與程度低、任議員期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉指，陳不是組織者或策劃者，僅屬於「積極參與者」，而且在國安法生效之前，陳在本案的參與程度已是相對低，他並沒有出席任何「35+」記者會，也沒有參與協調會議，在 WhatsApp 群組中，除了曾經回覆「thank you」之外，其餘時間都是「已讀不回」。在國安法生效之後，陳的參與程度更加低，他並沒有出席7月6日的民間論壇或7月15日的抗爭派記者會，僅進行自己的競選活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，在案發期間，陳志全任職立法會議員，並且以勤奮和盡責的態度履行職責，冀法庭基於此接受陳有良好品格。馬指，陳的妹妹和配偶均替他撰寫求情信，形容陳為孝子、關愛的兄長和有愛的伴侶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，從大量朋友的求情信可見，陳是一名勤奮的立法會議員，過往積極地替性小眾利益發聲，亦有前政府官員替他撰寫求情信，綜合以上，冀法庭酌情減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其他被告分別被安排在第一庭和第二庭觀看直播，在第一庭的被告包括：王百羽、伍健偉、岑子杰、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、梁晃維、吳政亨和馮達浚。在第二庭旁聽的被告包括余慧明、黃子悅、袁嘉蔚、黃碧雲和吳敏兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。林卓廷一方指，林的參與程度屬最低，他無出席協調會議、其代表亦在會上反對否決，林無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明、無提過否決預算案，一直是傳統民主派，支持一國兩制、香港回歸中國，望法庭考慮他為判監3年以下的「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表范國威的大律師吳靄儀則強調，否決程序為《基本法》所容許，又指本案謀劃非常公開，加上政府有「大殺傷力武器」可DQ參選人，謀劃不可能實現，望法庭考慮情況特殊而減刑。吳又指，范獲西貢區議會前主席吳仕福、前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信，讚揚他務實無私及對地區民生的貢獻，庭上並呈上范3年前為街坊所畫牛年年畫；范的女兒亦形容他是「最好的爸爸」。辯方指范望將一切抛諸腦後，專注家庭，望法庭視范為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」的較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷稱任內處理鉛水事件揭發圍標事件&quot;&gt;林卓廷稱任內處理鉛水事件、揭發圍標事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的沈士文指，林是一名傳統和典型的民主黨黨員，從其往績和控方證人區諾軒的證供可印證。林任職立法會議員期間，曾揭發私人屋苑工程圍標情況，推動「反圍標」運動，涉事沙田屋苑居民亦撰寫求情信，講述林引起公眾關注圍標的非法行為。後來《競爭法》立法，林在立法會也是推手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林作為民主黨長期黨員，受到何俊仁邀請下擔任黨內秘書處職務，何亦有替林撰寫求情信。此外，民主黨前立法會議員張文光和劉慧卿，以及現正在海外留學的兒子，均有替林撰寫求情信。林的母親則讚揚林是孝子，經常到赤柱探訪兒子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林卓廷不主張否決預算案-亦無簽署墨落無悔聲明&quot;&gt;辯方：林卓廷不主張否決預算案 亦無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林的參與程度可說是眾被告中最低，他對於達成協議無差別否決預算案沒有任何興趣，亦無親自出席任何新東協調會議，對於涉案計劃全程不熱衷，代表他出席會議的黨友亦在會上表明不認同否決預算案，導致新東在會議結束後並未就否決達成共識，是在首被告戴耀廷推動下才最終達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，林無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，也不曾於選舉單張和社交平台提及否決預算案，他亦不認同「攬炒」或解散立法會等主張。林在初選論壇受到激進派候選人的施壓時，更反問若政府在預算案中承諾向每名香港市民派3萬元，如何投反對票，可見他並非積極參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，林定罪是因搜出論壇筆記，以及時任民主黨主席胡志偉言論，以「共謀者原則」入罪，辯方尊重法庭的裁決，但必須強調林在本案的「串謀」中，角色非常輕微，認為林應屬「其他參加者」，即監禁3年以下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林卓廷是傳統和典型的民主黨黨員-支持香港回歸中國和一國兩制&quot;&gt;辯方指林卓廷是傳統和典型的民主黨黨員 支持香港回歸中國和「一國兩制」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈強調，林是一名傳統和典型的民主黨黨員，從不激進，他跟從傳統民主派的立場，包括支持香港回歸中國和「一國兩制」的《基本法》概念，民主黨亦常與政府合作。而林自2016年起任立法會議員，紀錄顯示他非常勤奮，贊成的議案多於反對議案，指林無差別否決是與多年往績完全不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈另交代林的定罪紀錄，林就2018年「一地兩檢」會議衝突案，承認一項妨礙正在執行職責的立法會人員罪，在2022年12月被判囚3周，已服刑完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳靄儀涉案謀劃公開政府可dq-不可能實現&quot;&gt;吳靄儀：涉案謀劃公開、政府可DQ 不可能實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表范國威的大律師吳靄儀，採納其他大狀的法律陳詞，認為本案並非顛覆國家政權罪最嚴重。吳又指，本案非常特殊，整個計劃非常公開、有大量文件記載（well-documented），令計劃埋下自我毀滅的種子。而被告雖稱否決權為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，但要達成的前提是有「35+」，然而行政機關也有「大殺傷力武器」去抗衡，選舉主任可以DQ參選人，本案31名參選被告中便有9人被DQ，計劃無可能實現。吳又指，即使有Plan B，該些參選人同樣會因其主張而被DQ；而政府最後也宣布押後選舉，被告根本無機會當選；即使立法會解散，特首也能批出短期撥款，法庭判詞提到的後果很難會出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ic1t1m0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image22&quot; /&gt;
▲ 范國威&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，假若吳靄儀是正確，為何協調會議要討論替補機制、甚至有「Plan C」，吳重申，即使有Plan B、Plan C，政府也能DQ，或者他們根本無機會勝出；又指以否決預算案爭取五大訴求，政府拒絕回應，終致特首下台，是《基本法》允許的情況，「我們的憲制沒有那麼脆弱」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又指，根據《基本法》，即使立法會因否決預算案而解散，仍須經歷另一次選舉，否決同一份預算案，特首才須辭職，並指政府若選擇將同一份預算案呈上立法會、而不作任何改動是很奇怪，舉例若政府選擇派錢，新選出的立會有可能通過，相關程序的結果無法預視。吳重申，根據客觀事實，能否肯定同一班人會再當選、政府會提出原案、民主派會再否決該份預算案，均未可知，如法庭不能肯定謀劃會成功便應減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉主動提到，初選有逾61萬人投票，若謀劃不會成功，選民是否被騙：「你看，他們被承諾，投票可為香港政局帶來改變」，質疑被告若認為計劃不可能實現，是無向選民說出真相。吳指，難以知道所有選民投票的原因，並強調政府有責任維持穩定，對於謀劃公開、但政府容許投票發生而沒採取行動感到非常驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳靄儀量刑時不應考慮國安法前行為-官明言拒納&quot;&gt;吳靄儀：量刑時不應考慮《國安法》前行為 官明言拒納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳續指，被告於《國安法》生效前行為並不構成罪行，認為判刑時不能就《國安法》前的行為懲罰他們。法官李運騰指，人的思想不會一夜改變，除非有證據顯示被告的改變，否則被告《國安法》前的行為，可用作推論他《國安法》後的心態和參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳強調，《國安法》無追溯力，認為此前行為只可用來證明串謀存在、及被告是謀劃的參與者，但不能用來衡量其罪責，並因此而加刑。法官陳慶偉指，他不能接納這一點，早前求情亦已向代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明表達；又問吳是望法庭不考慮范國威《國安法》前哪一些行為。吳坦言，此爭論與范關係不太大，是原則的爭議，並指范在初選並非組織者或發起人，只是出席協調會議和參加初選，參與較低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;范獲民建聯吳仕福前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信&quot;&gt;范獲民建聯吳仕福、前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳續談及范的個人背景，指他在美國修讀藝術，對政治感興趣，自2000年起擔任21年西貢區議員，並曾任立法會議員6年，指范非常務實，專注改善地區民生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又呈上民建聯西貢區議會前主席吳仕福的求情信，指范會議出席率顯示他的勤奮，他曾在區議會就區內事務推動超過300項議案。范又獲前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信，指范十分務實、無私，為將軍澳區發展有很大貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另呈上多封街坊和同事撰寫的求情信，形容范是很受歡迎的議員，為居民改善生活。吳又呈上一幅范於3年前牛年為街坊所畫的畫，街坊憶述當時天氣寒冷，范手指僵硬仍作畫，不想令街坊失望，辯方指顯示范希望為街坊帶來快樂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又呈上范的母親、姐姐和女兒的求情信，范的女兒今年畢業，形容他為「每個女生所能渴求的最好的父親（the best father any girl can ask for）」，其母親亦讚他為好兒子，悉心照顧病重父親。吳指，范是「顧家的好男人（good family man）」、勤奮務實，望將本案一切抛諸腦後，與家人相處（keep himself to family），沒有重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳強調，范無意違法，他受誤導而犯案，已感到非常後悔，望法庭考慮他為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」的較低程度，因及時認罪、有悔意、良好品格和公共服務而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鍾雪瑩認藏槍囚7年4個月 官：接納為維繫與男友蘇緯軒關係而犯案&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZIy1Vlc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴7名被告。陪審團昨裁定6人罪脫，1人交替罪成。至於早前認罪的吳智鴻及鍾雪瑩，今（30日）於高等法院進行求情。吳押後再進一步求情，鍾則涉與在計劃中任槍手的男友蘇緯軒同住並藏有槍械，她承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，被判囚7年4個月。法官張慧玲接納辯方指，鍾犯案是為了維繫與男友的情侶關係，而「今次犯案基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒」。張官考慮到無證據證明鍾使用槍械作非法用途，但肯定她必然知道男友躲藏是為逃避警方拘捕，故決定以10年監禁為量刑起點。無罪釋放的男被告張俊富及李家田今亦有到場旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳智鴻認串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸罪&quot;&gt;吳智鴻認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為12.8行動策劃者的吳智鴻（案發時24歲），承認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及「意圖危害生命而管有槍械或彈藥」罪；至於「串謀謀殺」罪則獲存檔法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈文件顯示吳品學兼優-官質疑小學幾優異都係假&quot;&gt;辯方呈文件顯示吳品學兼優 官質疑「小學幾優異都係假」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳身穿黑色西裝、戴眼鏡及紮馬尾，步出犯人欄，一度向旁聽親友點頭。吳由資深大律師謝志浩及大律師陳韋君代表。法官張慧玲表示，辯方沒有呈交「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的案例，雖然大部分案例是英國，但原則上亦相同。張官要求辯方作出書面補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方呈上了吳的父母及未婚妻所撰寫的求情信。但張官不解為何辯方呈上一些與現時無關、遠至小學階段的信件，包括吳希望入讀香港華仁書院，並自行寫信予校長的文件。辯方解釋，希望反映吳是一名資優生，小學時品學兼優，父母對他有很大期望。張官指：「小學幾優異都係假」、「二十幾歲人，已經做緊嘢，講返小學做咩？」張官又批評辯方沒有篩選過文件便呈交予法庭。張官指將會押後再求情，以待辯方準備案例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾雪瑩認無牌管有槍械及彈藥罪&quot;&gt;鍾雪瑩認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一被告鍾雪瑩（案發時29歲）承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，案發時她為認罪被告兼污點證人蘇緯軒的女友。鍾身穿白色恤衫及灰色外套、戴眼鏡及紮馬尾，步出犯人欄。她自2020年10月被捕後還柙至今近4年。鍾由大律師陳永豪及陳濟洲代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;案情指鍾與男友兼槍手蘇緯軒同住-單位內有兩支槍&quot;&gt;案情指鍾與男友兼槍手蘇緯軒同住 單位內有兩支槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案情指，蘇被指派在12.8行動之中擔任槍手，射擊警務人員，他管有一支手槍、一支 AR15 長槍及大量彈藥。但最後串謀者被捕故行動夭折。蘇與鍾為情侶關係，他們於2019年12月16日帶同槍械遷入翠屏花園躲藏。直至20日，警方尾隨兩人離開翠屏花園，並將他們截停。當警長捉住蘇的右臂時，他突然轉身逃跑，同時在腰間拔出手槍上膛，向警長開一槍。警長及時按下蘇的右臂，子彈沒有打中。於21日，警方在搜屋時發現一支長槍裝上瞄準裝置、8個裝有逾200發彈藥的彈匣，以及防彈背心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警員其後亦拘捕鍾雪瑩，她在警誡下表示，自己任職設計師，陳玉龍於2019年8月介紹蘇予她認識。蘇因為與家人吵架而遷至藏身處，並叫鍾同住。蘇被捕後，鍾因驚慌故收拾東西離開，前往朋友「阿龍」的住所。她又指槍械屬於蘇，自己並不知道用途。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情若犯案是為維繫愛侶感情可行使酌情權&quot;&gt;辯方求情：若犯案是為維繫愛侶感情，可行使酌情權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方求情指，涉案槍械及彈藥並非由鍾購買，她只是跟隨男友，其角色被動，並非始作俑者。辯方又呈上案例指，若法庭接納犯罪是因維繫家人及愛侶的感情，或被他們利用，則可行使酌情權。辯方又指，沒有證據證明鍾直接接觸或使用涉案槍械作非法用途，亦未能證明她知道12.8行動，以及男友管有槍械的意圖。辯方又提及，雖然鍾在2018年因非法集結罪被判囚4星期，但希望法庭不要因此加刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方鍾還柙期間改過已經向善&quot;&gt;辯方：鍾還柙期間改過、已經向善&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指在獄中傳道的牧師對鍾的嘉許正面，鍾母則讚女兒孝順、有愛心及樂於助人。辯方總結指，鍾面對案件期間多次流淚並掙扎，更改過並進修充實自己，現時是「已經向善嘅鍾雪瑩」。張官卻認為，即使鍾在羈留期間向善，但判刑時仍然應該以控罪性質為重，並需要向社會大眾發出需要嚴懲的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，鍾被捕後被控「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，於2021年一度被改控更嚴重的「意圖危害生命而管有槍械或彈藥」罪，當時她不認罪。最後與律政司認罪協商後，改為承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪。辯方希望法庭採納10年或以下的量刑起點，並給予25%減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾患混合焦慮抑鬱症-需到精神科覆診&quot;&gt;鍾患混合焦慮抑鬱症 需到精神科覆診&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官考慮約一小時後判刑，並讀出鍾的背景。鍾現時33歲，童年時期被欺負導致有抑鬱症狀，她於19歲時被戀人欺騙後，一度打算自殘。直至2014年她到屯門醫院精神科求醫，被診斷患適應障礙症。其後曾向私家醫生求醫，但經濟上未能負擔而放棄。鍾在羈留期間情緒低落，於2021年5月被診斷患混合焦慮抑鬱症，因此被安排繼續到精神科覆診，惟過往數月焦慮情況加劇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接納為維繫關係而犯案-基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒&quot;&gt;官接納為維繫關係而犯案 「基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官判刑時表示，「明顯睇到你細個嘅經歷波動，唔係平穩。今次犯案基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒。」張官接納辯方指，鍾犯案為維繫與蘇緯軒的情侶關係，而鍾在羈留期間已嚐失去自由的滋味。張官指，欣賞鍾在求情信中沒有要求輕判，反而要求法庭判處她應得的懲罰。張官表示，控罪最高刑罰為14年監禁，犯案明顯對公眾及社會帶來很大危險，因此阻嚇性刑罰是無可避免。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官槍械非隨身攜帶無證據證明作非法用途&quot;&gt;官：槍械非隨身攜帶、無證據證明作非法用途&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官考慮案情時指，雖然涉案槍械彈藥並非隨身攜帶，但卻放在床下，沒有覆蓋和收好，有機會讓歹徒取得並使用。本案中沒有證據證明槍械已裝上子彈，亦無證據顯示鍾用作非法用途。但張官肯定鍾必然知道男友躲藏是為逃避警方拘捕，亦曾目睹他開槍射向警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官考慮鍾真心悔改-減刑兩個月&quot;&gt;官考慮鍾真心悔改 減刑兩個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官決定以10年監禁為量刑起點。她指不會因鍾過往的非法集結案底而加刑，至於減刑方面則給予25%扣減，即判囚7年半。張官另考慮到鍾真心悔改、羈留期間有正面改變，以及重犯機會微，因此減刑兩個月，共判囚7年4個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference report is based on the discussions which occurred during a one-day workshop held in September 2023 at RUSI’s headquarters in London, attended by a range of representatives from defence companies and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). The purpose of the workshop was to identify early opportunities to set the conditions for integration across the joint force. The workshop examined where and how the MoD, the armed services and, especially, UK Strategic Command (StratCom) and its new Integration Design Authority (IDA) can achieve immediate results to galvanise the broader effort to deliver the stated aspiration of providing “integration as a service”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop focused on the questions of how different actors, both past and present, have approached the challenge of data integration, and sought to examine which transferable lessons might be drawn from precedents from both the world of defence and beyond it, in areas such as the financial sector. This report, based on the workshop and subsequent secondary literature review, examines the immediate steps that the MoD can take to set the conditions for a broader effort to achieve multi-domain integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key deduction from the day’s discussions was that if, as is likely to be the case, software-driven evolution will play an important role in determining how the joint force fights, perhaps to an even greater degree than hardware adaptation, then it will be of considerable importance that frontline commands (FLCs) are able to cohere capability at all stages, even as the software is continually adapted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was noted that traces of this change are already visible in operational theatres such as Ukraine, where software can and must be adapted on a six-weekly basis to stay ahead of adversary cyber- and electronic-warfare capabilities; this rate far exceeds that of hardware replacement or adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the joint force is to operate across domains, FLCs must pursue iterative change in a coordinated manner. Consequently, the specific focus of the workshop was on achieving common data standards within defence. The workshop and subsequent research relied on historical case studies from both the UK and other nations to identify the drivers of success and failure in integration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day’s discussions also examined the development of civilian networks, which have succeeded through the existence of standards sufficiently broad to enable change but well defined enough to allow for interoperability. The lessons derived are applicable to other areas where integration and standardisation of capabilities across all services is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key findings surfaced from the day’s discussions, and reinforced by a review of secondary literature, are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is limited precedent for successful integration on a top-down basis. Moreover, success has often involved procedures which – by virtue of their secrecy – existed outside normal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In several areas there are strong service- and defence-level incentives to collaborate, but no individual service owns responsibility for an outcome. This separates operational from financial risk. Helping resolve these “tragedy of the commons” areas would allow the IDA to work with, rather than against, the grain of service imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common set of foundational standards which FLCs can use to drive the process of integration could serve as a starting point. Data standards are a key part of the foundations. Achieving standards in one area can create functional spill-overs (where integration in one area makes it difficult to function without integration in other areas, leading to a cascading process that eventually requires no top-down supervision).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-integration&quot;&gt;The Challenge of Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed at the workshop, a number of factors can pose challenges to the effective integration of capabilities across the joint force. Among them are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tendency towards feature creep – the expansion of an integration effort to include more tasks than can reasonably be accomplished, thereby increasing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An over-emphasis on technical capabilities, as opposed to specifying the operational requirements that justify the costs and complexities inherent to integration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-adoption or partial adoption of standards once they are created.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standards that act as barriers to entry for new capabilities because of their complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, it was noted that these challenges have been prominent features of previous UK efforts at joint force integration, particularly the Network Enabled Capability (NEC) programme, which began in the 2000s. The challenges that the UK has faced with the adoption of the NEC are in certain respects emblematic of the issues one may expect to encounter. As pointed out by one of the participants, the NEC was a victim of the fact that FLCs were not involved in articulating operational use cases. Moreover, the programme was not closely aligned at the enterprise level. Ideally, it would have encompassed both the relationships between different acquisition lines and areas such as operator education. It was noted that because NEC-related programmes were not situated within an operational use case, the costs were harder to justify within individual services where the benefit was not as great as for others. As a result, when services had to make trade-offs between individual NEC capabilities (such as a cooperative engagement) and other lines of effort, NEC capabilities were often sacrificed, scaled back or only partially adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case studies discussed at the workshop, such as the US Air Force’s Airborne Battle Management System (ABMS) programme, illustrate another major risk that integration efforts face: feature creep. The programme, which began as a replacement for the E-8 JSTARS, morphed into a wider effort to deliver an internet of things. While this development was not problematic in itself, the fact that use cases were driven by programme executive offices led to uncoordinated feature creep and cost increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those instances where effective top-down integration was achieved, notably the US Navy’s NIFC-CA programme, it was enabled by two things. First, a clear single service chain of command within a well-defined mission set allowed the US Navy to control requirements and enforce them. Second, as observed by a workshop participant who was involved in the rollout of the programme, the heavy classification of the programme meant that decision-making was restricted to a small number of individuals who had the authority to make and enforce systems engineering trade-offs (even though, in many cases, the reasons for specific requirements were not communicated to those charged with implementing them). Narrowing the group responsible for making decisions made it possible to avoid feature creep. Once established, requirements were imposed on engineers with little room for consultation, given the classifications involved, while the decision-makers’ authority could not be challenged. It was noted at the workshop that the ability to develop stringent requirements and ensure their adoption without pushback was only possible because many existing procedures for procuring and integrating capability were circumvented in a programme which was subject to highly centralised (and specific) processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed the fact that that these criteria will be difficult to achieve outside very specific contexts. So instead of integrating specific platforms, a different approach to integration might be taken – one that uses the authorities of bodies such as StratCom to solve emerging tragedies of the commons, over which no individual service has effective control or responsibility. Participants agreed that where StratCom can add value as the “strategic integrator” is not by solving specific integration challenges as an external part of the programme, but rather by creating toolkits that allow integration to be driven by MoD Finance and Military Capability (FMC) using existing management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections describe working use cases which might become a basis for focused support to cross-service integration by StratCom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-to-enable-cross-service-integration&quot;&gt;Opportunities to Enable Cross-Service Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several solutions emerged from the day’s discussions. First, the IDA could provide a mechanism to cohere capability if it more systematically informed the Defence Capability Risk Assessment Register (DCAR) process. Although the IDA does not have budgetary authority, it can provide FMC with information about which capability gaps can be closed through integrating existing or likely capabilities and which require additional capacity rather than integration. Through the IDA and leveraging its responsibilities for Defence Digital, StratCom can generate an information base regarding data standards, which FMC can then use to insert requirements into specific programmes. This might be analogised to the way in which consultancy firms are used by governments to fill gaps in both expertise and capacity. With a staff drawn from across the services and the capacity (through the Permanent Joint Headquarters) to assess the operational use cases for individual service capabilities, StratCom can provide FMC with the information needed to inform decisions regarding data standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed at the workshop, the importance of a feedback loop between StratCom and FMC will become greater in the medium term, as the demands of integration will increasingly affect hardware. Most concepts for distributed operations, such as DARPA’s “STITCHES” Initiative, introduce considerable requirements for processing power to enable network integration and the translation of data at the tactical edge. This will in turn introduce size and cost requirements on platforms which StratCom and FMC can only drive in tandem. A model which is initially applied to data- and software-led development can then serve as a microcosm for a more ambitious system which will be needed in a 10-year timeframe. The model can enable StratCom and FMC to develop the procedures needed to coordinate with each other and the FLCs, and can introduce the services to new practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-market-of-standards&quot;&gt;Creating a Market of Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, it was noted that delivering the integration identified above could be facilitated immediately by creating a market of common standards which services can opt into for specific functions. In this way, StratCom could set the stage for future integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, if software-led integration is a priority, flexible standards will be essential. This has been observed in civilian networks, which are able to maximize their effectiveness through a combination of relatively specific bearer standards and much more flexible standards for transport and middleware layers of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also observed that there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that backwards integration with open source software is possible, with examples from the world of integrated air and missile defence particularly prominent. It is possible to define broad parameters within which messages must fit and to then rely on middleware to translate data across the different formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that not all tasks will require comparable levels of data standardisation. For tasks such as electronic warfare, for example, the requirements for rapid updating and the stringency of security requirements impose a need for well-defined standards, which limit the amount of time needed to translate data across formats. Similarly, a particularly stringent set of standards could be adopted by the FLCs to share F-35 data while they might select different standards for other functions. Conversely, in other cases, such as joint logistics, a more flexible set of standards might be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key determinant of the degree to which standards are necessarily stringent will likely be the degree to which network compromise can be expected, as pointed out during discussions regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine. Where network compromise is highly likely (for example, because platforms will operate within reach of adversary electronic warfare capabilities), it will probably be the case that data will need to be packaged in ways that enable encryption while balancing the trade-offs involved between encryption and latency. As was discussed at the workshop, this will be of particular importance when a decision is made to exploit civilian bandwidth for certain functions – the relative lack of security of the network layer makes the security of the messaging layer all the more important. In other instances, compromise may be likely but accepted as the cost of scalability – for example, when commercial off-the-shelf UAVs are being incorporated into force structures. Finally, there are some instances where the security of a network against different modes of compromise is sufficiently robust that risk can be accepted at the level of data. One example is communications using millimetric wave frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both discussions during the workshop and existing research suggest that the experience of organisations such as the International Organization for Standardization lends itself to the argument that a diverse set of voluntary standards can be effective in allowing agents to select standards that are best suited to enabling their operations. Rather than driving the process, StratCom and the IDA could generate multiple options which can be relevant to specific multi-domain tasks, from which FLCs can jointly select based on cross-service consultation. By resolving the informational challenge of generating options, Stratcom can narrow the set of options from which services can choose and provide them with an incentive to choose from the options it provides by removing the requirement to generate standards by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conclusion reached by participants was that where StratCom might add value is through the provision of a typology of trade-offs. Data standards could be categorised on whether they are designed to allow access to multiple network types, reduce latency or increase security – mindful of the fact that one can typically only achieve at most two of these three ideals. FLCs could then justify trading off one priority against others based on the demands of a specific operational requirement. For example, if forward reconnaissance elements of the force are expected to operate in communications-denied or -disrupted environments, they might opt to trade latency for the ability to securely use multiple modes of communication. Levels of encryption sufficient to pass data along multiple types of networks with different levels of vulnerability to compromise necessarily impose demands in terms of the TTPs and the size of data packages, meaning a cost in latency which precludes certain things such as the frequent use of full video links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-distributed-tactical-ledgers&quot;&gt;Case Study: Distributed Tactical Ledgers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part of the workshop was based on group discussions of potential use cases. One area where participants identified the potential to achieve “quick wins” was the development of a system comparable to those based around distributed ledgers that have emerged in the world of finance. The key points that emerged from discussions around this use case are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any system that requires coordinated collective action requires agents to have information about each other’s whereabouts, capabilities and obligations. For example, if an air defence interception is to be performed on a collaborative basis that might involve an Army-operated GBAD system, an RAF combat aircraft and a ship, it will be necessary to know what capabilities are held on each platform, how well suited they are to the task of an interception and how valuable it would be for each platform to perform the interception as opposed to another function. In other words, ledgers of both capabilities and the value of using a given capability in a specific way would be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed in the breakout sessions, awareness currently existing at the theatre level includes the Recognised Air Picture (RAP) at a Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC). However, if envisioned concepts of distributed operations are to be achieved, this awareness and capacity for collaboration must be pushed to the edge. One prerequisite for this is a shared set of standards by which information about available cross-domain blue forces and tasking orders can be shared locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the breakout sessions agreed that the ability to task capabilities in a decentralised manner would require, at a minimum, both the ability of units to communicate their availability to nearby units from across the force, and a basis on which tasking requests might be either accepted or rejected. In the civilian world, applications such as Uber accomplish this through the broadcasting of data by taxis and the use of a price mechanism. However, this model is not directly transferrable to a military context. The constant broadcasting of data represents a security risk, while decisions about what a platform is tasked to do typically reflect the allocation of resources to a task by a higher authority through, for example, an air tasking order. However, many emerging concepts of operations, such as Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and Mosaic Warfare, presume a comparable dynamic recombination of assets, with systems sometimes being tasked to a zone rather than a specific function. In a military context, communications would likely need to be local rather than broadcasted, because broadcasting availability creates risk and would rely on directional transmissions which, in turn, create a requirement for blue force tracking which would be difficult to assure in GPS denied environments. The requirement for accurate blue force tracking stems from the fact that to share data safely, as F-35s have done with US Marine Corps HIMARS batteries in tests, systems need to use Link 16 on directional antennae rather than relying on omni-directional broadcasts, which would reveal their positions. Directional transmissions require an accurate understanding of the location of a receiving antenna, which has been achieved in tests but which would be difficult to deliver in conflict. The need for blue force tracking incentivises an effort to leverage multiple networks, but this must be balanced against the requirement for security. In effect, there is something of a trade-off between the flexibility of a system in terms of the network it uses and the data used. The more flexible a system is at the network level, the more stringent data standards must be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system would necessitate a shift from mission command to mission definition at the edge, as operators would exercise control over not only how they executed preset missions but also which tasks they opted to support. For example, an aircraft over a part of the battlefield for the purpose of SEAD may face a choice between engaging a SAM or broadcasting data to enable another system such as a GMLRS to engage another target. This requires the pilot to know how valuable the alternative target is regarding the ground forces mission set as opposed to the SAM, which could be otherwise engaged as part of the SEAD mission. In effect, a military analogue to a pricing mechanism is necessary for multi-domain operations, but it must be secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coordination of capabilities will require network standards that are sufficiently flexible to enable the use of multiple pathways, as well as data standards that are stringent enough to allow for tasking requests to be communicated securely, since multiple networks of varying reliability are being used in the face of adversary compromise. Also, a mechanism for assessing whether the application of a system to a task is appropriate given the system’s availability would be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this task is both complex and a multi-level system engineering task, the full extent of which should be the basis for subsequent discussions a first step towards such a system might involve delivering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed cross-domain system for tracking blue forces and delivering tasking orders without communications to higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed system for assigning value to tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system of distributed ledgers would at a minimum require shared standards for indexing data about locations, capabilities and values, as well as voting protocols to enable changes to locations and target values without systemic risk. There are multiple network types which can support such a system. Area-wide communications networks, including civilian systems such as Starlink, might represent one mode. Alternatively, each platform in an area can communicate locally to update peers on its position, enabling them to pass this data further on to platforms adjacent to them. This could enable data to be “daisy chained” between adjacent systems to allow for broad situational awareness to be achieved without the constant broadcasting of data. Local communication with adjacent nodes can be achieved with low wavelength communications frequencies that are less susceptible to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain instances and use cases, particularly where situational awareness is desirable over a broad area (for example, in the context of distributed operations in the maritime domain), it may be desirable to accept stringent standards of encryption as a means of utilising multiple network types. In other instances, for example within the land operating environment, the relative proximity of multiple units may allow for the use of mobile ad-hoc networks to enable the daisy chaining of data using less easily compromised modes of communication such as millimetre wave radios or tropospheric scatter – in turn allowing for more flexible data standards that allow lower latency and a lower requirement for operators to generate encryption keys. Security in this context is delivered by the network and not the data, and the relative simplicity of the data being transmitted (which allows for low latency) does not need to be lost due to a requirement for padding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as such a system does not exist, it can be directly shaped by central bodies in a way that creates a common good around which service-level lines of effort would adapt. Generating a set of differentiated data standards that might underpin such a system would be likely to secure service-level buy-in for several reasons. First, it simplifies the task of selecting standards for individual services. Second, such a system would not necessarily require services to immediately grapple with the intricacies of networking platforms to generate complete situational awareness. Rather, it would require the ability to receive and transmit simple data regarding the presence of friendly platforms and the value of any given adversary target across a shared indexing system. Third, a broad market of standards could allow different trade-offs to be weighed by services based on the tactical imperatives of one or more services in a specific context. Generally, the acceptance of standards tends to depend on the number of impositions that standards create. The more intricate a set of standards, the less likely it is that buy-in will be achieved. A flexible set of standards which is only restrictive on issues that directly pertain to security can circumvent this issue and, importantly, allow tasks to determine approaches. Because services can agree standards based on their appropriateness to a shared cross-service task, this can secure support, because the need for a given standard is rooted in an operational requirement rather than a top-down diktat. This bottom-up approach has characterised previous successful efforts at cross-service coordination, such as the 31 initiatives between the US Army and US Air Force which led to the emergence of AirLand Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several deductions emerged from the discussions held as part of the workshop. Of greatest salience was the suggestion made throughout the day that, as it approaches the task of integrating the force, StratCom will benefit from an approach that builds from relatively modest goals, but with a clear sense of where it is heading. It must eventually achieve the following aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish organisational procedures which allow it to determine integration requirements in light of operational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a shared set of routines for coordinating with FMC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effort to establish shared data standards could serve as a starting point. Standards need not immediately impinge on service-level prerogatives regarding platform-level decisions and can be approached in a flexible way, as illustrated by voluntary standards markets. The tasks for which standards are sought might initially involve less stringent capabilities, such as a shared indexing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a range of options can be of greater utility than the imposition of standards, not least because standards imposed by fiat are often opposed, and moreover tend to create perverse incentive structures. By contrast, the creation of an option set allows one or more services to explicitly weigh trade-offs and justify choices made in light of the trade-offs acceptable in the specific operational contexts in which the assets of more than one FLC interact. On the basis of the system and precedents set, StratCom and FMC could begin to articulate a more coherent system and division of labour, which could then be applied to more complex systems engineering challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling the relatively modest task of creating a flexible set of data standards and solving broad tragedies of the commons could, then, create the conditions for a more ambitious future approach to integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，陪審團今（29日）裁定6人就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立，當中包括已還柙3年半的張俊富。但張於開審前承認「管有爆炸品」及「無牌管有槍械」共兩罪，法官張慧玲判囚18個月。辯方求情指，張自2021年3月起至今已還柙3年半，故希望法庭判即時獲釋的刑期。據了解，計算刑期後張可以即時獲釋。法庭明天將會處理認罪被告吳智鴻及鍾雪瑩的求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;案情指張俊富與黃振強將煙花放貨倉&quot;&gt;案情指張俊富與黃振強將煙花放貨倉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張俊富（案發時22歲）早前承認「管有爆炸品」及「無牌管有槍械」罪。案情指，張俊富於12月3日凌晨，曾經與黃振強取得兩箱煙花，並放置在荃灣貨倉。在他被捕後，警方於其住所檢取貨倉鎖匙，並前往搜查。最後發現有防彈板、兩盒煙花爆竹、4罐胡椒噴劑、10支伸縮棍、大量示威裝備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情已還柙3年半望法庭判即時獲釋刑期&quot;&gt;辯方求情：已還柙3年半、望法庭判即時獲釋刑期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張俊富的大律師李國輔求情指，張案發時22歲，現在27歲，自2021年3月起至今已還柙3年半，故希望法庭判即時獲釋的刑期。辯方又指，張乘搭快艇到內地水域被捕後，已服刑一段時間，送返港後再因妨礙司法公正罪判囚10個月。辯方認為法庭可考慮上述因素，以及張主動帶警察去搜查涉案地點，而給予更多扣減。辯方希望法庭就「管有爆炸品」罪判不多於2年，就「無牌管有槍械」罪以6個月為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官明顯作破壞之用不接納用作自衛&quot;&gt;官：明顯作破壞之用、不接納用作自衛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲判刑時指，涉案的炮仗煙花可以令人燒傷，而且擺放在荃灣貨倉明顯打算作破壞之用，就「管有爆炸品」罪以20個月監禁量刑。至於涉案的胡椒噴劑，張官不接納辯方指作為自衛用途，明顯是與「屠龍」的示威行動有關，唯一合理推論是噴向警方，就「無牌管有槍械」罪以15個月為量刑起點。張官認為，張因乘搭快艇潛逃到內地才會被判監，因此是咎由自取，並非減刑因素。張官給予25%認罪扣減，「管有爆炸品」罪其中3個月分期，合共判囚18個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「管有爆炸品」罪指，張俊富於2019年12月3日至12月8日期間（包括首尾兩日），在荃灣致利工業大廈內一單位，明知而管有、保管或控制兩盒煙花。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「無牌管有槍械」罪指，張俊富於2019年12月8日，在同地無牌管有4個載有諾香草胺的噴罐（即胡椒噴劑）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪則不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Wagner Group ceasing to exist last year after the death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, it may seem that the threat from non-state actors on the battlefield in Ukraine has disappeared. However, while the most well-known group might have stopped its activities, Ukraine continues to attract various paramilitary groups, most of which hold far-right views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notorious groups that is known for its involvement in Ukraine is Rusich, which has been actively involved in the conflict in Ukraine since 2014 and holds extreme right-wing, neo-Nazi beliefs. One of its leaders, Alexei Milchakov, became infamous not only for publicly and proudly calling himself a Nazi, but also for his penchant for sadistic violence after he made a video of himself killing and eating a puppy. It must be noted, however, that Rusich does not seem to be particularly popular among the Russian far right. Thus, Sergei Korotkih, one of the creators of the Russian National Socialist movement and an ally of Russia’s most infamous neo-Nazi, Maxim Martsinkevich (nicknamed Tesak), was quoted as saying that people like Milchakov are considered “losers” in the movement and see the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to gain traction on social media. This may be true, as the group’s social channels contain very little ideological content and the small amount that is available is mostly dedicated to the thrill of killing Ukrainian soldiers who, it appears, Rusich considers a second-class race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another far-right group is the Russian Imperial Movement (or specifically its military wing, the Imperial Legion) and its smaller affiliates, which consider themselves “nationalists”. They believe that Ukraine as a state should not exist and it is simply part of Russia; hence, they see their participation in the war as contributing to the unification of Russian territories, with the final goal of creating new Russian Empire with a monarch ruling it. The group’s social media is full of posts dedicated to explaining its views and justifying its involvement in Ukraine. It should be noted that despite its enthusiastic welcome of the war and active involvement, the group presents itself as an opposition to the Russian government. In its rhetoric, it appears to hope that its involvement will eventually help it achieve its strategic goal of changing the regime in Russia and seizing political power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, the so-called Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) has also gained a certain amount of fame as a Russian group fighting on Ukraine’s side. This group was founded in August 2022 by Denis Kapustin (now Nikitin), a Russian national from Germany. It is believed that Kapustin holds neo-Nazi views, and he has even been labelled as a “key figure in European extreme far-right circles” and “one of the most dangerous neo-Nazis in the region”. Another member of the movement, Alexei Levkin, used to be the head of neo-Nazi group Wotanjugend, and called Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik a hero. Several other members also have a history of expressing public support for extreme right-wing groups and terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikitin himself, in an interview with PBS, said: “Islamisation, cultural Marxism, multiculturalism, I think all those – all those things are harmful. European culture is definitely endangered. I believe in things like the Great Replacement”. These and other comments made by Nikitin resonate with far-right ideology, which leaves no doubt as to his and his movement’s political views. It appears, however, from interviews with other members that the degree of acceptance of these views varies – some members say that they hold traditionalist views but do not agree with more extreme far-right ideas, and others have even argued that the image of RVC as being an extreme right group was created and promoted by their adversaries in Russia (the group is designated as a terrorist organisation in Russia). While this might be true, Russian neo-Nazis have expressed support for RVC on their social media (such as the Telegram channel “National Socialist”) and have even called for donations to help wounded RVC fighters receive medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It appears that despite the disappearance of the Wagner Group, Ukraine still remains an attractive target for various non-state actors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, there are also two more groups supporting Ukraine – “Freedom of Russia Legion” and “Sibir Batalion” – however, there is not enough credible information to make firm conclusions about their ideological orientations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it appears that despite the disappearance of the Wagner Group, Ukraine still remains an attractive target for various non-state actors, many of which hold extreme right-wing beliefs and are active on social media reporting about their activities and recruiting new members, as well as committing acts of violence. Their presence in the region is a reason for concern, as not only does it further aggravate the situation on the battlefield, but it also poses a security threat for Europe as these groups may attempt (as some already have) to move their activities beyond the borders of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（28日）踏入第82日審訊。3男6女陪審團昨（27日）早開始退庭商議8小時，仍未有結果，至今天繼續。陪審團提出3項問題，其中一項是，如達致不到有效裁決時，應該繼續討論，直至有人改變立場，還是尋求更多指引？法官張慧玲回答指，陪審團之間需互相借鑒及集思廣益，因此要考慮他人意見，並進行討論及辯論。有人最後可能會被說服並改變立場，亦有可能繼續堅持立場，但最重要是忠於自己的誓言，作出符合事實的裁決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問兩爆炸罪分別-官指涉恐怖主義罪需證明放公用場所及意圖致死&quot;&gt;陪審團問兩爆炸罪分別 官指涉恐怖主義罪需證明放公用場所及意圖致死&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陪審團提出了3項問題，並由法官張慧玲回答。首項問題為：「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，兩者的分別是否在知識上，對於「訂明標的」是否有認知？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示，「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的元素，除了包括將炸彈放置在公用場所外，亦要有意圖導致他人死亡，必須滿足上述所有元素。而「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，則毋須考慮炸彈是否放置在指定地點，只需考慮是否有意圖通過爆炸造成相當可能危害他人生命。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問財產的嚴重損害定義-官指無定義要憑經驗決定&quot;&gt;陪審團問「財產的嚴重損害」定義 官指無定義、要憑經驗決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二項問題是，恐怖主義行為中「財產的嚴重損害」的定義是甚麼？張官表示，法例上沒有實質定義，陪審團需要運用其人生經驗及智慧決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問未能達有效裁決是否應繼續討論-官指需忠於自己誓言&quot;&gt;陪審團問未能達有效裁決是否應繼續討論 官指需忠於自己誓言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第三項問題是，如達致不到有效裁決時，應該繼續討論，直至有人改變立場，還是尋求更多指引？張官回答指，陪審團之間需互相借鑒及集思廣益，因此要考慮他人意見，並進行討論及辯論。有人最後可能會被說服並改變立場，亦有可能繼續堅持立場，但最重要是忠於自己的誓言，作出符合事實的裁決。若然最後未能達至最低要求的7比2裁決，陪審團可通知張官。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（28日）踏入第82日審訊。3男6女陪審團昨（27日）早開始退庭商議至今午達14小時。法官今早回答陪審團提出的3項問題，下午再回答另一問題。陪審團問到，經多番討論後，就其中兩條控罪未能達致有效裁決，即其中一位被告的交替控罪「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，以及「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，陪審團問是否交法官處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲指，陪審團現已商議達14小時，希望他們再用更多時間商議。若他們在法律問題上有疑問，或在證據上需要提醒，張官會盡量幫忙，但如果最後仍未能達致有效裁決，就可以告知張官，表示「唔係監你哋話一定要達到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;相隔約一小時後，陪審團再問，他們對恐怖主義行為中「財產嚴重損害」的定義未能達成共識，各人有不同定義，他們希望法官就財產損害的程度提供具體準則。張官表示，她不能提供指引，因這屬事實裁斷範疇，需要由陪審團自行決定是否屬於嚴重。張官希望他們繼續商議，嘗試達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vyKJhWw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】「法官閣下，我係伍健偉，本案被告，D28。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，昨天踏入求情第9天。參選新西、獲逾2萬票出線的伍健偉，沒有律師代表，選擇隔着被告欄的玻璃幕牆，向三位法官親自陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大約一個小時的陳情，身穿灰色西裝的伍健偉聲線響亮，不徐不疾地吐出一字一句。右手拿着筆記的他，不時望向旁聽席微笑，說到凝重處會抿嘴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他說到參選原因——眼看有人犧牲自由甚至生命，他難以忍受自己毫不作為，「我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念」；他也相信政府是人民的僕人，港人應該亦值得擁有自由社會和民主制度。他又說，五大訴求合情合理，並非海市蜃樓的願望，他有責任為選民爭取；而當四年前61萬港人冒法律風險投票，作為代議士，「我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他於1995年9月6日出生。假若2020年9月6日的立法會選舉能如期舉行，他說當天的結果「可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在獄中近三年半，伍健偉說他願意為其行為負責，但不會為與選民共享的信念道歉：「我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。」作為政治人物，他期許自己有承擔，竭盡所能留守到最後一刻，「我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。」法官問他是否沒有悔意，他毫不猶䂊答：「冇錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;展望將來，伍健偉打算放低政治人物身分，但仍望盡力貢獻社會——他覺得只要抱持自救互助的精神，記錄過去真相，活在真實當下，為未來做好真誠準備，「香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以下為伍健偉陳情全文和與法官的對答紀錄，由《獨媒》記者整理及謄寫，部分對答經刪節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陽光底下的計劃&quot;&gt;陽光底下的計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我係伍健偉，本案被告，D28。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;喺我正式陳詞前，我想向之前代表我嘅資深大律師、大律師及律師團隊，感謝佢哋熱心同埋專業嘅服務。另外，我感恩社會各界對我哋嘅關心同埋支持，最後，我感激每一個愛我嘅人對我嘅付出同埋犧牲，（轉身向旁聽席躹躬）我祝福各位平安、健康。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就住控方對《國安法》入面「首要分子」同「罪行重大」嘅解讀，喺法律原則上，我冇咩補充，我相信法官、控方同埋一眾辯方律師喺法律原則上嘅議題處理得比我好好多。所以喺如何定義「首要分子」呢件事上，我冇咩想補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正如我喺較早之前6月24日嘅陳詞，我認為喺本案裡面，我係一個「積極參與者」。不過控方指出「罪行重大」嘅係要考慮被告或者本案嘅一啲原則，就住嗰啲原則，我希望向法庭提供幾個觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一點，法官閣下，本案「35+計劃」係一個喺陽光底下進行、眾所周知嘅計劃，我哋計劃裡面進行嘅手段同埋目的都係清晰、明確，而為人熟知嘅。我希望3位法官考慮嘅係，要達致我哋本案最終進入立法會無差別否決財政預算案呢件事，單靠我哋47個被告係冇可能完成。要進入立法會成為議員，係需要廣大嘅香港市民向我哋授權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而廣大市民對於願唔願意授權畀我哋進入立法會呢件事上，我認為其中一個背景，係7月《港區國安法》實施之後，有超過61萬香港市民喺7月11、12號參與咗我哋「35+計劃」嘅初選。法官閣下，毫無疑問，大家對於係咪違反《港區國安法》，喺當其時，對我而言，唔係一個絕對唔違法嘅情況。換句話說，參與投票嘅61萬市民，亦都係冒住犯上法律嘅風險，去進行嗰個嘅投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我作為一個民意嘅代表，除咗我有責任去遵守法律嘅義務之外，我嘅首要責任，係為選民去爭取佢哋嘅合理訴求。作為一個代議士，我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民，喺咁嘅情況下，希望法官喺考慮本案嘅罪行性質嘅時候，考慮各位被告佢哋之所以犯下本案嘅原因，並唔係出於個人嘅利益同埋私利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;合情合理的訴求&quot;&gt;合情合理的訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我想邀請法庭考慮第二點嘅係，法官閣下，我同意本案造成嘅後果可以引致一個憲政嘅危機，但係我唔同意呢個係一個憲政嘅災難。喺《基本法》下，第50、51、52條，本身其實已經有預計過發生相關嘅情況嘅時候，法律授權我哋嘅特區政府點樣去處理呢件事。當然，嚴重干預政府施政嘅效率係無可避免，但係喺《港區國安法》第22條裡面，我認為，各位被告充其量都係干犯咗第三條。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，「五大訴求」係一個合情、合理、無被法庭裁定違法嘅訴求，但係我想指出嘅係，五大訴求對於特區政府係「是不為也」，而非「不能為也」，至少「五大訴求」嘅第一項，撤回逃犯條訂條例，早在我哋7月之前已經係滿足咗。喺呢個情況下，我邀請法庭考慮嘅係，我哋唔係追求緊一個虛無飄渺、海市蜃樓嘅願望，香港市民就住五大訴求嘅每一個訴求⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳慶偉：今日是求情聆訊，不是讓你發表政見的場合⋯⋯如任何人想發表政治陳述，隨便，但不是在我的法庭內。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;和平理性非暴力的初選&quot;&gt;和平、理性、非暴力的初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明白法官你嘅立場嘅（微笑）。至於第三點，就住我哋本案個性質係咪「罪行重大」，我希望法庭考慮嘅係，喺當其時嘅時空同背景⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳仲衡：若邀法庭考慮為「積極參加者」，無需就「罪行重大」陳詞。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明白嘅法官（微笑），雖然我自己定位係積極參與者啫，但係假如三位法官唔同意嘅話，我都希望就住另外嗰兩個 category 作出一啲嘅回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過我第一部分嘅陳詞差唔多㗎喇（微笑）。正如我啱啱所講，我希望法官考慮當其時嘅背景，喺當其時，街頭嘅激烈衝突已經持續咗非常耐嘅時間，正如喺我嘅陳詞裡面所講，我唔希望有人受傷，唔希望有人被捕，更加唔希望再有人因為政治事件而犧牲佢哋嘅生命。所以，我選擇參與「35+」初選計劃，因為至少呢個手段雖然係違法，但呢個手段係和平、理性、非暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;無想過違法&quot;&gt;無想過違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：你在哪個階段意識到35+是違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我嘅認知係2021年1月6號我被拘捕嘅時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：你剛才說當時作為代議士，沒有選擇只能繼續，是否代表「35+計劃」進行時，已知道計劃可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我同意法官所講。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：即控罪期間已知計劃可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如果容讓我準確咁講，我對於參加「35+」初選有可能違法，係7月12號初選投票結束之後，我哋嘅政府官員，以及我唔記得係中聯辦定港澳辦喇 sorry，佢哋發出嘅聲明，大概係嗰啲嘅時段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：如指政府發聲明，時間是早於初選投票日。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，喺初選之前，我記得官員曾國衞先生有提出嘅，不過佢提出嘅係「可能」違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：他當然要這樣說，因為是否違法，是由法庭而非他來裁定，他最多只能講「可能」違法。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我作為一個市民嘅角度，我有理由相信政府係唔會任由罪案發生。容我舉一個例子，有一個人計劃揸車去打劫，佢有冇真係違法當然係由法庭去處理啦，而就算執法部門都只會通常回覆呢個行為可能係涉及違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但係如果呢件事係一個咁明確嘅違法罪行，我有理由相信政府嘅執法部門唔會容許成件事發生，發生完咗之後半年都冇進行任何嘅執法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：我只想知道你案發時的想法，警方何時拘捕是他們決定，不是我的關注。我的問題是，控罪期間，你是否知涉案協議可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，喺當其時，我對於喺財政預算案投否決，我並無得知，甚至認為有可能係違法。就住第一部分我嘅陳詞係咁多喇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（小休）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音&quot;&gt;暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，咁我就住個人背景開始陳詞。本人現齡28歲，現正喺監獄裡面修讀香港都會大學榮譽學士課程，未婚，係一個恨嫁嘅男人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（被告及旁聽席發笑）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我喺2021年2月28號被提控本案之前，無任何定罪記錄，喺2020至2021年期間，我透過選舉成為元朗區議會嘅議員，我喺2022年6月24日透過當時嘅代表律師，向法庭表達我嘅認罪意向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我承認串謀顛覆國家政權，我為我個人嘅過去一切嘅言行而負責。今日我想喺度向三位法官交代，我喺案發期間嘅想法同埋犯案嘅原因，希望三位法官可以給予我一定嘅耐性同埋包容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我喺1995年出世，自從1997年以來，香港涉及社會運動而被檢控嘅罪名、經審訊而裁定嘅刑罰，拾級而上，越發嚴苛，但係及後嘅社會運動，無論係參與嘅人數、時間、規模以及激烈嘅程度，仍然逐步擴大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認為，每一場暴動都係人民無被聽見的聲音，如果我哋香港人民嘅合理訴求持續被漠視，矛盾同衝突必然會接腫而來。高壓統治、嚴刑峻法，充其量只能夠收一時之效，深層次嘅矛盾必需要尋求解決之道，社會先有可能復和、邁進、穩定、繁榮，否則難言長治久安，更加枉論由治及興。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有義務繼承逝者信念&quot;&gt;有義務繼承逝者信念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我參與35+初選嘅原因，既有遠因，亦有近因。先講遠因，我個人嘅信念，相信政府係人民嘅僕人，而唔係統治者。我相信冇人願意被極權統治，我認為每一個人都希望生活喺一個可以追求夢想、免於恐懼嘅社會。作為一個香港人，我有一個理想，我認為大家應該擁有、亦都值得擁有自由、平等、包容嘅社會，有效維護人權、法治、公義嘅民主制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，2019年係我參選嘅近因，當其時有三個因素促使我作出呢個決定。第一個係我對自由被侵蝕嘅恐懼；第二，係對政府傲慢嘅不滿；第三，亦都係最重要、最令我動容嘅原因，係我對離世生命嘅沉重悲痛，我完全唔希望有人受傷，無論佢哋嘅政治取態，我亦都唔希望有人被捕，更加難以忍受有人犧牲生命，但自己無動於衷、毫不作為。作為一個普通市民，我冇能力起死回生，我甚至冇辦法阻止佢哋付出自由同埋生命嘅代價，我冇完美嘅答案去解決如此巨大嘅問題，但係我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念。基於上述原因，我認為參與社會運動、地區嘅服務、投身政治，係我可以為呢個社會有所貢獻嘅行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我喺2019年憑藉住4,371位選民對我嘅信任，而成為元朗區區議員；喺初選之中，憑藉住20,525位香港人，佢哋嘅支持而勝出初選。假若2020年9月6號立法會嘅選舉能夠如期順利舉辦，當日嘅結果，可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;成為一個代議士、一個香港民意嘅代表，我期許我自己嘅首要責任，係為民發聲、為民請命，我有責任去捍衛人民嘅權利，同埋佢哋嘅自由，努力爭取選民合情合理嘅訴求得以實現。即使機會係渺茫，即使我個人對於喺建制上尋求改革毫無信心，但我仍然會選擇承擔風險，尋求打破局面嘅機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：是什麼風險？你小休前說，當時不認為是違法。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;喺我被捕之前，我實在冇諗過會因為本案而入獄，但係並唔等於我認為成為一個代議士係唔會犯上任何嘅《國安法》，原因可能係因為我嘅政治言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：我不明白，你是說你當選後會做違法的事？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. 我嘅意思，係我認為即使我唔係成為一個立法會議員，但係喺《港區國安法》之下，我繼續參與政治活動或者社會運動，有好大嘅風險會觸犯相關嘅法律⋯⋯如果就本案「35+計劃」，成為一個立法會議員，喺議會無差別否決財政預算案，正如啱啱所重複，我冇諗過會因為呢件事而違法。但係另外一方面，我認為，我喺立法會議員以外嘅身分嘅行動，譬如，舉一個例⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：不認為需舉例，只是就協議檢控，而非其他行為，你不用自證其罪。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;不為信念道歉&quot;&gt;不為信念道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;咁我繼續落去。法官閣下，距離我被捕之前，我冇任何一刻打算離開香港，我願意為我嘅行為負責，但係我唔會為我同選民所共享嘅信念同埋價值而道歉，我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：可理解為，你對做過的事沒有悔意？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（沉默片刻，神情凝重）正如我所講，我為我嘅所有言行而負責，我會承擔一切嘅代價。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：那不是我的問題，我問的是，你是不是對你做過的事沒有悔意？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（直視法官）無錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為一個政治人物，我期許我要有承擔，竭盡我所能，留守到最後一刻，所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長夜終盡黎明將至&quot;&gt;長夜終盡，黎明將至&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，展望將來，我作為民意代表嘅任期已經完結，我打算放低政治人物嘅身分，但我仍然希望盡力留喺香港貢獻社會，即使我已經預視到困難係重重嘅，不過首先，一如時任嘅終審法官包致金先生所講：「There is no reason to leave if things are good, and if things are bad, there are more reason to stay.」我認為香港人同我只要抱持自救互助嘅精神、理性嘅思考，行公義、好憐憫，存謙卑的心，記錄過去嘅真相，活在真實嘅當下，為未來做好真誠嘅準備，香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後，法官閣下，二十世紀嘅完結，我哋向蘇聯同埋納粹作告別。失去足夠制衡嘅權力必然會自我膨脹，絕對嘅權力必定帶來絕對嘅腐敗。長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我感謝三位法官嘅包容同埋忍耐，本人謹此作結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳慶偉：因為你遲認罪和沒有悔意，認罪扣減會遠少於其他被告，你有沒有話想說？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;冇嘅，法官，我完全明白嘅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（28日）續處理參選新西的吳敏兒、譚凱邦，和參選新東的柯耀林求情。代表前職工盟主席吳敏兒的資深大律師李志喜指，涉案串謀不涉武力，性質非顛覆罪最嚴重，而且參選人可被DQ，計劃不可能成功。她又指吳敏兒於初選落敗，屬「陪跑」，望法庭考慮她為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」。辯方又引述吳敏兒親撰的求情信，提及她2016年成為職工盟主席，參選僅望改善勞工法律，沒有意圖顛覆國家。她被捕始知涉違法，對此感到震驚，而職工盟已解散，她已與政治劃清界線，形容犯案是「人生最大的錯誤」，就此真誠致歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭家麒梁國雄張可森無到庭&quot;&gt;郭家麒、梁國雄、張可森無到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的郭家麒、梁國雄及張可森今無到庭，其餘7人按男女分成上下兩排，由6名懲教人員隔坐。昨天綁馬尾的吳敏兒和黃子悅，今改為紮髻，黃亦改為穿有藍白色蕾絲領的黑色公主袖連衣裙。各被告向旁聽親友揮手、點頭，吳敏兒露齒微笑，黃子悅做心心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員劉慧卿、邵家臻，社民連曾健成等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方謀劃不涉武力法庭不應採納過高量刑起點&quot;&gt;辯方：謀劃不涉武力、法庭不應採納過高量刑起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師李志喜為前職工盟主席吳敏兒求情。李表示，《國安法》第22條的刑期分級制僅針對顛覆的實質罪行，並不適用於本案的串謀控罪；但若法庭認為可作參考，辯方立場是本案的「非法手段」不涉武力或威脅使用武力，不應視為「罪行重大」，而法庭不應採納過高的量刑起點，否則便沒有空間處理其他更嚴重的罪行，例如造成人身傷亡、企圖綁架議員等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指謀劃不可能成功-官質疑是否求情理由&quot;&gt;辯方指謀劃不可能成功 官質疑是否求情理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，本案的串謀特別，她從沒見過有串謀會徹底公開其計劃的內容，讓政府能採取措施將之扼殺於萌芽；而計劃的本質是選出最有機會勝出的參選人，在當時而言屬合法的政治活動。她續指，計劃的公開性已埋下「自我破壞的種子」、令其非常難以成功，參選人承諾否決，令選舉主任可取消其資格。她又指，選舉充滿變數，被告一旦當選可能陷入政治兩難，若預算案回應他們爭取十多年的訴求，他們未必會否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，初選有替補機制，有「Plan B」甚至「Plan C」，但李強調，要迫使特首下台，須經過解散立法會後重選，並否決同一份預算案兩次，涉案計劃在現實中不可能發生。陳慶偉笑說，視乎她問誰，如果是問戴耀廷，「他對計劃能成功頗為樂觀」；又以搶劫案為例，指判刑只考慮犯案手段和案情嚴重性，毋須考慮是否可能實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦舉例，若有人想下毒謀殺他人，但出於化學知識的無知，其毒物不足以致命，「計劃的不可能，是否減輕意圖謀殺罪的嚴重性？」李志喜同意涉搶劫、危險藥物等罪要判處阻嚇性刑罰，法官李運騰反問，若阻嚇販毒等罪行重要，保護國家安全不也是同樣重要嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指吳敏兒初選屬陪跑與政治劃清界線&quot;&gt;辯方指吳敏兒初選屬「陪跑」、與政治劃清界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜又指，《國安法》於6月30日才生效，計劃的公開、以及社會上有人說初選不違法，令被告認為並無違法。李又指吳敏兒沒有案底，反問「人們會否明知犯法仍繼續？」李運騰笑說：「對某些被告來說，可能」。李志喜指法庭是就個別被告情況判刑，李運騰回應不認為需談到那麼遠，因吳敏兒在最早階段已認罪，並非最激進的參選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜同意，指吳於初選落敗，是新界西其中一個最不成功的候選人，在選舉論壇上也因反應太慢，沒有太多發言機會，同意法官李運騰形容為「陪跑（also-ran）」。李又指，初選落敗後，吳繼續工會工作，協助工人渡過疫情，與政治劃清界線，而職工盟亦已解散，她不會重犯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳敏兒稱干犯本案是人生最錯決定&quot;&gt;吳敏兒稱干犯本案是「人生最錯決定」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜續讀出吳敏兒的求情信，吳提到自身經歷，她擔任空中服務員，並成立英航香港機艙服務員工會，關注職業安全和爭取權益，並於2016年當選職工盟主席，夢想有更好的勞工法律保障工人權益。李志喜指，吳或不如其他前立法會議員般直接服務社會，但她的人生也投入服務公眾，任職空中服務員對保障乘客安全很重要。低頭看文件的吳一度拿紙巾拭眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續引述吳指，她參選立法會的願景很簡單，只是希望推動社會進步，令工人能分享經濟成果，她從沒有意圖以任何方式顛覆國家。吳敏兒又指，被捕後才意識到干犯了《國安法》，對此感到震驚，強調自己不會明知而犯法。她承認所犯罪行非常嚴重，對犯案真誠致歉（genuinely sorry），「干犯本案肯定是我人生最大的錯誤」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望考慮為其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方望考慮為「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李重申，吳並非從一開始就刻意犯法，她深感後悔。惟法官陳慶偉指，能接納吳不大可能重犯、並非首要份子、本案不涉武力手段，但不認為能接納辯方稱吳無意違法。李志喜同意吳認罪，意味她承認有意圖犯案，但認為吳當時不知道違法，可構成減刑理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李終指，吳敏兒參與較輕，在初選落敗，望法庭考慮她為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」，並望法庭考慮吳敏兒家庭和個人健康狀況減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DACEXNS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（28日）續處理參選新西的吳敏兒、譚凱邦，和參選新東的柯耀林求情。譚凱邦一方認為譚屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，指前天文台台長林超英為譚撰求情信，肯定他對環保的付出；而譚決心不再重返政治，包括不再提倡環保議題。辯方又指，譚還柙期間受感染，手腳皮膚潰爛，望法庭能基於人道原因酌情減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林一方同倡柯為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，指柯溫和保守，參與程度較其他被告為低。不過法官質疑，他曾簽署「墨落無悔」、出席選舉論壇、派發選舉單張、聘請選舉經理，難言參與較他人少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第五批被告今完成求情，下周一（9月1日）將處理最後一批被告求情，為餘下9名新界東初選參與者：何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠，料需時3天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林超英撰求情信-肯定譚凱邦對環保議題付出&quot;&gt;林超英撰求情信 肯定譚凱邦對環保議題付出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表譚凱邦的大律師馬維騉指，譚熱衷環保議題，他獲前天文台台長林超英撰求情信，指認識譚多年，肯定他對環保議題的付出。譚亦獲妻子、中大退休教授、環保團體、區議會同事、馬灣居民等撰求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，譚一直視環保議題為首要議程，他參與初選目的並非顛覆政府，而是望進入議會，為環保發聲。馬又指，譚在初選屬「陪跑」，於新西初選得票最低，票數比排尾二的吳敏兒還要少一半，未能出線。翻查資料，吳敏兒獲10,860票，譚凱邦獲4,865票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指譚決心不會重返政治&quot;&gt;辯方指譚決心不會重返政治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，辯方是說獲得最少票數的參選人，刑期應最輕？馬指不是，但指譚知名度低，即使初選採用替補機制也對他無影響。馬續指，望法庭考慮譚並非初選組織者或主要推手，參與程度低，屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，加上他認罪獲三分一扣減，相信他很快會獲釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續指，譚曾任兩屆馬灣區議員，具良好品格，而譚在還柙期間修讀建築管理課程，顯示他決心不會重返政治，因他意識到如再向政府提倡環保議題，必然牽涉一定程度的政治。譚凱邦聞言點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指譚手腳皮膚潰爛-冀酌情減刑&quot;&gt;辯方指譚手腳皮膚潰爛 冀酌情減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，譚還柙期間舌底曾出現腫囊，亦有皮膚問題，還柙期間受感染，望法庭考慮其健康問題增加他服刑苦楚，而額外減刑。法官陳慶偉閱讀譚2021年的醫療報告，指譚的病情不夠嚴重，馬指有今年4月的醫療記錄，但陳指那並非醫療報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，探望譚凱邦時，看到其手腳皮膚潰爛，情況「非常差（very bad）」，譚一度在被告欄內攤開雙手手掌展示，又提起右腳。陳慶偉說：「我們不是醫生，我們只看醫療報告」。馬表示可索取進一步醫療報告，並認為法庭可運用酌情權，基於人道理由作減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯耀林參與程度較他人低-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指柯耀林參與程度較他人低 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅指，柯在串謀的參與非常有限，其初選得票率低，不足1%，認為柯屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度。他又指，相較其他光譜的參選人，有出席記招、定期擺街站、發起「墨落無悔」，柯只是站在一邊，認為要做一些事來取得參選入場券。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉質疑，柯曾簽署「墨落無悔」、出席選舉論壇、派發選舉單張。葉回應，重點是柯的參與程度有多重。陳慶偉即說：「他當然有大力為選舉宣傳（heavily campaigned for the election）！他聘用了選舉經理⋯⋯你怎能說他的參與比其他人少？」法官李運騰亦指，柯或不是最激進的候選人，但不等於他罪責最輕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯溫和保守參與公共服務多年&quot;&gt;辯方指柯溫和保守、參與公共服務多年&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續指，柯耀林專注民生議題，而非推翻政府，他具良好品格，參與公共服務多年，自2003年起三度當選區議員，2008年亦獲政府表揚就公共服務的貢獻。辯方強調，柯是非常溫和保守的政治人物，涉案屬「不幸」，他獲不同政治光譜的區議員撰寫求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又引柯的關姓友人求情信，二人相識逾20年，關指柯因想協助更多人而辭職參選區議員，並在他於內地中風時，立即協助安排他到港接受治療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，各被告紛紛向旁聽席揮手，黃子悅單手放在面頰上做心形手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years have now passed since the humiliating retreat from Afghanistan. The UK has been fortunate that the US has borne the brunt of the opprobrium but, in truth, the Whitehall failure was equally shocking. In classic British tradition, the disaster is being rewritten as a Dunkirk-style “backs to the wall” triumph, with claims that the Taliban victory could not have been predicted. In fact, it was both predictable and predicted. There is little danger of lessons being learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 August 2024 the Taliban staged an impressive military parade at the former US air base at Bagram showing off the vast range of Western equipment that was left behind, including Black Hawk helicopters, MRAP mine-resistant vehicles, and Humvees. Far more serious are the thousands of semi-automatic weapons, millions of rounds of ammunition, artillery shells and (particularly) night-vision goggles that are now available to the many terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, some of which intend to destabilise neighbouring countries and further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) there is a sense of anticipation that David Lammy, the new foreign secretary, intends to make Afghan relations one of his flagship policies. Position papers are being prepared for meetings in early September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lammy visited Afghanistan in June 2022 and alleged that “the UK government’s woeful lack of leadership that was so visible last year is continuing as it ignores the humanitarian catastrophe. Ministers must urgently set out a comprehensive strategy for engaging with Afghanistan…” In reality, there is no need for political contact to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, most of which is delivered by the UN and international NGOs. In 2022 the FCDO provided £286 million in aid to Afghanistan and co-hosted an international conference which raised a further $2.5 billion. The British HALO Trust continues to undertake its vital work of removing Improvised Explosive Devices, which killed dozens of civilians – mainly children – last year. Such aid must continue, even increase, because the Afghan people did not want or deserve a Taliban government foisted on them by a craven US negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official-level contact with the Taliban continues, with Robert Dixon – the British charge d’affaires – visiting Kabul regularly from Qatar. In a meeting with a senior Taliban official only two weeks ago, he was quoted as highlighting “London’s commitment to collaborating with [the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan] to enhance global relationships”. If correctly reported, this sounds like the first indication of a new policy in the offing. This may be the first real test of Lammy’s progressive realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the absence of serious opposition to the Taliban and with no appetite to restart the cycle of armed insurgency, most countries have decided that quiet engagement is the answer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why should the UK engage with the Taliban? There are three reasons: to improve its understanding of the terrorist threat; to stop the harassment (and occasional killing) of those Afghans who served with British forces (such as the Triples); and to address the problem of migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should pause here to consider the Taliban of 2024. The much-trumpeted Taliban 2.0 was always a work of fiction, a press line cobbled together in Pakistan and swallowed whole by Western officials. The British Defence Chief at the time described the new Taliban as “country boys” who needed to be given space to show they were reasonable. However, the Taliban won the war against NATO, brought peace to the country and will likely be in power for a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present there are two main wings of the Taliban. The most influential group is based in Kandahar under the Supreme Leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada. These Kandaharis espouse a fundamentalist interpretation of their role. “We were created to worship Allah and not to earn money or gain worldly honour” was Akhundzada’s recent riposte to the Taliban government in Kabul, which wants international recognition and economic progress to reduce unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it would be a mistake to see the Taliban government in Kabul as moderate in any conventional sense – although the Pakistanis refer to them as the “saner Taliban”. Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani is a terrorist of long standing. Only two months after the victory in August 2021, he celebrated suicide bombers and their families at an event in the Intercontinental Hotel. Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub, meanwhile, is the son of the former Taliban Emir (or Amir) who gave Osama bin Laden sanctuary in Afghanistan before 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai spoke out in favour of female education in December 2023, and his comments were but one indication of policy tensions within the Taliban. But, as in Iran, it is the word of the Amir (or Supreme Leader) that prevails. Taliban enthusiasm for outreach to the West is largely tactical, to alleviate the financial and economic chaos into which they have plunged their country. In particular, they are seeking the unfreezing of Afghan state assets held overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the Kabulis overthrow the Kandaharis? In theory, yes – the blood-soaked Haqqanis alone have the capability. In practice, though, this is implausible. Akhundzada is the “Amir ul-Momineen” or Commander of the Faithful and is imbued with full religious authority. It would be a terrible crime from which the perpetrators would never recover. The best that the Kabulis can do is use the power of argument to secure small adjustments in policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Lammy and his FCDO officials should have no illusions about who they are dealing with. There is no chance that the Taliban will accord women their rightful place in society. At best, Whitehall can hope for small incremental steps on women, human rights and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no country has yet recognised the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan, there is a great deal of guile behind the scenes. Pakistan, Iran, Russia and China were all represented at the Bagram parade. A further 20 diplomatic missions in Kabul are now staffed, including those of Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the five Central Asian Republics (CARs). In the absence of serious opposition to the Taliban and with no appetite to restart the cycle of armed insurgency, most countries have decided that quiet engagement is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no-one is finding engagement easy. Pakistan, in spite of its decades of ill-considered support for the Afghan Taliban, has failed to obtain any cooperation against the TTP (often known as the Pakistan Taliban), which mounts terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. China has offered to include Afghanistan in its massive but ailing Belt and Road Initiative, but has not found sympathy for its request to hand over Uyghur militants. Even Qatar, which hosted a Taliban diplomatic mission when the group was fighting NATO forces, is finding that the Taliban prefer to deal with the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, London would demand full women’s rights and counterterrorist cooperation in return for installing Dixon in the UK’s embassy in Kabul. However, maximalist demands have no chance of being accepted. This is what happens when you lose a war. As a regional Islamist told the author: “Losers can’t be choosers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central question is whether engagement can extract sufficient benefits to be worth the risk of being credibly accused of selling out on fundamental women’s rights&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what realistic measures could the UK require from Afghanistan before reopening its embassy in Kabul? There are four principal areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women:&lt;/strong&gt; A recent survey by the UN found that 64% of Afghan women felt unsafe leaving their homes (compared to 2% of men). Women’s safety is one area where the UK could push for change, as a first step towards other gradual improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrorism:&lt;/strong&gt; There is clear evidence that the Taliban are fighting Islamic State Khorasan Province, and this is an area where the UK could benefit from cooperation. However, the Taliban are also playing host to a vast array of other terrorist groups and individuals – including Al-Qa’ida and the TTP as well as Balochis, Uyghurs, Uzbeks and Chechens – who will remain unmolested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Triples:&lt;/strong&gt; There is still evidence that the Taliban are hunting down members of the British-trained and sponsored Special Forces units, 333 and 444. Any move towards engagement should require a full and monitored amnesty for the Triples, including assisted transfer to the UK if requested. This could lead to further cooperation on migration to the UK, preventing Afghans from having to resort to a perilous 4,000-mile journey followed by a Channel crossing at the mercy of predatory smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heroin:&lt;/strong&gt; 90% of heroin on UK streets comes from Afghanistan. The continuing Taliban prohibition on cultivation should be welcomed, although there is now Fentanyl to plug any gap in supply. The UK could work with the Taliban to explore alternative livelihoods for newly impoverished opium farmers, using the extensive work conducted in London during the 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this can be done in isolation. Afghanistan would provide an ideal subject for Lammy to collaborate with other countries, not just the G7 and the EU but India, Turkey, the Gulf states, the CARs and even China. There is a great deal of global unanimity on what is required from Afghanistan. The key is to leverage change but to demand conditionality at every stage. This is something that both Trump and Biden failed to do after the Doha Accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central question is whether engagement can extract sufficient benefits to be worth the risk of being credibly accused of selling out on fundamental women’s rights. However, there is no point in pretending the Taliban do not exist. So, Lammy should proceed, but with extreme caution. If he gives too much in return for too little, he will become the latest of many generations of UK politicians to underestimate the political dangers of Afghanistan. The probability is that any hopes of genuine change will ultimately perish on the rocks of the Amir’s theocratic obduracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The readiness of the UK’s fleet of nuclear attack submarines (SSNs) has been a source of enduring concern over the previous half decade. With five Astute-class SSNs currently in service (less than half of what the UK had at the end of the Cold War), the Royal Navy fields fewer submarines than has been the case at any given time in recent history. Moreover, challenges with respect to maintenance, compounded by the priority accorded to ensuring that the UK’s continuous at sea deterrent remains operational, have resulted in periods during which the UK did not have an attack submarine at sea. In light of the growing threat posed by Russia’s Northern Fleet, ensuring the readiness of a capability which remains a key UK offer to NATO as an alliance member will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-balance-of-forces&quot;&gt;The Balance of Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition to maintain a commanding position in the undersea operating environment played a crucial role in the Cold War. During the early years of the Cold War, tracking Soviet SSNs as they attempted to break through the Greenland–Iceland–UK gap was vital to Allied efforts to ensure that US reinforcements could cross the Atlantic. In the 1980s, NATO’s approach shifted. In the context of a forward maritime strategy, the ability of NATO to menace Soviet ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) in their bastions was a key component of deterrence against the USSR, which was presumed to enjoy considerable advantages in Central Europe. The success of this approach was perhaps best illustrated by the fact that by the end of the Cold War, the commander of the Soviet Northern Fleet was compelled to request a trebling of his budget if the maritime component of Russia’s nuclear triad was to be adequately protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a rough symmetry in how Allied and Russian forces have evolved, with both sides undergoing quantitative reductions but qualitative improvements. The Russian Northern Fleet fields 13 active SSNs and guided missile submarines (SSGNs), a far cry from its heyday, but vessels such as the Yasen and improved Akula II and III are considerably quieter than their predecessors. Allied submarine fleets including the Royal Navy’s submarine flotilla have endured a comparable drop in capacity, with the Royal Navy fielding fewer than half as many submarines as it did in 1990, although the Astute is also considerably quieter and more capable than the Trafalgar class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major shift, however, is that the US SSN fleet will increasingly be focused on demands in the Indo-Pacific, where robust Chinese anti-access/area denial capabilities will put surface vessels at ever greater risk, but where US submarines still enjoy considerable advantages over the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s noisy SSNs and immature anti-submarine warfare assets. As the size of the US submarine fleet (which is already well short of the 66 boats the US navy requires to meet its commitments) shrinks during the late 2020s and reaches a low of 46 boats by 2030, it is not unlikely that the Pacific, where 60% of US submarines are typically deployed, will receive an ever larger portion of a temporarily smaller SSN fleet. Past 2026, the US navy expects to increase its build rate to three attack submarines per year, which should see it return to and then exceed its current strength by 2035, although the real effects of this regeneration of capability (if achieved) will be somewhat attenuated by the fact that the Chinese threat will not stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, this raises the possibility of short-term capability gaps emerging. In this context, the readiness of the Royal Navy’s submarines – which are, among other things, the only non-US Allied nuclear submarines that regularly perform under-ice operations – is both a national and an Alliance-level concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With five Astute-class SSNs currently in service, the Royal Navy fields fewer submarines than has been the case at any given time in recent history&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake to assume that the Russian submarine fleet is ten feet tall. Of the 13 SSNs and SSGNs currently fielded by Russia’s Northern Fleet, only a handful can be described as truly modern. While the Russian Yasen and Yasen-M are competitive against Western submarines, four of the Northern Fleet’s SSNs are aged Sierra II and Victor III-class boats, and the fleet also fields two older (though still credible) Oscar-class SSGNs. The fleet’s Project 971M/I Akula-class submarines are slowly returning to readiness after a trough in capability during the last decade, with SSNs such as the K-328 Leopard and K-154 Tigr completing refits in the early 2020s. Even so, the number of project-improved Akulas at the fleet’s disposal in the next several years should hover around six, meaning that the fleet currently fields eight SSNs/SSGNs (six Akulas and two Yasen/Yasen-M) that are credible in a modern context. Although Russian practice has historically prioritised surge capacity over presence at sea (which is why the Soviet Navy only deployed 25% of its SSNs at any given time during the Cold War as opposed to the 66% which the US navy maintained), a very high readiness rate of 80% would imply six or so modern SSNs being available in Russia’s Northern Fleet in a crisis (though submarines could be moved to the north from the Pacific Fleet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will field more Yasen-class SSGNs by the end of this decade. While the lead boat of the class, the Severodvinsk, took 15 years to build, its successor the Kazan was constructed in eight years and accepted into service after 12, while the third and fourth submarines in the class (both allocated to the Pacific fleet) reached full operational capability in eight and nine years respectively. Two more boats were ordered in the first tranche of Yasen-class submarines to be built, and will likely enter service in 2024–25. In this period, the Northern Fleet’s complement of Yasen-class boats will increase from two to three (with three Yasen-class boats in the Northern and Pacific Fleets respectively). The Russian navy has commissioned a further six boats in the class which will likely enter service in the 2030s, assuming a comparable build rate. At present, there is some indication that the Yasen fleet appears to have been committed to the maintenance of a near year-round presence off the coast of the continental US – something which will likely require all four of the boats currently in service to maintain, and which will leave the fleet with limited surge capacity. One reason for this might be that the Russians are replicating the Soviet policy of delivering an “analogous response” to US missile deployments in Europe (which will occur from 2026 onwards) through the deployment of missile-equipped submarines to the Western Hemisphere. If this is the case, the ability of the Yasen fleet to surge multiple SSNs into the Atlantic will be limited until the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the 2030s, then, will represent a point of particular concern as a nadir in US capability coincides with the growth of the Yasen SSGN fleet as a consequence of investments being made now. Past the mid-2030s, both a recovery in US numbers and progress on SSN (R)/SSN AUKUS will (in the absence of delays) result in the rectification of this imbalance. While the situation in the Atlantic is not presently critical, it is vital that steps are taken to ensure that a window of vulnerability does not open in the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-more-out-of-astute&quot;&gt;Getting More Out of Astute&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be assumed that some of the issues plaguing the Royal Navy’s submarine readiness right now can be resolved at the speed of relevance if the threat is likely to become most acute at the end of the decade. To use one example, the lack of available docks at Devonport (which has forced a prioritisation of SSBN maintenance) should be resolved in the coming years, as 10 Dock at Devonport becomes available and 15 Dock is converted to service the Astute class. Furthermore, the floating docks being procured under the Additional Fleet Time Docking Capability (AFTDC) programme should help with the issue of readiness, although this programme is nascent and no date has been set yet for the tender. Finally, the Astute fleet will grow by two SSNs during the next few years. While still considerably smaller than the Russian Northern Fleet in numerical terms, the Royal Navy can, in conjunction with other European SSN operators such as the Marine Nationale, offset the effects of a relative reduction in US capacity and match a notional Russian force of 10–11 modern attack submarines which may be operated by the Northern Fleet in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means a certainty, however, and the fate of programmes such as the AFTDC remains to be seen. Moreover, infrastructure investments will not entirely resolve some of the challenges highlighted by Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff Lieutenant General Rob Magowan, which include supply chain management and the availability of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the question of availability will only be exacerbated by the rotational deployment of an Astute-class submarine to Perth beginning in 2027. To be sure, AUKUS is not necessarily a drag on capacity – investments in the UK’s submarine industrial base by Australia may be an important part of the solution to certain issues such as supply chain management. However, the timing of the rotational deployment bears considering, since this could coincide with the point at which the Russian submarine threat peaks. There may be competitive advantages to be gained in Europe from the deployment of submarines to the Pacific. To the extent that Russia (incorrectly) assesses AUKUS to be a full-fledged military alliance, it is likely to view any steps to delivering on it as a threat to the Russian Far East where, notably, half of the incoming batch of Yasen-class SSGNs will be based. As such, the strategic ambiguity of a rotational presence could play a role in fixing Russian assets away from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These opportunities notwithstanding, a more salient question for the Royal Navy may be the timing and form that its rotational commitment to Submarine Rotational Force West takes. One approach to how the rotational deployment might be conducted by partner states could conform to the logic of dynamic force employment articulated by former Secretary of Defence James Mattis, in which forces were expected to make short, irregular deployments geared towards an emphasis on readiness and operational uncertainty. If the deployment schedule of British and US SSNs was made shorter and larger in scale (with multiple SSNs on any deployment but for a shorter period), this could impose a degree of operational uncertainty on Russia while maintaining a regular drumbeat of visits to Australia for functions such as training and political signalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a likely multi-year rotational forward presence is deemed politically vital to the success of AUKUS, the UK would do well to deliver its part of the commitment before 2030, which is when the threat in Europe will peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The period from 2025–35 will likely be one of maximal concern as the demand from the Indo-Pacific and a qualitative increase in the Russian threat converge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to thinking about how longer-term commitments are managed and sequenced, the tasking of the Astute fleet could become more focused. For example, the role of SSNs as Tomahawk land attack missile (TLAM) launchers in support of expeditionary activity might reasonably be sacrificed given that this entails the use of a highly specialised platform for functions that can eventually be played by surface vessels, and draws on capacity in support of relatively peripheral missions. Until the Type 26 enters service, readiness for the contingent employment of limited stocks of TLAM outside Europe might be treated as a task to be effectively gapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, a greater emphasis might be placed on committing more resources to key activities such as ASW and exercises such as Ice Exercise, in which the Royal Navy and US Navy practice under-ice SSN operations (something no European partner other than the UK provide the US), even if this comes at the expense of other standing commitments (beyond nondiscretionary missions like protecting the deterrent). A more narrowly focused pattern of activity could help optimise a limited fleet for its core functions, which during the latter part of this decade and the first part of the next could in turn set the conditions for a more balanced pattern of activity towards the middle of the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the relative balance between the submarines of the Russian Northern Fleet and Allied capabilities can be influenced in certain ways. As mentioned, the rotational deployment of Yasen-class submarines in what appears to be an analogous response posture will rob Russia of surge capacity. Similar long-distance deployments as part of an analogous response approach might be incentivised by forward operations in the Barents Sea (which former commander of the Russian Navy Admiral Yevmenov discussed with some concern in the journal Morskoi Sbornik), or through live exercises simulating the firing of submarine-launched cruise missiles from forward positions (something which is viewed as a matter of concern since British missiles are viewed as a component of a much larger US prompt strike capability). These represent notional examples rather than concrete solutions, but the broader point is that the pattern of activity the submarine service should aim for is one in which short bursts of Allied activity stimulate much longer Russian deployments. While the number of hulls in the Russian Northern Fleet cannot be impacted, the number available to Russia at any time can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are no simple fixes to the challenges that shortfalls in SSN numbers will pose. These shortfalls will not be acute until later in this decade, by which time the UK should have overcome some of its own short-term challenges. The period from 2025–35 will likely be one of maximal concern as the demand from the Indo-Pacific and a qualitative increase in the Russian threat converge. In this window, it will likely be vital to narrow the number of tasks performed by the Astute fleet as much as possible. Beyond this point, there will be greater room for the fleet to support longer-term goals, including those entailed under AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;3男6女陪審團今早開始退庭商議&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GIGMWFr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員與另一勇武小隊涉計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（27日）踏入第81日審訊。法官張慧玲已完成引導陪審團，3男6女陪審團今早約11時起退庭商議。張官指，陪審團需達至9比0或8比1或7比2的裁決；若達至6比3或5比4，並非法例上可接受的大比數，屆時她會作進一步指引。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官有人在串謀之後退出亦非答辯理由&quot;&gt;官：有人在串謀之後退出，亦非答辯理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第七日引導陪審團。她提及本案控罪的罪行元素。就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，「訂明標的」是指公用場所，即開放予公眾人士的地方，而本案目標地點為灣仔軒尼詩道，符合公用場所的定義。她又指，本案控罪屬串謀，控方需要證明兩人或以上達成非法協議，意圖用爆炸性裝置導致他人死亡或遭受身體嚴重傷害。至於串謀者可以用身體語言、手勢、姿勢或行動達成協議，不一定要用書面形式。當協議達成後，串謀就已經完成；若串謀者仍然維持至少兩人，串謀就繼續存在。如有人在串謀之後退出，亦非答辯理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官控方需證明有意圖加入協議並打算付諸實行&quot;&gt;官：控方需證明有意圖加入協議、並打算付諸實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示，控方需要證明被告有意圖與控罪所指的串謀者加入協議，並打算由被告本人或其他串謀者付諸實行，但毋須最終有實行。張官重申，以下3個情況並不屬串謀一份子，包括：對協議不知情、知情但無意加入、假裝加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官提到，吳智鴻為串謀的策劃者（Mastermind），他有最大的知情度。而根據控方立場，「屠龍」等成員則較遲加入，但張官表示毋須證明各被告在同一時間知道串謀，亦毋須證明各被告均曾接觸過所有串謀者，因此「屠龍」成員可以不認識吳智鴻一方的人，亦可以沒有互相聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於屬交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，張官指如果「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪不成立，陪審團就要考慮此罪是否成立。此罪主要涉及非法及惡意地，串謀藉爆炸品導致爆炸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀謀殺」罪，張官指需要證明串謀者有意圖殺害他人，只是令對象身體受嚴重傷害並不足夠。就李家田被控的「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪，張官認為陪審團需考慮李的招認口供，即提及自己曾經管有手槍，是否在警方威逼利誘之下作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官控方立場指投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為&quot;&gt;官：控方立場指投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後就劉佩凝被控的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，張官指需要證明被告提供或籌集財產是作恐怖主義行為，但毋須證明財產是否實際上被如此使用。而控方立場是投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為。控方另指，劉負責在用作眾籌的「育龍」頻道上，發布「屠龍」的示威精華片段，她亦知道部分款項會給予負責用汽油彈的「魔法仔女」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官需達9比0或8比1或7比2裁決&quot;&gt;官：需達9比0或8比1或7比2裁決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官最後提醒，控方需要證明被告有罪，而被告則毋須證明自己無犯罪。她又指，陪審團需要達至9比0或8比1或7比2的裁決；若達至6比3或5比4，並非法例上可接受的大比數，屆時張官會作進一步指引。張官另指，若陪審團在退庭商議期間有疑問，可以書面形式交給她，她會與律師商討後回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陪審團退庭商議8小時後，仍未有結果，明早9時繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了一共參選新西的被告，根據司法網頁顯示，參與新東初選的梁國雄、柯耀林亦由今日起一併作求情。雷玉蓮今早便請假到法院支持戰友，她早前曾探望長毛，形容對方「撐得住」，並引用蘇東坡的詩句送予長毛：「稽首天中天，毫光放大千，八風吹不動，端坐紫金蓮，佢就係一個咁樣嘅人，無嘢打動得到佢。」她身穿印有蓮花的外衣，寓意47人出於污泥而不染：「所以我要著呢件衫支持佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蓮姐對記者談到一件事，多年前與長毛到位於中環下亞厘畢道的舊政府總部抗議，那年頭衝擊鐵馬「正常不過」：「嗰陣時吳恭劭都仲喺度⋯⋯嗰次好多警察，好危險，我哋最後無衝，我哋同警察鬥企。長毛將示威物品掛咗喺度就算，佢想確保所有人都安心。長毛好多時都諗咗人哋先，先諗自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到47人案的求情即將進入尾聲，蓮姐最希望他們能大步檻過：「最緊要佢哋出到嚟，咩是是非非都唔重要。有啲人求情講甚麼東西，其他人講甚麼東西，每個人處境都唔同，我一個人食得幾多？但當你有家庭、有顧慮嘅時候，你諗嘅嘢都會多咗，你唔會自己都要為佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，蓮姐有點感慨地說，過往較少與梁國雄、古思堯合照，才發現「影相係咁重要」：「當長毛同阿古入咗去嘅時候，我睇返我哋好少合照，好似一張合照，因為以前成日見到，但世事無常。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了多年戰友，亦有社民連義工特地來支持長毛。盧先生今早乘坐頭班車，排隊等候進入法院，前來支持長毛。他表示自2012年接觸長毛，留意到社民連的理念與自己接近，便一直為社民連助選：「左翼、幫弱勢，又係為公義發聲，所以開始幫佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到與長毛相處最深刻的一件事，盧先生稱「好平常㗎咋喎」：「有一次喺中聯辦門口，警察噴胡椒噴霧，有個義工嘅，後生嘅，長毛一手攬佢埋嚟，用件褸遮住個頭。個義工無事，佢自己兜口兜面食影晒。」他形容長毛其實溫柔，並很照顧他人，而且亦講道理：「唔係出邊話佢市井，其實佢好博學，睇好多書。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;行政會議召集人葉劉淑儀早前接受外媒訪問，稱香港民主20年來的實驗失敗，相信在《基本法》第23條立法後，反對派將長時間不會重臨，更點名「長毛」和「癲狗」黃毓民之流不會再回來立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;知悉長毛獄中有情緒病-盼保重撐住&quot;&gt;知悉長毛獄中有情緒病 盼保重撐住&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧先生笑言政治一日都嫌長：「佢無錯嘅，可以將來見到嘅形勢都係咁，唔知㗎呢啲。黎智英都可能會出返嚟，佢講得太早。我哋梗係希望，你應承我哋嘅雙普選，2008年就應該有，你應該兌現，做到真正港人治港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，盧先生表示知悉長毛在獄中有情緒病，而且頭部生瘡，「佢上庭成日𢲷個頭」：「保重、撐住，平安呀！嗯，入邊嘅人都係講呢啲。但我哋講啲咩說話對佢無作用，係要靠佢自己意志。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林亦被安排在今日起作求情，去年曾任柯耀林mentee的阿偲，指與柯交流時，感覺他不太開心，嘆很多朋友已不在港，而柯初罪成還柙後仍「有講有笑」、鼓勵她，不過近來情況變差，「多咗亂諗嘢」。阿偲指，到場旁聽望給予柯耀林支持：「畀佢覺得，無論咩時候都有人陪住佢、撐住佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（26日）處理第五批、新界西8名被告及經定罪的梁國雄、柯耀林求情。西九龍裁判法院外再現排隊人龍，獲裁定罪脱、曾參與超區初選的李予信，繼上月旁聽第四批被告求情後，今日凌晨再次排隊入席旁聽，他分享最近正在閱讀心理學、韌性培養的書籍，認為社會需要這樣的質素，學習如何正面處理逆境和創傷的感受，「我諗好多人都經歷緊呢樣嘢」；又指需要正視眼前情況和回應過往經歷，「咁樣我哋先至有更加強韌嘅心態繼續喺未來走落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;清晨6時，西九龍裁判法院外已有逾40人排隊輪候旁聽，當中不乏攜折凳、戴口罩列隊的年長者。李予信凌晨5點半已帶備椅子、手提電腦到場，排在隊伍約第30位。與上次約凌晨1時到場相比，依舊戴棒球帽、身穿純白上衣的李予信今次較遲到達，他稱這次有了經驗，「知道排隊黨嘅時間大概係幾多」，便預計時間在排隊黨全部出現前到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;與上次凌晨時分專注電腦中足球賽事轉播、偶爾傳出歡呼聲相比，這次李予信自到場後便戴上耳機，神色凝重、沉默不語。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信分享最近的消遣讀物，指自己正在閱讀心理學相關、關於韌性培養的書籍，認為社會需要這樣的質素，學習如何正面處理逆境和創傷的感受，「我諗好多人都經歷緊呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦形容旁聽原因就像看這些書一樣，「我覺得係一個好重要嘅經歷嚟，好需要去正視我哋眼前現實發生嘅情況，同時間都要好好去回應過往嘅經歷，咁樣我哋先至有更加強韌嘅心態繼續喺未來走落去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選47人案今早繼續作求情，被告之一伍健偉預料將親自求情。前元朗區議員林進今早繼續排隊，希望進入庭內旁聽。談到伍健偉的情況，林進對《獨媒》表示，對方還柙初時的狀態不太好，過去半年則「成功肥到」，心態上已有所調節，現已坦然面對困境：「佢話咪10年囉。我自己評估都係，要發生都發生咗，怨天尤人都改變唔到啲咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在去年10月，伍健偉選擇在案件開審前認罪，並表明會親自求情，他當時表示「希望我自己嘅人生由我自己掌握」。林進亦強調，伍健偉對於案件的裁決、刑期已有準備，沒有任何樂觀的猜想：「反而諗得差啲，個差啲都接受到嘅時候，就無乜嘢接受唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自三年前被捕還押後，伍健偉每次出庭應訊，林進都會到場旁聽，又會到獄中探望對方。林進表示，每次探監都沒有傾談太多日常生活，反而是伍健偉關心朋友的近況：「嗰15分鐘都係講朋友嘅多，內容都係好實在，無咩閒話家常。」不過，林進指伍健偉仍然很關心香港，很關心朋友：「佢仲好有意志。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林進提到，伍健偉即使面對漫長的審訊，意志仍然非常堅定，稍後寸情的時候出「有說話想對香港人講」：「咁漫長嘅審訊，正常人坐監，意志都好容易磨蝕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;憶伍健偉比樂觀仲樂觀-王逸戰到場旁聽仲喺度&quot;&gt;憶伍健偉「比樂觀仲樂觀」 王逸戰到場旁聽：仲喺度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前「賢學思政」召集人王逸戰亦有到場，他指自己是新界西選民，初選時曾與張可森、伍健偉、黃子悅擺街站，因較欣賞他們理念、望令更多人認識，王今亦特意到庭支持三人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王逸戰苦笑，2020年與伍健偉擺街站，翌年伍因本案被捕還柙，至2022年自己也因煽動顛覆國家政權案入獄，在獄中與伍「玉帛相見」，至今天自己已出獄，伍「仍然喺入面」還柙候判。認識四年，王形容，伍是「比樂觀仲樂觀」、「真誠地樂觀」的人，每次見面也「笑笑口」，與四年前相比「冇乜改變」，「棱角、樂觀都仲喺度」。他又指，伍會很坦誠表達自己想法，覺得「既然行得呢一步，我有嘢想講就去講」，但王補充，伍不是魯莽，而是勇敢，會「三思而後行」，自己在外要做決定時，也會問伍的意見，認為可從他學習，伍會叫他小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張可森，王形容他幽默、有才華，笑言初次見面邀他拍攝搞笑片段，張也願意配合，比新聞上所見有血有肉、很真誠。張可森太太在他還柙期間誕下兒子，王嘆張無法如普通父親與孩子相處很可惜，亦不懂怎樣安慰，但覺得能到庭與張見面已是最好的表現。王亦很佩服黃子悅，指她「望落嬌滴滴」，但蘊藏的能量比他想像更大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問有什麼想跟三人說，王坦言「依一刻唔知可以講啲咩」，只想說：「仲喺度」。他說，今天到場主要望聽到被告的陳情，「我覺得我聽到已經心滿意足，我見到佢哋、出現喺呢個地方已經夠」。被告求情陳詞或有不同考量，王說作為過來人，明白他們的處境，會尊重他們說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選47人案今早進行求情，包括多名新界西、新界東的被告。多名前職工盟成員今早到西九龍法院排隊，希望進入正庭陪伴被告之一的前職工盟主席吳敏兒。前執委吳惠靈對《獨媒》表示上星期曾到羅湖懲教所探望吳敏兒，指對方精神不錯：「佢有盼望嘅。好多嘢想同佢講，但探嘅時間有限，我成日話俾佢聽，見唔到我哋唔等如我哋唔喺度，太多人入唔到正庭，我哋會喺附近與你常在，大家都喺度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳惠靈曾任職工盟屬會學校非教員工會主席，但在參與屬會營後才認識吳敏兒更多，到出任執委後有更多合作：「佢好硬淨，由同英航flight，到今日一直都無變過。佢一直面對好多困難，包括工作上，家庭上嘅壓力，都係堅持做正確嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rz4hH5q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳惠靈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除此之外，吳惠靈曾兩度參選區議會選舉，她指吳敏兒曾攜同子女為其助選，十分熱心。她認為吳敏兒基層出身，為人細心、包容，在職工盟同事出現分歧的時候，亦會耐心地解釋，及與同事商討：「佢做主席係好恰當，有堅強嘅一面，亦都有人對人包容，每個層面都好理解。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生則是工黨兼前職工盟成員，同已認識吳敏兒多年。他今早6時到西九龍法院排隊，希望可以入庭旁聽，為吳敏兒送上支持：「點解嚟？佢正直囉，如果佢唔正直，我今日都唔坐喺度啦，仲坐幾個鐘頭？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，陳先生早前到羅湖懲教所探望吳敏兒：「有咩好講呀，宜家都唔需要啦，最緊要保重身體。」他透露吳敏兒狀態不錯，但對方在獲悉涉及國安法的案件，或未獲扣減三分一刑期：「聽到無得減三分一情緒低落啲，呢個肯定。健康各方面無問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出張親撰的求情信，提及在獄中的30歲生日作深刻反省，認為審議預算案是立法會議員的責任，關乎廣大市民生活，不應作為政治工具及藉此危害國安。張盼能盡快完成博士學位，不負家人期盼：「當事情告一段落後，我將會以家庭作為人生中心，投入全副精神照顧高堂，並且一如我妻愛我般愛我妻，與她協力養育兒子成人。」至於朱凱廸、梁國雄及黃子悅一方均採納書面陳詞，辯方指黃屬「積極參加者」，正就暴動案服刑，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則，部分刑期分期執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;各被告精神不俗-郭家麒向旁聽席飛吻&quot;&gt;各被告精神不俗 郭家麒向旁聽席飛吻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今處理求情的10名被告，包括參選新西的朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、伍健偉；及參選新東、經審訊後罪成的梁國雄和柯耀林。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，男女被告分成上下兩排，由6名懲教看管。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的柯耀林，戴眼鏡、穿淺綠色中袖裇衫，口袋服筆；去年主動撤銷保釋、正就理大暴動案服刑的黃子悅，去年剪的短髮已留長並紮成馬尾，她戴黑框眼鏡、穿黃綠色上衣，不時望向旁聽席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其餘被告均還柙近3年半，吳敏兒戴眼鏡、紮馬尾，穿粉紅色上衣和黑色外套，微笑向旁聽席點頭。一頭灰白頭髮、穿黑色西裝和打呔的郭家麒，精神不俗，頻向旁聽和律師席揮手和飛吻。尹兆堅穿黑色棒球外套，面形比還柙前略瘦，手指向旁聽席點頭、揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森穿灰色間條裇衫、黑色外套，向旁聽席點頭，身型和面型較還柙前胖。梁國雄身穿黑色哲古華拉上衣，一頭灰白短髮，不時低頭摸頭髮。朱凱廸穿藍色裇衫、黑色外套，譚凱邦穿間條白裇衫，沒有律師代表的伍健偉則穿灰色西裝外套、白色上衣，向旁聽席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪脫的李予信、前荃灣區議員陳劍琴、前「天水連線」成員林進、「女長毛」雷玉蓮、前立法會議員劉慧卿、社民連陳寶瑩及黃浩銘等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方張可森屬積極參加者還柙期間父離世&quot;&gt;辯方：張可森屬「積極參加者」、還柙期間父離世&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張可森的大律師伍頴珊認為，《國安法》22條下的刑期分級制並不適用於串謀罪，但法庭可作參考，並認為張屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指，張還柙期間父親離世，張的兒子亦出生，現時接近3歲。伍指，張小時候父親經常不在，他難以見到父親，現在張自己也成為人父，他對未能與妻子和兒子相處感到悲痛（devastated），很希望能陪伴兒子，對於父親離世亦感到加倍後悔和悲傷。法官陳仲衡指，張父不幸離世在判刑考慮的比重不多，法庭較關注張的悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張撰求情信盼與妻養育兒子成人&quot;&gt;張撰求情信盼與妻養育兒子成人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續讀出張撰寫的求情信，提及：「在獄中的30歲生日，讓我得以冷靜思過，整理過去，理清思緒，如今的我明白到案中計劃一旦實行到底所衍生的嚴重性，並就此深刻反省。審議財政預算案，是基本法賦與立法會議員的責任，關乎廣大市民生活，不應作為政治工具，亦不應藉此危害國家安全。我也明白到當下的情況及懲處，是我必須學會承擔的後果，未來我希望能盡快完成博士學位，不負家人期盼，尤其是我妻。當事情告一段落後，我將會以家庭作為人生中心，投入全副精神照顧高堂，並且一如我妻愛我般愛我妻，與她協力養育兒子成人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍又指，張於2024年7月8日已取得博士候選人的資格，將會在還柙期間認真完成畢業論文，取得博士學位。據悉張正修讀香港中文大學文化研究博士學位。張伍又呈上多封求情信，張的大學老師對他有很高評價，其妻子、家人亦望法庭能輕判。伍指張沒有案底，重犯機會為零，望法庭能考慮其良好品格和悔意，減刑三分一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黃子悅屬積極參加-望考慮另涉暴動案減刑&quot;&gt;辯方指黃子悅屬「積極參加」 望考慮另涉暴動案減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃子悅的大律師潘志明亦採納書面陳詞，指黃是本案最年輕的被告，屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。潘續指，雖然黃在理大暴動案保釋期間犯案、兩案性質不同，但兩案均在2019至2020年期間發生，望法庭考慮「整體量刑原則（totality principle）」，部分刑期分期執行。潘又指，黃並非刻意干犯本案，她案發時曾稱否決是《基本法》下的合法權利，「35+」計劃亦由法律專業人士提倡，黃當時真誠誤信為合法，望法庭不要因此加刑太多。庭上並透露，黃就暴動案最快於2025年3月服刑完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今早處理新界西、新界東的8名候選人被告的求情。參選新界東、前立法會議員「長毛」梁國雄在陳情書中重申「權力歸於人民」，指這不但是其終生信守的理念，亦是從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾。長毛表示，今天雖然成為階下囚，但絕無怨言，重申「堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權」，並希望港人莫失莫忘、爭取民主及守護公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選案原定今日起處理第五批，即參選新界西的8名被告求情。司法機構網頁昨日顯示，將一併處理參選新界東梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。梁國雄向法庭呈交陳情書，表示自70年代起參與政治運動和社會抗爭，是源於改變社會不公的願望，而爭取民主自由、實現社會主義，亦從沒放棄。他表示一路走來近50年，從黑髮變成白頭，長毛成為短毛，自由人淪為階下囚，均秉持該理念行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;議會內外均進行抗爭-憾未能爭取全民退休保障&quot;&gt;議會內外均進行抗爭 憾未能爭取「全民退休保障」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自2004年起，梁國雄曾連續四屆當選立法會議員，他表示無論是一介草民仰或議員，都是當仁不讓，透過制度內外進行各種抗爭，由示威遊行、議會拉布、司法抗爭，到五區總辭變相公投等，爭取政制民主和社會公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛憶述在任立法會議員期間，已多次反對政府的《財政預算案》，以抗議當局重富輕貧，賤視貧苦大眾。他亦不忘重提爭取多年的「全民退休保障」，指政府在財政充裕、社會日漸高齡化時，卻拒絕在預算案中撥款設立，對未能推動當局改革，辜負全港160多萬長者，一直深以為憾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳情書中，長毛稱參與初選是因為多年切身體驗，明白必須在立法會中與志同道合者取得過半數議席，才能有足夠壓力令政府推行惠及民生的社會政策；而「五大訴求」中的實行行政長官及立法會雙普選，更是其多年身體力行的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神&quot;&gt;長毛：最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛重申無論是「35+」或「35-」，即議會過半與否，「我們不必寄望議會過半就能翻天覆地，亦不要因未能過半而感到灰心絕望」，認為最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神，爭取香港人最大的動員，共同改變不公不義的社會現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳情書尾聲，長毛表示已知悉法庭判其有罪的理由，但再次重申立法會議員否決《預算案》乃屬《基本法》早已訂明的憲制權力，《基本法》亦有處理「憲制危機」的程序，讓行政長官、政府官員和立法會議員一齊面對選民壓力，彼此作出適當的舉措和互動解決爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;反問為何不在首次否決時便改革-多名社民連成員旁聽支持&quot;&gt;反問為何不在首次否決時便改革 多名社民連成員旁聽支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛認為，議員兩次行使否決權不但是民意依歸，更只是彰顯200萬遊行市民的民意，順從60萬初選投票者的民願。他認為，行政長官面臨下台的憲制危機，必須經歷兩次立法會選舉的民意授權，而既然否決《財政預算案》具全體人民授意，便反問行政長官：「為何不在立法會首度否決時順應民意，推行改革？」他最後強調，權力歸於人民是其終生信守的理念、從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，社民連主席兼長毛妻子陳寶瑩，成員黃浩銘、曾健成及陳皓桓等，今早亦有到庭旁聽支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳情書全文&quot;&gt;陳情書全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　從我在70年代開始參與政治運動和社會抗爭，是一種出於改變社會不公的願望，爭取民主自由、實現社會主義，從沒放棄。一路走來近50年，黑髮變白頭，長毛成短毛，自由人淪為階下囚，我都是秉持這個理念行事。無論是一介草民還是立法會議員，我都是當仁不讓，透過制度內外各種抗爭，由示威遊行、議會拉布、司法抗爭，到五區總辭變相公投等，爭取政制民主和社會公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我就任立法會議員時，已經多次反對政府的《財政預算案》，抗議政府重富輕貧，賤視貧苦大眾，尤其在財政充裕，社會日漸高齡化時，拒絕在《預算案》中撥款設立「全民退休保障制度」。我未能推動政府改革，辜負全港160多萬長者，一直深以為憾！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我參與35+初選計劃，就是因為多年切身體驗，明白必須在立法會中與志同道合者取得過半數議席，才能有足夠壓力令政府推行惠及民生的社會政策。「五大訴求」中的實行行政長官及立法會雙普選，更是多年身體力行的目標；正如我所屬的組織社會民主連線在2020年6月的《決議文》所言：「我們不必寄望議會過半就能翻天覆地，亦不要因未能過半而感到灰心絕望」，無論是「35+」還是「35-」，最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神，爭取香港人最大的動員，共同改變不公不義的社會現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我現在知悉法庭判我有罪的理由，我當初認為立法會議員否決《預算案》乃屬《基本法》早已訂明的憲制權力，《基本法》亦有處理「憲制危機」的程序，讓行政長官、政府官員和立法會議員一齊面對選民壓力，彼此作出適當的舉措和互動解決爭議。行政長官面臨下台的憲制危機，必須經歷兩次立法會選舉的民意授權，缺一不可！既然否決《預算案》有全體人民授意，行政長官為何不在立法會首度否決時順應民意，推行改革？若行政長官執迷不悟，仍然需要多一次人民授權，才會面對下台困局。因此，議員兩次行使否決權是民意依歸，只是彰顯200萬遊行市民民意，順從60萬初選投票者民願。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　「權力歸於人民」是我終生信守的理念，從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾！今天我雖然成為階下囚，但我毋怨。我堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權，惟願港人莫失莫忘，爭取民主，守護公義！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（27日）處理參選新西的8人，及梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。其中前元朗區議員伍健偉沒有法律代表，親自陳情。他指暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音，高壓統治和嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效，他參與初選非為私利，而是不希望有人受傷、被捕，甚至犧牲生命。伍又指，初選手段「和平理性非暴力」，「五大訴求」亦合情合理、無被法庭裁定違法，政府是「不為」而非「不能」，惟法官打斷指並非表達政見場合。伍續指，他無打算離開香港，亦願為個人過去一切言行負責，但他不會為與選民所共享的信念和價值道歉，不可辜負人民信任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，伍健偉是否沒有悔意？伍答「無錯」，指作為政治人物，期許自己要有承擔、竭盡所能，留守到最後一刻，「所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落」。伍指未來打算放低政治人物身分，但仍望貢獻香港社會，認為港人只要抱持自救互助精神，活在真實的當下，理想定會實現，「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。」法官陳慶偉最後指，由於伍較遲認罪和沒有悔意，減刑折扣明顯會較他人少，伍表示完全明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍健偉自行陳詞-感激律師社會及愛我嘅人&quot;&gt;伍健偉自行陳詞 感激律師、社會及「愛我嘅人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沒有律師代表的伍健偉自行陳詞，他身穿灰色西裝外套、白色襯衫，捧着文件走到被告欄前方，以咪高峰發言。伍先表示，已向法庭提交兩份手寫陳詞，並指：「喺我正式陳詞前，我想向之前代表我嘅資深大律師、大律師及律師團隊，感謝佢哋熱心同埋專業嘅服務。另外，我感恩社會各界對我哋嘅關心同埋支持。最後，我感激每一個愛我嘅人，對我嘅付出同埋犧牲，我祝福各位平安、健康。」說罷轉身向着旁聽席鞠躬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍初選陽光下進行逾61萬人投票-被告非為私利犯案&quot;&gt;伍：初選陽光下進行、逾61萬人投票 被告非為私利犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍健偉先就法律原則陳詞，他認為自己於本案屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」，但就控方對刑期10年以上的「首要分子或罪行重大」的詮釋，望提出數點讓法庭考慮。伍先指，「35+計劃」是在陽光底下進行、眾所周知的計劃，當中的手段和目的均清晰、明確和為人熟知。伍指，要達致進入立法會無差別否決財政預算案，「單靠我哋47個被告係冇可能完成」，他們要成為立法會議員，「係需要廣大嘅香港市民向我哋授權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，2020年7月《國安法》實施後，有超過61萬香港市民參與初選投票，他指毫無疑問，當時「唔係一個絕對唔違法嘅情況」，故61萬市民「係冒住犯上法律嘅風險」進行投票。伍續指，作為民意代表，除了有責任遵守法律義務，「我嘅首要責任，係為選民去爭取佢哋嘅合理訴求。作為一個代議士，我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民」，望法官考慮各被告犯下本案的原因，「並唔係出於個人嘅利益同埋私利。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;同意可引致憲政危機但非憲政災難&quot;&gt;同意可引致憲政危機、但非憲政災難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍表示，他同意本案所造成的後果可引致「憲政危機」，但不同意是「憲政災難」，因《基本法》第50至52條已預計相關情況出現，法律授權政府如何處理。雖然無可避免嚴重干預政府施政效率，但他認為各被告充其量只是干犯《國安法》第22條第3項，即嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱五大訴求合情合理政府不為非不能-官打斷促勿發政見&quot;&gt;伍稱五大訴求合情合理、政府「不為非不能」 官打斷促勿發政見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續說，五大訴求「係一個合情、合理、無被法庭裁定違法嘅訴求」，「五大訴求對於特區政府係不為也，而非不能為也」，因至少撤回逃犯條訂條例一項早於2020年7月前已滿足。伍望法庭考慮，「我哋唔係追求緊一個虛無飄渺、海市蜃樓嘅願望，香港市民就住五大訴求嘅每一個訴求⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官陳慶偉打斷，指今天是求情聆訊，「並不是讓你表達政見的場合」，他又指，從伍提交的信可理解其立場，「如任何人想發表政治陳述，隨便，但不是在我的法庭內。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱被捕後始知計劃違法&quot;&gt;伍稱被捕後始知計劃違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍微笑說「明白法官你嘅立場嘅」，續就性質是否「罪行重大」陳詞。法官陳仲衡指伍自視為「積極參加者」，無需就此陳詞，伍回應「雖然我自己定位係積極參與者啫」，但如法庭不同意，仍望作回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，案發時的背景，是街頭激烈衝突已持續非常長時間，「我唔希望有人受傷，唔希望有人被捕，更加唔希望再有人因為政治事件而犧牲佢哋嘅生命，所以我選擇參與35+初選計劃，因為至少呢個手段雖然係違法，但呢個手段係和平、理性、非暴力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，伍何時意識到計劃是違法？伍指是「2021年1月6號我被拘捕嘅時候」。李運騰追問，伍曾稱當時作為代議士只能繼續，是否代表案發時已知道計劃可能違法？伍同意，補充初選投票後，政府官員、中聯辦及港澳辦發聲明指初選可能違法。李運騰指，政府是於初選前已發聲明，又指時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞僅稱「可能」違法，因為是由法庭而非他裁定是否違法，曾最多只能說「可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍回應，作為市民，有理由相信政府不會任由罪案發生，「如果呢件事係一個咁明確嘅違法罪行，我有理由相信政府嘅執法部門唔會容許成件事發生，發生完咗之後半年都冇進行任何嘅執法。」李運騰指，警方執法程序非法庭考慮，法庭只關注案發時伍是否得知協議違法。伍再回應，當時對否決預算案「我並無得知，甚至認為有可能係違法」，法官陳仲衡指控罪非僅否決、而是無差別否決，伍指明白，但「不過都一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效&quot;&gt;伍：暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音、嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍於小休後，續就個人背景陳詞。他以右手拿着手寫的求情信，表示現年28歲，正修讀都會大學榮譽學士課程，未婚，「係一個恨嫁嘅男人」，有被告和旁聽人士發笑。伍指，他被捕前沒有案底，2020年當選為元朗區議員，並於本案承認控罪：「法官閣下，我承認串謀顛覆國家政權，我為我個人過去一切嘅言行而負責」，而他欲交代犯案原因，望法官給予一定耐性及包容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，他於1995年出生，自1997年以來，香港涉社運被檢控的罪名及刑罰「拾級而上、越發嚴苛」，但及後社運的參與人數、時間、規模及激烈程度仍逐步擴大。伍認為，「每一場暴動都係人民無被聽見的聲音」，如香港人民訴求持續被漠視，矛盾和衝突必然接腫而來，「高壓統治、嚴刑峻法，充其量只能夠收一時之效」，深層次矛盾必須尋求解決之道，社會才可能復和邁進、穩定繁榮，「否則難言長治久安，更加枉論由治及興。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍參選因恐懼自由被侵蝕對離世生命沉重悲痛&quot;&gt;伍：參選因恐懼自由被侵蝕、對離世生命沉重悲痛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指，參與初選有遠因和近因，遠因是源於其個人信念，「相信政府係人民嘅僕人，而唔係統治者」，「作為一個香港人，我有一個理想，我認為大家應該擁有、亦都值得擁有自由、平等、包容嘅社會，有效維護人權、法治、公義嘅民主制度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，參選近因是2019年，當時他恐懼自由被侵蝕，對政府傲慢感不滿，而最令他動容的原因，是他「對離世生命嘅沉重悲痛」。伍指，他完全不希望有人受傷、被捕，更難以忍受有人犧牲生命，自己卻無動於衷、毫不作為。作為普通市民，他無能力起死回生，亦無法阻止他們付出自由和生命的代價，「但係我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念」，他認為參與社會運動、地區服務、投身政治，是可為社會貢獻的行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍代議士責任爭取選民訴求願承擔風險尋求破局機會&quot;&gt;伍：代議士責任爭取選民訴求、願承擔風險尋求破局機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍健偉指，他在2019年憑4,371名選民信任成為元朗區議員，初選亦憑20,525位港人支持勝出，如2020年立法會選舉順利舉辦，當天的結果「可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物」。伍續指，成為一個代議士、一個香港民意的代表，「我期許我自己嘅首要責任，係為民發聲、為民請命，我有責任去捍衛人民嘅權利同埋自由，努力爭取選民合情合理嘅訴求得以實現，即使機會係渺茫，即使我個人對於喺建制上尋求改革毫無信心，但我仍然會選擇承擔風險，尋求打破局面嘅機會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問是什麼風險，伍指正如信中下一段所說，在被捕前，「我實在冇諗過會因為本案而入獄」，但不等於他認為成為代議士不會犯《國安法》——即使他無成為立法會議員，但在《國安法》下繼續參與政治或社運，也有很大風險犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍指無一刻打算離港-確認沒有悔意&quot;&gt;伍指無一刻打算離港 確認沒有悔意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍繼續陳詞，表示被捕前，「我冇任何一刻打算離開香港，我願意為我嘅行為負責，但係我唔會為我同選民所共享嘅信念同埋價值而道歉，我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。」法官李運騰問，是否可理解伍健偉是對所作的事沒有悔意？伍沉默片刻，凝重說：「正如我所講，我為我嘅所有言行而負責，我會承擔一切嘅代價。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指那並非他的問題，再問伍對所作的事是否沒有悔意？伍直視法官說：「無錯。」伍續說：「作為一個政治人物，我期許我要有承擔，竭盡我所能，留守到最後一刻，所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱打算放低政治人物身分-但仍望貢獻香港社會&quot;&gt;伍稱打算放低政治人物身分 但仍望貢獻香港社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續說展望將來，他作為民意代表的任期已完結，「我打算放低政治人物嘅身分，但我仍然希望，盡力留喺香港貢獻社會」，即使已預視到困難重重。法官李運騰打斷，指伍的說法可有不同解讀，他關注伍的重犯風險，望伍澄清「貢獻」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指將會講到，並先指一如時任終審法官包致金所言，「There is no reason to leave if things are good, and if things are bad, there are more reasons to stay.」，「我認為香港人同我只要抱持自救互助嘅精神，理性嘅思考，行公義、好憐憫，存謙卑嘅心，記錄過去嘅真相，活在真實嘅當下，為未來做好真誠嘅準備，香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍絕對權力必帶來絕對腐敗-信民主終再得勝&quot;&gt;伍：絕對權力必帶來絕對腐敗 信民主終再得勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍最後指，二十世紀完結，人們向蘇聯和納粹作告別，「失去足夠制衡嘅權力必然會自我膨脹，絕對嘅權力必定帶來絕對嘅腐敗，長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。我感謝三位法官嘅包容同埋忍耐，本人謹此作結。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱因無悔意-認罪扣減會較他人少&quot;&gt;官稱因無悔意 認罪扣減會較他人少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就伍健偉認罪的日期，羅天瑋助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋指，2022年10月伍健偉的律師代表去信表示擬認罪，伍於11月3日案件管理聆訊上再次確認，至2023年2月6日案件開審首天，伍於庭上認罪，並於同年10月5日聽取承認案情，確認伍是於案件交付高院後認罪、審訊訂定之前改認罪。法官李運騰指根據案例，最多只可獲25%減刑，法官陳慶偉並指，由於伍較遲認罪和沒有悔意，其認罪扣減會明顯比其他人為少（significantly less than other），問他有沒有話想說。伍回應：「冇嘅，法官，我完全明白嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（27日）處理參選新西的8人，及梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。尹兆堅一方指他投身公共服務近20年，曾成功爭取殘疾人士2元乘車優惠和長者生活津貼等，出獄後打算於國際人權組織「世界中央廚房」任職，亦獲3名前高官蕭偉強、羅致光及張炳良撰求情信，指他和平理性。惟法官關注尹過往有4次定罪紀錄，就其良好品格的求情理由能否「循環再用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒一方亦指郭和平理性，獲前高官邱誠武及前議員石禮謙和張超雄撰求情信，張提到郭曾阻止示威者七一衝擊立法會大樓。辯方又指，郭在公民黨解散前已退黨，出獄後望繼續行醫，退出政治，沒有重犯機會，望法庭考慮他犯案完全與性格不符，採納「積極參加者」的較低量刑起點。法官質疑，本案串謀持續多月，郭必然對參選作詳細考慮，不認同他犯案是與性格不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指尹投身公共服務近廿年-官關注求情理由能否循環再用&quot;&gt;辯方指尹投身公共服務近廿年 官關注求情理由能否「循環再用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員尹兆堅由大律師莫彥婷代表，莫指尹投身公共服務近20年，他於1994年成為註冊社工，自2004年起四度當選區議員，並於2016年當選立法會議員，服務不同公職。其中尹自2002年起設立殘疾人士爭取交通半費優惠聯席，10年後成功爭取殘疾人士2元乘車優惠，亦成功爭取長者生活津貼和拆除臨時房屋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，得悉尹的貢獻，但他曾有4次定罪紀錄，該些案件均已考慮其良好品格；法官李運騰亦關注，若其他案件已因尹的公共服務和良好品格而減刑，法庭是否能將相關理由「循環再用」。莫指，相關案件並未考慮尹的公共服務往績，明日會向法庭補充詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;尹獲3前高官撰求情信-讚和平理性&quot;&gt;尹獲3前高官撰求情信 讚和平理性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;尹兆堅亦獲兩名前勞工及福利局局長蕭偉強、羅致光，以及前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良撰求情信，蕭指尹熱心幫助弱勢，保障貧窮和殘疾人士等權益，雖然未必在所有議題上有共識，但對其可信及有禮印象深刻，相信他會兌現承諾。前黨友羅致光亦指，尹推動社會政策表現和平理性，二人就勞工福利政策有良好有效的交流。辯方指，求情信可顯示尹除公共服務外，為人和平，為政府提供建設性意見，望法庭作進一步扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，尹是出色的廚師，打算在出獄後，將烹飪技術應用在國際人權組織「世界廚房（World Kitchen）」。就案情而言，辯方指尹沒有簽署「墨落無悔」，沒有出席任何選舉論壇，作為民主動員委員，亦不曾參與任何會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭家麒撰求情信提公共服務經歷-官質疑無提就本案反思&quot;&gt;郭家麒撰求情信提公共服務經歷 官質疑無提就本案反思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員郭家麒由資深大律師蔡維邦代表，蔡求情指，郭於2021年9月已表示擬認罪，是最早一批表示認罪的被告，亦不爭議案情，顯示他具悔意。蔡又指，郭是有原則、願意奉獻、具同理心的人，「我做求情近25年，我可以說他是一個具良好品格的人而不面紅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續讀出郭親撰的求情信，提到他出身草根家庭，八十年代成為醫生，任學生期間目睹多人因工業意外受傷，因而籌辦活動保障工人健康，並成立香港工人健康中心。辯方指，即使郭任職醫生，仍奉獻空餘時間促進弱勢的福祉，他自1994年至2007年任中西區區議員，2004年當選立法會議員，並獲委任為醫管局成員，沙士期間作出貢獻，並與不同官員合作，改善醫療服務。辯方又引郭指，他從無考慮「攬炒」，亦不支持「香港獨立」，任議員多年，目標是確保最邊緣社群獲得足夠資源和照顧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，郭的長篇求情信提及其行醫和公共服務經歷，但沒有提及對本案行為的反思。蔡維邦指，對任何還柙超過3年的人來說，當然私下有反省，而郭在最早階段認罪亦反映他具備高度悔意，只是沒有在信中直接表達，不認為法庭應將折扣減少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;獲邱誠武石禮謙張超雄撰求情信-稱七一曾阻示威者衝立法會&quot;&gt;獲邱誠武、石禮謙、張超雄撰求情信 稱七一曾阻示威者衝立法會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡維邦又呈上多封求情信，包括兩名曾受助於郭的市民，有女士提到兒子患罕見面顎變形，需進行手術，等候十年卻被醫院取消，無助之際獲郭幫助和申請資助，成功進行手術；有女士亦指，曾因醫療事故失去初生女兒，郭積極跟進院方調查，堅定尋求公義，形容郭具同情心、毅力和尋求問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭亦獲前運輸及房屋局副局長邱誠武、前立法會議員石禮謙及張超雄撰求情信，邱指二人常就房屋及交通等政策討論，郭一向是弱勢權益的捍衛者，雖與政府意見並非經常一致，但尊重他向政府問責，且二人在改善房屋、工業安全等議題上意見也一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續指，2019年時，郭曾站出來着群眾冷靜，以避免進一步暴力發生，例如曾協助救護車進入警總，以幫助有醫療需要的人。張超雄亦指郭主張和平，在2019至2020年是調停者，例如七一立法會曾站在玻璃門前阻止示威者衝擊大樓，亦因而受傷；8月機場內時任環球時報記者付國豪被示威者綑綁和襲女十水手時，郭和張亦趕到現場阻止，被示威者數度推開。郭於11月理大被圍時，亦曾與一群校長進入學校，嘗試令年輕示威者冷靜，獲該些校長撰求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指郭已退黨無重犯機會-屬積極參加者較低程度&quot;&gt;辯方指郭已退黨、無重犯機會 屬「積極參加者」較低程度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，郭為人和平理性，他於公民黨解散前已退黨，並決定退出政治，沒有重犯機會，服刑完畢後如獲醫務委員會允許，預期會繼續行醫，繼續幫助有需要病人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又認為，郭屬「積極參加者」，望法庭考慮他犯案完全與性格不符（out of character），具良好品格和公共服務，以刑期3至10年的較低程度為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望考慮犯案與性格不符-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方望考慮犯案與性格不符 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，郭必然對初選和如何當選作出詳細考慮，不認同郭犯案是與性格不符。辯方重申，郭的行為與他過往多年作為理性政治人物的行徑不同，又指就郭於2020年3月公民黨記者會的言論，當時其行為不可能是違法，不應因此加刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦質疑，與性格不符通常是一時衝動、受刺激而犯案，但本案串謀持續多月，被告有多次機會反思其行為，難以被說服此情況下，被告的參與是與性格不符，而且涉案串謀對香港穩定和安全性有很大影響。蔡同意，但重申郭行為與過往紀錄不符，望法庭考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒一方求情完畢，案件明早續，將處理餘下兩名新西被告吳敏兒、譚凱邦，以及參選新東的柯耀林求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方為郭家麒申請明日不到庭獲批，散庭時，張可森舉手，並走近被告欄咪高峰，表示想申請明天毋須出席聆訊，梁國雄亦說：「我都係，我都係申請唔嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團：不能撇開2019年反修例運動背景&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XDcpJaL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（26日）踏入第80日審訊，法官張慧玲第六日引導陪審團。張官指，控方沒有直接的證供可證明各被告達成協議，並屬串謀者，大部分是依賴環境證供。而陪審團需要小心考慮環境證供，不能單憑推斷或臆測。控方於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀；辯方卻不同意這個做法。張官今表示，不可能完全不考慮2019年的社會事件作為背景，反而要考慮相關背景，不能將其撇開，當時串謀者打算趁民陣遊行期間執行計劃，而「唔係就咁擺個炸彈喺街」。張官預計明天可讓陪審團退庭商議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無直接證供證明被告達成協議主要依賴環境證供&quot;&gt;官：無直接證供證明被告達成協議、主要依賴環境證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第六日引導陪審團。她指，控方沒有直接的證供可證明各被告達成協議，並屬串謀者，大部分是依賴環境證供。在處理環境證供時，陪審團需要先考慮控方能否證明控罪的元素，之後再考慮各被告的情況。張官將上述兩項比喻為兩條線，陪審團需要考慮將他們加在一起後，能否成為一條有足夠力量的繩去支撐。張官同時提醒，需要小心謹慎考慮環境證供，不能單憑推斷或臆測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官引辯方指-單憑tg訊息不能證明被告參與串謀&quot;&gt;官引辯方指 單憑TG訊息不能證明被告參與串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官引述辯方立場指，沒有直接證供顯示各被告與串謀有關，實際上「屠龍」隊員並不知道行動內容及詳情，單憑 Telegram 訊息並不能證明他們為串謀一份子。張官亦指，陪審團需要小心衡量，污點證人黃振強是否如辯方所指，有動機虛構證供並冤枉其他被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方依賴的「共同串謀者原則」，張官指部分證據為 Telegram 的群組及私訊的訊息，雖然被告並不在場，但陪審團要考慮被告的發言，是否為了令計劃可以付諸實行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官需考慮2019年反修例運動作為背景&quot;&gt;官：需考慮2019年反修例運動作為背景&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方曾於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀；辯方卻不同意這個做法。張官今表示，不可能完全不考慮2019年的社會事件作為背景，反而需要考慮相關背景，不能將其撇開而憑空思考。她解釋指當時有很多人因反修例運動上街，這屬事實，而污點證人黃振強亦提及自己有參與示威。因此，張官認為不能用現時的社會情況去考慮，因必定與當時的環境有差別，當時串謀者打算趁民陣遊行期間執行計劃，而「唔係就咁擺個炸彈喺街」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，張官指陪審團需要考慮控方所指向警方投擲汽油彈的行為，是否符合法例中的「恐怖主義行為」定義。控方主要依賴劉知悉「屠龍」的示威精華片段，並知道籌款是用作購買「火魔法」，即汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件明（27日）續審，預計明天將會讓陪審團退庭商議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周五（23日）在高等法院踏入第79天審訊，法官張慧玲第6天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官總結本案多名專家的供詞，當中針對警方於香港華仁書院附近搜獲的一大一細土製炸彈，專家指內含鐵釘增加威力，若有人在繁忙街道放置炸彈，可造成400米範圍內嚴重人命傷亡。至於在「屠龍」貨倉中被檢取的伸縮棍，法官重申伸縮棍與本案的控罪無關，即使認為「屠龍」成員曾在示威中使用，均屬「不被控告的行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官專家指兩土製炸彈可致嚴重傷亡&quot;&gt;官：專家指兩土製炸彈可致嚴重傷亡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周四總結指，案中唯一作供被告李家田，供稱被警方上門拘捕時，遭拳打腳踢及多次用水刑，又被威嚇會對其母親不利，稱自己在警方的引導下作出招認。而拘捕警員則於庭上否認李遭受警暴。法官另覆述被告賴振邦的案情，提到辯方曾指警員嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，而警員於庭上否認。法官指，由於賴選擇不作供，故本案沒有相關證供，陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周五續引述本案各專家證人的證供，當中涉案於香港華仁書院附近被搜獲的一大一細炸彈，分別有8及2公斤炸藥，由改裝手提電話遙距控制引爆。經專家檢驗後發現，炸彈內有鐵釘以增加威力，而引爆威力達半徑400米。若有人在繁忙街道放置炸彈，可造成400米範圍內嚴重人命傷亡。而炸彈中亦被發現有具爆炸性化學物品「HMTD」及炸藥「ANFO」等。專家指「ANFO」屬高性能爆炸品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官伸縮棍與本案控罪無關&quot;&gt;官：伸縮棍與本案控罪無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「屠龍」於荃灣貨倉被檢取的11支伸縮棍，政府化驗所化驗師吳嘉豪曾檢驗。法官提醒陪審團，伸縮棍與本案的控罪無關，即使認為「屠龍」成員曾於示威活動中使用，進行暴動或非法集結，均屬「不被控告的行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案涉及大量 Telegram 訊息，而警方又以程式 Cellebrite 擷取涉案手提電話的資料。法官亦分別引述 Telegram 及 Cellebrite 專家的證供，提到 Cellebrite 可復原部分被刪除的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官另引述財務專家的意見，此專家曾分析涉案戶口交易紀錄及金額等，包括黃振強及劉佩凝的戶口。專家報告沒有總結指有眾籌情況出現，但指戶口的匯款模式類似眾籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由法官張慧玲及3男6女陪審團審理。7名被告依次為張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦、許湛榮及劉佩凝，起訴時年齡介乎20至29歲不等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few years have seen a transformational change in Japan’s approach to space security, with space capabilities now featured prominently in Tokyo’s national security and defense strategies. While Japan has long been considered one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations, its accomplishments have occurred largely in civil space exploration and science, with Japanese government policy ascribing nonmilitary purposes for space activities. However, intensifying threats in the region have led to a new emphasis on leveraging the space domain for national defense and the need for deeper partnerships at the policy, operational, and industrial levels to deliver space capabilities on timelines paced to the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan’s 2008 Basic Space Law created the legal basis for the country to pursue national security space activities, its 2022 security documents provided the impetus for “radically expand[ing] the use of space systems for national security.” Sitting in the middle of a complex Indo-Pacific security environment, Japan’s regional security concerns are dominated by intensifying Chinese and North Korean military activities, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine presages what aggression in the region could look like. Tokyo has set 2027 as a key milestone for strengthening its national defense, with space capabilities as one part of a broader strategic effort that includes force modernization, munitions acquisitions, infrastructure improvements, and enhanced training and exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy (NSS), National Defense Strategy (NDS), and Defense Buildup Program, together with its 2023 Space Security Initiative (SSI), designate key priorities for future space acquisitions, operational activities, and partnerships necessary to advance its national and economic security interests. The SSI outlines the country’s national security space architecture plans. This ambitious vision includes satellites that can detect and track missiles, including hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs); intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and tracking (ISRT) satellites to provide insights on land and maritime threats and targeting information for counterstrike systems; space-based communications satellites; positioning and navigation satellites; and space domain awareness systems, all supported with a suite of government and commercial space launch vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding to expand Japan’s space capabilities and grow its industrial base is following the plans. Tokyo has more than doubled its investments across civil and national security space over the last five years, including in defense-specific and dual-use space technologies, and plans further increases. Over the next 10 years, the Japanese government has committed ¥1 trillion ($6.9 billion) toward a Space Strategy Fund aimed at expanding Japan’s space industrial base that the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) will administer. Also, over the next five years, an additional ¥1 trillion is anticipated to be allocated for space security. Like the United States and other countries, Japan recognizes the economic and technological benefits of space and how government investments create a demand signal to spur private sector innovation and attract technical talent. It also sees advances in the space domain as helping to solve global sustainability, resource management, and disaster relief challenges here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational reform is also following the plans. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) will be renamed the Japan Air and Space Self Defense Force in 2027 to “reinforce its space operation capability and . . . [develop] a system to ensure superiority in use of space.” Within the JASDF, the Japan Space Operations Group (JSOG) was created in 2020 as the first space-focused unit that will continue to grow as it takes on more operational space missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s approach to security remains strongly tethered to the policies and actions of the United States, with deepening bilateral ties “at a concrete level” being “of vital importance.” Cooperation and collaboration, particularly with the United States, is an integral part of Japanese strategy in the space domain. Likewise, expanding cooperation with allies and partners has been a pillar of U.S. national space policy across successive administrations. In May 2024, the assistant secretary of defense for space policy, Dr. John F. Plumb, characterized such partnership as “an asymmetric advantage that our competitors can never hope to match” that advances collective security, underpins military strength, and contributes to the safety and sustainability of the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space has become more prominent in high-level discussions between the two nations, including at the president and prime minister level, cabinet and ministry level, and senior military leader level. U.S. and Japanese space leaders convene regularly through a comprehensive space dialogue, the two countries exchange military liaison officers, and business leaders from both countries now participate in dialogues to discuss U.S.-Japan space industry collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-observations&quot;&gt;Key Observations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few broad observations stood out to the authors throughout the course of their research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment of interests:&lt;/strong&gt; With a shared understanding of the threat environment, alignment of strategic interests, strong leadership and political support, and commitment of personnel and resources, there is now a window to advance a comprehensive and enduring agenda for bilateral cooperation on space security. While the authors focused heavily on security cooperation, cooperation across other instruments of national power, such as economic and diplomatic activities, were also recognized as essential to advancing both countries’ national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National security space proficiency and capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan grew into one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations through its civil space programs; however, past government policy mandating that the government of Japan utilize space only for nonmilitary purposes led to its defense institutions and related industrial base having less exposure to, and experience with, space missions. Further, it resulted in a limited market for Japan’s space industry to serve. While the current emphasis on space security creates greater opportunities for U.S.-Japan space cooperation, it also — understandably so — highlights areas where Japan’s defense institutions and industry need to build greater space proficiency, operational experience, and industrial capacity, especially in building and operating large satellite constellations for security missions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground architectures and satellite constellations:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the authors’ discussions with government and industry representatives centered on ideas for partnering to build satellites, which are discussed herein. However, it must be emphasized that partnerships beyond just satellite constellations are important in space security mission areas. For example, the missile detection and tracking mission must operate on militarily relevant timelines, which demands equal attention to the ground architecture, data processing and analysis, and connectivity to missile defense systems. There is just as much opportunity to forge partnerships around ground architecture activities as there is in satellite development and production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complementary industrial base strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; Both nations emphasize the importance of industrial partnerships for delivering military space capabilities within relevant timeframes. However, there will be a natural tension as each country seeks to expand its industrial base and market access and decide on what each is willing to rely on the other for. Each nation’s industrial base retains unique and complementary strengths. For example, while U.S. industry is strong in systems integration, ground architectures, and large-scale satellite manufacturing capacity, Japanese industry is a global leader in satellite components, robotics, and advanced manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timelines, resources, and risks:&lt;/strong&gt; The pacing threats facing both nations drive aggressive timelines for fielding new capabilities. There may be near-term approaches that rely more heavily on U.S. industry or commercial service providers but offer longer-term pathways to increase Japan’s own industrial capacity. Such a longer-term framing that articulates the overall security and economic benefits each country accrues will be important to both countries’ stakeholders. Moreover, with the yen weakening, Japan’s spending power will not go as far as anticipated despite significantly increasing investment in space security capabilities and personnel. On the U.S. side, defense budgets are likely to be flat or declining. Partnerships not only provide the benefit of increased capacity and resiliency for both countries, but also ways to burden share across resources and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and digital resiliency:&lt;/strong&gt; There is now clear recognition across Japanese government, industry, and academia that security — cybersecurity, information security, personnel security, and facility security — is paramount to further U.S.-Japan space cooperation. Further, Tokyo is attuned to the importance of continuity of operations, particularly having observed Russian cyberattacks against Ukrainian satellite and ground networks and the effects of natural disasters on critical infrastructure such as the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which was damaged by a 2011 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Japan-U.S. Alliance, including the provision of extended deterrence, will remain the cornerstone of Japan’s national security policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-national-security-strategy-of-japan-2022&quot;&gt;– National Security Strategy of Japan, 2022&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report advances several recommendations for deepening U.S.-Japan cooperation and collaboration in space security. The authors stress that collaboration should not be pursued merely for its own sake — there must be intent behind these actions to ensure the respective industrial, economic, and security needs are met for both nations. Summarized here and discussed in greater depth later in the report, these are areas where the combined, complementary strengths of both nations’ governments and industries can be brought together to deliver concrete capabilities to advance both U.S. and Japanese national and collective security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating human development:&lt;/strong&gt; While Japan grew into one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations through its civil space program, its past limitation that space be used only for nonmilitary purposes resulted in its defense ecosystem having less experience in the use and development of space capabilities. Thus, building greater space proficiency within Japan’s defense institutions and supporting industry through education and training will be foundational to any space cooperation activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercising and training the space force and joint force:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should be encouraged, with support from the United States, to develop a greater understanding across its military services of how space capabilities contribute to security and defense missions by integrating space capabilities into joint exercises and training. Within the military space community, participation in tabletop exercises and wargames, as well as greater hands-on operational training, aid in understanding space threats, operations, and decisionmaking processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing data and information:&lt;/strong&gt; Sharing space and cyber threat assessments is a logical start. Further, space domain awareness (SDA) data sharing can be enhanced and expanded trilaterally, building on the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral information exchange model used for data sharing on North Korean missile launches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasizing complementary industrial base strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; In formulating partnerships, the United States and Japan should consider the unique and complementary strengths of each nation’s industrial base and not limit their partnerships to the space domain. Both nations should look to each other as they seek to increase supply chain resiliency and seek investors to boost their space start-up ecosystems to achieve broader alliance objectives vis-à-vis space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecting national security space constellations:&lt;/strong&gt; Both countries have set out national security space architectures that are ambitious, resource-intensive endeavors, with partnerships being a core tenet of their respective approaches. The areas of missile detection and tracking, ISRT, SDA, and satellite communications (SATCOM) stand out because of the urgency described in Japan’s strategy documents to have sufficient defensive capabilities deployed by FY 2027. In several of these areas, accessing commercial space-based data and services can accelerate the delivery of near-term capabilities and complement government owned and operated architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in digital transformation and cybersecurity:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should include a digital transformation and cybersecurity component within the bilateral space agenda. A digital infrastructure that encompasses data architecture, cloud computing, and cybersecurity can be a catalyst for greater interoperability and information sharing at an operational level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading on policy and in international forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Through complementary and coordinated efforts in regional and international forums, both Japan and the United States can provide strong thought leadership and advance diplomatic initiatives on space sustainability, the development of responsible behaviors in space, and the reduction of threats to the peaceful uses of space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these recommendations can deliver material capabilities and policy successes, they will still require that policymakers address existing barriers. Chief among these obstacles is the need for leaders from both countries to set clear priorities and direction to move their respective institutions and industries into action. Both countries are undertaking ambitious space architecture plans. Delivering on those plans will be challenged over the long term by resource availability, industrial capacity, and labor availability in highly technical fields — all the more reason to forge industry relationships that leverage each nation’s strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further barriers include developing a data sharing policy within the United States that provides guidance on the technologies, capabilities, and mission knowledge that U.S. industry can share with its Japanese counterpart, as well as Tokyo implementing security improvements, including legislation on security clearances extending from the military to industry, which it has made progress on. U.S. security experts across government and the private sector could be brought to Japan to share best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries’ export policies and regulations have been barriers to closer space cooperation and industry-to-industry partnerships. U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) hampers bilateral industry cooperation, with both U.S. and Japanese companies which have been encouraged to forge joint space acquisition partnerships citing ITAR and classification as issues. Notably, in late 2023, Tokyo revised its principles on the transfer of defense equipment and technology, which is expected to enable greater export of domestically produced military technologies and components. While a positive development that can further contribute to supply chain diversification and the defense of like-minded partners that are increasingly under threat, the impact of this policy shift for space-related technology exports is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a consistent message from government and industry representatives in both countries is that they often do not know who to talk to on the other side. Both sides have found the annual comprehensive space dialogue to be highly valuable in bringing together both countries’ space leaders and identifying counterparts, as well as facilitating interagency dialogues within each country. Opportunities to sustain these interagency and bilateral interactions beyond the senior leader dialogue were encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this study incorporates months of research, detailed briefings, and extensive discussions with government officials, industry representatives, and academic experts in both Japan and the United States, the authors acknowledge that it is not a comprehensive road map to all the opportunities and challenges in space security cooperation. However, as much as possible, the authors sought to identify concrete actions, including near-term options, that policymakers could take that, over time, would lead to material improvements in capabilities, more fielded systems, and a more highly trained and proficient workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Japan sits in the middle of a complex Indo-Pacific security environment. Intensifying Chinese and North Korean military activities dominate regional security concerns, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has provided a sobering wake-up call for what aggression in the region could look like. These concerns are reflected in three strategic security documents that Tokyo released in 2022: the National Security Strategy (NSS), National Defense Strategy (NDS), and Defense Buildup Program. These documents emphasize a need for independent security and economic growth at an accelerated pace to protect against growing threats, the risk of invasion from a neighboring nation, and instability around the world. Integrated into each of these three documents is the use of space (or uchū in Japanese) for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, the Allied powers imposed restrictions on Japan’s heavy industry and defense capabilities, including restrictions on aerospace development. This continued until the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951, which ended the legal state of war and reestablished peaceful relations between the Allied powers and Japan through the United Nations. The treaty removed several restrictions, including those preventing Japan from entering the space age. Among the restrictions that were lifted, the treaty allowed for Japanese entry into the space age. In 1955, Professor Itokawa Hideo, known as the father of Japanese rocketry, launched a miniature nine-inch rocket, known as the Pencil Rocket, with a team from the Institute of Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo, and thus began Japan’s ambitions in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the decades that followed, Japan’s national policy allowed space development only for peaceful purposes (which Japan defined until 2008 as excluding military space purposes), leading to Tokyo’s decades-long focus on research and scientific development in space, led by its civilian space organization, JAXA, and JAXA’s predecessor organizations. However, a fraught security environment in the Indo-Pacific region has prompted Tokyo to reevaluate its security and economic goals. As the country reckons with an increasingly tense security dynamic driven by growing Chinese and North Korean military activity and defense budgets, space capabilities are becoming integral to Japan’s national security. Further, the U.S.-Japan security alliance continues to be at the core of both countries’ approaches to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, with both seeking to deepen their cooperation across myriad national security areas, including in the space domain. Space is now a prominent agenda item in meetings between the U.S. president and Japanese prime minister, as well as several of their cabinet secretaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report summarizes an Aerospace Security Project research effort to examine the evolution of Japanese strategy and policy for space security and identify potential areas for space security cooperation between Japan and the United States, including opportunities for industry engagement. The authors reviewed publicly available information; conducted interviews and discussions with a wide range of Japanese and U.S. officials, both in the United States and Japan; and hosted a series of workshops at CSIS with current and former Japanese and U.S. government officials, industry representatives, and academics. Valuable insights were gained regarding the trends, capabilities, priorities, strengths, and challenges within each country’s space ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report outlines the history of space programs in Japan and the country’s space capabilities, developments in space security after the 2008 Basic Space Law, international partnerships, regional space security observations, and alignment with the United States. It continues with a discussion of candidate areas to deepen or expand U.S.-Japan space security cooperation, including across missions and architectures, organizations, industrial and technology sectors, and within international forums. It also discusses potential barriers and limitations that need to be overcome to achieve greater cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-history-of-japan&quot;&gt;Space History of Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three distinct but cooperative organizations were tasked with incubating Japan’s nascent national space program: the National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL), the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science (ISAS), and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA). NAL was created in 1955 to research aerospace transportation systems. ISAS was founded in 1964 by the University of Tokyo for research and development and, in 1970, was responsible for the launch of the country’s first satellite. In 1969, NASDA was founded by national law and set space development priorities for Japan. The law that created NASDA was accompanied by a supplementary resolution that limited the development and use of space to peaceful purposes. This resolution was interpreted by the Japanese government as “nonmilitary”; while many other countries around the globe also refer to “peaceful purposes” vis-à-vis their space activities, they often interpret the term to mean nonaggressive but still permissive of military space activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NAL, ISAS, and NASDA each held responsibility for different aspects of the country’s space ambitions until they were later combined to create JAXA, which was established by the Law Concerning Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in October 2003. Under this law, JAXA’s objectives are to (1) develop research at academic institutions and universities, (2) enhance space and aeronautics science and technology, and (3) promote the utilization and development of space, but only for peaceful purposes. JAXA has continued to focus on peaceful operations, although it was authorized in the early 2010s to engage in security-related activities. It has since signed agreements with Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD) for technical cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 20 years since its founding, JAXA has become a reliable actor in civil space missions. One of the first missions after the organization’s establishment was the Hayabusa mission, launched in May 2004, which collected matter from the near-Earth Itokawa asteroid for further study. This mission made Japan the first nation to collect and return asteroid samples to Earth. The Hayabusa mission was successfully completed in 2010 and a second mission, Hayabusa2, was launched in 2014 to collect samples from the Ryugu asteroid. Hayabusa2 successfully delivered samples back to Earth in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, JAXA contributed the Japanese Experiment Module, known as Kibo, to the International Space Station (ISS) for microgravity experiments. In 2022, Japan officially signed on to contribute to the ISS — which had been in operation for over 23 years — through 2030, making Japan the first country besides the United States to formalize its commitment for an additional eight years of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although JAXA’s primary focus is on civil missions, Japanese space policies describe a partnership between JAXA and Japanese national security entities in developing and deploying certain space missions and technologies. For example, because of increased missile activity from North Korea in the late 1990s, including a North Korean rocket that flew over Japan in 1998, Japan launched its first satellite constellation, called the Intelligence-Gathering Satellite (IGS) program, in 2003. IGS satellites are dual use between national defense applications and civil national disaster monitoring. These reconnaissance satellites have been launched with either optical (EO) or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, and each satellite has a projected operational life of five years on orbit. The IGS program has seen over one dozen launches atop JAXA rockets in its 20-year history to include both EO and SAR satellites. However, the data from the IGS program is managed almost exclusively by the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center (CSICE). Japanese policymakers have sought to increase JAXA’s contributions to Japanese space security efforts following the passage of the 2008 Basic Space Law, and collaboration is ongoing on space situational awareness and other areas, although there remains room for significant expansion of such efforts. JAXA is also working with Japanese industry to develop reusable rockets by 2030 to reduce launch costs and compete with international efforts to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-organizations-of-japan&quot;&gt;Space Organizations of Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge to understanding the leadership and locus of space policy in the Japanese government is the siloed nature of space across sections of the Japanese government. In the executive branch, the prime minister is supported by the cabinet, which includes the Cabinet Office, Cabinet Secretariat, and 11 ministries. Space activities are ultimately overseen by the Strategic Headquarters for National Space Policy. As space is further integrated into defense, the Japanese MOD has become an increasingly important space stakeholder as well. Interministerial rivalry on space issues is common in Japan, and space activities often end up siloed, with a lack of formal coordination across ministries, until issues reach the National Space Policy Secretariat or the Strategic Headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cabinet, a Strategic Headquarters for National Space Policy was created in 2008 by the Basic Space Law. Under the headquarters, Japan’s National Space Policy Secretariat (NSPS) was created in 2012 to assist in the coordination of space policies and budget allocations among the various ministries. It is considered a counterpart to the U.S. National Space Council (NSpC) staff. Similarly, the Committee on National Space Policy, involving representatives from industry and academia, was created in 2012 to serve as an advisory body to the headquarters. In contrast to the U.S. NSpC, the NSPS also holds licensing responsibilities under Japan’s Space Activities Act and Remote Sensing Data Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cabinet Office, which operates under the cabinet, directs the planning, design, and coordination of policies regarding space exploration and the development, maintenance, and operation of the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS). QZSS is Japan’s regional satellite navigation constellation that both operates independently and is interoperable with the Global Positioning System (GPS). The cabinet directed the Cabinet Office to operate QZSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ministries with primary responsibilities for Japan’s space programs are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT), which oversees JAXA&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The MOD, which oversees the Japanese military and Self-Defense Force (SDF), as well as the recently established Space Operations Group&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Economics, Trade Industry (METI), which has become more involved with space and helps administer strategic planning and industry funds&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), which handles international space policy diplomacy&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC), which oversees the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology and its large space research and development group&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT), which oversees the Japan Meteorological Agency, responsible for the Himawari geostationary meteorological satellite constellation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of the Environment (MOE), which is responsible for monitoring greenhouse gasses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), which is responsible for supporting relevant industries and food security&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l7H88Ck.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Japan Space Organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space responsibilities are also assigned to the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office (CIRO). Although not part of a ministry, CIRO falls directly under the prime minister and is responsible for providing integrated intelligence to policymakers in the cabinet and the Cabinet Secretariat. Within CIRO, the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center is responsible for acquisition, operations, data collection, and imagery analysis for the growing IGS satellite constellation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ministry-of-defense&quot;&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD organizes and executes national defense strategy and leads the Self-Defense Force. Space policy and program decisions are created throughout a variety of positions and offices in the MOD, specifically including the Internal Bureau of Defense Policy and Bureau of Defense Buildup Planning. Other space-related organizations include the Joint Staff; Air Staff Office; the Acquisition, Technology &amp;amp; Logistics Agency; and the Defense Intelligence Headquarters. Japan is set to stand up the Japan Joint Operations Command by 2025, which will direct all SDF joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military service responsible for space activities is the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), which was established in 1954. In FY 2027, the service will be renamed the Japan Air and Space Self-Defense Force to “reinforce its space operation capability and . . . [develop] a system to ensure superiority in use of space.” The Space Operations Group was created in 2020 as the first space-focused unit within the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The group is organized to facilitate easy cooperation and interoperability with parallel U.S. organizations. It currently has 150 military personnel and will continue to grow. Its initial responsibility is the operation of Japan’s Space Situational Awareness (SSA) system. The group has four main objectives: (1) enhancing SSA; (2) improving information, communication, and positioning capabilities; (3) leveraging electromagnetic domain capabilities to deny other actors use of the full slate of command, control, communication, computer, and intelligence operations; and (4) working with other Japanese agencies, such as JAXA, and relevant counterparts in the United States and around the world. Beyond the Space Operation Group, the JASDF chief of staff maintains relationships with space leaders around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evolution-of-space-security-policy-in-japan&quot;&gt;Evolution of Space Security Policy in Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased ballistic missile and space activities from China and North Korea began to shift the security dynamic in the Indo-Pacific and motivated Japanese leaders to rethink Tokyo’s national defense strategy. Japan began to slowly integrate space into its overarching security policies starting in the late 2000s. China’s 2007 direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) test, which created thousands of pieces of debris in low Earth orbit (LEO), also likely influenced Japanese perspectives on space. Japan was one of the first to condemn the test, along with the United States and the United Kingdom, and many others followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, one year after China’s destructive ASAT test, the Diet adopted the Basic Space Law, which went through many iterations to gather support from both the ruling and opposition parties in the Diet. The Basic Space Law was the first law for space development in the country and reversed Japan’s decades-long policy that space be utilized for nonmilitary purposes only, aligning Japan with the same policy approach as many other countries. It established a Strategic Headquarters for National Space Policy, which became a driver of space policy and plans in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basic-space-plan&quot;&gt;Basic Space Plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Basic Space Law also created the first Basic Plan on Space Policy, which was a foundational document in Japanese space policy and the first to clearly identify national security as an objective of Japanese space activities. This was a turning point in how Japan approached space capabilities as part of its national defense strategy. The Basic Plan on Space Policy is now in its fifth iteration. In both the Basic Space Law and the iterations of the Basic Plan on Space Policy that followed, the development and use of space capabilities are described as a way to improve the lives of Japanese citizens and increase international peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2013, Japan published a second version of its Basic Plan on Space Policy that outlined government-led space activities for the decade ahead, citing a rapidly changing space domain as an impetus to update the country’s policies. The document suggested a fundamental shift in Japanese space development from a focus on scientific and technological research to the utilization of space for national security and environmental monitoring. Further, it emphasized the need for Japan’s aerospace industry to become a competitive supplier of space capabilities and services to buyers outside of Japan in an increasingly international market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, in January 2015, a third Basic Plan on Space Policy was published, with a request that two industry-focused space acts be adopted by the Diet. These two laws — the Space Activities Act (SAA) and the Remote Sensing Data Act — were enacted in 2016. The SAA was created to establish a system to regulate and license the launch of spacecraft, ensure public safety, and promote the use of space to improve the lives of the Japanese people, including via economic development. The Remote Sensing Data Act is a broadly scoped document that established a licensing regime for space-based remote sensing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PcAhsU0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Japan’s Space Security Advancements since 2008.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2020, the country released its fourth Basic Plan on Space Policy, acknowledging for the first time the urgency of space assets to advancing national security. This update describes Japan’s space industry as lagging behind other countries in trending areas, such as the deployment of large constellations of small satellites. The document describes the growing importance of space in national security, the dependence of militaries and governments on space systems, and the risks of interfering with the sustainable use of the space domain. It also lays out Japan’s space policy vision: to become a self-sustaining space nation and use space to contribute to a wide variety of national interests, including disaster management and economic growth. An undercurrent of the document is a desire to use space to solve global sustainability issues and strengthen national resilience. Sustainability and resource management are two key pillars of Japanese society and policy and remain a priority for space development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fifth Basic Plan on Space Policy was released in June 2023, highlighting the accelerated use of space for national security and the growing dependence of economic and social activities on space systems. The document further notes that on-orbit systems and their ground architectures are increasingly becoming seamlessly integrated and that access to space is democratizing beyond traditional spacefaring nations, which the document labels “space transformation.” The plan further underscores that the symbiotic nature between private and government space investment helps Japan maintain its leading role among spacefaring nations and must be further strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2022-security-and-defense-strategies&quot;&gt;2022 Security and Defense Strategies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan released three new strategic documents as well as an updated defense budget document in December 2022. The NSS, NDS, and Defense Buildup Program together reflect a turning point in Japan’s defense positioning. Integrated into each of these documents is a strong emphasis on the use of space for defense and national security. This is a noticeable change from policies of the past. Japan does not yet operate any satellites exclusively for military purposes, consistent with previous policy, though the SDF exclusively operates military-use communications payloads on private sector satellite buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complex and increasingly threatening security environment frames the 2022 NSS. Described as the most “severe and complex as it has ever been since the end of World War II,” the security environment includes the expanding military arsenals of China and North Korea, the introduction by China and North Korea of advanced weapons such as HGVs, and Russia’s brazen invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine’s effective resistance. The NSS draws parallels between Russia’s hostile actions against Ukraine and the West and potential Chinese regional aggression against Taiwan and others. The NSS also clearly and frequently mentions the threat of a nuclear weapons buildup in China, North Korea, and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of growing security demands, these new documents emphasize the need for an independent defense strategy and accelerated economic growth to protect against threats and the risk of invasion from a neighboring nation, as well as challenges to the post–World War II international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSS, which was first issued in 2013, outlines three main national interests: (1) sovereignty and independence while maintaining peace and security; (2) economic prosperity; and (3) protecting universal values and the international order, specifically in the Indo-Pacific region. It also calls upon like-minded nations to come together and cooperate to address global challenges, such as climate change and infectious diseases. The document also states that the line between military and nonmilitary fields has been blurred in areas both technological and economical, another departure from previous national documents that explicitly separated the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is cited heavily in the strategy and is specifically mentioned as a national security policy area, alongside diplomacy, defense, and economic security. The NSS calls for increased comprehensive efforts in space security from the entire government, including the use of the space domain by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and the integration of space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic domains into ground, maritime, and air capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missions prioritized in the NSS, including both missile defense and counterstrike operations, will rely heavily on space-based capabilities. The Japanese government had not previously acquired counterstrike capabilities due to the interpretation of its “defensive defense” policy at the time. As the Japanese military is still a self-defense force, government policy permits counterstrikes, but preemptive strikes are not permitted — a distinction that comes after years of debate in the Japanese government dating back to the 1950s. Currently, Japan relies significantly on the United States for information to enable its own missile defense and counterstrike capabilities. The expanded threat of mobile missiles, with unusual trajectories and the ability to be launched en masse, along with the capabilities of hypersonic weapons, are heavily underscored in the document and a key driver for the need for information collected from space-based assets. This includes imagery satellites to detect missile movements on the ground, develop targeting solutions, and provide warning of impending launches, as well as satellites that can detect missiles once launched and develop tracks and firing solutions for missile defense interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a Japanese national security strategy document, space security has its own subsection, “Reinforcing Comprehensive Efforts for Space Security,” in which space is described as “indispensable” for social and economic activities. The SDF and Japan Coast Guard are encouraged to utilize space capabilities. The section also calls for strengthening cooperation between JAXA and SDF on security matters — language that is a departure from past space policies in which JAXA was isolated from defense and security discussions. Greater “cooperation and coordination” are also encouraged between the CSICE, MOD, and SDF in intelligence gathering, including from space-based assets. Furthermore, the section encourages the utilization of civilian space technology and growth in the space industrial base to support the development of satellite constellations and better integration of industry products into space security missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document itself does not lay out specifications for space priorities or space organizations, but it sets the expectation that the country will release a concept supported by the government. This Space Security Initiative — the country’s first space security policy — was announced in June 2023 at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kishida Fumio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship in the NSS cannot be understated, nor can the emphasis on deepening security cooperation between the two countries. As Japan’s ally “with the world’s greatest comprehensive power,” increased cooperation and coordination with the United States is listed numerous times as a strategic approach and a means by which to achieve Tokyo’s security goals, including in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship in the NSS cannot be understated, nor can the emphasis on deepening security cooperation between the two countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 NDS seeks to clarify the national defense objectives of Japan, maintaining that the development of defensive capabilities is solely to protect the nation, not to pose a threat to other countries. Building off the NSS, the NDS is framed by Chinese, North Korean, and Russian threats to both the national security of Japan and the international community. The NDS articulates that the Indo-Pacific region is facing significant challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is building up its military and technological resources to amplify force on its mainland and in the East China and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;North Korea has become more brazen with its ballistic missile programs and pursuit of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and its impacts in Europe are a warning to the possibilities of invasion or disruption in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document calls for a strengthening of Japan’s defense capabilities and overall deterrence posture, particularly in cooperation with the United States, whose alliance serves as a pillar of Tokyo’s overall security policy. Time is a grounding factor in the NDS, which calls for Japan to be able to primarily defend itself against potential invaders by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the use of space for missile warning is not explicitly stated, missile defense is a stand-out priority throughout the document. Missile defense, and a subsequent counterstrike capability, have rising importance in light of elevated missile launch activity from North Korea and China inching closer to Japanese territory. Space is the key enabler for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities to ensure accurate and responsive missile warning and defense in the nation. Japanese defense policymakers are prioritizing Japan developing its own capability to defend itself, with missile defense systems developed in collaboration with and built to be interoperable with U.S. capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NDS also details a desire to integrate space into MOD and SDF activities by utilizing satellite constellations for communications, intelligence gathering, and positioning and by building a space domain awareness (SDA) structure to respond to threats in the space domain. Finally, the NDS calls for an enhanced SDA capability to be able to monitor objects in space by FY 2027 and for the continued acquisition of space capabilities and integration into SDF units over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the NSS, the NDS recognizes space as vital for both civilians and the military and calls for increased collaboration between the SDF and JAXA. The NDS also renames the Air Self-Defense Force as the Air and Space Self-Defense Force, emphasizing a renewed focus on space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEFENSE BUILDUP PROGRAM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Buildup Program serves as a guide for the MOD and the SDF to build, maintain, and operate defense capabilities. It provides a general outline of the systems the SDF will procure and operate. The program states that within five years, Japan will strengthen its defense capabilities, and within ten years, the SDF will be capable of deterring future invasions without allied assistance. Space capabilities are called upon early in the document as a tool to improve cross-domain operations such as missile warning, information gathering, and communications. The SDF is directed to develop a space-based space domain awareness capability, which will include the use of supplementary commercial options, and to increase efforts to add layers and resiliency to existing secure military communications. The MOD will also coordinate with JAXA to leverage space as a mechanism to strengthen cooperation with the United States and other friendly nations. Finally, the program echoes the call of the NDS to rename the country’s Air Self-Defense Force to the Air and Space Self-Defense Force, highlighting the increased role space capabilities will play in the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout each of these documents, it is clear that space has become an integral component of Japan’s national security posture. With a focus on information gathering, communication, and positioning data from space capabilities, Japan is focused on further integrating space, including JAXA and industry partners, into its defense architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2023-space-security-initiative&quot;&gt;2023 Space Security Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build on the NSS, Japan released the Space Security Initiative (SSI) in June 2023 to provide a decade-long strategy for space security and the space architecture needed to achieve those goals. The initiative identifies space as an “arena for geopolitical competition for national power over diplomacy, defense, economics, and intelligence. . . ” and highlights a growing need for an expansion of capability and cooperation with allies. The document outlines requirements for a national security space architecture to include compatibility and interoperability of satellite data, cyber security, and information security; resilience against threats and risks in space; and economic efficiency through the use of commercial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative identifies parallel framing issues as in the NSS, but it is able to specify the use of space in target areas of policy. The SSI describes the impact Western commercial satellites made in supporting Ukraine in the initial weeks of Russia’s invasion, describes the critical importance of cloud-based data management, and references China’s dramatic increase of space capabilities to include SAR and radio frequency satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI describes a three-pronged approach to establishing a national security space architecture: “Radically Expand the Use of Space Systems for National Security,” “Ensuring Safe and Stable Use of Outer Space,” and developing a “Virtuous Cycle of Security and Fostering [a] Space Industrial Base.” A thorough and ambitious architecture is presented in the document, with space capabilities covering position, navigation, and timing (QZSS and GPS); intelligence (IGS constellation and commercial imagery satellites); communications (commercial SATCOM, defense SATCOM, tactical SATCOM, commercial and optical constellations); missile defense (early warning satellites and a missile defense space system); space domain awareness (SDA satellites and commercial space situational awareness satellites); and on-orbit fuel supply satellites. It also includes space transportation (government launch vehicles and commercial rockets) and optical telescopes and radar run by JAXA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI outlines specific needs for a national security space architecture. Satellite data must be interoperable with U.S. and allied infrastructure. The architecture must have robust cyber and information security; be resilient against space threats, including anti-satellite weapons; be able to protect ground stations; and be able to leverage commercial services, particularly in communications, Earth observation, and data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve security from space, the first priority listed is intelligence collection. This is specified as geostationary-based optical satellites to add to the current IGS constellation. The current IGS system, and intelligence collection systems writ large, place resolution above revisit rate and are stovepiped from other MOD initiatives, creating the need to duplicate particular systems to give information to disconnected government offices. The SSI calls for an increase in satellite resolution, faster data transfer, and cooperation among CSICE, which currently operates and owns IGS data, the MOD, and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, as well as other relevant agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second priority outlined in the SSI is missile defense, specified as continued work with the United States on an early warning satellite. Additionally, the SSI describes a technical demonstration of additional missile defense capabilities, such as detection and tracking to respond to ballistic missiles and HGVs being developed and deployed by China and North Korea. This may be the architecture that presents the most opportunity for collaboration and coordination with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative’s third priority is the establishment of anti-jamming communications capabilities. Tokyo is attuned to the importance of continuity of operations, seeing Russian cyberattacks against Ukrainian communication networks on the first day of the conflict. The SSI calls for a layered and redundant communications capability that utilizes multiple orbits, both geostationary orbit (GEO) and LEO, to be interoperable with the United States and additional allies. This communications system will be used not only by the MOD and Self-Defense Forces, but also by the Japan Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth priority relates to position, navigation, and timing services, to be achieved through strengthening the current QZSS constellation. The final aspect of security from space in the SSI is space transportation, with a focus on continuing to operate a space launch vehicle, reduce launch costs, and commercialize operations for government utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI then turns to priorities for security in space and ensuring the safe and sustainable use of the space environment. The top priority in this initiative is enhancing space domain awareness. This encompasses not only situational awareness and movements of other satellites, but also operations and capabilities of other nations’ on-orbit assets. Space domain awareness will offer avenues to collaborate internationally in the Combined Space Operations Center and the Combined Space Operations Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-orbit servicing is a secondary priority area, focusing on on-orbit refueling and servicing to extend the life cycle of satellites in GEO. Subsequently, the SSI details the importance of information sharing across Japanese government agencies that may currently be stovepiped in the decisionmaking process, including the Cabinet Secretariat, the Cabinet Office, the MOD, and the Self-Defense Forces. Strengthening cooperation and information sharing with the United States is highlighted throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the SSI specifies that Japan will continue to lend its voice to the United Nations and other multinational organizations to shape norms for responsible behavior in the use of space. Along with the United States, Japan has committed to not conducting destructive, direct-ascent ASAT missile testing and to mitigating any future creation of space debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To realize its ambitious goals, the SSI acknowledges the need to strengthen public-private partnerships in the space domain in a large variety of areas, including personnel exchanges and technical cooperation with industry and government both within and outside Japan; research and development; government support of industry; investment diversification in private entities; and additional backing to industries with dual-use opportunities such as on orbit servicing, SAR and optical satellites, and launch. Additionally, the SSI aims to support a stable supply chain for components of critical technologies, including by issuing a Space Technology Strategy and by bolstering JAXA as the center of space excellence in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Technology Strategy was released in 2024 to build on the 2023 Basic Space Plan and SSI. It serves as a guide for the timeline and development of civilian and military sectors in satellites, space science and exploration, space transportation, and cross-domain technologies. The Space Technology Strategy further prioritizes efforts to mitigate “supply chain risks” to Japan’s “predominance” in space technologies, again linking the “competitiveness” of Japan’s space industry to its national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support these priorities, in November 2023, Tokyo announced that JAXA would be allocated ¥1 trillion over a 10-year period to support the nation’s commercial sector and technology development in the space industry. The funding will focus on satellites, space exploration, and space transportation. An additional ¥1 trillion is anticipated to be allocated for space security from 2023 to 2027. Like the United States and others, Japan recognizes the economic and technological benefits of space and how its investments create a demand signal to spur private sector innovation and attract technical talent. It also sees advances in the space domain helping solve global sustainability, resource management, and disaster relief challenges here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-budget&quot;&gt;Space Budget&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo’s policies and plans for greater space utilization are being implemented through increased funding. According to annual budget request documents published by the Cabinet Office, the government of Japan has been steadily increasing its space budget and, since FY 2019, spending on space activities has more than doubled. In late 2023, the government of Japan announced plans to commit ¥1 trillion ($6.9 billion) over a 10-year period toward the expansion of Japan’s domestic space industry. These resources, established as the Space Strategy Fund, will be managed by JAXA. The FY 2024 space budget begins to reflect this new funding, with large increases allocated to MEXT, the ministry overseeing JAXA, and METI, which has become more involved in stimulating Japan’s space industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7vHoWMw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s overall defense budget has been increasing since 2012, and it saw significant increases following the 2022 release of its defining defense strategy and budgetary documents. Tokyo’s FY 2022 defense budget (including its initial budget and supplementary budget) — framed as a “Defense-Strengthening Acceleration Package” — comprised ¥5.9 trillion ($40.9 billion) and reflected a 6.5 percent increase over FY 2021. In FY 2023, Japan’s “‘First Year’ Budget for Fundamental Reinforcement of Defense Capabilities” totaled ¥6.6 trillion ($45.7 billion), an increase of 11.9 percent over FY 2022. And in FY 2024, a year characterized as “Progress . . . in [the] Fundamental Reinforcement of Defense Capabilities,” Tokyo’s defense budget was ¥7.7 trillion ($53.3 billion), an increase of 16.7 percent. The FY 2025 budget request is planned for release in August 2024 and is expected to reflect continued increases in defense spending aligned with Tokyo’s national security and defense strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOD publishes an annual overview of its budget for defense programs, with space domain capabilities categorized in a few broad areas: space situational awareness and space domain awareness, strengthening information-gathering capabilities, enhancing space resiliency, and utilizing space for missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/579ptd3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Japan Ministry of Defense Space-Related Budget.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/en/d_act/d_budget/index.html&quot;&gt;“Defense Budget,” Ministry of Defense&lt;/a&gt;; and authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honing in on FY 2023, since that year marks the first MOD budget following the release of Japan’s NSS, NDS, and SSI, space funding nearly doubled, increasing from ¥79 billion ($546 million) to ¥152.9 billion ($1.1 billion). The FY 2023 budget document framed this funding increase with the observation that “the space domain is now the foundation of our citizens’ daily lives and security, and it is extremely important for Japan to ensure superiority in space use”; therefore, “it is necessary to strengthen space operational capabilities.” SDA enhancements saw the greatest growth, including the production of a domestic SDA satellite and consideration of more satellites (¥59.5 billion, $411.9 million) and the development of space command and control capabilities (¥13.7 billion, $94.8 million). The other area that saw significant growth was in information-collection capabilities, with ¥34.3 billion ($237.2 million) allocated to enhancing the X-band SATCOM network and ¥22.6 billion ($156.2 million) allocated to the procurement of data for image analysis. Notably, the FY 2023 budget also begins funding infrared sensor technology demonstrations for HGV detection and tracking (¥4.6 billion, $31.8 million) and demonstrations to acquire and process EO/SAR data and respond to HGVs (¥8 billion, $55.3 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FY 2024 MOD space budget slightly declined from FY 2023. It maintained an emphasis on SDA to include ¥17.2 billion ($118.8 million) for the launch and deployment of an SDA satellite, scheduled for launch in FY 2026, and space command and control (¥9.2 billion, $63.6 million). The budget also begins funding an optical datalink demonstration in GEO (¥4.8 billion, $33.2 million) and a study on hosted payloads. It continues investments in information-collection capabilities with the acquisition of commercial satellite imagery (¥24.7 billion, $170.6 million) and advancing HGV detection and tracking technology demonstrations, specifying use of the HTV-X space station resupply vehicle as an experimental platform (¥3.8 billion, $26.2 million). The one area that saw a significant increase over FY 2023 is in SATCOM resiliency to build interoperability between X-band military SATCOM and other commercial SATCOM systems (¥10.5 billion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts on Japan’s space programs and budgets shared with the authors that the FY 2024 topline decrease for space can be explained through the natural progression of certain programs (e.g., allocating funds to transition the SDA satellite from production to preparing it for launch and deployment) and some delays in budget execution. However, the FY 2025 space budget request, scheduled to be announced in August 2024, is expected to rise significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space-industrial-base-of-japan&quot;&gt;Space Industrial Base of Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s space industry is worth approximately ¥1.2 trillion ($8.6 billion) as estimated by the World Economic Forum, with the Japanese government seeking to double the size of the industry by the early 2030s. It is dominated by government-funded heavy industry, primarily through the production of space launch vehicles (SLVs), but includes a growing number of space start-ups. Japan’s long-standing focus on indigenous launch capabilities and independent access to space indicates a prioritization on autonomy. SLVs are often seen by rising space powers as a key to competitiveness in the space market and international success in the domain. A majority of SLV operations are now based in the private sector with JAXA oversight. On the start-up front, over a 21-year period (2000–2021), Japan accounted for the third-largest number of investors in space start-up companies, behind the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the 2019 annual report of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Japan’s space industry comprises three broad categories: (1) space vehicles, including launch vehicles, satellites, and space station components, which make up 87 percent of total production; (2) ground facilities, which comprise 8 percent; and (3) software, which accounts for the final 5 percent. The FY 2022 report, released in 2023, shows a slight rebalancing of 76.6 percent, 9.6 percent, and 13.8 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;traditional-industry&quot;&gt;Traditional Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the Japanese aerospace market was dominated by four large companies: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), IHI Aerospace, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO), and NEC Space Technologies. These companies provide products and solutions across a wide range of industrial sectors — from agriculture to telecommunications to transportation. Aerospace and defense comprise a fraction of their overall business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MHI has been providing launch services in Japan since 2007 and has proved to be a reliable partner to JAXA in the development of three SLVs: the H-IIA, H-IIB, and H3 launch vehicle (in production). Prior to the H3’s failure in March 2023, the H-IIA/B vehicles had 49 consecutive successful launches. In addition to SLV production, MHI produces rocket engines, test facilities, electronic parts, and parts of Japanese systems or components for the ISS, such as the Japanese Experiment Module. The H3 test-launched successfully in February and July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHI is involved in a variety of large industries in Japan, including space, defense, aircraft engines, and long-term research and development. The Epsilon Launch Vehicle, developed by IHI Aerospace and operated by JAXA, is currently on its fifth iteration, known as Epsilon (S), and has a successful record of inserting up to nine satellites into LEO. Additionally, IHI Aerospace contributes solid rocket boosters, a gas jet system, and pyrotechnics to the H-IIA and H-IIB launch vehicles and continues to work with JAXA and MHI on the production of a new solid booster for the H3 vehicle. IHI Aerospace also designed and manufactured the return capsule for the Hayabusa asteroid probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MELCO has been developing space technology for Japan since the 1960s, with an emphasis on satellite production, high-performance payloads, and exportable components for satellite programs across the globe. MELCO is also involved in building ground stations, including manufacturing antennas, transmitters, receivers, and radio and optical telescopes, among other products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEC Space Technologies focuses on specific components for satellites and launch vehicles rather than full systems. Components from NEC have been used on over 350 spacecraft worldwide. Though one of Japan’s mainstay industry partners in space, NEC maintains fewer than 450 employees across its space business, serving as a reminder of the small scale of Japanese space personnel and the room for growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation is the largest geostationary satellite communications operator in the Pacific region, where the company operates 17 geostationary communications satellites. The company was established in 1985 as Japan’s first private SATCOM company. It plans on expanding operations to include Earth observation satellites to enable it to respond to security issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SKY Perfect JSAT is headquartered in Tokyo, with a U.S. subsidiary, JSAT International, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to conglomerates that operate aerospace and defense segments, Japan has a unique trading house economy. Known as “sogo shosha,” Japanese investment houses, which are often part of larger Japanese business groups known as “keiretsu,” look to engage in a variety of sectors and technologies; they helped propel Japan into global markets and industrialization, particularly in the aftermath of the post-war reconstruction period. Modern-day houses are increasingly investing in space technologies and companies in Japan and internationally. Traditional firms are also investing in international space start-ups, including through joint ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-space&quot;&gt;New Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small start-ups, many of which are funded by venture capital, are expanding Japan’s space activities beyond the scope of traditional Japanese heavy industry. Several of these companies are capitalizing on Japan’s strength in robotics to innovate in the areas of space sustainability and exploration, such as space domain awareness and on-orbit servicing. Companies such as Astroscale, ispace, and GITAI are focusing on a variety of different mission areas, ranging from on-orbit servicing to lunar missions to robotics on the ISS. Other new space companies, including Axelspace, iQPS, and Synspective, are developing small satellite constellations to observe and analyze natural and human activity on Earth. Listed below are several new space companies, providing examples of the wide-ranging space technologies in development in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astroscale, a Tokyo-based start-up company with subsidiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom, among other countries, specializes in on-orbit servicing, including satellite life extension, on-orbit SSA, and debris-removal technology for the safe and sustainable use of space. Although products from Astroscale are largely still in the development phase, the company has conducted successful test missions. In 2023, Astroscale was awarded a contract by the U.S. Space Force Space Systems Command (SSC) for the provision of on-orbit satellite refueling services, a demonstration of the potential for collaboration between the U.S. government and Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another innovative Japanese company is ispace, a lunar exploration company that also seeks to expand human presence beyond Earth. In late 2022, ispace launched its first Hakuto-R mission, with the goal of a lunar landing in early 2023. Although the lander successfully reached lunar orbit, it crashed into the surface of the Moon, likely due to a software failure, and was unable to complete its mission. If it had been successful, the lander would have become the first private sector spacecraft to land on the Moon. Ispace’s second Hakuto-R mission, which will again attempt a soft landing on the Moon, is currently scheduled for 2024 launch. Additionally, ispace has been contracted by NASA to develop the lander for a 2026 commercial lunar payload services mission to the far side of the Moon. In late 2023, ispace established a U.S. headquarters in Colorado to enable more business opportunities in the United States, especially with the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GITAI is a space robotics start-up capitalizing on Japan’s long history of excellence in robotics. The company aims to partner with launch companies to build colonies on the Moon and Mars. While this may sound far-fetched, the company has formed successful relationships and contracts with Toyota Motor Corporation and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry; has completed a successful technology demonstration mission inside the ISS; and has engaged with U.S. space companies. Like other Japanese space start-ups that have established a U.S. headquarters or subsidiary, GITAI has moved most business operations to the United States to better conform to U.S. export control regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Axelspace designs and produces Earth observation microsatellites and their components and successfully launched its first satellite in 2014. The company currently has five satellites in orbit with customers in over 30 countries. Axelspace’s business model centers on sustainability, including using collected optical imagery and data services to monitor climate change resulting from deforestation and supporting a sustainable space environment through policy advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, iQPS and Synspective are building small satellite constellations for Earth observation, leveraging synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology that enables the collection of data and imagery day and night, and in all-weather conditions. The information can be used to support environmental monitoring, disaster management, and national security applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;growing-prominence-of-space-in-the-bilateral-relationship&quot;&gt;Growing Prominence of Space in the Bilateral Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Our bilateral partnership is among the strongest in the world, in part because we’re always adapting it to meet the evolving challenges of our time. That’s the case on everything from advancing security and stability in the Indo-Pacific, to bolstering our economic and energy security . . . we’re also expanding the horizons of our partnership in a very literal way, through space cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-january-13-2023&quot;&gt;– U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken, January 13, 2023&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space has become more prominent in high-level discussions between the United States and Japan, with political and military leaders from both nations committing to deepen cooperation in space security. This builds upon a long history of space cooperation, especially across civil space organization missions and organizations, which span human spaceflight, scientific research, satellite navigation and communication, and defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, U.S. president Joe Biden and Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio announced a bilateral space framework agreement, further cementing cooperation on space exploration, while also discussing the need to better align force postures in the space domain. The U.S. and Japanese defense and foreign ministers now regularly highlight the growing importance of space to stability, security, and economic prosperity. In 2023, they committed to deepen cooperation “on space capabilities to strengthen mission assurance, interoperability, and operational cooperation.” Then, in April 2024, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida went further, announcing a bilateral collaborative effort on a satellite constellation to detect and track missiles, including hypersonic glide vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers from both countries emphasize the increasing importance of space in their defense strategies, with space cooperation providing “an asymmetric advantage that our competitors can never hope to match.” Japan plans to “radically expand the use of space systems for national security” while also playing a “proactive role in shaping norms for responsible behavior in outer space.” The United States is prioritizing resilient space architectures, promoting responsible behaviors in the space domain, and expanding space cooperation to enhance information sharing and develop combined operations in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artemis-program-and-artemis-accords&quot;&gt;Artemis Program and Artemis Accords&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is a partner of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to explore the Moon and Mars. As part of the Artemis missions, the Lunar Gateway will serve as an outpost that will orbit around the Moon to stage deep-space exploration. In November 2022, NASA and the government of Japan announced specific contributions under the “Gateway Implementing Arrangement.” Under this arrangement, Japan agreed to contribute critical components to the Lunar Gateway’s International Habitation module and the JAXA HTV-XG spacecraft to launch and deliver resupply missions for the Lunar Gateway. Japan’s contributions to the International Habitation module will include an Environmental Control and Life Support System, cameras, functions for thermal control, and batteries for additional modules. In return, NASA agreed to fly a JAXA astronaut as a Lunar Gateway crew member on NASA’s Space Launch System rocket. The Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology later added that the country seeks to have a Japanese astronaut land on the Moon in the late 2020s as the first non-American on the Moon, an aim that was reinforced by Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden in a 2024 state visit where Japan’s anticipated role of providing the first international Artemis astronaut on the lunar surface was formalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Japan was one of seven original signatories to NASA’s Artemis Accords in 2020. The accords, which are separate from the Artemis campaign, are a set of “principles for cooperation in the civil exploration and use of the Moon, Mars, comets, and asteroids for peaceful purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2023-space-collaboration-agreement&quot;&gt;2023 Space Collaboration Agreement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the U.S. secretary of state and Japan’s minister of foreign affairs signed a space collaboration agreement titled “Framework Agreement Between the Government of Japan and the Government of the United States of America for Cooperation in Space Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, for Peaceful Purposes.” The specific areas of collaboration emphasized include space science (including Earth and lunar science), space exploration, technology, and mission assurance and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-japan-security-consultative-committee&quot;&gt;U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee (SCC), often referred to as the “2+2” meetings and comprising both countries’ foreign and defense ministers, is a long-standing bilateral forum for discussing security and defense cooperation. The joint statement from the January 2023 SCC meeting emphasized alliance modernization and renewed both sides’ “commitment to deepening cooperation on space capabilities to strengthen mission assurance, interoperability, and operational cooperation.” It also, notably, included a declaration that “attacks to, from, or within space . . . in certain circumstances, could lead to the invocation of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,” which commits the United States to defend Japan if attacked by a third party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-japan-comprehensive-dialogue-on-space&quot;&gt;U.S.-Japan Comprehensive Dialogue on Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cement both nations’ commitment to bilateral space cooperation, Japan and the United States engage in a Comprehensive Dialogue on Space. This is one of only two comprehensive dialogues that the United States maintains, and it is the most longstanding one. In March 2023, the eighth meeting was held in Tokyo, which included representatives from the governments of both nations and, for the first time, industry participants. Policymakers discussed national security, including Japan’s 2022 NSS, as well as commercial and civil space cooperation, with an emphasis on space situational awareness. The ninth dialogue is planned for the summer of 2024 in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-japan-military-cooperation&quot;&gt;U.S.-Japan Military Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We cannot secure stable use of space by unilateral effort, therefore, it is essential to cooperate with the U.S. and our partners at all stages from peaceful time to armed contingencies.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-major-general-yajima-masahito-director-general-of-the-defense-planning-and-policy-department-air-staff-office-japan-air-self-defense-force&quot;&gt;– Major General Yajima Masahito, director general of the Defense Planning and Policy Department, Air Staff Office, Japan Air Self-Defense Force&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several recent organizational developments have marked closer space ties between the two countries, especially at the operational level. The first instance of operational military cooperation stems from a 2020 agreement between the U.S. Space Force and Japan’s Office of National Space Policy, whereby two U.S. payloads will be hosted on Japan’s QZSS satellites. The U.S. payloads have space domain awareness optical sensors and have been delivered to Japan to launch on the QZS-6 and QZS-7 satellites from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, Japan participated in its first senior-level meeting of the Combined Space Operations initiative, where it joined a cohort of 10 countries working to improve multilateral space coordination, information sharing, and operational cooperation for the space domain. Political and military leaders from each of the 10 nations’ departments of defense meet annually to deter conflict, optimize resources, facilitate information sharing, and enhance mission assurance and resilience. The anticipated establishment of a U.S. Space Force command element in Japan in 2024 would facilitate further opportunities for bilateral training, exercises, and operational collaboration. This would be similar to U.S. Space Force command elements established in the Republic of Korea under the Space Force component supporting U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and in Tampa, Florida supporting U.S. Central Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments supplement an already established liaison officer initiative whereby Japan places a space liaison officer with the U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM). The U.S. Space Force (USSF) has an officer assigned to U.S. Forces Japan; that role is expected to transition into a new USSF field command element in Japan later in 2024. As combined training and operational collaboration increases, further embedding liaison personnel would likely be welcome by Tokyo, including the placement of USSF or USSPACECOM personnel with the Japan Space Operations Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further integrate military approaches, Japan and the United States participate in hosted wargames. Each year since 2001, the United States has hosted an annual Schriever Wargame, originally organized by Air Force Space Command and now led by the U.S. Space Force. Japan has been a participant since 2018. Participation in these wargames builds confidence and insight into the strategy, capabilities, and decisionmaking of other nations, especially with regard to space threats. In 2024, Japan joined NATO members and other partners to participate in the French AsterX exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deepening-cooperation-in-space-security&quot;&gt;Deepening Cooperation in Space Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are abundant opportunities for deepening U.S.-Japan cooperation and collaboration in space security, building on the decades-long relationship in civil and commercial space cooperation and the nascent security activities underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alignment on threats and strategic interests, guidance from senior leadership and political support, and the commitment of personnel and resources create a window to advance a comprehensive agenda for space security cooperation. Questions of implementation remain, including how to translate high-level policy intent into meaningful actions to deliver space capabilities, create interoperability across systems, and enhance mission resilience. This must be done while leveraging the complementary strengths that both countries bring forth, building greater collective knowledge and expertise in the space domain, strengthening the industrial base and promoting a culture of innovation, and expanding the talent pool across each country. But collaboration should not be pursued just for collaborations’ sake — there must be intent behind actions to ensure that the respective industrial, economic, and security needs are met for both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes several areas where the combined, complementary strengths of both nations’ public and private sectors can be brought together to deliver concrete space capabilities to advance both U.S. and Japanese national and collective security interests. These areas span collaborative efforts at the policy, operational, and technical levels and involve the governments, industry, and academia of both countries. The following section unpacks persistent challenges to greater cooperation. Each area includes discussion of the authors’ observations and findings from their research, interviews, and workshops, as well as the recommendations that follow therein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Collaboration should not be pursued just for collaborations’ sake — there must be intent behind actions to ensure that the respective industrial, economic, and security needs are met for both nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cultivating-human-development&quot;&gt;Cultivating Human Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s past limitation that space be used only for nonmilitary purposes led its space ecosystem to grow around JAXA, civilian space missions, and civilian-led space science and technology research. This has been reinforced in the bilateral relationship through long-standing cooperation across space science and human spaceflight, as well as through expansion to cislunar and the Moon through NASA’s Artemis program and the Artemis Accords. Yet while Japan grew into one of the world’s most advanced spacefaring nations, its defense institutions and supporting industry have little exposure to, and limited experience in, military space missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes establishing requirements for military space systems, developing and utilizing those systems, and integrating them into joint military operations. Building such knowledge and proficiency starts with education and training, which serves as the foundation for the space security relationship. Japanese officials describe this as “human development,” expressing a near-unanimous view across government, industry, and academia on the need for space education and training for both military and civilian personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To jump-start this human development, U.S. space institutions across government and academia could partner with Japan’s MOD and the JASDF to provide civilian and military personnel with greater space domain knowledge. This could include invitations by the U.S. Space Force to attend “Space 100/200” courses and Defense Acquisition University space acquisition courses. U.S. academic institutions, partnered with Japanese academia, can also serve an educational role. The USSF has partnered with Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies for its professional military education, which — in addition to other academic institutions — has established executive education courses in space security. To maximize these education and training opportunities, leaders on both sides can also encourage greater foreign language proficiency across their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Japanese experts further describe a shortfall in “human resources” — the workforce required to support Japan’s space security vision — and cite the need for more engineers (e.g., aerospace, mechanical, electrical, and software engineers). In the near term, such a human resources shortfall is expected to place greater strain on JAXA, given its current workforce level and resources and the industrial base that supports it. Not only is JAXA supporting an expanded space exploration program, including the development of the Artemis Lunar Gateway and lunar rover, it is being asked to partner with the MOD to support the Space Security Initiative and develop many of the satellite systems described in it. This includes delivering the first domestically designed and produced SDA satellite for the JASDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help educate and inform MOD space professionals, JAXA assigns subject matter expert employees to the MOD defense policy bureau. However, it is important for the MOD to retain its own cadre of space professionals who are experts in space security policy, operations, and technology, as JAXA supplying personnel to the MOD is not a long-term solution to the MOD’s human resource shortfalls. Given JAXA and its predecessor organizations’ long-time focus on nonmilitary activities, it also lacks knowledge and experience with military requirements and operations, which differ in significant ways from those in a civil space context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a call to “expand and enhance” JAXA’s human resources and to recruit, train, and retain space professionals who can develop, build, and operate both civil and national security space missions. Over the next 10 years, the Japanese government has committed ¥1 trillion toward developing Japan’s domestic space industry. This Space Strategy Fund is aimed at supporting JAXA and the expansion of Japan’s space industrial base. Japan’s expanding start-up ecosystem should be nurtured as a pathway to bring greater technical talent into the space ecosystem. As one 2023 study notes, “Japan’s start-up ecosystem is currently able to draw top-tier talent to high-growth start-ups at a scale that was not possible fifteen years ago.” However, expertise takes time to cultivate. Partnerships with U.S. space and technology companies, especially on cooperative projects involving codevelopment or coproduction, can hasten this knowledge and experience while also adding needed capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also observed within Japan was the lack of space-related media and think tanks in contrast to the robust presence of media in the United States dedicated to reporting on civil, commercial, and military space developments. Public discussion about space programs and plans, technologies and start-ups, and the security and economic benefits of space may also lead to excitement, understanding, and greater support among the Japanese population. Without this public reporting, space would not receive broader attention and inclusion in conversation. Both U.S. and Japanese government and industry leaders could be more deliberate in their engagement with traditional Japanese media on space initiatives and collaborative efforts to build understanding and broader encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exercising-and-training-the-space-force-and-joint-force&quot;&gt;Exercising and Training the Space Force and Joint Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From early warning and intelligence to border and maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations, and high-end combat, space capabilities contribute to nearly every aspect of modern military operations. As Japan develops the space capabilities outlined in the SSI, it will be vitally important not just for the JASDF to build space proficiency, but for the broader Japanese joint force to understand how space capabilities enable its missions. In turn, such joint force learning will shape requirements on what the SDF needs from space systems moving forward. This learning is built through education, as discussed above, and integrating space elements into exercises and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these exercises is where theory meets reality. This is where both Japanese and U.S. forces work through the space capabilities each side can bring, the quality and timeliness of information needed from those systems to make decisions, and how that information is presented and delivered to users. These exercises can also be used to build interoperability between systems and identify any factors that may limit mission effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space capabilities can be increasingly integrated into bilateral and multilateral joint exercises, such as Keen Edge, Keen Sword, and Rim of the Pacific, and into routine service-specific and joint training, at both the command and field levels. Notably, Keen Edge 2024 — a command-level bilateral exercise between U.S. forces and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to enhance joint operations and interoperability for crises and contingencies in the Indo-Pacific — featured USSPACECOM participation for the first time. Military commanders will find that space capabilities play a key yet less visible role in joint force employment and can be a useful contributor as Japan evolves its command and control structures and stands up a joint operations command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the military space community, JASDF officials noted the value of taking part in the U.S. Space Force Schriever space wargame series and USSPACECOM’s Global Sentinel exercise, both of which expose participants to multilateral space operations scenarios. Such wargames and realistic scenarios, along with immersive tabletop exercises and collaborative studies, were cited as ways to improve Japanese understanding of space threats and the principles of operating in space for those new to the domain. They can also be leveraged by space policymakers and operators to explore scenarios that might lead to “the invocation of Article V of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty,” as discussed at the 2023 U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting, including considerations regarding the decisionmaking processes and information needs of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, JASDF officials recognize that their space forces will need to gain greater operational experience as they field satellite constellations that support Japan’s national security. As the MOD and JASDF expand into new mission areas in which satellites in orbit can maneuver to characterize other objects in space, such as space domain awareness, additional training will accelerate their ability to effectively employ the systems once they are fielded. Japan’s first SDA satellite is planned for launch in FY 2026, so now is the time to commence such training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such training and sharing of operational best practices support a policy goal shared by both countries to advance responsible behaviors in space, including conducting activities in space that promote the safety and sustainability of the domain. These capabilities also benefit the United States by having additional assets capable of identifying unfriendly or unusual satellite behaviors in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector Japanese and U.S. satellite operators have also gained greater operational insights from their participation in space wargames and exercises. For example, Japanese industry participated in a space situational awareness tabletop exercise through USSPACECOM’s Joint Task Force-Space Defense Sprint Advanced Concept Training initiative, which has since been renamed the Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell. The satellite operators were presented with operational problems such as how to respond to others’ satellite close approaches and maneuvers, satellite breakup events, etc. These scenarios challenged their thinking, helped them refine their own best practices, and forged key relationships with U.S. government and industry partners. Exercises such as these are all the more critical given Japan’s participation in USSPACECOM’s JCO cell. As industry becomes a trusted partner in fielding and operating satellite systems, its involvement in joint exercises will continue to become more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SHARING DATA AND INFORMATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information sharing helps build a more complete picture of emerging threats and enables each country to act with more fulsome knowledge than it would be able to individually. Whether for missile defense, counterstrike, space operations, or cyber defense, information will need to be disseminated to users in a timely manner and increasingly at machine speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An information exchange model often cited is the trilateral mechanism between the United States, Japan, and South Korea that enables real-time data sharing on North Korean missile launches. However, in the space domain, both U.S. and Japanese officials shared observations that the current information-sharing paradigm is “largely emails and PDFs,” not space threat information or operational data that both sides can access, analyze, and use. As both countries emphasize speed and adopt greater automation, advanced processing, and artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, they must be able to share datasets on operationally relevant timelines, whether in terms of real-time data on the launch and trajectory of a threatening hypersonic glide vehicle or regarding the maneuvering and close approach of an unfriendly satellite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing space and cyber threat assessments is a logical start, especially with the increasing availability of both classified and unclassified threat assessments from the U.S. government, industry, and academia. Further, SSA and SDA data are strong candidates for enhanced sharing given the emphasis both countries place on these capabilities. The Japanese MOD, the JASDF, and JAXA maintain terrestrial SSA sensors and are developing an SDA satellite. The USSF is expanding its global space surveillance network (working with allies) and SDA satellites, and U.S. commercial SSA providers add capacity with shareable data and orbital analysis. The two nations are collaborating further on a USSF SDA payload to be hosted on a Japanese QZSS satellite, yet no concrete plans have been made to provide that SDA data to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a clear area in which both parties bring data and information to the table that can increase collective capacity to identify unusual and unfriendly behaviors and attribute threats in the space environment. Such information sharing can also support both nations’ leadership efforts to reduce space threats through the promotion of principles and norms for responsible space activities. Further, because SSA is an essential capability for a majority of spacefaring nations, establishing a cooperative information-sharing mechanism can provide the building blocks for greater multilateral information sharing on space activities going forward, including between Japan, South Korea, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSA and SDA operations and operational data remain highly classified within the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). It will be critical for U.S. policy officials, working with USSPACECOM, to update and streamline policy permissions for sharing such information and to accelerate the implementation of the DOD’s revised classification policy for space programs and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMPLEMENTARY INDUSTRIAL BASE STRENGTHS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both nations emphasize the importance of partnerships between U.S. and Japanese industry for delivering military space capabilities within relevant timeframes. However, there will be a natural tension between the countries as each will seek to expand its own industrial base and decide what it is willing to rely on the other for. Moreover, while Japanese industry is well versed in building exquisite scientific satellites for JAXA and contributing to civil missions, the contrasting scale and timeline shift for developing, producing, and fielding military systems is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is useful to consider the unique strengths maintained in each nation’s industrial base that lend themselves to collaborative efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In areas where timely action is particularly critical, the quickest pathway to a near-term, interoperable capability may be for Japan to acquire space systems from U.S. aerospace and defense companies that maintain an institutional and operational knowledge base that may be impossible to scale from scratch. But a strict “buy American” approach does not meet Tokyo’s policy objectives of security and industrialization that would help it strengthen its industrial base and attract talent. Likewise, a Japanese domestic-only approach in which U.S. industry does not see benefit or expanded market access is equally unproductive, especially as Japan seeks to speed up its technical and operational proficiency in developing and utilizing military space systems. Therefore, it is useful to consider the unique strengths maintained in each nation’s industrial base that lend themselves to collaborative efforts that enhance the alliance’s overall deterrence and defense posture in addition to meeting industrial development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strength across U.S. industry is its institutional knowledge of military space systems, particularly from its aerospace and defense primes, which have been designing, building, and operating military satellite systems for decades. U.S. industry brings experience in systems integration of large satellite constellations and in constructing the ground infrastructure necessary for data processing, analysis, and connectivity with users on militarily relevant timelines. In some areas, such as LEO intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and communications satellites, U.S. industry has scaled up manufacturing capacity with hot production lines. Sharing lessons learned from past projects and providing systems integration and ground architecture expertise may prove invaluable as Japanese industry takes on large national security space constellations with pressure to deliver in a short time span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese industry holds a particular strength in satellite components, with proven hardware in areas such as transponders, amplifiers, optical links, and solar arrays. These components, built by Japanese companies such as MELCO and NEC, are used in hundreds of satellites from dozens of nations around the world. As the United States seeks to increase supply chain resiliency, it should look to these Japanese component providers as part of its broader trusted supplier base. Further, Japan has long maintained strength in certain cutting-edge technology areas, such as robotics and advanced manufacturing, especially in the automotive sector. There are best practices to be drawn from these sectors and applied to both Japanese and U.S. satellite production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the commercial services front, both nations have long-standing commercial SATCOM operators, such as Sky Perfect JSAT and Viasat, that are being joined by a new crop of commercial space companies. Bolstered by private capital, these companies are providing data, analytic products, and services in areas like Earth observation, space situational awareness, SATCOM, and in-space servicing. They offer capabilities that can be integrated into each country’s space architectures, providing shareable data and additional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 2023 report on trends in start-up space investments by U.S. analytics firm BryceTech, roughly 50 percent of all investors in start-up space companies since 2000 were from the United States (43 percent) and Japan (7 percent). BryceTech further noted that “participation from international investors has been increasing since 2018, primarily in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.” Such capital, including reciprocal investments in each nations’ space sectors, can boost the development of the commercial space capabilities and services described above to achieve broader alliance objectives vis-à-vis space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Japan’s Space Strategy Fund has the potential to strengthen Japan’s broader space and technology ecosystem so that it can more substantially contribute to the space security needs of both countries. Ideally, the fund would focus not only on big ticket hardware like space launch vehicles, but also on stimulating Japanese start-ups, advancing dual-use technologies, and developing space data analytic tools and services that can support the MOD’s objectives, as well as encouraging Japanese firms that are beneficiaries of the fund to partner with U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. and Japanese start-ups are one source of innovation and disruption within the space ecosystem, government agencies are also introducing disruptive acquisition approaches and business models to traditional space acquisition programs. As the developer, acquirer, and operator of the next-generation Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), the U.S. Space Development Agency — along with its industry partners — is well equipped to share insights on acquisition best practices, the development of open source and modular components, and spiral development methods to incrementally deliver new capabilities over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while it may be expedient to focus on partnering constructs within the space ecosystem, what each country needs most from the other may not be space specific. For example, while Japan may be best served by U.S. industry aiding in the system integration of its military satellite constellations, the United States may be best served leveraging Japanese industry for overseas ship repair and maintenance, or mass production of drones and munitions, given Japan’s strengths in advanced robotics and manufacturing. Expanded thinking on industrial base cooperation and broader “win-win” approaches that leverage each nation’s complementary strengths should be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;architecting-national-security-space-constellations&quot;&gt;Architecting National Security Space Constellations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its Space Security Initiative, Japan for the first time presents a road map for a multifaceted space security architecture with constellations of satellites performing missile detection and tracking, information collection, communications, positioning and navigation, and space domain awareness, supported by a suite of space launch vehicles. Meanwhile, the United States is in the midst of major changes to its national security space architecture, prioritizing mission assurance through diverse, resilient space architectures that includes greater investment in proliferated missile warning and missile tracking (MW/MT); intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; communications constellations of smaller, less exquisite satellites; and space protection and space control capabilities. Both countries emphasize that government systems and commercial services, including new areas of space commercialization, will be needed to implement these strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington and Tokyo appreciate that their alliance and partnerships provide them with an asymmetric advantage and that their cooperations “broaden the number of systems collectively available for space operations, both on orbit and on the ground; strengthen resilience; expand our options for diplomatic and military responses; and complicate an adversary’s decision making.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both approaches are ambitious, resource-intensive endeavors. However, despite increased funding for space in both countries, delivering on these plans will be challenged over the long term by resource availability, industrial capacity, and labor accessibility in highly technical fields. Japanese experts emphasize that they need U.S. partners, as Japanese industry lacks sufficient human resources and would be hard-pressed to deliver space capabilities at the scale and timelines needed. While the United States brings deep experience in military space systems development and operations, it also seeks additional capacity for resiliency and filling gaps and new ways to share the burden. Moreover, as the U.S. approach transitions to proliferated architectures, there will be opportunities to create new concepts of operations, different technology development and production arrangements, and new partnering constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors considered numerous ideas on architecture cooperation across different space mission areas, informed by discussions, briefings, and workshops with U.S. and Japanese government and industry representatives. Several of those will be discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all areas described in the SSI could be candidates for greater bilateral cooperation, missile detection and missile tracking, tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting capabilities, protected SATCOM, and SDA stand out because of the urgency to have sufficient defensive capabilities deployed by FY 2027 described in Japan’s strategy documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MISSILE DETECTION AND TRACKING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanding missile arsenals of North Korea and China, including advanced ballistic and cruise missiles and HGVs, have made space-based missile detection and tracking one of the more pressing areas of need for the United States and Japan. This led leaders from both countries to commit, in April 2024, to pursue “bilateral collaboration on a Low Earth Orbit detection and tracking constellation for missiles such as hypersonic glide vehicles, including potential collaboration with U.S. industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, a shift in approach is underway toward a proliferated MW/MT architecture with satellites in multiple orbits to increase resilience against growing space threats that also takes advantage of commercially derived components and practices. The U.S. Space Force, through its Space Development Agency, is building out hundreds of satellites in LEO through the PWSA; the USSF and MDA are building medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites, and the USSF is replacing its GEO and high Earth orbit space-based infrared systems through a next-generation overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5cSdScn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Popular Orbit Regimes.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Aerospace Security Project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan aims to develop a sovereign capability and, while there is interest in LEO collaboration, it has not yet coalesced on an overall architectural approach. To date, Tokyo has relied on missile warning data shared from U.S. space-based infrared systems and defense support program missile warning satellites in GEO and high Earth orbit and its own ground-based radars. Some in Japan question the need for a global architecture and instead argue that regional needs can be met with GEO systems that provide persistence and sensors that can monitor the region. Japanese industry has proficiency in building large satellite buses that could be integrated with an OPIR payload for GEO operations. Others argue that LEO or MEO add complementary capacity and increase resiliency, with opportunities to build numerous smaller satellites and supply satellite components over time with more regular technology refreshes. Regardless of the approach, such an architecture is a significant, long-term resource investment. At this point, it is important not to foreclose options, but policymakers, program officers, and political leaders must make decisions on requirements in short order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this backdrop, the authors offer a few ways to think about cooperation going forward. Building and operating a space-based missile detection and tracking architecture is new for the MOD and SDF, their acquisition organizations, and the industrial base. Phased approaches that enable Japan to better learn the military mission and new target set (e.g., HGVs) to inform its overall requirements and to build technical and operational proficiency over time came up repeatedly in workshops and discussions led by the authors. It was also argued that, of all space mission areas for U.S. industry to heavily engage in, missile detection and tracking is particularly symbiotic. It is one of the few technology areas that Japan’s industrial base has not yet developed, and it cannot be acquired through commercial services. Further, it is an area in which the United States is planning to field hundreds of satellites in a global constellation and is a natural extension of the already close missile defense relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A partnership between the MOD and the U.S. Space Development Agency centered on the tracking and transport capabilities of the PWSA LEO architecture offers an attractive pathway for such phased collaboration and contributes to greater overall resiliency. With its planned architecture of smaller, less expensive satellites numbering in the hundreds, PWSA provides an incremental approach for Japan to learn the mission and to scale its small- to mid-sized satellite development and production (building “reps and sets”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described herein are several recommendations specific to missile detection and tracking cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the near term, a PWSA ground station could be deployed in Japan and PWSA data shared with Japan. Building off the current early warning data-sharing model, this would allow both Japanese and U.S. users to gain familiarity with PWSA tracking data; build experience processing, analyzing, and fusing it with other missile early warning data; and provide feedback on the data quality, latency, and connectivity needed to support decisionmaking and missile defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the near term, a joint technology and production demonstration program could be pursued for missile detection and tracking and transport layer satellites. This would give both industrial bases opportunities to explore different partnering arrangements while also building Japanese industrial capacity. For example, Japanese optical communications payloads could be integrated into transport satellites, and coproduction or licensed production arrangements could be explored for both transport and tracking layer satellites. Both constructs could fit within the Space Development Agency’s “future capabilities initiative,” in which incremental improvements can be on-ramped into future tranches of PWSA capability. Japanese optical communications payloads should be interoperable by design with PWSA optical communications, which are open source.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Such a joint technology development program could also include a coordinated test campaign and sharing of test data, especially involving performance against HGVs. Japan could participate in U.S. PWSA testing activities and, likewise, the United States could take part in Japan’s testing scheme as it flies its own military infrared (IR) payload demonstration on a future HTV-X mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the mid to long term, Japan could scale up its domestic industrial capacity and technical proficiency to build a sovereign operational constellation that is informed by a clearer understanding of mission needs and is complementary to and interoperable with the U.S. PWSA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If timely fielding of an operational capability is the driving need, Japan could lean heavily on U.S. industry early on, taking advantage of active satellite production lines and minimizing time for design and development. As Japan builds experiential knowledge and domestic production capacity, this dependency would wane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Japan decides to pursue a GEO architecture, industry options such as a Japanese satellite bus paired with a Japanese or U.S. OPIR payload could be examined. For example, Japan has funded plans to fly a military IR payload demonstration on a future HTV-X launch that could be a candidate. While the payload is likely to be highly capable, U.S. experience shows that such new design and development efforts are complex, costly, and take time. While satellite interoperability between U.S. and Japanese systems will be harder with two different designs, opportunities for fusing data in ground stations from GEO and LEO systems could be explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be emphasized that partnerships beyond satellite constellations are important in this mission area. For missile detection and tracking — a mission that must operate on militarily relevant timelines — the ground architecture, data processing and analysis, and connectivity to missile defense systems can oftentimes be more challenging than satellite development and will demand equal attention. There is just as much opportunity to forge industry partnerships in ground station processing, advanced analytics, battle management, and command and control functions as there is in satellite development and production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is just as much opportunity to forge industry partnerships in ground station processing, advanced analytics, battle management, and command and control functions as there is in satellite development and production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, RECONNAISSANCE, AND TARGETING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SSI describes the need to “advance target detection and tracking capabilities” for Japan’s standoff defense capability and maritime domain awareness. This includes better understanding the surrounding terrestrial, maritime, and air operational environments, building an intelligence picture of threats, and providing indications that the threat has changed. Further, Tokyo’s standoff counterstrike systems will require real-time targeting information provided by intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various Japanese representatives shared that the government plans to invest in a constellation of dozens of electro-optical (EO) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites that would provide ISRT capabilities in day, night, and all-weather conditions. These systems would also play a role in detecting and tracking missiles prior to launch, such as tracking adversary mobile missile movements in and out of garrison, mapping missile-related facilities, and building patterns of activity among missile units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of ISRT, Japan has a strong sovereign foundation on which to build. The Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center, working with Japanese heavy industry, has built and operated EO and SAR satellites as part of its IGS constellation for over two decades, with plans to further expand the constellation. Japan’s domestic commercial remote sensing industry is emerging, with both mainstays and start-ups building commercial imagery satellites, especially in SAR, and aiming to sell data products as a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese industry and the Japanese government have a strong pedigree in this mission area. They also have a long history of working closely with U.S. intelligence agencies and U.S. space companies providing commercial imagery. Therefore, cooperation efforts should focus on adding capacity and resiliency to the alliance, engaging in ISRT data sharing, building greater analytic and multi-intelligence insights, and gearing the overall architecture toward supporting military requirements and delivering actionable information on operationally relevant timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors identified key partnership areas across ISRT, which are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both countries see benefits in the greater adoption of commercial satellite data and analytic services to support traditional military missions as well as to enhance maritime domain awareness, support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, and track global trends and environmental changes. The MOD is likely to increase its FY 2025 budget for the acquisition of commercial imagery, and the U.S. Space Force has begun leveraging commercial data sources. This is an important trend to continue, not just to support national security priorities and decisionmaking but also to strengthen the global competitiveness of both countries’ commercial space sectors, which are facing increasing competition from Chinese competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although Japanese industry has experience building EO and SAR satellites, a demand for scale and the timely fielding of systems will necessitate partnerships that abide by Tokyo’s “security and industrialization” policy while also leveraging U.S. industrial scale and systems integration expertise. Such partnering arrangements could include coproduction and license production agreements between U.S. and Japanese space companies and the acquisition of commercial EO and SAR data or dedicated access to commercial satellite constellations. In the longer term, Japan could scale up its domestic industrial capacity to sustain this constellation on its own. In order to better collaborate, U.S. firms — and the U.S. government — would benefit from a greater understanding about Japan’s general architecture envisioned for an ISRT constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ISRT is another mission area in which collaboration will need to be fostered beyond satellites, with a commensurate focus on ground systems, data processing, and analysis, as well as interoperability across those ground systems. This includes developing a ground architecture and processes for tasking, collecting, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data from the EO/SAR constellation. Further, the volume of data from a large ISRT constellation will be immense; there will not be enough human analysts in Japan or the United States to scrutinize each image for military intelligence value. Partnerships that emphasize data processing, automation, and the development of advanced analytic tools, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, can be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable one of its priority mission areas, counterstrike, the JASDF recognizes that it will need to improve proficiency in military intelligence analysis and target development, such as the targeting of “vessels and landing forces.” The Bilateral Intelligence Analysis Cell, established in November 2022, aims to do just that, with Japanese and U.S. analysts at Yokota Air Base jointly analyzing video feeds from remotely piloted aircraft. It could be expanded to incorporate space-based remote sensing data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors were encouraged to explore ways that data sharing between CSICE and the MOD and SDF could be increased, as Japan’s defense and intelligence institutions remain highly stovepiped. The authors note that this remains a perennial challenge within the United States as well — how to ensure that the intelligence community supports both national decisionmakers and warfighters. The private sector can be a pathway for breaking down stovepipes. One additional area of collaboration across U.S. and Japanese companies could be demonstrating the fusion of multiple sources of information — not just EO and SAR, but also radiofrequency signals collection, hyperspectral imagery, and open-source intelligence. Industry, and particularly start-ups, are not beholden to the same stovepipes that governments are. They may be able to make greater progress on demonstrating the higher-value intelligence insights gained from multi-intelligence concepts of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPACE DOMAIN AWARENESS AND COUNTERSPACE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries have advanced capabilities in tracking and monitoring space objects and debris. They are increasing their SDA investments as threats to space capabilities grow and the domain becomes more congested. SDA is already an area of active partnerships across both governments and industries. As described earlier, a 2020 agreement between the U.S. Space Force and Japan’s Office of National Space Policy led to two U.S. SDA payloads being hosted on Japan’s QZSS satellites (which have not yet launched). Industry partnerships are also being cemented, such as the agreement Northrop Grumman and IHI Aerospace struck in March 2023 to build small maneuverable satellites and other capabilities to enhance SDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier section of this analysis described opportunities to enhance data sharing to improve the accuracy and coverage of space object tracking, reducing the risk of collisions and enhancing overall space traffic management. Described here are areas of cooperation centered on SDA capabilities and infrastructure and joint initiatives focused on debris mitigation and removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unlike the United States, Japan is not bound to decades-old space object tracking systems and catalog systems. Japan has an opportunity to take a clean-sheet approach to building a common operating picture of the space domain by leapfrogging ahead: leveraging state-of-the-art commercial technology and fusing space surveillance data from both the Japanese and U.S. government and commercial sources, including data from JAXA ground optical telescopes and radars and commercial data (e.g., LeoLabs, Slingshot, and COMSPOC). Further, such a capability could support government and commercial satellite operators alike, providing detections of close approaches by other satellites, building patterns of activity by unusual or unfriendly objects in space, and analyzing the risk of satellite collisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other hosted payload concepts in addition to the USSF SDA-QZSS partnership could be explored. Beyond the IHI-Northrop Grumman partnership to develop a joint SDA capability, other Japanese and U.S. companies are studying concepts that would integrate SDA payloads onto next-generation SATCOM systems and provide them to governments as a service. The recent announcement that the QZSS constellation will expand to 11 satellites provides an opportunity for further hosted SDA payloads.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both countries could also consider coordinated operations between their SDA satellites — including Japan’s SDA satellites, the first of which is planned for launch in 2026 — and U.S. Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites. Such coordinated operations would aid in training, add capacity, and reduce the duplication of target coverage. Japanese scholars raised the idea of SDA satellites and U.S. GSSAP satellites “operating in coordination,” particularly once Japan’s second SDA satellite is fielded, as it is anticipated to have increased “mobility and imaging capability.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan is a leader in developing technologies for debris removal, including active debris removal with technologies such as laser ablation, while the United States has extensive experience in space operations. Joint demonstrations and missions could validate active debris removal technologies while also advancing new operational concepts for debris mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both governments should also explore options to cooperate on space protection and build a baseline understanding of how each side views counterspace capabilities, although the topic and any capabilities will be highly sensitive. The JSOG possesses equipment to detect satellite jamming that will be useful for government and commercial operators alike as electronic attack weapons become more proliferated. Japan’s NDS also lays the groundwork for the development of capabilities “necessary to disrupt or neutralize the opponent’s use of space.” For example, as part of efforts to secure its use of the electromagnetic spectrum, Tokyo allocated funds in its FY 2024 budget for communication and radar jamming capabilities. While further counterspace activities are likely to be highly classified by each country — and have long been treated as such in the United States — a general discussion on basic concepts, capabilities, and scenarios would be helpful to understand how each side thinks about the mission area and, importantly, to avoid miscalculations. The recent U.S. DOD push to lower classification barriers for certain space capabilities, along with Japan’s membership in Combined Space Operations, provides an opening to overcome foreign disclosure barriers to sharing information with Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PROTECTED SATCOM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilient satellite communications are also an area of emphasis in both countries. The United States has long operated a range of military SATCOM systems, complemented by commercial GEO, and is increasingly leveraging LEO broadband networks, with Starlink being the most prominent. Japan also has a long pedigree in satellite communications, leveraging Sky Perfect JSAT to develop and operate a network of GEO satellites for military use. Japan’s SSI outlines plans for a multilayered and redundant SATCOM network across GEO and LEO orbits, with government and commercial systems meeting growing demands for connectivity across Japanese forces and weapons systems. While SATCOM cooperation between Japan and the United States is already underway and Japan has established a line of effort dedicated to commercial LEO broadband, government officials have expressed particular interest in partnering on protected SATCOM that can provide secure anti-jamming and anti-spoofing connectivity, especially as adversaries increasingly employ electronic warfare systems and tactics. On the Japanese side, its Joint Staff C4 Systems Department (J6) is leading protected SATCOM investment efforts, while on the U.S. side, the Space Force’s Space Systems Command (SSC) is leading the acquisition of protected tactical SATCOM capabilities across satellites, ground infrastructure, modems, and user terminals. Partnerships in the area of protected SATCOM could be explored in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Notably, as part of the U.S. SSC protected tactical SATCOM program, SSC is funding a project to deliver protected tactical waveforms over commercial and international GEO and MEO commercial satellite constellations used by the U.S. military and coalition forces. This is an area in which Japanese SATCOM operators could be a partner to SSC in providing platforms for the maturation of this capability. Japan would then be in a prime position to scale this across its fleet of SATCOM assets used for security purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Japan refines its acquisition approach for a protected SATCOM system, one model to consider is the approach recently taken by Australia to develop a sovereign military SATCOM capability. The government of Australia required bidding teams to comprise a prime contractor with extensive military SATCOM experience and several Australian businesses. Such an approach could even lead to greater interoperability across U.S., Japanese, and Australian SATCOM systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As Japan fields SATCOM capabilities with optical communications payloads, opportunities exist for cross linking between communications networks, especially if both sides can align on common optical interface standards. Japanese government and industry representatives expressed particular interest in connectivity between Japanese space assets and the PWSA transport layer, creating even greater resiliency and multipath options for data delivery to users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investing-in-digital-transformation&quot;&gt;Investing in Digital Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is essential to maintaining a battlefield edge, creating greater mission effectiveness through data accessibility and connectivity across users and resilience and security in the face of threats to IT infrastructure and communications networks. The U.S. Department of Defense is implementing a cloud strategy and making investments in capabilities such as the Air Force and Space Force’s Cloud One. The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) has long invested in a cloud-based architecture known as the IC Cloud that enables users to log into a desktop from any IC location and access mission-related information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar digital transformation is underway in Japan, with senior leaders discussing how a government cloud network can enable information collaboration, crisis response, and increased operational efficiencies across the government. Tokyo is attuned to the importance of digital resilience and continuity of operations, having experienced natural disasters affecting critical infrastructure such as the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant and seeing Russian cyberattacks against Ukrainian satellite and ground networks. With regard to the latter, Ukraine’s successful migration of government and banking data to a cloud storage system in the initial days of Russia’s invasion proved crucial to the continuity of Ukrainian government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, national security leaders in both countries recognize that the private sector leads in cloud storage, computing, and security, and they benefit by adopting these commercial services. Neither government can match the scale, speed, performance, and agility of commercial technology companies or their investment in digital infrastructure. These companies invest billions of dollars per year in cybersecurity alone, continuously improving their networks and cloud infrastructure while under constant cyberattack. Microsoft, for example, cites 1.5 million attempts a day to compromise its systems and invests roughly $1 billion annually in cloud security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Neither government can match the scale, speed, performance, and agility of commercial technology companies or their investment in digital infrastructure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral space agenda would be well served by including a digital transformation and cybersecurity component: an area that is not exclusive to space but would enable the sharing of sensitive mission data and operational information. Japanese partnerships with U.S. digital infrastructure companies could be particularly valuable, with companies such as Amazon Web Services planning to invest ¥2.26 trillion ($15.4 billion) to expand its Japanese cloud infrastructure by 2027 and Microsoft investing $2.9 billion in Japan on AI and cloud infrastructure, workforce training, and a research lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging these investments, the MOD and the JSOG could identify their expanding space architecture, including space operations, command and control (C2), and space domain awareness data, as early candidates for migration to the cloud. This interest was conveyed to the authors in conversations with Japanese space operators who recognize the benefits of cloud for greater connectivity, data management, and network security. U.S. officials emphasized that information security is essential to expanding data sharing given the sensitivity of space technology, operations, and increasing cyber threats to satellite networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compatible digital infrastructures with common interface standards would provide the technical foundation to facilitate greater connectivity and data exchanges between U.S. and Japanese networks. Working from similar digital infrastructures creates more direct opportunities to share cybersecurity best practices and also creates a more accessible and fulsome data environment for both countries to exploit using AI tools and other innovative applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD is also modernizing the information-sharing networks it uses for international partners to securely access, process, and analyze sensitive mission data and to deliver insights to users. For example, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) is accelerating the development of the INDOPACOM Mission Network, which is built off of the DOD’s larger Mission Partner Environment program to share information and enable a common operating picture with allies and partners. Another U.S. information sharing system, the Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System program, provides connectivity for sharing military intelligence information. Not only should the DOD be encouraged to leverage commercial solutions, taking advantage of the benefits described earlier, but also to expand access points within the MOD and the JASDF, including the JSOG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leading-on-policy-and-in-international-forums&quot;&gt;Leading on Policy and in International Forums&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability has long been a theme in Japanese society and policy. Tokyo is well positioned to continue extending this theme into space as a leading voice on enhancing the sustainability of space. Both Japan and the United States, through complementary and coordinated efforts in regional and international forums, can provide strong thought leadership and advance diplomatic initiatives on space sustainability, developing responsible behaviors in space and reducing threats to the peaceful uses of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s actions bolster its standing in these areas. It has designated sustainability and resource management as clear priorities for space development. New space companies, such as Astroscale, have crafted business models around the removal of on-orbit debris and the disposal of spacecraft reaching their end of life. Others are developing remote sensing satellites to monitor climate change as well as the security environment. Tokyo is becoming a destination for important space symposia, including on the topic of space sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomatically, Japan is increasingly exercising its voice on space security and sustainability issues. In April 2024, it joined with the United States to introduce a United Nations Security Council Resolution on Preventing Nuclear Weapons in Space, calling on nations to uphold their obligations under the Outer Space Treaty. This resolution was drafted in response to news that Russia may be developing a satellite with a nuclear device that would be indiscriminate in its destruction of satellites in orbit. In September 2022, Tokyo pledged not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent ASAT missile testing, working with the United States and other nations to promote international discussions on responsible behaviors in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should be seen as a regional leader on space security issues and as a partner of choice for countries in the region. In 2021, as part of the Quad, Australia, India, Japan, and the United States established a space working group to share space-based Earth observation data with one another and with other countries in the Indo-Pacific to build a collective understanding of climate change risks and support the sustainable use of oceans and marine resources. In 2023, Japan, South Korea, and the United States held a trilateral dialogue on space security focused on threats in the space domain, the responsible use of space, and national space strategies. Building off of Japan’s close bilateral defense partnerships with Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS), during Prime Minister Kishida’s official visit to Washington, D.C., in April 2024, it was announced that AUKUS partners “are considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also well situated to engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Several member countries see Japan as the most trusted major power in the region, China as a strategic partner, and the United States as often focused on pressuring countries to pick sides (the United States vs. China). Many of these nations seek to grow their nascent space programs and benefit from the use of space in areas such as Earth observation for maritime domain awareness and natural resource management. They also have a vested interest in preserving the safe, secure, and sustainable use of space. Working with Japan, they can add an important perspective to international discussions on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-persistent-challenges&quot;&gt;Addressing Persistent Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While opportunities abound for cooperation that can deliver material capabilities in support of national policy and security strategies, policymakers will still need to knock down barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;priorities-and-time-urgency&quot;&gt;Priorities and Time Urgency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be important for leaders from Japan and the United States to set clear priorities for their space partnership, harnessing each other’s strengths and building interoperable systems to add needed capacity and resiliency for both countries in a timely manner. While both countries have ambitious space architecture plans and have increased resources for space security development and utilization in the past few years, those resources will need to be prioritized and efficiently allocated. Clarity on when capabilities are needed to posture for regional threats will also be important to move their respective institutions and industries into action. Japanese defense strategy highlights the need to take primary responsibility for dealing with invasions by FY 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing and building satellites and their ground stations is a multiyear, resource-intensive effort. The timelines for when certain space capabilities are needed to keep pace with the threat will factor heavily into which architectural solutions are pursued and the phasing of those solutions. Fielding a capability in the near term will necessitate a reliance on more mature technologies and existing commercial services where spigots can be turned on. However, investments in longer-term research and development (R&amp;amp;D) efforts are necessary to ensure next-generation capabilities keep apace of the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-demand-signal&quot;&gt;Government Demand Signal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the opportunities for industrial partnerships that present themselves, both U.S. and Japanese industry would benefit from stronger signals and top cover from both governments when attempting to partner to support priority bilateral projects. Much of their reasoning ties to risk and technology export limitations. Several industry representatives conveyed that their companies limit substantial investments in satellite design, R&amp;amp;D, and facilitation unless they have high confidence in a market and customers. Thus, to encourage and support industry collaboration, both governments must create a demand signal and market for such cooperative endeavors, including for interoperability and integration across systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not currently a government-to-government agreement for industry collaboration on space, although other mission areas have examples that the space relationship may be able to build on. Integrated Air and Missile Defense is one such example. In Integrated Air and Missile Defense, an agreement covers the U.S.-Japan missile defense relationship and provides guidance on cooperation, including information sharing and the codevelopment/coproduction of specific systems, among other items. Frameworks like this help make possible industry collaboration, such as the March 2024 agreement between the Missile Defense Agency and Japan’s MOD to codevelop a hypersonic missile defense capability. A similar agreement in space could guide industry prioritization of particular architectures, cooperation models, and information-sharing exchanges. The U.S. DOD and the MOD have a bilateral memorandum of understanding for research, development, test, and evaluation projects, an agreement that commits the nations to increasing opportunities for bilateral collaboration on defense-related emerging technologies. Although space is not mentioned as part of this agreement, this may be an initial avenue to explore space technologies that support defense capabilities such as missile defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there should be follow-through on publicly announced cooperation agreements. During the April 2024 state visit, the United States and Japan announced the negotiation of a Technology Safeguards Agreement (TSA). A TSA would provide a framework for U.S. commercial space launch from Japan and opens further opportunities for space-related technology collaboration within industry. Accelerating the completion of negotiations on this TSA will show that both governments have the momentum to follow through with action on high-level talking points that will impact industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-sharing-policy&quot;&gt;Data Sharing Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the U.S. side, there is no comprehensive data exchange framework that provides guidance on the technologies, capabilities, and mission knowledge that U.S. industry can share with their Japanese counterparts. Some U.S. government officials express frustration that such a framework may take years to develop, negotiate, and coordinate through administrative processes. Notably, many areas of current U.S.-Japan cooperation take place through idiosyncratic processes and bespoke agreements, not overarching frameworks. Therefore, the speediest way to enable cooperative efforts, such as missile detection and tracking data exchanges, is through a standalone bespoke agreement negotiated at the senior White House, DOD policy, and State Department levels with their Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The areas of cooperation being proposed — such as missile detection and tracking, SDA, and ISRT — involve sensitive technology, capabilities, and mission knowledge that largely fall under U.S. security classification controls, from controlled unclassified information up to higher classification levels. Thus, technical exchanges between U.S. and Japanese companies to explore specific partnership arrangements across satellite development, manufacturing, and architecture interoperability would be limited absent U.S. government clarity on technology transfer and data sharing. Such direction has been provided for other defense cooperation areas such as SM-3 missiles and Blackhawk helicopters, and both parties have instituted processes and practices to protect sensitive information. A similar approach could be adopted for space security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly significant challenge is the difference in cultures of security between the United States and Japan. This includes personnel, information, facility, and cybersecurity, among other areas of difference. The U.S. public and private sectors involved in national security have long-established policies and processes in place and a culture built around protecting sensitive information and advanced capabilities. Security clearances require an intensive look into the backgrounds of personnel employed in the national security ecosystem. However, in Japan security is established more on a case-by-case basis, looking at particular aspects of security for projects and evaluating specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now clear recognition across Japan’s government, industry, and academic community that security — cybersecurity, information security, personnel security, and facility security — is paramount to further U.S. space cooperation. Implementing security improvements, including recent steps by the Japanese government to institute private sector security clearances and extend classification protections to economic security information, are encouraging and should serve as foundations for getting closer to functional equivalency across several of these security areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. security experts across government and the private sector could offer training and share best practices. For example, in 2023, Japan’s MOD Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency developed its first Defense Industrial Security Manual, with advisers from the U.S. Defense Technology Security Administration and the U.S. Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an acute awareness across the Japanese government and industry of their cyber vulnerabilities. Greater sharing of cyber threats and cyber best practices is the most immediate way to improve Japan’s network and cybersecurity. Partnerships with U.S. technology companies, especially in cloud security and cybersecurity, could also be particularly valuable in providing network resiliency and ensuring government continuity of operations. This would also benefit operational space elements, such as the JSOG, to inform their efforts to protect against cyber threats to their networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;export-policies&quot;&gt;Export Policies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries’ export policies and regulations have been barriers to closer space cooperation and industry-to-industry partnerships. U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the U.S. interpretation of its commitments under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) hamper bilateral industry cooperation, with both U.S. and Japanese companies that have been encouraged to forge joint space acquisition partnerships citing ITAR and classification as issues. In December 2023, Tokyo revised its principles on the transfer of defense equipment and technology, which is expected to enable the greater export of military technologies and components. While a positive development that can further contribute to supply chain diversification and the defense of like-minded partners that are increasingly under threat, the impact of this policy shift for space-related technology exports is unclear. This policy revision demonstrates a significant shift in Japanese defense policy writ large, as well as a political motivation to support such shifts in a range of policy and strategy documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;counterparts-and-interagency-communications&quot;&gt;Counterparts and Interagency Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a consistent message from government and industry representatives in both countries is that they often do not know who to talk to on the other side. Observing the U.S. space ecosystem, there are so many points of contact that it is hard to know even what organizations Japanese interlocutors should engage with. As noted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in a 2016 report, there are “approximately 60 stakeholder organizations” across U.S. national security space. Observing the Japanese space ecosystem, responsibility for space security capabilities is spread out across the government. For example, QZSS is with the Cabinet Office, missile detection and tracking with the MOD internal bureaus, SDA with the JASDF, SATCOM with Joint Staff J6, and ISRT with Japan Defense Intelligence Headquarters. Further, Japan’s defense and intelligence institutions remain highly stovepiped. Both sides have found the annual comprehensive space dialogue to be highly valuable in bringing together the countries’ space leaders and identifying counterparts, as well as facilitating interagency dialogues within each country. Opportunities to sustain these bilateral and interagency interactions beyond the senior leader dialogue were encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captured here is a summary of the recommendations for space security cooperation described throughout the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating human development:&lt;/strong&gt; Education and training is foundational to build greater space proficiency across Japan’s defense institutions and supporting industry. Partnerships between the MOD and JASDF and U.S. space institutions across government and academia could include enrollments in U.S. Space 100/200 and Defense Acquisition University courses. Partnerships with new space and technology start-up communities can expand the pipeline of “human resource” talent needed in both Japan’s and the United States’ space ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercising and training the Space Force and joint force:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should develop a greater understanding of how space capabilities contribute to the joint force, including terrestrial and maritime operations, by integrating a space component into bilateral and multilateral joint exercises and into routine service-specific and joint training. Within the military space community, participation in tabletop exercises and wargames, including multilateral space operations scenarios, as well as greater hands-on operational training, aid in understanding space threats, space operations, and decisionmaking processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing data and information:&lt;/strong&gt; Sharing space and cyber threat assessments is a logical start, especially with the increasing availability of both classified and unclassified threat assessments from the U.S. government, U.S. industry, and academia. Further, SDA data sharing can be enhanced, including the sharing of data from U.S. payloads hosted on Japanese QZSS satellites. SDA information sharing is also an area to expand trilaterally, building on the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral information exchange model used for data sharing on North Korean missile launches. Updating U.S. policy permissions for data sharing and accelerating implementation of the U.S. DOD’s revised space classification guidance can quicken results and build momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasizing complementary industrial base strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; In formulating partnerships, the United States and Japan should consider the unique and complementary strengths of each nation’s industrial base and not limit the partnerships to the space domain. For example, while U.S. industry is strong in the systems integration of military satellite constellations, ground architectures, and scaled-up satellite manufacturing capacity, Japanese industry is a global leader in satellite components, robotics, advanced manufacturing, and shipbuilding and repair. Both nations should look to each other as they seek to increase supply chain resiliency and seek investors to boost their space start-up ecosystems to achieve broader alliance objectives vis-à-vis space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Architecting national security space constellations:&lt;/strong&gt; Both countries set out national security space architectures that are ambitious, resource-intensive endeavors, with partnerships being a core tenet of each country’s approach. The areas of missile detection and tracking, ISRT, SDA, and SATCOM stand out because of the urgency to have sufficient defensive capabilities deployed by FY 2027 as described in Japan’s strategy documents.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile detection and tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; Updating U.S. policy permissions for data sharing and accelerating implementation of revised space classification guidance can quicken results and build momentum. A partnership between the MOD and the U.S. Space Development Agency centered on the tracking and transport capabilities of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture offers an attractive pathway for such phased collaboration and contributes to greater overall capability and resiliency. PWSA ground station deployment in Japan and data sharing, a joint technology and production demonstration program, the exchange of best practices on modular design and tranche-based acquisition and launch, and ground architecture partnerships offer ways to build collective industrial base capacity and overall mission proficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should focus cooperation efforts on adding capacity and resiliency, building greater analytic and multi-intelligence insights, and gearing the overall ISRT architecture toward delivering actionable information on operationally relevant timelines. Another area to explore includes coproduction/license production agreements between U.S. and Japanese space companies and greater access to EO and SAR commercial data and analytic services.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space domain awareness and counterspace:&lt;/strong&gt; In contrast to the U.S. challenge of modernizing legacy space traffic management and catalog systems, Japan has an opportunity to take a clean sheet approach to building a common operating picture of the space domain by leapfrogging ahead: leveraging state-of-the-art commercial technology and fusing space surveillance data from both the Japanese and the U.S. governments and commercial sources. The partners should also explore other hosted payload concepts beyond the USSF SDA-QZSS, consider coordinated operations between their SDA satellites, and explore options to cooperate on space protection. The United States and Japan should further leverage U.S. efforts to reform space program classification to hold in-depth discussions about counterspace concepts of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protected SATCOM:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should be an early international partner in the U.S. SSC project to develop protected tactical waveforms over commercial and international communications satellites. Additionally, discussions on optical interface standards can inform Japan’s development of optical communications payloads, and the latter should grow the opportunities for cross linking between communications networks, creating greater resiliency and multipath options for data delivery to users.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in digital transformation and cybersecurity:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and Japan should include a digital transformation and cybersecurity component to the bilateral space agenda and encourage the MOD and the JSOG to designate their expanding space architecture, including space operations, C2, and SDA data, as an early candidate for migration to the cloud. This would also facilitate the greater sharing of sensitive mission data and operational information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading on policy and in international forums:&lt;/strong&gt; Both Japan and the United States, through complementary and coordinated efforts in regional and international forums, can provide strong thought leadership and advance diplomatic initiatives on space sustainability, developing responsible behaviors in space and reducing threats to the peaceful uses of space. Japan should be seen as a regional leader on space security issues and as a partner of choice — along with the United States — for countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persistent challenges that can serve as barriers or limitations to such cooperative efforts will also need to be addressed in key areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priorities and time urgency:&lt;/strong&gt; It will be important for leaders from both countries to set clear priorities for the space partnership, harnessing each other’s strengths and building interoperable systems to add needed capacity and resiliency in a timely manner. Clarity on when capabilities are needed to posture for regional threats will also be important to move their respective institutions and industries into action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government demand signal:&lt;/strong&gt; Both governments must provide clear signaling and direction to industry on specific areas of cooperation and assurance that barriers to cooperation will be addressed, particularly for large-scale bilateral projects on key mission areas like MW/MT and ISRT. Companies will limit investments in substantial satellite design, R&amp;amp;D, and facilitation, unless they have high confidence in a market and customers and that technology-sharing limitations will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data sharing policy:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States lacks a comprehensive data exchange framework that provides guidance on the technologies, capabilities, and mission knowledge that U.S. industry can share with its Japanese counterparts. The speediest way to enable cooperative efforts, such as missile detection and tracking data exchanges, is through a stand-alone agreement developed at senior government levels. This authority must operate on a tactically relevant timeline and not be hamstrung by legal reviews concerning the ownership of operational data, binding and nonbinding agreements, and other prosaic details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing policies and processes to protect sensitive information and advanced technologies, and inculcating them into organizational cultures, is paramount to further U.S. space cooperation. The security imperative encompasses personnel, information, facilities, and cybersecurity, among other areas, and is ripe for U.S. security experts to engage in training and share best practices across government and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export policies:&lt;/strong&gt; Both countries’ export policies and regulations have been barriers to closer space cooperation and industry-to-industry partnerships. U.S. ITAR and interpretation of its MTCR commitments hamper bilateral industry cooperation, with both U.S. and Japanese companies that have been encouraged to forge joint space acquisition partnerships citing ITAR and classification as issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counterparts and interagency communications:&lt;/strong&gt; A consistent message from government and industry representatives in both countries is that they often do not know who to talk to on the other side. Both sides have found the annual comprehensive space dialogue to be highly valuable in bringing together both countries’ space leaders and identifying counterparts, as well as facilitating interagency dialogues within each country. Opportunities to sustain these bilateral and interagency interactions beyond the senior leader dialogue were encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For the sake of national security, we will dramatically scale up the use of space systems and ensure the safe and stable utilization of the domain.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-japanese-prime-minister-kishida-fumio-june-2023&quot;&gt;– Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio, June 2023&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is increasingly emphasized in the defense strategies of countries around the world — from global space powers such as the United States, China, and Russia to evolving space leaders such as Japan and France. Aggressive behavior from China and North Korea and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have caused a shift in the way the Japanese government perceives defensive capabilities and the role space will play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s new security emphasis in the space domain is significant, and its recent policies suggest greater Japanese activity in space security in the next five to ten years, spanning from homegrown technology and capability development to expanding international partnerships. Tokyo has an acute awareness of the economic benefits of space and space technology, but developing those capabilities and expanding industrial capacity will likely be a challenge, given the urgency of the need to field operational capabilities in the near to mid term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Japan continues to strengthen its space capabilities, its immediate focus continues to be on its space launch sector. Notable milestones will be the success of the H3 and Epsilon S rockets, which aim to cement Japan’s leadership role in space launch, provide a competitive regional alternative to Chinese and Indian launch services, and — in the case of the H3 rocket — play a critical role in the Lunar Gateway program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Japan’s traditional heavy industry developing launch vehicles, new entrants are exploring robotics, on-orbit servicing, and remote sensing solutions that may further transform Japan’s space industry and keep it at the leading edge in certain space technology areas. Sustainability and resource management are two key pillars of Japanese society and policy and are priority areas for space development. Japanese companies are well positioned to develop space solutions to better understand the impacts of climate change and to remove on-orbit space debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tokyo will continue to seek ways to indigenously advance technology and bolster its domestic industrial base. This is to be expected, but it will also be challenging given the urgency of the security environment and the slow pace of development that has defined other areas of Japanese industry. Traditional Japanese space entities, such as JAXA and heavy industry, are expanding their scope from a smaller set of primarily scientific space systems supporting long-term civil missions to larger constellations with a defense and security mission focus. The MOD and SDF must develop new technical and operational expertise in space security to support these new and diversified activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan will actively expand the role of space capabilities in its security posture going forward. As emphasized in its national defense documents, launch, missile warning, SDA, information gathering, communications, and navigation are all space mission areas with growing defense and national security significance. The establishment of the Space Operations Group also signals a more active role by the SDF in Japan’s space enterprise and the continued integration of space capabilities into national security missions. However, while Tokyo is increasing its focus on space and increasing its space spending, its ambitions — especially in the build-out of its space architecture for national security — still surpass its budget. It will be crucial for Japanese policymakers to ensure that Japan’s investments into national security space are providing interoperable and secure capabilities that complement the alliance’s ability to achieve its objectives in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan intends to become an increasingly important voice on space in international forums, such as on the threats to the peaceful use of space and responsible behaviors in space, including sustainable use. Tokyo will also continue to be vocal in advocating for stronger and more resilient norms for the use of the space domain to counter adversary threats to the safety of the domain for all users globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Japanese alignment with the United States on regional threats, the growing role of space in national security, and Japan’s increased focus on security opens up greater cooperation opportunities beyond traditional civil space cooperation. However, this security focus will continue to come into tension with Japanese processes and cultural norms, and the two countries will need to continue to break down barriers to cooperation, such as aligning on security and technology protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both nations’ governments and industries alike have a multitude of space cooperation opportunities before them that will individually and collectively strengthen their overall national and economic security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團　引述李家田供稱遭警暴　賴振邦沒作供故沒相關證供&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周四（22日）在高等法院踏入第78天審訊，法官張慧玲第5天總結供詞及引導陪審團。就案中唯一作供被告李家田的證供，法官總結指，李供稱被警方上門拘捕時，遭拳打腳踢及多次用水刑，又被威嚇會對其母親不利，稱自己在警方的引導下作出招認。而拘捕警員則於庭上否認李遭受警暴。法官另覆述被告賴振邦的案情，提到辯方曾指警員嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，而警員於庭上否認。法官指，但由於賴選擇不作供，故本案沒有相關證供，陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪受審，僅女被告劉佩凝獲准保釋。（繪圖：Kensahung）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李家田供稱受襲用刑警否認&quot;&gt;官：李家田供稱受襲、用刑　警否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周三指，陪審團若不信納被告李家田的證供，認為他不只在旁觀察，更有份參與「屠龍」行動，涉暴動、縱火等罪行，但此為本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。官強調，有關行動僅可作背景參考，須考慮控方能否令陪審團肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及曾管有手槍和彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周四續總結李的證供，覆述李供稱在警員上門時遭襲擊及施行水刑，指警員將配槍子彈取出，放在李的手心磨擦，自己在威逼利誘下作出招認。而有份拘捕李的警員作供時，則否認曾暴力對待李，又稱自見到李直至帶他到警署，一直與他在一起，沒有看到有人不當對待李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李稱選擇作供因信法庭畀到公義&quot;&gt;官：李稱選擇作供因信法庭「畀到公義」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官總結指，據李的說法，當警員入屋後，曾帶李家田入廁所，而警署警長馮保羅稱：「我宜家畀機會你，黃振強已經篤到你應一應，你肯講嘅話，我就淨係告你支槍，如果唔係你就好大鑊」；李回應「冇」，隨後被警方施行水刑，又一度被打腹部。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警員又威嚇「同樣嘅情況都可以發生喺你阿媽身上」，李遂表示「支槍唔喺我度，喺鴻仔度。」李又指母親為菲律賓人，不諳粵語，而且自警方入屋後已再沒有見到同住的母親，他亦相當擔心母親的狀況，所以作出招認。隨後警方向他展示一些涉案人物的相片及向他介紹名字，著他記住，但他在錄影會面中則沒有完整覆述這些名字，只提到「強」及「乸乸地」的人等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而李在作供時亦仔細講述了他在錄影會面中，甚麼內容屬實，又有哪一部分是虛構，應警方所需而作出的招認。例如李在會面中供稱曾把手槍保管在綠色袋中，李稱屬虛構。而李在非自願的情況下提供手機密碼。此外，李亦供稱一直相當害怕，但仍選擇出庭作供，因為「法庭係會畀到一個公義我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官賴振邦沒作供沒逼飲滴露等證供&quot;&gt;官：賴振邦沒作供　沒逼「飲滴露」等證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對第五被告賴振邦的案情，辯方曾經指出當警員到「3C 工作室」上門拘捕賴時，警員曾嘗試逼賴「飲滴露」和消毒酒精，並不斷罵他為「曱甴」，而作供警員則一概不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，賴行使權利沒有作供，故本案中沒有他被逼「飲滴露」等證供，而陪審團須判斷警員的證供是否可信。而賴被捕後亦行使其權利保持緘默，陪審團不可因而對他有不利想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官應考慮賴是否涉案-tg-用戶再考慮串謀否&quot;&gt;官：應考慮賴是否涉案 TG 用戶　再考慮串謀否&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指 Telegram 用戶「接完紙鶴未？」是賴振邦，而賴又曾在訊息介紹自己是 Bobby，而認罪被告彭軍壕口中的 Bobby 是賴。辯方則否認賴是用戶「接完紙鶴未？」及 Bobby。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方曾指，賴振邦的姐夫張堅順曾稱呼賴為「阿邦」，而非 Bobby。而法官引導時則指，家人以中文名字稱呼賴，是否等於他不是 Bobby，陪審團應以常理作判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪被告彭軍壕曾與 TG 用戶「接完紙鶴未？」聯絡，而辯方指「接完紙鶴未？」是另有其人，指彭為了減刑，而剪裁證供、生安白造。法官指，陪審團應考慮賴是否用戶「接完紙鶴未？」，警方檢獲的電話是否屬於賴，再考慮他是否串謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又曾向警員指出，警署警長馮保羅曾帶隊，連同其他警員，在警署內見賴振邦，期間要求賴脫去衣物，只剩下內褲，著其在牆角踎低，有警員不斷喝罵他為「曱甴」等。而有份參與行動的警員則否認曾發生上述事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官重申，由於賴沒有出庭作供，故庭上沒有賴被施襲的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leaders are determined to prevent Taiwan’s permanent separation and eventually bring it under their control. Beijing’s growing use of its military to put pressure on Taiwan in recent years has stoked concerns that it may invade the island. Yet China has options other than invasion, one of which is a blockade designed to break the will of Taiwan’s people to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Beijing’s goal is to punish Taiwan and demonstrate its ability to exert control over the island, China could conduct a quarantine, led by law enforcement forces rather than the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine would aim to demonstrate Beijing’s power — not severely cut off trade to Taiwan. While a quarantine would pose major challenges for Taiwan, it would not be sufficient to force Taiwan to make major concessions or unify with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would be the next rung up the escalation ladder. Unlike a quarantine, a blockade would be led by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and would involve kinetic acts of war against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would aim to cripple Taiwan by cutting off trade, especially imports of energy and other material needed to sustain Taiwan’s bustling economy and population of nearly 24 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China can inflict sufficient pain on the island for long enough, it could force Taiwan to the negotiating table or help China set the conditions for a successful invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of a blockade would hinge on Taiwan’s resilience and the scale of its response as well as the international political and economic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China may also have to contend with direct military interventions. The United States and key allies like Japan have bases in the region that can project considerable power to oppose China’s forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Drawing on Chinese military writings, tabletop exercises, private consultations, and expert surveys, this report lays out China’s potential motivations for a blockade and maps out possible scenarios of how China could approach blockade operations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-china-might-blockade-taiwan&quot;&gt;Why China Might Blockade Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese military planners have long considered a blockade to be one of the main campaigns for which the PLA needs to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science of Campaigns, a textbook published in 2006 by China’s National Defense University, defines a “joint blockade campaign” (联合封锁战役) as “an offensive campaign that is implemented by Navy-, Air Force-, Second Artillery- and Army campaign large formations with the assistive concerted efforts of the armed police force and militia . . . to sever enemy economic and military connections with the outside world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Second Artillery was renamed the “Rocket Force” in 2015 as part of larger organizational reforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would aim to take advantage of Taiwan’s status as an island with limited natural resources. Taiwan is much more dependent on trade than other large economies. In 2022, Taiwan’s imports and exports amounted to 61 and 69 percent of its GDP, respectively. By comparison, China’s imports and exports were only 15 and 20 percent of its GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zO86jBc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is particularly reliant on foreign energy supplies, importing about 97 percent of its energy. It also imports approximately 70 percent of its food, though it is self-sufficient in certain staples that could help sustain its population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reportedly, Taiwan has less than two months of coal and natural gas reserves for electricity generation, six months of crude oil reserves, and six months of food stockpiles. In the most likely blockade scenarios, these stockpiles would be subject to Chinese bombardment, reducing Taiwan’s ability to resist. Making matters more challenging, a survey conducted by the CSIS China Power Project found that many experts believe China could sustain major military operations against Taiwan for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China does not need to hermetically seal off Taiwan to achieve its goals. Curtailing trade into Taiwan by even 50 percent would prove detrimental for Taiwan, especially if Beijing stops all or most imports of oil, natural gas, and coal, which would eventually cause progressive failures in electric power distribution around the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uq7AjxE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a blockade would not be without its drawbacks for Beijing. There is no guarantee that a blockade alone will achieve Beijing’s goals. If Taiwan proves resilient, and if it receives assistance from the United States or others, China may find it impossible to force Taiwan’s capitulation without forcefully occupying the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all, there are numerous factors at play that likely shape Chinese decisionmakers’ thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of a blockade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l6EofWe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mixture of pluses and minuses shows that a blockade of Taiwan would be a serious gamble and would not guarantee China more success than an invasion. There is also the possibility that China would need to escalate a blockade into an invasion if Taiwan is not willing to capitulate or if the U.S. and other forces intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is important to distinguish the standalone “joint blockade campaign” detailed in this report — which is a campaign-level operation intended to achieve strategic objectives — from a blockade operation that is embedded within a broader invasion campaign. An embedded blockade would be short in duration and intended to help set the conditions for the amphibious invasion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet in the near term, a blockade could be more appealing for Beijing. In a 2023 CSIS China Power Project survey of experts from the United States and Taiwan, a highly kinetic joint blockade was seen as more likely than an invasion in the next five years — though only by a small margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This likely reflects beliefs that China currently lacks the capability to successfully invade Taiwan, but this strategic calculus could shift as the PLA’s capabilities grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-china-could-implement-a-blockade&quot;&gt;How China Could Implement a Blockade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would be an unprecedented undertaking for China, requiring it to overcome complex operational and logistic hurdles. Chinese decisionmakers would have to not only command joint military operations but also coordinate law enforcement and maritime militia forces to support the PLA. They would also need to prepare for war with Taiwan and the possibility of war with the United States and its allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, China is rapidly enhancing its capabilities, including the kinds of forces needed for a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint blockade operations would rely most heavily on six main types of PLA forces: naval surface and submarine fleets; air forces (including the PLA Air Force, Naval Aviation, and Army Aviation); conventional rocket forces; coastal and air defense forces; and support forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N6Wp0ud.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA writings emphasize that seizing the “three dominances” (三权) in key domains — information, maritime, and air — is crucial to executing a joint blockade campaign. China’s varying forces each play a role in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Missile strikes could, therefore, play a pivotal role. PLA writings stress the importance of degrading key enemy capabilities like air and coastal defense batteries before widely deploying China’s forces close to Taiwan to enforce a blockade. China may also target key civilian targets to limit Taipei’s ability to govern and respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could instead launch a less kinetic blockade to try to reduce international backlash — as outlined in the second and third scenarios below. However, this would risk exposing China’s blockading forces to counterattacks and not putting enough pressure on Taiwan to achieve Beijing’s desired goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8E3LeoD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ “When organizing comprehensive firepower strikes, we should carefully select important military targets that have a significant impact on our blockade campaign and targets that substantially threaten our blockading forces. . . . Simultaneously . . . we should employ aviation units and submarines to conduct large-scale mine-laying operations against enemy ports and shipping lanes.” — Science of Campaigns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA would not be operating alone in executing a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese maritime law enforcement forces would play a key role. The China Coast Guard (CCG) is the largest coast guard in the world by number of oceangoing vessels. Once the PLA has established the “three dominances,” the CCG — with help from China’s civilian maritime law enforcement agency, the Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) — would help maintain and enforce the blockade by interdicting noncompliant ships. This is critical to allowing China to portray the blockade as a domestic law enforcement matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding out China’s blockading forces would be the maritime militia — a network of organized, trained, and armed personnel operating in fishing vessels and other civilian craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These militia would not engage in force-on-force operations, but they could fill gaps in China’s ISR and complicate Taiwan’s maritime domain awareness by swarming in certain areas. The militia could also potentially aid in logistics by ferrying limited amounts of equipment and personnel to PLA vessels supporting the blockade operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could also receive support from partners like Russia. As China and Russia have grown closer in recent years, their militaries have conducted joint naval and aerial exercises in the Western Pacific and elsewhere. Russia may not intervene directly, but Beijing could request that Moscow take action to show support for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given the challenges China might have with beyond-visual-range target identification, a joint China-Russia military operation is likely to occur immediately before China blockades Taiwan or far from the main blockade areas.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The scenarios outlined below are only three examples of potential blockade approaches. There are other conceivable scenarios. In each of these scenarios, Beijing assesses that it must use military force to either deter an outright shift toward independence or force Taiwan to accept unification.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1&quot;&gt;Scenario 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;all-out-kinetic-blockade&quot;&gt;All-Out Kinetic Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario aligns most closely with PLA doctrinal writings and is believed by many U.S. analysts to be the most likely approach China might take if its goal is to use a blockade to force Taiwan to capitulate, negotiate on unification, or set the conditions for successful invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is predicated on the PLA establishing the “three dominances” (in the information, air, and maritime domains) to set the conditions for effectively imposing and sustaining a blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EDTZRzK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing China’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law, Beijing states that Taiwan has engaged in unacceptable moves toward independence and announces that the PLA and maritime law enforcement forces will conduct seven days of joint live-fire exercises around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement indicates that exercises will begin in 48 hours and take place in five air and maritime exclusion zones. The operations involve unprecedented levels of PLA activity, including aircraft and surface vessels encroaching into Taiwan’s claimed territorial waters and airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside this visible activity, Chinese submarines covertly deploy sea mines at the entrances to six of Taiwan’s key ports and energy terminal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these mines are timed for activation and are not yet active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south, the PLA mines the entrance to the Port of Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s busiest and most important trade hub, and the nearby Yung-An Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal, which is the island’s leading LNG importing terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the north, the PLA lays mines at the entrances to ports at Taichung, Taipei, Keelung, Su’ao, and Hualien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/P8s4gck.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day three of the exercises, as a separate operation, China and Russia hold a joint strategic aerial patrol over the East China Sea and Sea of Japan. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs notes that this is part of regular China-Russia patrols, but Chinese media commentators suggest that it is meant to deter Japan from intervening and to create concerns about Russian support for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FpH438f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fifth day of exercises, China announces that in 48 hours the PLA will initiate “special law enforcement operations to punish Taiwan independence elements.” The original five exclusion zones are replaced by a single large maritime and air exclusion zone covering the entire island and Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The exclusion zone extends to the boundaries of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone to the north, east, and south. China could call it a “blockade zone” instead of “exclusion zone.” There are differences between the two. Calling it an exclusion zone may help to portray the operations as a domestic law enforcement activity, but Beijing would in principle need to differentiate between enemy military vessels (which are lawful targets) and neutral or enemy merchant vessels.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing warns that unauthorized vessels or aircraft entering the zone will be warned and then fired upon if they do not comply. Approved Chinese-owned commercial vessels are permitted to transit the strait and enter Chinese ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/C6EgxO6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 48 hours later, China commences its “special law enforcement operations.” Beijing emphasizes the law enforcement elements to cast its actions as an internal affair in line with Chinese laws in the hopes that this will diminish international support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA announces that approaches to major Taiwan ports have been mined with smart munitions, which are now activated. Shipping insurance rates for the area surge, and shippers immediately halt traffic to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vafDHbQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the PLA Rocket Force, Air Force, and Navy launch joint firepower strikes against hundreds of targets, including Taiwan’s air and naval bases, coastal and air defense batteries, communication facilities, and military command and control infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/57Oc185.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLA forces then strike Taiwan’s civilian ports and airfields and supporting transportation infrastructure. They also attack Taiwan’s energy import terminals, fuel storage facilities, and power grid to undermine the island’s ability to sustain itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oOIkCSx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA simultaneously cuts Taiwan’s undersea internet cables, incapacitates Taiwan’s communication satellites, and launches cyberattacks against government and commercial entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China could specifically target Taiwan’s financial institutions to create panic and confusion among Taiwan’s public.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These attacks aim to disrupt communications and internet access within Taiwan and sever the island’s connections with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nYVyrN3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Taiwan’s defensive capabilities are significantly degraded, China positions seven naval surface action groups (SAGs) around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each SAG comprises three to six ships — including destroyers, frigates, support vessels, and covertly deployed attack submarines — for a total of over 30 warships. The vessels remain 70 nautical miles from Taiwan’s coast to avoid attacks by Taiwan’s remaining shore-based anti-ship missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA Navy also positions its Shandong aircraft carrier strike group southeast of Taiwan to launch sorties of J-15 fighters east of the island. The carrier’s presence is primarily aimed at deterring and combating Taiwan or U.S. Navy vessels attempting to convoy blockade-running ships into Taiwan from the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WaR85yd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China simultaneously deploys over two dozen law enforcement (CCG and MSA) vessels within the maritime exclusion zone to picket the approaches to Taiwan’s main ports. These could be accompanied by maritime militia vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fQ4wbvF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an initial large show of force, China scales down PLA deployments and relies more on shore-based anti-ship and anti-aircraft cruise missile batteries to enforce the blockade and deter intervention. This leaves China’s navy less exposed to counterattacks, but if the situation escalates, Beijing could redeploy forces to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCG and MSA remain largely deployed to enforce the blockade and portray China’s actions as a law enforcement operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after offensive operations begin, Beijing pauses kinetic strikes to offer an opportunity for negotiations and time for noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO). China offers to establish humanitarian corridors for Taiwan citizens to seek refuge on the mainland and says Chinese civilian airplanes and vessels would take part in the evacuation. These actions are aimed at weakening Taiwan’s internal cohesion and willingness to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Taiwan continues to resist after this initial pause, China periodically engages in more missile strikes to stop Taiwan’s military from reconstituting damaged equipment and deploying additional mobile weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is prepared to enforce the blockade for months but builds in subsequent pauses if Taiwan is willing to negotiate. Implementing a protracted blockade will require the PLA to periodically rotate personnel and equipment — a tall order for a military that last engaged in a war more than four decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of military operations, China engages in massive efforts to stir up pro-Beijing and other elements within Taiwan to advocate for negotiating with Beijing. This includes spreading false rumors, sabotaging counter-blockade efforts, and inciting unrest and public demonstrations against Taiwan’s government. Beijing could further elevate the status of a particular opposition leader or proxy in Taiwan and offer to negotiate with them instead of Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2&quot;&gt;Scenario 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;mining-blockade&quot;&gt;Mining Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first blockade scenario is representative of the likeliest approach China may take, it is not the only plausible option. China can vary the level of forces it deploys and adjust its rules of engagement to manage escalation. This second scenario is a scaled-down version of the all-out kinetic blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the first scenario, China begins by announcing major live-fire exercises to take place in five air and maritime exclusion zones off Taiwan’s major ports. As part of the exercises, China’s rocket forces fire over a dozen ballistic missiles over and around Taiwan, but they splash down in the water rather than hitting targets in Taiwan. This is intended to intimidate Taiwan and international shipping companies and deter other countries from intervening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the exercises, PLA submarines covertly lay sea mines at the entrances of Taiwan’s major ports. The mines are timed to activate later to coincide with the start of blockade operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five days of exercises, the PLA announces the start of “special law enforcement operations” and releases the coordinates for an air and maritime exclusion zone around Taiwan. Whereas in scenario one the zone covered the entire Taiwan Strait, in this scaled-back scenario, the zone only covers the eastern half of the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N1oqpwX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the PLA does not conduct joint firepower strikes against targets in Taiwan. However, PLA cyber forces conduct non-kinetic attacks to disrupt military and civilian communication systems and internet access and to disable energy and transportation infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enforce the blockade, the PLA Navy positions seven SAGs around Taiwan, and Beijing announces that mines have been laid near the entrances of key ports. China also deploys approximately 20 law enforcement vessels around Taiwan throughout the maritime exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of maritime militia vessels are also positioned alongside law enforcement ships to provide ISR and swarm vessels attempting to enter the exclusion zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vtZzVR4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial ships are to be engaged by law enforcement and maritime militia vessels unless only PLA Navy ships are in range, and they are to first try nonlethal measures such as ramming and spraying water cannons. Taiwan navy vessels are to be engaged by PLA forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enforce the no-fly zone, the PLA regularly flies aircraft around Taiwan. Since Taiwan’s air defense capabilities are still intact, the PLA relies more heavily on unmanned systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Chinese forces are ordered to not strike first, but they are authorized to return fire if they are attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has advantages and disadvantages compared to the all-out kinetic scenario. By not cutting off the entire strait, Beijing would aim to allow commercial traffic to continue transiting, which may reduce the economic fallout for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China would also seek to avoid U.S. intervention since a partial blockage of the Taiwan Strait does not significantly impact international trade and is less likely to be seen by the United States and many other countries as violating international customary laws on freedom of navigation and overflight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By not launching joint firepower strikes against targets in Taiwan and by maintaining more strict rules of engagement, Beijing may hope to avoid rapid escalation of the conflict and reduce the willingness of the United States and other countries to intervene. However, failing to degrade Taiwan’s defensive capabilities and the island’s energy infrastructure will leave China’s air and maritime forces exposed to counterattacks and leave Taiwan with a greater ability to withstand Chinese pressure for longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Taiwan escalates significantly, Beijing could intensify its own approach and evolve operations to resemble the all-out kinetic blockade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3&quot;&gt;Scenario 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-blockade&quot;&gt;Limited Blockade&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final blockade scenario is largely consistent with the second scenario but lacks mining. It is the least kinetic and escalatory of the three scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the second scenario, China stages large-scale drills around Taiwan, including live firing of ballistic missiles that splash down in the waters near Taiwan. Beijing then announces the start of “special law enforcement operations” and publishes the coordinates for a maritime and air exclusion zone that covers the main island of Taiwan but does not cut off the entire Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China deploys air, maritime, cyber, and other forces in much the same way as in scenario two, and they operate under the same rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r1AghJf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference from scenario two is the lack of mining. Mines serve to deter vessels from attempting to run the blockade, and they offer a more passive means for the PLA to threaten noncompliant ships. Without mines, China’s forces will need to play a more active role in stopping entry into Taiwan and may therefore be put in more situations in which commanders have to make decisions about exactly how to engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach could have potential upsides. This limited blockade is easier to implement since covert minelaying can be difficult — especially in the shallow waters of the Taiwan Strait. This limited blockade is also more reversible. Mines typically cannot be easily removed or deactivated, meaning that once the mines are laid China is committed to its approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By avoiding the use of mines and kinetic attacks against Taiwan, Beijing would seek to control potential escalation spirals between the PLA and Taiwan’s forces. More broadly, by taking this approach, Beijing would seek to demonstrate restraint to the international community, which could lend China’s actions greater credibility among countries seeking to remain neutral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is the least likely of the three. The lack of kinetic operations and mining leaves the PLA highly exposed to escalation by Taiwan or interventions by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5VwjmCG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three scenarios are intended only to offer three illustrative ways China could blockade Taiwan. Of these three scenarios, the all-out kinetic blockade is the more plausible one and most in line with Chinese military doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that China could pair a blockade with other kinetic military operations. For example, Beijing could combine a blockade of the main island of Taiwan with a seizure of one or more outlying islands administrated by Taiwan, such as Kinmen or Matsu near China, the Penghus near Taiwan, or Pratas in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would cut off Taiwan’s ability to reinforce and defend these islands, and seizing an island could provide Beijing a “win” even if the blockade does not lead to Taipei’s capitulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success or failure of a Chinese blockade depends on many factors. Taiwan’s resilience and willingness to defend itself and the extent to which Washington and its allies intervene are critical. How well prepared the PLA is and how Beijing controls its frontline forces and manages escalation are important not only to a successful blockade but also to ensure that a blockade does not unintentionally escalate into an invasion or war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its current military capabilities, some in Beijing may assess that a blockade carries a higher chance of operational success than an invasion in the near term. Yet Chinese decisionmakers likely recognize that a blockade would be an immensely risky choice with no guarantee of success.&lt;/p&gt;

This report outlines key policy recommendations aimed at strengthening this alliance, enhancing coordination, and ensuring a robust and unified approach to countering threats and preserving peace in the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s intensifying military activities in and around the Taiwan Strait, economic coercion tactics against Taiwan, and aggressive rhetoric about compelling reunification have increased anxiety in Taiwan, across the region, and around the world. These actions increase the prospect of a conflict over Taiwan, either a full-scale Chinese invasion or aggression that falls in the “gray zone” below the threshold of military force. Additionally, an annual report by the U.S. intelligence community suggests that Beijing is aiming to have its military prepared for decisive action to absorb Taiwan by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, countries are concerned by increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait, but worries are particularly acute in the Indo-Pacific region. That concern does not always translate into concrete action, however, and countries across the region have different calculations on how best to promote stability in the Taiwan Strait and the degree to which direct engagement on the issue serves their national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the United States, Japan, and Australia stand as the anchors of regional stability. And yet, despite the combined power that the three countries bring to the table and the common interests they share in cross-strait stability, the discussion among Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra about preventing and responding to a crisis remains underdeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As concern about Beijing’s military modernization has intensified in recent years — along with China’s maritime pressure in the East China Sea — the United States and Japan have deepened dialogue on issues related to China. The reality of Japan’s close geographic proximity to Taiwan — a fact brought home by China’s military exercises around the island in August 2022, which included ballistic missile launches that landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone — has prompted the two governments to expand bilateral planning related to a Taiwan contingency. Although still politically sensitive, the openness with which Japanese officials discuss responses to a crisis in the Taiwan Strait today stands in sharp contrast with a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions of Taiwan issues in official channels with Australia are more limited. Concern about the threat posed by China to Australia’s interests closer to home has driven significant change in Australia’s defense posture, to include its commitment to the AUKUS initiatives and a new national defense strategy intended to address the “most challenging strategic environment since the Second World War.” Nevertheless, focus in Australia on cross-strait stability, and Australia’s potential role in a crisis, remains more limited than in Japan. Given the critical role that both Japan and Australia would play in a crisis — economically, diplomatically, and even militarily — improving trilateral coordination related to Taiwan should be a strategic priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help drive a focused discussion among these three critical allies on preserving cross-strait stability, the CSIS Australia Chair, in partnership with the CSIS Japan Chair, brought together 22 leading American, Japanese, and Australian strategic thinkers for two days of Track 2 discussions in Canberra in March 2024. The result was a rich dialogue on current dynamics in cross-strait affairs; the strategic interests at stake in cross-strait stability for the three allies; and opportunities to deepen cooperation on the economic, diplomatic, and military fronts, with the goal of promoting cross-strait stability. The group engaged in a vigorous debate on how to best respond to increased Chinese gray zone coercion and to reinforce deterrence against a potential Chinese use of force to compel unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several key concepts emerged from the two-day conference. Participants in the three countries broadly agreed that they should deepen direct links with Taiwan, both in government and in civil society, deliberately expanding beyond long-standing constraints on official ties; this engagement should include support for Taiwan’s efforts to expand its role in international organizations. Participants also broadly agreed on the need to develop an economic resilience agenda for Taiwan, to limit its vulnerability to Chinese economic coercion by diversifying trade and supply chain links outside of the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On questions of military deterrence, views were more mixed. Some participants advocated for a focused trilateral discussion on sustaining deterrence in the Taiwan Strait, including a division of labor that maximizes the effectiveness of capabilities each country brings to the table. Some Australian participants noted that the national conversation in this area lagged behind that of others; while certain types of trilateral initiatives might provide a useful mechanism to do more, in some areas individual governments need a more proactive list of ways to engage Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the dialogue, CSIS asked each participant to draft a short response to the following question: Given the enormous stakes involved, what more can be done by individual countries and by groupings of like-minded nations to preserve stability in the Taiwan Strait? An expansive question, it was hoped, would generate thoughtful, creative, and novel ideas. This report is the product of those discussions, organized as a compilation of policy recommendations put forward by the individual contributors in the following essays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;us-perspectives&quot;&gt;U.S. Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-potential-for-further-chinese-economic-coercion-against-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Potential for Further Chinese Economic Coercion against Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By James Carouso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun Tzu famously said, “In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. . . . Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting.” Chinese president Xi Jinping might be expected to follow this doctrine to realize his goal of bringing Taiwan under China’s control for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s practice of using gray zone tactics to achieve its territorial objectives has been largely successful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Killing fellow ethnic Han, who compose more than 90 percent of both China’s and Taiwan’s populations, in a Taiwan conflict would tarnish the achievement of a reunified China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Most Chinese soldiers are only children, meaning their parents have no other offspring. Their deaths could have a severe social backlash, especially if the fighting is drawn out and does not go to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rebuilding a destroyed country, especially while fighting an insurgency, would be an expensive and morally draining enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If China does not use military force, other powers would be reluctant to fire the first shot or intervene militarily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A likely strategy for Xi to achieve Taiwan’s surrender of its sovereignty would be through economic strangulation. Xi could announce that any nation that trades with Taiwan would have its exports to China subject to high tariffs, if not outright bans. Moreover, bilateral China-Taiwan trade could end (China accounts for about 25 percent of Taiwan’s total trade and takes 22.6 percent of Taiwan’s exports). In 2010, China cut off exports of rare-earth metals to Japan after a boating collision. Chinese exports of critical minerals could once again be used as a means to coerce third nations into inaction. Harassment of shipping and air traffic could cause associated insurance premiums to reach unsupportable levels, or insurance could become unobtainable if China boycotts shippers and insurance carriers that continue to do business with Taiwan. Chinese air and naval incursions across the Taiwan Strait median line and naval activity to the east of Taiwan seem designed to remind the world that China could quickly end global transport links with the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One indicator of China’s willingness to apply economic coercion to Taiwan without using kinetic acts or a formal blockade occurred in December 2023, a month before Taiwan’s elections, when China suddenly announced that Taiwan had put up trade barriers in contravention of both World Trade Organization rules and its 2010 trade deal. China’s Ministry of Commerce added that these barriers have had a “negative impact” on Chinese companies, implying that China was considering retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan government and key private sector companies have recognized Taiwan’s economic vulnerability and have taken some actions to mitigate the risks. Tsai Ing-wen, following her election as president in 2016, instituted the New Southbound Policy to promote trade and investment with Indo-Pacific nations, besides China. The value of trade with all of these countries increased from $96 billion in 2016 to $180 billion in 2022, and investment flows rose from $2.4 billion in 2016 to $5.3 billion in 2022. In 2022, Taiwan’s investment in these countries combined made up about 35 percent of its total investment abroad, outstripping investment in China for the first time. Nevertheless, China remains Taiwan’s largest single trade partner and stock of outward foreign direct investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has no intention to economically decouple from China, seeking stability in its bilateral relations. But further diversification of trade and investment would be welcome. Like-minded countries could accelerate this process by agreeing to multilateral trade agreements that include Taiwan. The multilateral approach would reduce China’s ability to retaliate as well as tie Taiwan more broadly into the ex-China global supply chain. The terms of any such agreement would have to include lowering trade barriers and therefore would go beyond the May 2023 trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, just after U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit, China suspended imports of more than 2,000 Taiwanese food products. It banned Taiwanese pineapples, beer, grouper, pomelos, and other goods heavily dependent on the Chinese market. While these goods made up less than 2 percent of Taiwan’s total trade with China, the political intent was clear, especially as it coincided with increased incursions by People’s Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft into Taiwan’s airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Taiwan’s government launched campaigns such as #FreedomPineapple asking friendly countries like Japan to import more Taiwanese farm products whenever China imposes a new ban. To prevent similar acts of coercion in the future, like-minded countries should go further and agree on a standby arrangement to lift any trade barriers to Taiwanese goods targeted by China. In addition, they could agree to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to a percentage equivalent to the impact on Taiwan’s exports. A trip wire of this sort would put the onus on China not to weaponize trade with Taiwan unless it is willing to also suffer economic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, like-minded nations should continue efforts to insulate themselves from dependence on China for goods critical to national economic security and defense. Efforts to establish more semiconductor foundries outside of Taiwan are useful in worst-case scenarios, but these new foundries still depend on some inputs from China. For example, China began restricting exports of gallium and germanium in July 2023 (it produces 80 percent of the world’s gallium and 60 percent of germanium). Both minerals are essential for production of high-end semiconductors, solar panels, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, China has historically restricted rare-earth exports, though it accounts for more than 90 percent of global production of rare-earth elements. These necessary components are used in more than 200 products across a wide range of applications, especially high-tech consumer products such as cell phones, hard drives, electric and hybrid vehicles, and flat-screen monitors and televisions. Significant defense applications include electronic displays, guidance systems, lasers, and radar and sonar systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various programs are underway to produce these elements outside of China and stockpile them in the interim, China’s manipulation of market prices severely hampers these programs. Like-minded nations need to work together to achieve economies of scale, long-term take-or-pay arrangements with non-Chinese sources, and joint stockpiling agreements to increase security of supply and reduce overall carrying costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that China can use economic means to achieve its ends in Taiwan even if it means a hit to China’s economy. Taiwan and its friends must work together to identify their economic vulnerabilities to China and coordinate to limit the impact of potential Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-states-japan-and-australia-should-bolster-taiwans-economic-resilience&quot;&gt;The United States, Japan, and Australia Should Bolster Taiwan’s Economic Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Bonnie S. Glaser&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increasing military threat to Taiwan has prompted the United States and some U.S. allies to sharpen their focus on strengthening deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. Efforts to bolster deterrence include transforming U.S. force posture in the Indo-Pacific to make it more resilient, mobile, distributed, and lethal, as well as helping Taiwan’s military acquire and train with weapons to support a porcupine strategy to deter China from blockading or invading the island. The United States and Japan are enhancing Taiwan Strait deterrence through various actions, such as a plan to enable small detachments of marines to deploy to the Nansei island chain and a decision to equip a U.S. Marine Corps regiment in Okinawa with antiship missiles that can target People’s Liberation Army Navy ships. Numerous U.S. allies have contributed to deterrence by stating publicly that their countries have a stake in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intensified attention by the United States and its allies to shore up military capabilities to defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is necessary and welcome, but an effective strategy to maintain cross-strait peace and stability must also include stronger economic support for Taiwan. Although Taiwan’s economic development has been relatively stable over the last decade, with growth rates averaging 3.2 percent between 2012 and 2022, the island faces growing risks due to overreliance on the Chinese market and relatively weak connections with the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Taiwan’s dependence on China has declined in the past few years. Its peak reliance was in 2020, when almost 44 percent of Taiwan’s exports went to mainland China and Hong Kong, while the United States had a 15 percent share. As a result of China’s economic slowdown and an increase in U.S. and European demand for semiconductor chips and other information and communications technology (ICT) products, Taiwan’s exports to China dropped to 35 percent of the total in 2023, the lowest share in 21 years. Meanwhile, the combined shares of exports to the United States, Europe, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries increased by 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad news, however, is that Taiwan is still highly vulnerable. China remains the island’s largest export market and most important trading partner while at the same time posing an immense and growing threat to Taiwan’s security. Beijing is already beginning to ramp up economic coercion as part of its strategy of using gray zone tactics to strangle Taiwan. If Chinese leader Xi Jinping concludes that “possibilities for a peaceful reunification have been completely exhausted,” justifying the use of “non-peaceful means” (the language of Article 8 of the PRC’s 2005 Anti-Secession Law), it could shut down a substantial portion of Taiwan’s trade flows and paralyze key sectors of its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, intensifying strategic tensions between China and the West, as well as China’s stagnating economy, make Taiwan’s reliance on China for economic growth no longer viable. Economic diversification is essential to secure sustainable, modest economic growth in the future. Robust economic support for Taiwan’s economy must therefore be part of a strategy the United States and its allies pursue to enhance Taiwan’s resilience. Concrete steps should be taken to support Taipei’s efforts to foster secure supply chains and negotiate agreements that encourage trade diversification. In 2023, Taiwan was the fourth-, seventh-, and ninth-largest trading partner of Japan, Australia, and the United States, respectively. All three countries should prioritize negotiations with Taiwan on economic and trade issues, with the goal of eventually signing bilateral free-trade agreements (BFTAs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration of U.S. president Joe Biden should do its utmost to complete the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on Twenty-First Century Trade this year. Whoever wins the U.S. presidential election should build on that achievement by launching negotiations to sign a BFTA, which has bipartisan congressional support. Canberra should resume talks with Taiwan aimed at a BFTA, which it suspended in 2017 due to pressure from Beijing and fear of retribution. Japan signed an investment accord with Taiwan in 2011, but its close economic relationship with China as well as Taiwan’s ban on food imports from five Japanese prefectures affected by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident have inhibited discussion of a BFTA with Taipei. The latter obstacle was removed in February 2022 when Taipei lifted the import restrictions. As a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the name Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, Taiwan has the right to conclude trade agreements with other WTO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy to bolster Taiwan’s economic security should also include efforts to expand Taipei’s regional economic interactions. Both Taiwan and the PRC have applied for membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Although the trade pact’s consensus-based accession process poses hurdles to Taiwan’s membership, Tokyo and Canberra should encourage other members to base their positions on approving new members on their readiness and willingness to meet CPTPP criteria. Taiwan’s inclusion would enhance economic security and supply chain resilience in the Indo-Pacific and enable Taiwan to boost exports to CPTPP member countries. Japan has already expressed strong support for Taiwan’s application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra could also join forces to respond directly to China’s intensifying use of economic coercion against Taiwan. For example, they could offer preferential access to their markets for products targeted by Chinese sanctions and support Taiwanese businesses targeted by Chinese pressure through purchase commitments and export credits. In addition, Japan and Australia could strengthen dialogue with Taiwan, either bilaterally or multilaterally alongside the United States, on digital trade, supply chains, international standards setting, critical infrastructure, and cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening trade and economic cooperation with Taiwan would still be consistent with the One China policies of the United States, Japan, and Australia. Nevertheless, to reduce PRC concerns, all three allies should explain their intentions to Beijing and reiterate that they will adhere to their respective One China policies and their commitments not to support Taiwan’s independence. Increased economic engagement is essential if like-minded democracies hope to strengthen Taiwan’s resilience and preserve peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-the-economy-of-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Securing the Economy of the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Erin Murphy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s economic security is as important as any military component in a potential Taiwan Strait crisis. Such a conflict would result in mutually assured economic destruction for both China and Taiwan and devastating consequences for the global economy. Economic security in the strait could be strengthened by further engaging Taiwan economically — both through expansion of its semiconductor and high-value electronics industries and involvement in regional trading blocs — and demonstrating to regional partners and key countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) the impact of a strait crisis on their markets. These steps provide more outlets for Taiwan to weather China’s coercive tactics, build more resilient supply chains, and offer more leverage for outside actors to convince both China and Taiwan to pursue peaceful measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan occupies an important place in the global economy, especially for economies in the Indo-Pacific region. According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, accounting for 22.6 percent of total trade in 2022, followed by the United States at 13.3 percent, Japan at 9.7 percent, Hong Kong at 7.3 percent, and South Korea at 6.2 percent. In 2016, Taiwan launched its New Southbound Policy to enhance cooperation in the region, which partially contributed to Taiwan’s business investments in ASEAN exceeding its investments in China for the first time in 2021. Between January and October 2021, Taiwan invested $5.3 billion in ASEAN, most of it funneled to Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, the highest proportion of overall investment in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese companies manufacture close to 70 percent of the world’s semiconductors and approximately 90 percent of the most advanced chips. For example, semiconductors account for a sizable portion of Taiwan’s cumulative $8.9 billion investment in Singapore, led by companies such as United Microelectronics Corporation. In addition, Taiwan plays an outsized role in electronics manufacturing, with its most notable companies, TSMC and Foxconn, providing manufacturing services for leading electronics manufacturers such as, but not limited to, Apple, Dell, Nvidia, and HP. In 2020, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics firm, invested $270 million in Vietnam to produce tablets and laptops, expanding its investment by another $80 million in 2021. The company also invested $350 million in its Indian subsidiary for iPhone production. Moreover, Taiwan is the fifth-largest exporter of machine tools, the primary manufacturer for bicycle brands such as Giant, Merida, and Peloton, and a significant textile and apparel manufacturer, producing products and garments for brands such as Adidas, Lululemon, Nike, and Under Armour. Taiwan is also home to hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of Taiwan’s economy to the global supply chain makes the prospect of a conflict in the strait more daunting. A Rhodium Group assessment concluded that a blockade in the strait without international responses or second-order effects could result in a loss of $2 trillion to the global economy. Trade and investments globally would be affected. A full-on military conflict would be even more devastating, ensuring a collapse of the chips industry and disruption of critical supply chains from China and Taiwan. Countries would be forced to choose to side with China or risk coercive measures from it if in noncompliance with China’s demands. In addition to the real economic consequences, the lives of 23 million Taiwanese and foreign workers would be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stability in the strait may be strengthened by expanding participation in regional trade agreements and frameworks. Economic ties between the United States and Taiwan have strengthened with the advent of bilateral dialogues, development finance collaboration, the 2021 launching of the U.S.-Taiwan Technology Trade and Investment Collaboration supporting cooperation on critical supply chains, and most recently the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade, which was signed into law in August 2023. The initiative is the first major trade agreement approved by Congress and the administration under President Joe Biden that includes specific trade facilitation parameters to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States and Taiwan. This agreement could serve as an example of how governments could navigate tricky political waters and find ways to engage Taiwan economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This engagement on trade and deeper economic integration could be extended to other multilateral agreements as well, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Both Taiwan and China have applied for membership to the CPTPP to join countries from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Although there are serious political considerations regarding Taiwan’s membership, CPTPP members should also weigh the consequences of letting in China without Taiwan and the impact on stability in the strait. CPTPP members could also consider a loose affiliation in terms of economic engagement with the Taiwanese economy, particularly on issues such as digital trade and critical supply chains, in which Taiwan has demonstrated experience as a trusted partner and willing participant. Engagement in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, of which Taiwan is a member, is one model for members to work together to address critical economic issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also behooves regional allies and like-minded partners to work together when it comes to Chinese economic coercion. The risk of coercive measures from China will certainly rise along with tensions in the strait. While Taiwan has borne the brunt of China’s threats and coercive tactics, China’s measures, including import bans, critical minerals export bans, and other economic threats, have also affected Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea. Countries can work together to identify potential targets for coercion and strategies to address punitive measures. Further economic engagement among regional partners could help mitigate the harmful effects of coercion, leading to new markets for products banned by China — such as fruit, wine, and seafood — or finding substitute products should China cease exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, must consider how a conflict could affect them. It is not necessarily a question of choosing sides but how their economies and overseas workers would be directly affected. A conflict in the strait would have a direct impact on their economies, especially as China is one of their largest trading partners and engagement would be severely disrupted. ASEAN should consider urging a peaceful resolution or maintaining the status quo to maintain its members’ stability and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic interdependence has not prevented wars in the past, as evidenced more than once in Europe. But it can cause actors to think twice. A conflict between Taiwan and China would not be limited to their borders and would immediately affect the globe. The United States, its partners and allies, and countries in the Indo-Pacific should find ways to ensure economic stability in the strait, which will contribute toward maintaining the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;underscoring-the-costs-of-aggression-and-benefits-of-restraint-in-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Underscoring the Costs of Aggression and Benefits of Restraint in the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By David Shullman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of stability in the Taiwan Strait is widely understood. A Taiwan crisis could lead to catastrophic conflict and a global economic meltdown. With Chinese leader Xi Jinping seemingly more impatient than his predecessors to unify with Taiwan and rapidly developing People’s Liberation Army (PLA) capabilities to compel unification by force if necessary, the United States and its allies must enhance deterrence and prevent China from taking more aggressive actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the deterrence debate remains confined to a limited set of options primarily revolving around the use of military force. Given the circumstances, more creativity is needed to devise an extended menu of means to enhance deterrence on both sides of the cost-benefit ledger to affect Xi’s decision to use force regarding Taiwan. This means considering actions that may offend both advocates of hard-line positions on China and those who abjure exploiting the insecurities of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, more must be done to expand the benefits China expects from restraint. CCP leaders define China’s claim over Taiwan as central to the legitimacy of regime rule. U.S. diplomatic statements and stepped-up engagement with Taiwan in recent years have eroded Beijing’s sense that eventual unification is possible absent the use of force. Washington and its allies must reassure Beijing that, should China refrain from using force, the United States will remain committed to the One China policy, will oppose Taiwan declaring independence, will support resumed cross-strait dialogue, and will not establish a formal defense alliance with Taiwan. If Chinese leaders are convinced that inaction forecloses the possibility of unification, they will not remain invested in restraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genuine commitment to these long-held U.S. positions, frequently communicated privately and publicly to Beijing and U.S. allies in the region, helps expand options for U.S. and allied messaging on the other side of the ledger — the potential costs for Beijing of aggressive moves such as invasion or a military blockade. Options for deterring aggressive Chinese action against Taiwan fall into two broad categories: deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment. Deterrence-by-denial strategies are designed to deter action by making China’s objectives toward Taiwan militarily infeasible. Deterrence-by-punishment strategies involve threats to raise the cost of aggression, even if that aggression is successful. Included in this category is the promise of intolerable military and economic retaliation in response to China’s use of force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punishment strategies, however, are inherently less reliable than denial strategies, which offer the stark promise of blocking China from achieving its objectives through overwhelming military capabilities. For punishment strategies to work, they must convince China of allied willingness and resolve to impose punishments and follow through on threats after China has initiated aggression and possibly made significant gains. This fact is particularly important at a time when China’s risk tolerance is growing and deterrence is eroding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenge for the United States and its allies, therefore, is cobbling together enough convincing potential punitive actions across domains — primarily the military domain but also the diplomatic and economic domains — to alter the cost-benefit analysis for Xi such that he would reconsider using force against Taiwan. This is particularly challenging given that Xi is already aware of many of the risks and would use force only if it is worth the expected costs of preventing an intolerable outcome — for example, Taiwan declaring independence or a gradual shift in the military balance that renders China unable to compel unification in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shifting balance of military power in China’s favor suggests that additional types of costs are required to enhance deterrence. Some argue that China already understands the potential costs of a Taiwan conflict and therefore nothing can increase the collective deterrent value of potential punishment. But this is incorrect: more can be done to exploit the CCP’s deepest insecurities regarding its internal stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence is ultimately a “political proposition,” as Stephen Kotkin puts it. Any combination of punitive measures that deters China from aggression against Taiwan succeeds primarily because they prompt fear of economic instability and thus political costs for Xi and the CCP. If deterrence by punishment requires signaling to Xi credible political costs greater than the benefits of an action, then there is value in capitalizing on Xi’s worst fears regarding internal threats to the regime’s legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi needs little convincing about the general risks of internal dissatisfaction and regime insecurity — a subject that consumes much of his attention — or the idea that failure to achieve victory in a military invasion of Taiwan could produce these results. Nor does Xi doubt that his enemies would exploit these vulnerabilities. But he has probably given less attention to the massive economic challenges that would result from Chinese aggression against Taiwan and could compound instability. While Xi probably judges that other countries’ economic interdependence with China may deter them from intervening in a Taiwan crisis, it is not clear he views the economic costs to China itself as an additional reason not to initiate conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. or allied messages of concern that Chinese use of force against Taiwan would prompt economic instability in China could heighten Xi’s unease along these lines, potentially enhancing deterrence. The goal would not be to threaten Chinese leaders but to convey legitimate concerns about the impact of potential Chinese aggression on both regional and Chinese stability. Beijing would naturally reject any such U.S. message as wrongheaded and unwelcome interference in domestic affairs, but that is beside the point. Consistent messaging could enhance deterrence by indirectly amplifying Xi and other leaders’ already potent concerns that the CCP’s enemies will exploit internal instability in the event of anything less than total victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges and risks of incorporating messaging about internal instability resulting from aggression into a deterrent approach would be significant. First, the United States would need to be clear it has no interest in exacerbating China’s instability, which, if extreme, could produce catastrophic results for the Chinese people, the global economy, and U.S.-China relations. This being true in peacetime and during potential conflict, Washington would need to be clear that it would never view Chinese regime destabilization as a war aim. Instead, U.S. messaging would have to underscore concerns that economic crisis and political instability would be a natural consequence of China’s initiation of conflict. Washington would also need to clarify these aims with key Indo-Pacific allies, whose partnership is critical to maintaining stability in the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, the United States and others would have to carefully consider how to raise the salience of domestic instability with Chinese interlocutors. A combination of private conversations with Chinese officials and increased nonofficial public messaging on the subject would be a good start. In addition to conversations allied officials should have with their Chinese counterparts about the potential for conflict over Taiwan to spiral and ultimately lead to a broader war, Washington, and possibly allied governments, could also privately communicate growing concern about the impact of a war on China’s internal situation. Nongovernment researchers could dedicate more attention to the costs of conflict to China’s economy and governance capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added emphasis on the potential internal costs for destabilizing actions in the strait would, of course, be effective only as part of the array of other measures the United States and its allies must take to enhance deterrence. Further buildup of military capabilities to dissuade China from believing it might achieve a swift and painless victory will remain central. The United States and allies must continue to support Taiwan’s defensive “porcupine strategy” and ensure the island can hold out, potentially until U.S. arrival, and China must understand that threats of nuclear use will not dissuade Washington from intervening in a Taiwan crisis. Greater allied coherence on punitive economic and military responses to potential Chinese aggression is also essential. Beijing must be convinced it will face not just U.S. military power but also Japanese and Australian power — an impression that should regularly be underscored through joint military exercises and force posture decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Beijing’s calculus shifting and U.S. regional military dominance no longer tenable, a more robust punitive arsenal of consequences flowing from China’s use of force against Taiwan is required. Washington should be willing both to tolerate the bilateral tension of raising with Chinese interlocutors the internal costs of using force in the Taiwan Strait and to reaffirm long-standing U.S. positions that reassure Beijing that military aggression is unnecessary. Deterrence will be enhanced by guiding Xi toward a course defined by faith in the rewards of restraint and greater concern that aggression may put the CCP’s vital interests at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Jennifer Hong Whetsell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During just two weeks in February 2024, 124 aircraft and 74 navy vessels belonging to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were detected around Taiwan. Of those, 47 crossed the median line, entering Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ). Through such actions, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under General Secretary Xi Jinping is attempting to erode the rule of law and threaten Taiwan’s vibrant democracy. To achieve his goal of “reunification,” Xi has intensified gray zone activities in the Taiwan Strait and expanded China’s military, which now rivals that of the United States in terms of capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given China’s increasing coercion across the Taiwan Strait, Russia’s unprovoked war with Ukraine, the potential for the war in Gaza to escalate into a regional conflict, and the deepening relationship between North Korea and Russia, the United States and its allies must explore all avenues to uphold stability in the Indo-Pacific, preventing authoritarian actors from further degrading global peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-deterrence-through-space&quot;&gt;Enhancing Deterrence through Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of scientific, economic, and technological opportunities in the space domain has sparked fierce global competition to launch more spacecraft, proliferate more orbits, have more lunar landings, and generally outperform others in this increasingly promising field. Unfortunately, these endeavors are not all peaceful. Space has become increasingly militarized due to the absence of international safeguards and worsening global tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 15, the White House confirmed that Russia developed a counter-offensive satellite weapon that can disrupt military and civilian communications and harm other space assets if detonated, leading to severe disruptions in space and on Earth. China is also planning a record 100 orbital launches for 2024. Seventy of these launches will collectively send more than 290 spacecraft into orbit, each potentially carrying payloads of advanced satellites with surveillance and other military and intelligence capabilities. In addition to its continued proliferation of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, China launched a classified military satellite into geostationary orbit on February 23, raising alarm among U.S. officials. With recent launches and more on the horizon, China will have persistent visual and radar surveillance over strategically important areas throughout the Indo-Pacific. In this aggressive space race, ensuring national security and resiliency requires the ability to monitor activities on the ground from space; augmented Earth-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and uninterrupted access to communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies recognize the importance of the space domain for national security and global stability, as exemplified in recent joint statements. Nonetheless, space cooperation remains nascent. Through collaboration in space, the United States, Japan, and Australia can inhibit the expansionist ambitions of Xi, Russian president Vladimir Putin, and, to an extent, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while establishing rules and norms for space operations and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to strengthen cooperation in this critical domain, Washington, Tokyo, and Canberra need to ensure the three capitals are aligned in their goals and objectives for the space domain, and through the strengthened cooperation, enhance deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and stability across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FULLY LEVERAGE EACH NATION’S STRENGTHS BY SYNERGIZING THEIR SPACE ASSETS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long been at the forefront of space technology, boasting robust national and commercial infrastructure, extensive experience, and a storied history of successes. It has launched numerous satellites into orbit for both military and civilian purposes. Today, the U.S. government is focused on establishing “mega constellations” for resilient and redundant communications and improving its command and control capabilities by leveraging space assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also a formidable player in the space domain. Recent milestones include its launch of the H3 space rocket and its successful landing of a lunar mission, making it the fifth nation to accomplish this feat. These achievements are particularly noteworthy given Japan’s relatively small budget compared to that of other space-faring nations. Furthermore, Japan’s involvement in space war games, including the Schriever Wargame and other space-based military exercises, sets it apart as one of the few Asian nations to have engaged in such activities. Japan has been training alongside the United States and other allied partners for more than a decade to achieve interoperability for conflict scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Australia does not possess robust military or commercial space assets, compared to the United States and other space-faring nations, its geographic location and vast real estate represent unique strategic assets within the space ecosystem. Australia holds tremendous potential for becoming an instrumental Southern Hemisphere launch site for its missions and those of its allies. Located near the equator, Australia’s northern regions offer a distinct advantage for launching larger payloads into LEO at a more affordable cost. This is due to the Earth’s rotation, which allows rockets to harness additional energy, achieve greater launch velocity, and carry larger payloads more efficiently. Additionally, unlike the United States, Japan, and many other space-faring nations, Australia’s vast uninhabited land provides an opportunity for establishing inland launch facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ technical know-how and experience, Japan’s advanced technological assets and well-trained personnel, and Australia’s valuable real estate and increased access to orbital belts can be collectively leveraged to enhance the effectiveness of each nation’s respective space assets. Through such synergistic collaboration, the three partners can more effectively counter the ambitions of Beijing and Moscow for space dominance, thereby improving stability both in space and on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESTABLISH RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND PROMOTE SPACE SUSTAINABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instability in space is exacerbated by congested orbital belts, overcrowded with debris and satellites, as well as a lack of rules and regulations governing the space domain. The United States has promoted norms for responsible operation in space through multilateral and international platforms, both new (e.g., Artemis Accords, antisatellite test bans) and existing (e.g., UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space). It has been successful in aligning with like-minded nations, such as Japan and Australia. However, Beijing and Moscow have sought to counter such efforts by forming their own regional blocs and advancing destabilizing norms in the space domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with other like-minded nations, the United States, Japan, and Australia can advance more clearly defined rules of engagement for space, establish enforcement mechanisms, and promote space sustainability. The current dearth of norms and rules of engagement implicitly sanctions Beijing and Moscow to continue engaging in dangerous and irresponsible behaviors in space. However, by collaborating to preserve space for responsible use and operations, the United States, Japan, Australia, and other like-minded nations can deter Beijing and Moscow from employing space assets and technologies that threaten peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps-strengthening-deterrence-from-space&quot;&gt;Next Steps: Strengthening Deterrence from Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, Japan, and Australia should expand cooperation in the space domain to strengthen deterrence and uphold stability in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific by considering the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue to elevate the topic of space and norm setting within bilateral and multilateral dialogues and exercises, shaping the space environment to be operated with peace and sustainability in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursue specific cooperative efforts in such areas as sharing data, improving space domain awareness, and cross-training military and intelligence personnel. Continue to elevate space domain exercises with each other and invite other like-minded partners to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest more in domestic space infrastructure, including constructing ISR-capable satellites, developing capabilities that facilitate interoperability, and promoting technological advancements in the commercial space sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decrease barriers to cooperation between the three nations by reviewing and amending technology transfer regulations and classification levels in the areas that would benefit from enhanced cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation in the space domain is complex because alignment of key factors, such as technical capability and capacity, trust in intent and practice, and sharing of common threat pictures, is crucial to continuity and success. Today, due to differing priorities, the United States, Japan, and Australia share many, but not all, of these factors. However, given the current threats in the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific, as well as the advancing capabilities of actors whose motivations are not always clear or good, the three countries cannot afford to delay proactive cooperation in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;japanese-perspectives&quot;&gt;Japanese Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countering-xi-jinpings-expanding-domestic-governance&quot;&gt;Countering Xi Jinping’s Expanding Domestic Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Masuo Chisako&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, China has been engaged in a massive, unprecedented military buildup. When discussing the risks surrounding Taiwan, China’s neighbors and Western countries tend to focus on China’s military threat. Unlike under the presidency of Hu Jintao, however, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has shown little sign of involvement in Beijing’s foreign policy in recent years. Although Chinese president Xi Jinping has consolidated political control over the PLA, he does not trust it and purged many of its high commanders in 2023. Since the PLA has turned into a “difficult” organ for Xi to use, he is unlikely to invade Taiwan by force in the immediate future. Instead, he might seek “unification” of Taiwan through other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s centralization of power has considerably changed the nature of Chinese policymaking. Simply put, the regime is increasingly inclined to deal with international problems in the same manner as it does domestic ones. Xi’s decisionmaking team has relied heavily on the staffs that belong to the chain-of-command structure under the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission in the Chinese Communist Party, such as police and national security agents, to consolidate his supreme power domestically. Now the same team is calling for “centralized and unified leadership” in foreign policy. Xi has emphasized the importance of security, as he believes domestic and foreign threats are working in tandem to overthrow the Chinese communist regime. To prevent such a possibility, the administration tries to “plan for external and domestic security in an integrated manner.” Because the Xi administration does not clearly distinguish between the issues inside and outside of China’s borders, it has increasingly applied domestic governance methods to deal with external issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these conditions, two actions — (1) analyzing China’s maritime national program and (2) expanding Taiwan’s international role — should be pursued to upgrade cooperation among democracies to deter China from taking aggressive measures against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analyzing-chinas-maritime-national-program&quot;&gt;Analyzing China’s Maritime National Program&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the maritime contents of China’s territorial and spatial program, launched in 2021, allows for deeper investigation of China’s preparations to expand its effective control over the sea and air surrounding Taiwan. At the same time, it is important to study China’s new infrastructure construction and collect data on Chinese maritime behaviors. The latter effort includes the development of new technologies to intercept Chinese satellite systems such as BeiDou and monitor the behaviors of Chinese official and private vessels using signals other than the Automatic Identification System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the starting year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, China launched a national territorial and spatial program that stipulates the usage, development, and conservation of the 3 million square kilometers of water jurisdiction (管轄海域) it claims, making use of its own satellite and digital technology. Since about a half of the water is disputed with neighboring states, this serves as an action plan for China to expand its effective control substantially in the name of domestic governance. The East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, and South China Sea are equally under pressure from Chinese state planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, China attempted to expand its effective control of Taiwan’s Kinmen Island by using a fishing boat incident as an excuse. This follows a similar pattern to a Chinese fishing vessel incident that occurred in Japanese waters near the Senkaku Islands in 2010. The China Coast Guard (CCG), headed by the Central Military Commission since 2018, is responsible for establishing domestic control over claimed territory, whereas the PLA prepares against external threats. As a result, the CCG has been taking new measures to increase pressure on Taiwan in the name of domestic administration, seeking to fulfill established targets related to the national territorial and spatial program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for Taiwan and its liberally minded global counterparts to track those developments and deter China from taking further actions. However, it will be more and more difficult in near future as China is creating new types of infrastructure that can lay a foundation to implement its military-civil fusion strategy. Various satellite constellations centered on BeiDou, including the ones that enable space-based broadband communications, have been combined with the underwater surveillance system in preparation for contingencies when the PLA needs to mobilize private vessels and air/sea drones. Countries need to work together to study China’s new program and to increase maritime defense awareness against Beijing by monitoring and countering its new technology. This effort can also improve preparedness against it in the East and South China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-taiwans-international-role&quot;&gt;Expanding Taiwan’s International Role&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been engaged in a competition for diplomatic recognition with Taiwan in an attempt to extinguish the island’s identity and influence from international fora. Chinese pressure has intensified since Taiwanese president-elect Lai Ching-te’s victory in January 2024. Taiwan maintains its international presence in advanced semiconductor production, but this presence should be secured and upgraded amid the hardening international competition between the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated above, the organizations directed by the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission have gained political power in China as they have contributed to Xi’s growing domestic supremacy in recent years. They include the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of National Security, and Ministry of Justice. All of those bodies are now directed by Xi Jinping’s old and close allies. As China’s security pact with the Solomon Islands and its police cooperation with other South Pacific island countries illustrate, such forces have also extended their influence over foreign relations. In simple terms, China’s version of the KGB, that performs domestic surveillance and has helped to centralize power in Xi’s hands, is transforming China’s international approach. It naturally prefers secretive infiltration operations, in both domestic affairs and external relations, such as controlling the internet, diffusing fake news, bribing with money and benefits, and exerting influence through religious, cultural, and academic exchanges. Its activities are conducted using the latest information technology and are likely to consolidate pro-China authoritarian regimes in developing countries. China’s recent efforts to form a global partnership network seek to make these governance models and technologies available to developing countries as international public goods. This can accelerate international competition between democracies and autocracies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this picture, Taiwan has the best-developed measures to tackle Chinese infiltration efforts due to its abundant experience. Other like-minded countries need to learn from it. If the preventive measures developed in Taiwan can be systematically shared and improved upon among global democracies and offered to developing countries, the spread of Chinese autocracy can be mitigated or prevented. Perhaps establishing a private center in Taiwan that studies anti-infiltration methods and trains relevant personnel from all over the world is a good idea for advancing Taiwan’s international presence. To this end, it is also necessary for Western countries to position Taiwan as a bridgehead for securing democracy in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;articulating-a-regional-deterrence-architecture&quot;&gt;Articulating a Regional Deterrence Architecture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main strategic objective of China’s campaign to use force to unify Taiwan would be to force Taiwan to give up the indefinite continuation of the status quo and agree to eventual unification with a timeline. China’s growing nuclear arsenal will generate strong concern over the so-called stability-instability paradox and illuminate the significance of establishing conventional deterrence. The central question regarding conventional deterrence of Chinese armed aggression against Taiwan is whether Taiwan and other parties can credibly demonstrate the necessary will and ability to convince China it has no prospect of succeeding in forced unification with Taiwan. Australia, Japan, and the United States (hereafter “the coalition”), together with Taiwan and other willing and able states, need to send at least three messages to China in credible ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China cannot win a short, sharp war to unify Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China cannot prevail in a protracted war over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s arms buildup will be met with multinational balancing and will not deliver military dominance in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) likely has multiple war plans based on various assumptions. If China assumes unification is possible only by full-scale invasion of Taiwan, achieving the main goal of deterrence and response requires at least three lines of effort: (1) dislodge the invading forces that must cross the Taiwan Strait (deterrence by denial), (2) fend off PLA attacks to destroy coalition forces capable of targeting the invading forces and sustain the war-fighting effort (deterrence by resilience), and (3) continuously gain advantage in the competition with the opponent (deterrence by cost imposition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these lines of effort requires various missions and capabilities. Table 1 illustrates missions and capabilities that potentially contribute to these three types of deterrence; some have been extracted from the 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy. Different countries have different capabilities and are capable of different missions. Ultimately, their decision to use those capabilities and carry out certain missions will be political. However, for the purposes of deterrence, it makes sense to notionally identify typologies of states that will need to implement the missions and employ those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9dVoh8D.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Missions and Capabilities for Deterrence Roles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Table 1, frontline states will need to implement more expansive missions and capabilities (Tier 1), whereas supporting states will focus more on resilience- and denial-related efforts to support frontline states (Tier 2). Backup states will provide functional cooperation (Tier 3) to the frontline and supporting states. These are ideal types of roles for response and deterrence, but the framework permits identifying areas that allow for capability aggregation and require mission coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of Taiwan’s security, the Tier 1 role would need to be played primarily by Taiwan and the United States, while the Tier 2 and 3 roles would likely be played by Australia, Japan, and the United States. Japan assuming a larger share of the Tier 2 and 3 roles would have strategic implications for coalitional deterrence, and certain efforts could be facilitated by trilateral cooperation among Australia, Japan, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections (1) examine how Japan can contribute to credible deterrence messaging and (2) propose ways the coalition can cooperate to reinforce those messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterring-a-short-sharp-war-strengthening-the-coalitions-ability-to-dislodge-the-pla-invasion-force&quot;&gt;Deterring a Short, Sharp War: Strengthening the Coalition’s Ability to Dislodge the PLA Invasion Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Japanese government decided to fundamentally bolster Japan’s defense capabilities. The effort will enable it to carry out limited offensive operations and consequently allow the United States to focus more on the defense of Taiwan and the role of defeating PLA invasion forces. Japan’s decision to fundamentally bolster its defense consists of strengthening seven kinds of capabilities: (1) standoff capabilities, (2) integrated air and missile defense, (3) uncrewed systems, (4) cross-domain operation (mainly space, cyberspace, and electromagnetic) capabilities, (5) command and control and intelligence, (6) logistics and civil defense, and (7) sustainment and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Japan’s defense strategy has involved offensive operations by U.S. forces and defensive operations by Japan (the “American spear” and the “Japanese shield”). However, Japan’s new capabilities, such as counterstrike and active cyber defense, go beyond traditional defensive operations. If realized, these capabilities will enable Japan to assume certain offensive operations, as Japan eventually needs to assume defensive and offensive military operations to defend its territory. This, in turn, will free up U.S. forces previously devoted to the defense of Japan and allow them to concentrate more on the defense of Taiwan. In essence, the division of labor between Japan and the United States will evolve from function based (using the spear and shield to defend Japan) to theater based (Japan defending itself and the United States defending Taiwan). In other words, Japan’s defense capability buildup will allow Japan to assume a larger portion of the Tier 2 role and thereby enable the United States to focus more on the Tier 1 role and enhance overall deterrence vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan should accelerate acquisition of the following capabilities required to fulfill the Tier 2 role: (1) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms in various domains, (2) missiles and platforms capable of long-range precision strikes against PLA Navy ships and PLA Air Force aircraft, (3) missiles and platforms capable of neutralizing the PLA’s ability to wage missile salvo attacks against Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) bases, and (4) a close command and control architecture that will enable effective counterstrike operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s weapons systems and munitions should be interoperable with the United States, Australia, and preferably Taiwan to facilitate wartime sustainment and replenishment. Joint capability development of certain weapons systems such as hypersonic and counter-hypersonic weapons and uncrewed undersea vehicles (UUVs) should be pursued based on common standards to maximize interoperability. Technocratic arguments against Japan joining the second pillar of AUKUS, the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, deserve attention, but Japan’s participation in certain pillar two programs to maximize interoperability makes sense from a strategic point of view. Japan’s information security issues should be cleared as soon as possible to facilitate multipronged efforts to advance joint capability development with the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enduring-in-a-protracted-war-enhancing-resilience-and-sustainment-capacity&quot;&gt;Enduring in a Protracted War: Enhancing Resilience and Sustainment Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s strategic goal in any effort to defend Taiwan is to maintain the capability and the resolve to keep up the fight if deterrence fails. In other words, Japan must have the resilience and endurance required for a protracted conflict. Japan must push forward full steam ahead on national efforts to harden JSDF bases and facilities and rapidly build up gaps in civil defense architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building resilient networks for the JSDF and the Japanese government’s digital systems and critical infrastructure will prove decisive in enduring any conflict involving China. In the event of a crisis or contingency over Taiwan, sophisticated Chinese cyberattacks taking various forms will likely overwhelm Japan’s cyber defense capacity — a major vulnerability in the coalition. Japan needs to rapidly build up its capability for cyber defense both through a robust cyber unit development program and enhanced joint exercises and training with the United States and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During crises, China would very likely conduct information operations to dissuade the Japanese public from supporting U.S. operations to defend Taiwan. China would likely generate a war scare among the Japanese public to break Japanese public resolve; it would also attempt to deepen divisions in Japanese public opinion over the issue of whether and how Japan should get involved in a Taiwan contingency. Australia, Japan, and the United States should advance information sharing about the pattern of Chinese and foreign disinformation, and cooperation in the counter-disinformation realm should also be pursued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area for cooperation is reinforcement of munition production capacity. There should be a major international effort among the United States and its allies — including Australia and Japan — to expand munitions production capacity. To create an environment that encourages further investment by defense companies in production capacity, the governments of Australia, Japan, and the United States should consult on possible demands over the next 5 to 10 years to communicate prospects for munitions procurement to the defense industries of the three countries. Coproduction of certain missiles should move forward without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persistent-and-sustainable-balancing-demonstrating-unity-of-effort&quot;&gt;Persistent and Sustainable Balancing: Demonstrating Unity of Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia, Japan, and the United States should send a signal to China that its arms buildup will be met with multinational balancing. The three countries should coordinate various lines of effort to increase deterrence through joint capability development and mutual reinforcement of resilience and sustainment. Unity of effort among Australia, Japan, and the United States should be demonstrated through joint declarations in appropriate forms. One possible format would be a biannual trilateral foreign and defense ministers’ meeting, or a “2+2+2” meeting. The Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultations (AUSMIN) and Japan-U.S. 2+2 meeting could be held back to back, and the trilateral could be held in between. The process of issuing a joint declaration would compel defense and foreign ministries to coordinate various programs and explore new initiatives aimed at strengthening deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing to build credible conventional deterrence in the Indo-Pacific will compel Australia, Japan, and the United States to depend more on U.S. theater nuclear forces. Consequently, if deterrence fails, the coalition will likely face a stark choice between submission and U.S. nuclear escalation. To maintain strategic options and avoid such an eventuality, conventional deterrence and response must be strengthened and made more credible in a short period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;restoring-balance-in-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;Restoring Balance in the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Teraoka Ayumi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;actions-short-of-violating-one-china-policies&quot;&gt;Actions Short of Violating One China Policies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “status quo” in the Taiwan Strait — broadly defined as Taiwan’s continued de facto independence from mainland China — is increasingly under challenge. Although Beijing likely prefers a peaceful resolution to a costly war in achieving the “reunification” of Taiwan, it is engaging in nonpeaceful measures short of war to coerce the people in Taiwan to accept Beijing’s political demands. Despite Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen’s signals that her government would not seek de jure independence, Beijing closed off dialogues with Taipei by imposing the politically untenable precondition of endorsing the 1992 consensus and working to isolate her government. Now, with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te in May, whom Beijing regards as an even more pro-independent and worse counterpart than Tsai, pathways for the two sides to resume constructive dialogue remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because facts on the ground composing the status quo are far from static, Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington should strengthen ties with Taipei through all measures short of violating or changing their respective One China policies. One primary objective of such efforts is to prevent Beijing from challenging the status quo even further, including through a full-scale military invasion of Taiwan. Another is to restore Taiwan to a state where the government can engage in positive dialogue with Beijing without feeling pressured to concede excessively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recognizing-the-value-of-high-level-visits&quot;&gt;Recognizing the Value of High-Level Visits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Taiwan has become an increasingly popular destination for bipartisan delegations of lawmakers from Australia, Japan, and the United States, among others. Japanese parliamentary delegations to Taipei, often led by the Japan–Republic of China Diet Members’ Consultative Council, have been expanding in size; one comprised the first foreign visitors to congratulate Lai on his victory in the presidential election. In May, more than thirty Japanese lawmakers attended his inauguration ceremony. Since the summer of 2021, the consultative council has held strategic dialogues with legislative representatives from Taiwan and the United States under an initiative led by former Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo and U.S. senator Bill Hagerty. Twice in 2023, the ruling parties in Japan and Taiwan — the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Progressive Party — convened 2+2 meetings involving senior parliamentarians well versed in security and diplomatic issues. High-ranking members of the LDP, such as vice president, Taro Aso, and the then chair of the LDP Policy Research Council, Koichi Hagiuda, visited Taiwan last year. These activities will likely continue regardless of the current domestic political instability in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s subnational actors are also following this trend. Tokyo Metropolitan governor Yuriko Koike visited Taipei in early February to meet with President Tsai, Vice President and President-Elect Lai, and Taipei mayor Chiang Wan-an, who all agreed to enhance cooperation between the two cities. During a meeting with Taiwan’s minister of digital affairs, Audrey Tang, Koike also expressed interest in bolstering cooperation with Taiwan for Tokyo’s digital transformation. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has the tradition of including Taipei in its para-diplomatic outreach, such as the Asian Network of Major Cities 21. As Japan aims to strengthen its informational resilience against cyberattacks and mis-and disinformation operations, including in times of contingencies, its local governments might offer avenues for further cooperation with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of forging and maintaining durable and broad public support for Taiwan in these democratic societies cannot be overstated. In its absence, no costly action in support of Taiwan, whether in peacetime or during contingencies, would be possible for these governments. High-level visits, serving as signs of expanding bipartisan political support for Taiwan, are important in this context and provide moral support for the Taiwanese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tangible-steps-to-enhance-taiwans-resilience&quot;&gt;Tangible Steps to Enhance Taiwan’s Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these visits remain at the level of cheap talk, failing to produce measures to help Taiwan materially or credibly signal to Beijing the resolve of the United States and its partners to defend the status quo around Taiwan. Australia, Japan, and the United States should work to translate their ever-expanding yet relatively low-cost domestic political support for Taiwan into tangible steps toward enhancing Taiwan’s resilience in all dimensions of statecraft, including diplomacy, information, the military, and the economy. Examples include supporting Taiwan’s entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and conducting joint training and intelligence sharing with parts of the Taiwanese government in both traditional and nontraditional areas of security, including space, cyberspace, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, then, is how to realize this shift, since these steps are considered “costly” precisely because they may incite Beijing’s backlash. Two considerations are critical. The first is coordinated strategic communication among Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington to frame any enhanced ties with Taipei as efforts to offset Beijing’s increasingly aggressive postures in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing must receive consistent messages that draw a clear linkage between its behavior and signals of international support for Taiwan. Accordingly, if Beijing credibly softens its position, then these activities must be either curtailed or compensated through other accommodating measures offered to Beijing. Questions about reversibility or offset options must also be considered for various measures of cooperation with Taiwan in case of Beijing’s acquiescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Australia and Japan, as former victims of China’s economic sanctions, should lead efforts — with support from the United States — to build multilateral economic resilience. In anticipation of China’s responses to these countries’ closer ties with Taiwan, they should craft joint countermeasures, such as diversification strategies away from the Chinese market. Taking these steps and publicizing them widely will reduce the psychological impact of possible Chinese economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated strategic messaging among Australia, Japan, and the United States must show (1) that enhanced measures with Taiwan are tied to China’s changing grounds in the Taiwan Strait and (2) that these governments have already thought through countermeasures for China’s economic coercion with great care and coordination. Such messaging will help policymakers navigate domestic politics and garner broader support from other like-minded major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is necessary for pushing forward more sensitive areas of security cooperation with Taiwan but will also be important in the areas of boosting Taiwan’s diplomatic and economic resilience through multilateral forums, especially where the United States is absent. For instance, the CPTPP — which was saved by Japan’s leadership after U.S. withdrawal from its original form, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) — remains one of the most strategic and advanced multilateral trade agreements to enhance the rules-based economic order in the Asia Pacific. To preserve the legitimacy of this new economic institution, Japan, with the help of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, should seriously review China’s and Taiwan’s bids for entry. CPTPP membership does not require statehood, and CPTPP members should act collectively to support Taiwan’s entry based on their fair review of candidate’s readiness and willingness to play by the rules. In this process, CPTPP members open to Taiwan’s entry should also consider establishing a new, smaller multilateral trade framework among themselves as an interim step. Continuous encouragement of U.S. reentry to the CPTPP should also not be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating growing political support for Taiwan into tangible measures despite risk of Chinese retaliations is a signal of regional stakeholders’ resolve to preserve the status quo, the peace and stability in the region, and the rules-based international order. These signals of support should also help the new Lai government navigate its contested domestic political environment and any new opportunities for dialogues with Beijing. Of course, Canberra, Tokyo, and Washington should also coordinate closely with Taipei to maintain shared strategic aims toward Beijing throughout this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-build-a-bridge-over-a-troubled-strait&quot;&gt;To Build a Bridge over a Troubled Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Tokuchi Hideshi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;East Asia, positioned at the forefront of the great power rivalry, is a tinderbox with three nuclear authoritarian states and several flash points, including the Taiwan Strait. Because the region lacks an overarching security framework, a cluster of U.S. bilateral alliances works as the stabilizer. The hub-and-spokes alliance system is becoming more networked than ever but is still not fully integrated. For example, the Japan–South Korea relationship is rapidly improving but remains fragile. The Philippines seems to have made a strategic choice to be tougher on China, but it is uncertain how long this will hold due to the unwillingness of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to make a binary choice between the great powers. Finally, Taiwan, one of the leading regional partners of the United States, is not officially included in the U.S. bilateral alliance network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recent-developments-in-east-asian-international-relations&quot;&gt;Recent Developments in East Asian International Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GROWING PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several new security initiatives in the region include the Quad, a strategic dialogue and cooperation between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, and AUKUS, a strategic security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quad is evolving to engage with other partners, such as France, while AUKUS also has potential to evolve, as AUKUS partners are “considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Japan renewed their Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation in October 2022, which states, “We will consult each other on contingencies that may affect our sovereignty and regional security interests, and consider measures in response.” In May 2023, Japan and the United Kingdom committed themselves “to consult each other on important regional and global security issues and consider measures in response” by issuing the Hiroshima Accord. The partnership between Japan, South Korea, and the United States has new momentum, according to “The Spirit of Camp David” joint statement of August 2023, which announced the three countries’ “commitment to consult with each other in an expeditious manner to coordinate our responses to regional challenges, provocations, and threats that affect our collective interests and security.” This commitment does not necessarily mean joint contingency planning or military action, but their operational cooperation to address common challenges, presumably including Taiwan contingencies, likely will be enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These partners are cooperating more closely than ever, sharing a vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP). Moreover, the vision is evolving, as with Japan’s New Plan for a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” launched by Prime Minister Kishida Fumio in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GROWING ATTENTION TO THE TAIWAN STRAIT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan will remain a focal point of East Asian security because China has the ultimate goal of unification of Taiwan. For China, the Taiwan issue is at the core of its interests. In November 2023, Chinese president Xi Jinping told U.S. president Joe Biden that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. He also reiterated that China will realize unification and that it is unstoppable. Moreover, China has never denied the prospect of forceful unification. A People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officer said that unification is more precious than peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is increasingly important for industrial democracies in the region and the world, though their national interests related to Taiwan may differ. As far as Japan is concerned, Taiwan’s importance is obvious due to its geographical proximity, shared threat perception on China, trade and economic partnerships, and shared fundamental political principles and values. Since the Japan-U.S. joint statement of April 2021, several diplomatic statements have reiterated “the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” including the Australia-Japan Leaders’ Meeting Joint Statement of October 2022, the Japan-NATO joint statement of January 2023, the G7 Hiroshima Leaders’ Communiqué of May 2023, and “The Spirit of Camp David” in August 2023. The Japanese prime minister’s expression that the “Ukraine of today may be [the] East Asia of tomorrow” may allude to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan’s 2024 presidential election, citizens chose the diplomatic path to strengthen their defense, maintain autonomy, and enhance partnerships with other democracies, including Japan and the United States. Taiwan has proved once again to be a mature democracy. As Rory Medcalf argues, “Taiwan is a democratic model in the Chinese-speaking world. It disproves the nonsense that only Western people cherish a free society.” This fact — as well as Taiwan’s continuous pursuit of autonomy, stronger defense posture, and international partnerships to be more resistant to China’s pressure — will make China tougher on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-proposals&quot;&gt;Policy Proposals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. ENGAGEMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous U.S. engagement in the region, buttressed by robust U.S. military presence, is a must to prevent China’s miscalculation. As an alliance requires mutual cooperation, allies must take the lead and help the United States remain engaged in the region. It is particularly important today as the United States remains divided and seems more inward looking. Regional allies, particularly Japan, must provide a more dependable stationing environment for U.S. forces to operate effectively and promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONNECTING SMALL NETWORKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-centered alliance network, the Quad, AUKUS, and Japan-Europe partnerships should align with each other to generate synergy for deterrence, remaining vigilant over the Taiwan Strait. The Quad leaders’ joint statements lack reference to the Taiwan issue. It is important to work with India to ensure that all four Quad partners share recognition of Taiwan as India’s voice grows in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSFORMING SHARED RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN INTO COOPERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. commitment to Taiwan remains ambiguous. Most countries’ cooperation with Taiwan is limited to a nongovernmental or unofficial basis. Provocation of China will not be in their interests. However, it is in their interests to send a clear message to deter China. Western democracies should not be complacent in their shared recognition of the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is more important to transform this recognition into actual cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPANDING INTERNATIONAL BREATHING SPACE FOR TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Taiwan’s international breathing space narrows, the United States and other democracies, including Japan and Australia, should cooperate to prevent Taiwan from being suffocated. First, Taiwan should not be excluded from international organizations tackling global issues such as the World Health Assembly and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Taiwan’s contribution to those issues is indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF) should be utilized more for security purposes. The GCTF is a platform for Taiwan to share its expertise with partners around the world but should be used to help Taiwan enhance its capabilities as well. Several security-related issues, such as network security, media literacy, and humanitarian rescue, are already on the agenda. Nevertheless, the GCTF’s scope should be expanded, and more officials and experts should participate in security cooperation with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the nongovernmental basis for Japan’s relationship with Taiwan should be more flexible. Japan should learn from the practices of unofficial U.S. and Australian engagement with Taiwan and explore the possibility of expanding security partnerships — for example, in the category of people-to-people contacts. As part of this approach, intelligence cooperation using the PAVE Phased Array Warning System (PAWS) should be explored to address the proliferation of ballistic missiles in the region. Also, taking the opportunity to establish a permanent joint headquarters under the defense minister, Japan should craft a mechanism for effective policy and operational coordination with international partners, including Taiwan, as Taiwan contingencies will directly affect Japan’s national security. Japan should expand security-related intellectual exchange by inviting Taiwanese private researchers as visiting scholars in its in-house security think tanks to closely exchange expertise with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBLIC EDUCATION ON TAIWAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Taiwan Strait becomes more unstable and the risk grows, efforts for deterrence are urgently needed. The sense of urgency for deterrence must be shared with the general public so that international partnerships work most effectively. For this purpose, public education on Taiwan — including its geography, history, politics, and economy, as well as the delicate international relations involving Taiwan — must be promoted in the domestic societies of the United States and other democracies, including Japan and Australia. The intellectual communities of those democracies should cooperate in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-ukraine&quot;&gt;Lessons from Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Tsuruoka Michito&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important questions regarding a possible military contingency over Taiwan are whether, to what extent, and in what way the United States would be directly involved in military terms. Put simply, will Washington send its troops to Taiwan? With some exceptions, successive U.S. governments have maintained what is called “strategic ambiguity” regarding the U.S. response to a Taiwan contingency. The case of the war in Ukraine, including Washington’s response, provides a good starting point in exploring the question of U.S. involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden, from the beginning, ruled out the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight against Russia. Despite an unprecedented level of weapons and intelligence assistance to Kyiv, the Biden administration has kept that promise. There are three possible explanations as to why Washington does not send troops to Ukraine: (1) Ukraine is not a NATO member, and the United States does not have an obligation to defend Kyiv; (2) Ukraine is not important enough to U.S. strategic interests; and (3) Russia has nuclear weapons, and the United States does not want to risk a nuclear exchange with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first point, if the United States is not sending troops to Ukraine because Ukraine is not part of NATO and the United States has no obligation to help Kyiv, then Taiwan could be seen as in a slightly better position, in legal terms, than Ukraine. Although the United States does not have a treaty obligation to defend Ukraine, Ukraine has the Budapest Memorandum, which it concluded in 1994 with the United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom when Kyiv agreed to give up all of the nuclear weapons left on Ukrainian soil after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The document gives Ukraine “security assurances,” as the three countries committed to respecting Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity and reaffirmed their “obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force” against Ukraine. However, though the memorandum is an international agreement registered with the United Nations, it failed to be of any use during Russia’s invasion in 2014 when it illegally and unilaterally annexed Crimea and intervened in the Donbas region — or during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States has domestic legislation, not a security treaty, regarding its relationship with Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act calls “any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a “grave concern” to the United States. The act also states it is U.S. policy to maintain the capacity to “resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan.” In terms of legal power, it is not easy to compare the Budapest Memorandum and the Taiwan Relations Act due to their different statuses. Yet, arguably, domestic U.S. legislation has more power to be implemented, as it has an enforcement mechanism, whereas the international community lacks such a mechanism, as has been amply demonstrated. Taiwan, therefore, seems to be in a slightly more advantageous position than Ukraine when it comes to the legal dimension of U.S. commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, assuming Ukraine is not important enough for the United States to send troops, can Taiwan make a case that it is more important and worthy of troops? It must be noted that neither the United States nor any other country requires prior treaty commitment to exercise the right of collective self-defense, as it is enshrined in the United Nations Charter as an “inherent right” of all states. Therefore, if the United States were to determine that sending troops to Ukraine is imperative to its own interests, it could do so as a right rather than as an obligation. The United States has exercised the right of collective self-defense without treaty obligations on such occasions as the liberation of Kuwait or the counter–Islamic State global coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria. It is therefore inaccurate to say that the United States is not able to defend Ukraine because it does not have a security treaty with the country. Washington, if unbeknownst to many Americans, made its decision not to send troops there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Taiwan, its significant semiconductor industry is often mentioned as a reason why defending the island democracy is a strategic imperative for the United States. Yet it cannot be the deciding factor for sending troops there; it would be inconceivable for a U.S. president to send troops to Taiwan to protect semiconductor factories. Arguments related to U.S.-China strategic competition and the international order, by contrast, are more persuasive. The fall of Taiwan would be a huge blow to the U.S.-led international order in the Indo-Pacific region and strategic competition between the United States and China. Given how the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy describes China as the “only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it,” addressing China is, arguably, more strategically important than countering Russia. Taiwan is on the front line of U.S.-China strategic competition, and the stakes seem higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if the real reason that the United States does not send troops to Ukraine is Russia’s nuclear weapons and the risk of nuclear escalation, can Taiwan and others in the region, including Japan, be certain that the United States is prepared and willing to address China’s nuclear weapons? This is an inconvenient and unsettling proposition. On one hand, it may be argued that a line must be drawn between treaty allies such as Japan and partners such as Taiwan. President Biden has repeatedly emphasized U.S. commitment to defend “every inch” of NATO territory. Similarly, the United States has reiterated its nuclear commitment to Japan on numerous occasions. On the other hand, the need to avoid a third world war or nuclear Armageddon, something Biden has often referred to, has caused concerns among U.S. allies. While they agree that a nuclear exchange between nuclear powers must be avoided, for nuclear deterrence to work, nations must be prepared to escalate the situation by demonstrating their resolve to employ nuclear weapons when necessary. Avoiding nuclear escalation at any cost is not a position consistent with the logic of nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the three plausible explanations as to why the United States does not send troops to Ukraine, Taiwan could well make the case that it is in a better position than Ukraine. Nonetheless, the proposition that Russia has nuclear weapons and therefore that Washington needs to be extremely cautious is worrisome. It is in the United States’ interest to dispel such concerns among allies in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. The challenge of countering nuclear-armed adversaries intending to change the status quo by force is hardly new. Yet there is added urgency in tackling this challenge in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and in view of a possible Taiwan contingency vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Yamamoto Katsuya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s elections have ended peacefully, proving once again to the international community that mature democracy has taken root in Taiwan’s civil society. However, China has trumpeted the failure of Taiwan president-elect William Lai to win a majority of votes and the failure of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to retain its majority status in the legislature as evidence to the Chinese people that Taiwanese citizens do not widely support the DPP. This is because an authoritarian regime such as the People’s Republic of China would never allow a robust democracy that could elect a head of state and a majority in the legislature from different parties. However, the fact that the Taiwanese president did not win a majority and the fact that the ruling party did not win the majority in the legislature are not strange situations in a democratic society with the separation of powers. It is also evidence that Taiwan’s civil society has a good sense of balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The election also makes it clear once again that none of the forces in Taiwan want unification with mainland China. The DPP, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), and the Kuomintang (KMT) all campaigned to maintain the status quo. Of course, many Taiwanese citizens, including DPP supporters, have made it clear that they oppose unification as well as independence. When former president Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT said in an interview with German media just before the election that Xi Jinping should be trusted, even the KMT immediately denied it. The majority of the international community also expects Taiwan to maintain the status quo, and President Xi Jinping’s China is the only country in the international community today that strongly advocates for the unification of Taiwan and China. In recent years, Xi Jinping considers even those who support the status quo group to be one of the anti-unification section. As he enters his third term in power, President Xi Jinping will become increasingly active in maneuvering for Taiwanese unification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, Japan, which is adjacent to Taiwan, is the country most affected by developments in the Taiwan Strait and the country most in need of maintaining the status quo. Thus, Japan has two roles to play. The first is to make efforts to maintain the status quo, and the second is to be prepared in case these efforts are not successful and deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-efforts-to-maintain-the-status-quo-and-deter-in-the-taiwan-strait-and-western-pacific&quot;&gt;Japan’s Efforts to Maintain the Status Quo and Deter in the Taiwan Strait and Western Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Japan must strengthen its defense capabilities, which will give more latitude to the activities of U.S. military forces in the Indo-Pacific. It will also give more leeway to U.S. military forces assigned to the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait. In light of recent China-Russia coordination, a conflict in the Taiwan Strait could naturally induce Russia’s activities in Europe. Japan’s strengthening of its defense capabilities will help alleviate European concerns about the Indo-Pacific region. The ability of Europe and Japan to adequately defend themselves in their respective war zones is an important factor in ensuring the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions maintain peace and stability in the international community. Unlike warfare in Europe, all warfare in the Indo-Pacific — whether fighting, evacuation of noncombatants, or trade involving neutral parties — takes place at sea. Thus, the maritime scene in a contingency will be complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, one of the most feasible scenarios for China’s invasion of Taiwan is an economic blockade. The international community, including Japan, should recognize China’s blockade of Taiwan as an act of war. The region where China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are located occupies a pivotal position in the world economy. An economic blockade of Taiwan and the sinking of even one merchant vessel would send shipping insurance rates in the Western Pacific skyrocketing and paralyze maritime trade. The Japanese yen and Chinese yuan would plummet; the Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong stock markets would halt trading; and the international economy would quickly suffer. Vessels engaged in maritime trade are operated by various interests of different nationalities, including ship registries, ship owners, operators, and shipping companies. The Taiwan-related vessels subject to the blockade are also Japan- and Australia-related vessels. Japan needs to make sure President Xi understands that an economic blockade is an act of war against the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is to enhance information sharing among the first island chain. From Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines to Australia, the like-minded partners comprising the archipelago should share a common operational picture (COP) of the region. China’s gray zone and hybrid operations and activities are spread throughout all domains, not just the oceans and cannot be addressed in any one instance alone. In response to China’s activities to attempt to change the status quo, the countries of the first island chain need to share and visualize their COPs and repeatedly appeal to the international community. Japan must emphasize the urgency of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brainstorming-preparing-for-deterrence-failure&quot;&gt;Brainstorming: Preparing for Deterrence Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current international order must be firmly prepared for a new world order after deterrence fails. Even if the Russian invasion of Ukraine ends in Putin’s defeat, a Russia that has regained its strength is bound to turn on Ukraine and the Baltic states again. Thus, after the war in Ukraine, NATO will have to become an even stronger defense alliance against Russia. Similarly, even if China’s invasion of Taiwan fails at least once, China could turn on Taiwan again. Xi Jinping has repeatedly included Taiwan in his concept of national rejuvenation and the “China dream.” In the meantime, the democratic societies of the first island chain must work together to frustrate China’s intention to invade again. The U.S.-Japan alliance and Japan’s role in this new partnership must grow. Brainstorming for this purpose will also be a strong deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering China’s attempts to change the status quo means countering a big nuclear weapons state. It is said that Xi wants to be the Mao Zedong of the twenty-first century, and it would be a nightmare for all if Xi were to follow Mao’s perception regarding the use of nuclear weapons. It is time for Japanese society to seriously debate the effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Hayley Channer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With China’s rise and stated intention to bring Taiwan back under its control, a major conflict in the Indo-Pacific could break out. Australia has multiple stakes in Taiwan’s future, not least the potential for Australia’s closest partners, the United States and Japan, to be drawn into a conflict with wider destabilizing effects. However, in the context of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s increasing gray zone coercion of Taiwan using methods short of war, the policy question of how Australia pursues its relationship with Taiwan and cooperates with the United States and Japan in building Taiwan’s resilience is complicated. There is scope for Australia and Taiwan to elevate their bilateral trade and diversify renewable energy supply chains, thereby increasing Taipei’s resilience and signaling some resolve to withstand CCP pressure. But there are also strategic risks that must be considered and balanced against the opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-dominant-trade-position-with-australia-dissuades-canberra-from-deepening-economic-ties-with-taipei&quot;&gt;China’s Dominant Trade Position with Australia Dissuades Canberra from Deepening Economic Ties with Taipei&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is by no means an inconsequential trade partner for Australia, but it pales in comparison to Australia’s relationship with China. China is Australia’s largest export market, accounting for 35 percent of exports in 2020. In contrast, Taiwan represents Australia’s sixth-largest export market. There is also a large gap between China and all of Australia’s other trade partners. In 2023, China accounted for 26.8 percent of Australia’s two-way trade, and the next-largest partner was Japan with 9.9 percent. Taiwan accounted for only 2.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the large gap between China and Taiwan in Australia’s trade relations, it is common for Australia to have a free trade agreement (FTA) with its major trading partners, which would typically include Taiwan. Australia has FTAs or economic cooperation agreements with China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and India. Taiwan has been lobbying Australia for a more formal economic partnership partly because such agreements provide Taipei with greater international legitimacy and reinforce its independence from China. However, Australia is unlikely to agree to an FTA given the limited practical benefit, as Taiwan currently applies low tariffs on Australia’s main exports of minerals and energy. Further, such an agreement would almost certainly cause relationship damage with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China exerts pressure across all domains — political, military, technological, and social — to dissuade Australia and other countries from entering into FTAs with Taiwan. For this reason, Taiwan has FTAs with only a handful of economies, the largest being New Zealand and the smallest being the Marshall Islands. In response to Canberra taking security and political positions that angered Beijing, Australia has faced punitive trade measures from China since 2018, costing its economy an estimated $31 billion in lost commodity exports. To stabilize relations with China as much as possible, Australia is unlikely to negotiate an FTA with Taiwan that would deliver little trade benefit. However, apart from an FTA, there are other areas where Australia can help Taiwan increase its resilience, such as energy security and the clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy-and-supply-chains-are-a-primary-area-to-enhance-australia-taiwan-cooperation&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy and Supply Chains Are a Primary Area to Enhance Australia-Taiwan Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Taiwan have a strong relationship when it comes to traditional energy security. Taiwan relies heavily on energy imports, and Australia is its largest provider, supplying approximately two-thirds of its coal and one-third of its natural gas. However, beyond Australia exporting more coal and gas to Taiwan, Canberra has an opportunity to strengthen Taipei’s energy security and further Australia’s national priorities by cooperating on renewable energy sources and their supply chains. Plus, further integrating Taiwan into global energy supply chains will increase its value to the international community and complicate China’s calculations in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two areas where deeper Australia-Taiwan cooperation on renewable energy and supply chains would be particularly valuable are hydrogen and lithium-ion batteries. Australian and Taiwanese senior officials have been discussing hydrogen cooperation since at least 2021, when trade ministers from both countries participated in a hydrogen trade and investment dialogue. In 2022, the Australian government also hosted a Taiwanese business delegation to explore hydrogen opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia-Taiwan bilateral cooperation in this area could be expanded to trilateral or even quadrilateral cooperation with Japan and the United States. Australia and Japan have a Clean Hydrogen Trade Program, and Australian and Japanese businesses have been partnering on groundbreaking hydrogen projects. The United States is also heavily investing in hydrogen, including as part of the industrial policy measures contained within the Inflation Reduction Act. Combining Australian, Taiwanese, Japanese, and U.S. efforts on the hydrogen supply chain could streamline individual and bilateral efforts. This could be realized through commencing trilateral or quadrilateral dialogue with officials and industry leaders, progressing to a formal agreement and joint development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other opportunity for greater Australia-Taiwan cooperation is in large-capacity renewable batteries. Demand for lithium batteries, used in electric vehicles (EVs), grid storage, and consumer electronics, is greatly increasing. Taiwan has a growing battery industry, and Australia produces 60 percent of the world’s lithium, which is needed for lithium-ion batteries. Both Australia and Taiwan stand to benefit from cooperation on batteries: Australia from value-added mineral resources, access to Taiwanese technical capabilities, and potentially more Taiwanese investors and customers, and Taiwan through diversifying its battery manufacture, better securing its critical supply chains, and supporting its EV sector. Australia and Taiwan have commenced cooperation on batteries, including an agreement between Taiwanese battery company Aleees and Australia-based mining company Avenira to develop a manufacturing plant for lithium battery cathodes in Australia’s Northern Territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia-Taiwan cooperation on batteries, perhaps expanded to Japan and the United States, has the potential to supplement the global battery supply chain. China currently dominates the mid- and downstream stages of battery processing and manufacture, accounting for approximately 73 percent of global manufacturing capacity in 2023. Should Beijing seek to withhold trade in this sector for political or strategic reasons in the future, it is important that other battery supply chains are developed. At best, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, and the United States could produce a battery supply chain without a production stage in China, reducing Beijing’s ability to weaponize this commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwans-accession-to-regional-trade-pacts-would-aid-its-cause-but-is-currently-unlikely&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Accession to Regional Trade Pacts Would Aid Its Cause but Is Currently Unlikely&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary way Taiwan asserts its agency in the international system is through its membership of country groupings as an “economy.” Taiwan is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) initiative and has applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Other CPTPP members include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, with the United Kingdom expected to be admitted in 2024. Considering Taiwan’s high trade and labor standards, it would be an ideal CPTPP member and accession would hold considerable symbolic importance to Taipei, similar to FTAs but on a larger scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China has also applied for membership. Considering that Beijing is unlikely to reform its economic practices sufficiently to achieve membership, some CPTPP members — concerned about repercussions from China should Taipei be accepted and Beijing rejected — hesitate to accept Taiwan. As the CPTPP is a consensus-based agreement requiring endorsement by all, some members could perpetually delay Taiwan’s application. Although Japan welcomed Taiwan’s bid publicly and Australia would likely support it privately, current circumstances reduce the likelihood of CPTPP membership being an avenue to support Taipei’s resilience. Nevertheless, Australia and Japan should continue lobbying for Taiwan’s accession within the grouping, with the hope of gaining wider support from other CPTPP members in the future. One way to do so would be through an internal CPTPP working group, as Taiwanese diplomats have suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait will be extremely challenging given that China is attempting to change the status quo incrementally through coercion of Taiwan and its partner nations. Beyond Australia’s bilateral relations with Taiwan or coordinating efforts with Japan and the United States, Canberra’s primary interest in Taiwan is stability. However, it may be possible for Australia to work more closely with Taiwan on renewable energy and supply chains in a way that is less escalatory and still supports Taipei’s resilience. While careful calculation is imperative, without some resolve, Australia risks continual backsliding in its relations with Taiwan, to Australia’s detriment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maximizing-australias-subnational-government-and-civil-society-engagement-with-taiwan&quot;&gt;Maximizing Australia’s Subnational Government and Civil Society Engagement with Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By John Fitzgerald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence-and-community-resolve&quot;&gt;Deterrence and Community Resolve&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective diplomatic, economic, and military deterrence requires liberal democracies to show and communicate the willingness of free citizens to bear the costs of deterrence and conflict and associated disruptions to their way of life. An otherwise well-designed deterrence strategy is unlikely to deter if a liberal democracy fails to communicate the resolve of its citizens and the likely choices of its decisionmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a liberal democracy, Australia and its citizens have proved willing to bear the costs of the significant trade penalties China has imposed on them in retaliation for Canberra’s decisions around foreign interference, cyber threats, critical infrastructure, and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Such forceful demonstration of public resolve signals that the people of Australia, no less than their government, are willing to bear the costs of preserving institutional integrity and national sovereignty in the face of foreign coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Australia were to impose economic penalties on the PRC over a Taiwan contingency or to support U.S.-led efforts to assist Taiwan, a similar demonstration of public resolve could not be taken for granted. Such a demonstration would require broader public agreement than exists at present about what is at stake in the Taiwan Strait, why this matters to Australia, what the people of Taiwan want for their future, and why that too matters for Australians. Although Taiwan’s place in the growing geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States receives ample public attention, Australians are seeing and hearing too little about Taiwan itself. Greater public awareness of why Taiwan matters to Australia in the long term, on its own merits, needs to be generated through more extensive and intimate subnational and community ties between the people of Taiwan and Australia. Civil society has a part to play in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-civil-society-and-subnational-government-ties-matter&quot;&gt;Why Civil Society and Subnational Government Ties Matter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan confronts challenges and risks as grave as any country — including pandemics, floods and earthquakes, cybersecurity risks, gray zone disinformation and foreign interference, and possible maritime blockades and invasion — but it faces them without the benefit of international cooperation that risks on this scale normally entail. In view of Taiwan’s exclusion from major international organizations and its difficulties sustaining government-to-government cooperation with countries that recognize the PRC, Taiwan does not enjoy the degree of international cooperation merited by the challenges and risks it faces from one day to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government, irrespective of which party is in office, limits its engagement with the government of Taiwan. Under its One China policy, Canberra publicly opposes unilateral actions on either side of the Taiwan Strait that could undermine peace and stability in the region. It is reluctant to cooperate directly with the government of Taiwan to secure peace and stability through the normal avenues of interagency cooperation, military-to-military liaison, and department-to-department and ministerial-level collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just Taiwan that loses out under this arrangement. Taiwan has much to offer in return for international assistance and support through sharing skills and experience in managing gray zone tactics, cybersecurity, natural disasters, energy transition, and preparation for conflict scenarios. Australia’s subnational governments and civil society do not operate under the same constraints as the federal government and so are in a position to pick up where national government relations leave off, particularly in sharing skills and experience across areas of common concern. They could draw on Taiwan’s experience and expertise to assist Australia in meeting its own challenges around natural disasters and pandemics, cybersecurity, gray zone disinformation, foreign interference activities, and other areas of common concern, at the same time building familiarity through people-to-people ties that would stand both sides in good stead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-taken-and-missed&quot;&gt;Opportunities Taken and Missed&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing stands in the way of creating more extensive subnational and nongovernment ties between Taiwan and Australia. According to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the Australian government “strongly supports the development, on an unofficial basis, of economic and cultural relations with Taiwan, including a range of two-way visits, state, territory and local government contacts, trade and investment opportunities and people-to-people links.” Public opinion polling suggests that Australians of all backgrounds and all walks of life want to assist Taiwan in the event of conflict. Australians share similar democratic values with people in Taiwan, and Australian society is comparable to Taiwan in scale and complementary in its level of social and economic development. The underlying conditions are in place for closer people-to-people and local government engagement between the two societies. What is missing is encouragement, familiarity, and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Taiwan side, foundations, think tanks, and social entrepreneurs show growing interest in engaging with their Australian counterparts. But few comparable efforts are initiated from the Australian side, leading to missed opportunities. Where opportunities are taken, experience shows that expanded community engagement correlates closely with levels of state and local government engagement with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-diaspora-and-beyond&quot;&gt;The Diaspora and Beyond&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The democratic government of Taiwan cannot afford to be naïve about diaspora community engagement given the historical role of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Kuomintang (KMT) party agents in penetrating and mobilizing overseas Chinese (huaqiao) community organizations during the Cold War. Today, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) maintains a diaspora affairs (qiaowu) program in its Bureau of Consular Affairs and under each of the ministry’s five regional departments. These qiaowu bureaus date from the KMT government’s martial law administration during the Cold War, when they competed with CCP United Front agencies to win the hearts and minds of ethnic Chinese overseas. In democratic Taiwan, qiaowu offices have been repurposed from broad outreach programs extending to all Chinese overseas to a narrower role serving a limited range of community and consular functions for Taiwanese overseas. The PRC, by contrast, has stepped up its United Front operations among the Chinese diaspora (including the Taiwan diaspora) to mobilize overseas Chinese in support of China’s claims in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither can Australia afford to be naïve. It is home to around 1.4 million people of Chinese descent, of whom around 80,000 were born in Taiwan or are Australians of Taiwanese descent. Care is needed to reduce the likelihood of disagreement or conflict over Taiwan triggering social fractures and community alienation in Australia. Diaspora issues loom large for Taiwan and Australia in any possible sanctions or conflict scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is space for new institutional initiatives to compensate for the increasingly disproportionate investment in diaspora affairs between the PRC and Taiwan. One way forward is for Australian think tanks and universities to collaborate with nonprofits and think tanks in Taiwan with unrivaled expertise in exposing and analyzing Chinese-language disinformation and interference operations among diaspora communities. Another is for Taiwan and Australia to look beyond the Taiwanese or ethnic Chinese diaspora in search of broader community support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Public interest in Taiwan and the PRC reaches well beyond diaspora communities to include Australians of all backgrounds. Again, such an approach would require wider community familiarity with Taiwan than exists at present and a disproportionate investment in local government and community ties by Australians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwan-outreach-australian-response&quot;&gt;Taiwan Outreach, Australian Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, public diplomacy programs aimed outside the diaspora are largely confined to development assistance programs in a small cohort of countries with official ties. To the author’s knowledge, no agency or program is responsible for supporting people-to-people ties with countries lacking formal diplomatic relations but wishing to expand and intensify their social, cultural, and community links with Taiwan. Rather than engage directly with broader community or civil society organizations in countries such as Australia, the Taiwanese government prefers to outsource this work to nongovernment brokers such as think tanks and other civil society organizations through outreach to leaders and elites from friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Taiwan’s think tanks have been quick to take advantage of their government’s New Southbound Policy to reach out to Australia. The Prospect Foundation and the Taiwan Asia Education Foundation (TAEF) routinely invite Australian political leaders and experts to participate in their high-profile annual forums. Former Australian prime ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, and Scott Morrison have each taken the opportunity to deliver keynote addresses at major think tank forums in Taipei. Turnbull accepted an invitation to chair the International Advisory Council of the Center for Asia-Pacific Resilience and Innovation (CAPRI), a recently established independent think tank. And Doublethink Lab, arguably the region’s most capable nongovernment body focusing on Chinese government interference and cyber operations globally, has closely covered the Australian experience in countering foreign interference. Taiwanese think tank publishing arms also provide ample coverage of Australia, including the first major study of Australian relations with Taiwan to appear in print in many years, Taiwan and Australia: Advancing the Partnership of Four Decades, published in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiatives taken by Taiwan actors are highly significant, and the willingness of Australian invitees to accept their invitations is reassuring. Yet few comparable brokers or initiatives have emerged from the Australian side to create closer engagement with counterparts in Taiwan. A proportionate Australian response would match new initiatives coming out of Taiwan one for one. A disproportionate response would make maximum use of the space allowed to local government and civil society under Australia’s One China policy to fill gaps in national government engagement with Taiwan created by adherence to that policy. Australia’s independent civil society organizations and state and local governments could do more and are well placed to do more, but they need a dedicated platform to provide brokerage in Australia comparable to that exercised by think tanks in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government approves of people-to-people ties with Taiwan, as well as trading relations and local government relations. In some cases, it offers direct support — for example, by providing opportunities and funding for Australian graduates to work and study in Taiwan under the New Columbo Plan. Australia also participates directly in the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF), a government-to-government platform for sharing expertise and experience with Taiwan and selected partners on matters of common concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth has few programs advocating for stronger ties at the subnational level or promoting civil society engagement with Taiwan, though plenty of resources are available. DFAT houses a public diplomacy initiative with annual grant programs supporting cultural diplomacy and Indigenous diplomacy, both highly relevant to Taiwan. DFAT also provides generous funding for people-to-people initiatives with Greater China, including Taiwan, through its National Foundation for Australia-China Relations. But in practice, few government grants support Taiwan-related initiatives. The Commonwealth could usefully channel more of these resources toward subnational and nongovernment initiatives relating to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some state and local governments are building closer community ties and investment pathways with Taiwan. Queensland’s trade and investment office in Taipei is the sole Australian state office based in Taiwan and is reputed to be the largest subnational government office on the island. In recent years, the Queensland office claims to have attracted several hundred million dollars of talent investment in support of science, technology, and industry development in Queensland, particularly in biomedical research and development. Six of Australia’s seven active sister-city links with Taiwan are based in Queensland. Cities in Taiwan also cooperate with the state through clusters of local city links organized through networks supporting smart city and Asia-Pacific city linkages. The state’s Taipei office assists with civil society partnerships as well, some of which go back decades. It also facilitates relations with state cultural institutions, including Brisbane’s QAGOMA Asia Pacific Triennial, which hosts major exhibitions of Taiwan art and culture. Other Australian states and territories are missing out. The state government of Victoria has few links with Taiwan and no personnel in Taiwan, and in consequence the state hosts no sister-city links or relations with major cultural institutions in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is growing interest among universities to collaborate in research and teaching and in support of Indigenous diplomacy. There is further scope for university collaborations on diaspora affairs, including cooperation with specialist nonprofit research organizations such as Taiwan’s Doublethink Lab, a world leader in research and communication around foreign interference and cyber operations among sinophone communities in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charities customarily link communities and countries by providing routine assistance within communities (including diaspora communities) and by reaching out internationally to provide relief as needed. Taiwan is a special case. As a rule, charities and foundations that work in the PRC do not operate in Taiwan, and those that operate in Taiwan have no presence in the PRC, with few exceptions. Absent recognition from international charities based elsewhere, people in Taiwan have found additional incentives to establish independent charities to conduct charitable work comparable to that of large international charities at home and abroad, such as the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families and the Tzu Chi Foundation. The latter operates in Australia and the PRC. In the 1950s and 1960s, some Australian charities assisted the families of war orphans in Taiwan, but to the author’s knowledge, none has taken the opportunity to launch new initiatives in cooperation with Taiwan in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan offers unique opportunities for Australian chapters of international service clubs. As a rule, international service clubs have a negligible presence in the PRC and hence face few risks to assets or personnel arising from engagement with counterparts in Taiwan. Rotary International, for example, runs a large chapter network in Taiwan that is active in supporting local charities and providing international development assistance. Rotary is also very active in Australia. In 2023, several hundred delegates from Taiwan attended the annual Rotary International convention in Melbourne. Local chapters of Australian service clubs, such as Lions, Rotary, Apex, and Probus, could expand contacts and exchanges more systematically — for example, by providing local support in rural and regional Australia, where thousands of young Taiwanese labor in farms, abattoirs, and warehouses on working holiday visas with little connection to local residents. Local chapters of service clubs could offer similar assistance to visiting Australian students in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interoperability&quot;&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability matters in every deterrence domain. Military deterrence requires interoperability among national armed forces. Cybersecurity demands interoperability of data and security systems. Interoperability of financial systems is essential for cross-border cooperation in tackling financial crime and international terrorism. And interoperability among police forces, coast guard services, and development agencies is a high priority in planning for coordinated emergency responses in the Indo-Pacific. Timely attention should be paid to interoperability among civic institutions wishing to cooperate with Taiwan across national borders, including possible cultural, legal, and regulatory hurdles limiting cross-border cooperation among charities, foundations, service clubs, and other civic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil society is well placed to play expanded roles in Taiwan’s relations with countries in the region after basic questions are resolved about who can do what, where, and how. Answering these questions calls for basic research into: (1) the compatibility of legal and regulatory frameworks for Australian charities, foundations, and nonprofits wishing to work in Taiwan; (2) which Australian charities, clubs, societies, and other civil society institutions can work in Taiwan, which cannot, and why; and (3) which Australian charities, clubs, societies, and civil society institutions would be willing to cooperate with counterparts in Taiwan and what it would take to get them started. Parallel research could be usefully undertaken in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-a-disproportionate-effort&quot;&gt;Conclusion: A Disproportionate Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian government takes no position on the issue of Taiwan’s sovereignty, but it opposes the use of violence to resolve the issue. It works with allies and partners to deter conflict by building capability, establishing credibility, and communicating resolve to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For effective deterrence, democratic countries need to communicate to all concerned that their people, not just their government and policy specialists, have the understanding and resolve to bear the costs of deterrence. To this end, communities need to understand what is at stake in Taiwan, why it matters, and what Taiwan’s forceful incorporation into the PRC could mean for their well-being and prosperity. Liberal democracies need to bolster communication around deterrence by building community resilience and communicating national resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia, local governments and civil society have key roles to play in this effort. The Australian government is constrained by its One China policy commitments. Subnational governments and civil society are less constrained, but through misunderstanding and want of encouragement, they often refrain from engaging with their counterparts in Taiwan as deeply and often as they could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building public knowledge and understanding about Taiwan requires disproportionate effort by Australia’s subnational governments and nongovernment organizations, consistent with their missions and resources, to engage with counterparts in Taiwan, develop mutual support networks, counter gray zone tactics used to undermine public resolve, and find practical ways to assist each other in any crisis. Ahead of any crisis, this requires building connections and ensuring interoperability among subnational and nongovernment players in the region to facilitate more extensive communications and intensive people-to-people ties. These players include states, provinces, and cities; charities, philanthropies, and nonprofits; universities and schools; clubs and associations; faith-based groups; sporting leagues; educational and cultural institutions; and think tanks, among others. Building routine connections between people and organizations in Australia and Taiwan promises immediate benefits to both while building and communicating resolve to assist one another in a time of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-information-battle-and-taiwan-strait-security&quot;&gt;The Information Battle and Taiwan Strait Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Benjamin Herscovitch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is using a vast array of tools of statecraft to shift the cross–Taiwan Strait status quo in its favor. Among other policy levers, Beijing is regularizing the presence of the People’s Liberation Army around Taiwan, stepping up its efforts to exclude Taipei from international organizations, and both punishing and rewarding the Taiwanese people with a mixture of economic coercion and inducements. As well as calibrated U.S. and allied responses to these and other examples of China’s statecraft, preserving stability in the Taiwan Strait demands action in the information domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s global information campaign against Taiwan has two major components: (1) the spread of disinformation about the international status of Taiwan and the One China policies of various countries, and (2) the reshaping of various countries’ positions on Taiwan to bring them in line with Beijing’s One China principle. According to this principle, Taiwan is, inter alia, “an inalienable part of China.” By propagating the idea that Taiwan is by right, and so should be in practice, part of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Beijing’s information campaign is incrementally creating an international environment more conducive to China’s eventual annexation of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-disinformation-about-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s Disinformation about Taiwan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China spreads disinformation by regularly making erroneous claims about history, international politics, and other countries’ policies. Although the PRC has never ruled Taiwan and imperial Chinese dynasties had either incomplete or, in most cases, little to no political control or influence on the island, Beijing nevertheless incorrectly claims that the island “has been an integral part of China’s territory since ancient times.” Beijing also frequently misrepresents the 1943 Cairo Communiqué by claiming that it declared Formosa/Taiwan should be returned to China, when it actually stipulated that the island should be returned to the Republic of China, or China as ruled by the nationalist Kuomintang, not the PRC as ruled by the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China deceptively claims that UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 affirms “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory.” But this UN resolution makes no mention of Taiwan’s status; it is solely concerned with transferring China’s representation in the United Nations from Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang government to the PRC. As with China’s false claims about Chinese and Taiwanese history and the Cairo Communiqué, the disinformation regarding this UN resolution seeks to internationalize and legitimize Beijing’s One China principle and the PRC’s claim to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also spreads disinformation by misrepresenting various countries’ One China policies as versions of Beijing’s One China principle. Numerous states subscribe to different configurations of One China policies that recognize the PRC as the sole legal government of China without also endorsing Beijing’s view that Taiwan is a province of the PRC. Despite this, the Chinese government routinely asserts that its One China principle is “a universal consensus of the international community.” China also regularly seeks to deceive the public about the One China policies of other governments. For example, Chinese diplomats in Australia have published a series of op-eds in major Australian newspapers and local Chinese-language media in 2022–24 falsely claiming that Canberra is committed to Beijing’s view that Taiwan is a province of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;propagating-beijings-one-china-principle&quot;&gt;Propagating Beijing’s One China Principle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also successfully persuading countries to willingly sign on to its One China principle via less deceptive methods. As countries shift their state-to-state relations from Taiwan to the PRC or upgrade already established ties with Beijing, the Chinese government is persuading them to endorse its One China principle via communiqués and joint statements. Countries that recently switched recognition to China, including Kiribati and Solomon Islands in 2019, Nicaragua in 2021, Honduras in 2023, and Nauru in 2024, have agreed to joint communiqués that formally and fulsomely support Beijing’s view that Taiwan is an inalienable part of PRC territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Chinese government is persuading countries to endorse Beijing’s One China principle when they expand or upgrade ties. For example, the 2023 joint statement between Timor-Leste and China establishing a comprehensive strategic partnership included a clause stipulating “firm adherence to the one-China principle.” This was a dramatic shift toward Beijing’s position, considering that previous bilateral messaging had referred to a One China policy without specifying that Timor-Leste would regard Taiwan as an “inalienable part of the Chinese territory” and oppose “any form of ‘Taiwan independence.’” Timor-Leste is just one of many countries that have been persuaded in recent years to embrace China’s position on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing stepped up its efforts to internationalize its One China principle after Taiwan’s 2016 election of a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) president, and the Chinese government is unlikely to wind back this push following the reelection of a DPP candidate in January 2024. With Beijing signing more capitals up to its One China principle as they either sever state-to-state ties with Taipei or upgrade existing relations with the Chinese government, the number of nations that formally subscribe to the One China principle is likely to increase further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-should-be-done&quot;&gt;What Should Be Done?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China probably cannot annex Taiwan simply by shifting international official and public opinion and the particulars of the One China policies of a range of countries. But Beijing likely understands that its efforts to isolate and eventually take control of Taiwan will be aided if more countries and publics can be won over to the Chinese government’s view that the island is a province of the PRC. To preserve stability in the Taiwan Strait, Australia, Japan, the United States, and other like-minded states should counteract China’s efforts to spread Taiwan disinformation and propagate its One China principle by doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jointly and individually rebut the Chinese government’s disinformation about Chinese and Taiwanese history, the Cairo Communiqué, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, and international support for Beijing’s One China principle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide private support and advice to other states regarding the options available to them as they consider how to articulate their positions on Taiwan and emphasize that they need not adopt Beijing’s One China principle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use ministerial speeches and official statements to more regularly reassert the latitude that states enjoy to engage with Taiwan under their respective One China policies and, where necessary, rebut examples of Chinese government disinformation about these policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforce via official government messaging to their publics, subnational governments, and private sectors that extensive and deep engagement with Taiwan in the trade, investment, political, cultural, people-to-people, and other arenas is entirely consistent with maintaining One China policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calibrated military responses from the United States and its allies are essential for preserving stability in the Taiwan Strait. But hard power is not enough. The fight to maintain the status quo of a de facto independent liberal democracy in Taiwan will be jeopardized if like-minded countries cede the information domain to China. Just as it would be better from China’s point of view to take Taiwan without having to fight, other countries can foreclose the possibility of such an easy victory by ensuring that Beijing does not win the world over to its view that Taiwan is simply a province of the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-the-united-states-and-japan-can-support-taiwans-resilience&quot;&gt;How Australia, the United States, and Japan Can Support Taiwan’s Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Huong Le Thu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how to enhance Taiwan’s resilience, it is essential to know what resilience is. Resilience is defined as “the will and ability to withstand external pressure and influences and/or recover from the effects of those pressures or influences.” NATO considers resilience its first line of deterrence and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan faces pressure on all fronts: an increasing threat of military invasion, relentless intimidation and gray zone provocations, challenges to its domestic affairs through campaigns of mis- and disinformation, and attempts to take advantage of its open democratic system. Furthermore, like any other country, Taiwan faces frequent natural disaster risks characteristic of its geographical position, such as earthquakes, cyclones, and floods. As such, the country has long taken steps to prepare its citizens to play responsible roles in the face of frequent crises. Resilience is key to national comprehensive defense. Taiwan’s primary concept of resilience — preparing the population’s response to any disaster — also hardens it to the external pressures of a stronger adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an International Crisis Group analysis, China’s preferred scenario in the event of an armed invasion would be a lightning war that quickly subdues the population before any outside power can come to the island’s aid. U.S. intervention cannot be presumed, particularly as uncertainty mounts around the results of the November 2024 U.S. presidential election. In a contingency of an armed invitation, Taiwan needs to have the capacity to hold out until military support from the United States can be mobilized. Today, Taiwan is not optimally postured to do that. While the cross-strait military balance of power overwhelmingly favors China in quantitative and qualitative terms, Taiwan can still take steps to improve its position, such as investing in its asymmetric capabilities. Hence, Australia, Japan, and the United States need to support Taiwan’s efforts to make these investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s primary goal is to win without fighting, then the primary battlefield is not necessarily military but psychological: China must subdue the spirit of the Taiwanese people and their desire to resist Beijing. Victory is achieved through consistent long-term operations enabled by information technology, making China’s strongest weapon its mis- information and disinformation campaigns. Hence, protection of Taiwan’s cyber infrastructure becomes a primary priority. For a democratic society, managing the challenges of misinformation must be balanced with liberal values that safeguard the open flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-resilience-through-early-preparation&quot;&gt;Increasing Resilience through Early Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an invasion, China would almost certainly conduct cyber and electromagnetic attacks to disrupt Taiwan’s ability to communicate. The island will need to strengthen its infrastructure to ensure it can remain connected to the outside world after the first waves of attack. Reducing energy dependency by stocking more fuel reserves will also be important. Given the potential power crunch the island faces in 2025 with the planned closure of its last two nuclear reactors, Taipei should consider postponing the shutdowns as well as expanding its liquified natural gas (LNG) storage capacity. The same logic applies to other critical supplies such as food and medicine. Taiwan has achieved only 31.3 percent self-sufficiency in food, and it imports about 50 percent of its active pharmaceutical ingredients from China. It should quickly find ways to replenish its stores. A greater investment in civil defense preparedness, building on past civil society initiatives, would also be wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital resilience should include reinforcing the access of officials and public figures to communications networks, securing essential databases, developing alternative communications pathways to international audiences, and improving the physical security and cybersecurity of terrestrial infrastructure. A 2023 RAND Corporation report showed that China had gathered intelligence on nearly 300,000 points of interest (POIs) in Taiwan, including 550 POIs containing the locations of such network infrastructure as cable landing stations, internet service provider facilities, and mobile telephone facilities. Another 2,397 POIs detail the location of local, provincial, and government offices. These facilities could be targeted in advance and destroyed by rocket artillery or captured by special operators emerging on the first day of the attack. The case of Ukraine has shown the value of using satellites to link disconnected local networks, particularly when hard infrastructure is likely to be vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar alternative could be arranged in Taiwan by linking very small aperture terminals (VSATs) to 5G base stations in a variety of locations. As the terrestrial connections to core networks are severed, groups of 5G base stations could form edge networks and use VSATs to interconnect them. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would almost certainly hit electrical generation early in a conflict. Taiwan will need to prepare backup power sources for its edge and core networks and construct duplicate cable landing stations at alternative locations, at least for the highest-priority government agencies and military units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increasing-the-robustness-of-taiwans-satellites&quot;&gt;Increasing the Robustness of Taiwan’s Satellites&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an island nation such as Taiwan, satellites are the most feasible — albeit much less capable — substitute for submarine cables. Satellites cannot replace the enormous capacity of submarine cables, but they can connect high-priority fixed and mobile users, including government leaders, private citizens, and military units and the organizations and industries that support them. However, this option is complicated and deserves closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both government-owned and commercial communications satellites cover Taiwan and the air and sea lanes surrounding the island. Communications satellites owned by the United States and other governments are mostly in geostationary orbit (GEO), while commercial communications constellations operate in low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and GEO. The RAND report showed that a total of 182 communications satellites lie in the portion of the GEO arc visible from Taiwan. Of these, 63 are operated by commercial constellations based in countries likely to be sympathetic with Taiwan if China attacks it. The U.S. government and the governments of allied nations also operate 32 communications satellites that could provide coverage to users in Taiwan, including four wideband global system (WGS) satellites. Each WGS satellite can provide 500 megahertz of X-band capacity and 1,000 megahertz of military Ka-band capacity, which is at a higher frequency than commercial Ka band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has demonstrated direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons capable of destroying LEO satellites. It also has maneuverable satellites that could act as space mines by exploding near a GEO satellite and showering it with debris. The U.S. Department of Defense judges that China might also be improving its ground-based lasers to cause structural damage to LEO satellites and might be developing a new ASAT weapon to strike GEO satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government could help by providing some capacity from the four WGS satellites operating within view of Taiwan. Partners should consider supporting Taiwan by using commercial and military satellites for priority Taiwanese government, military, and civilian communications in the presence of heavy jamming attacks. Australia, Japan, and the United States can work closely with commercial providers to regularly practice shifting communications among satellites. Partners could support developing protocols to grant access to lower-priority public offices, businesses, and individuals on an as-needed or as-available basis. They could assist with providing a diversity of options to deploy mobile generators to maintain electrical power for critical satellite terminals. Moreover, a long-term approach to capacity building should be considered — including, for example, student training programs and research and development collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trilateral support in information capacity resilience is not without challenges when it comes to the restrictive and sensitive nature of information protection. Support for capacity building should be long term; it requires commitment from three governments and must be binding enough to sustain the changes in electoral cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-resilience&quot;&gt;Energy Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy security is national security. Energy dependence, laid bare after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, limited many European and NATO members in their security decisions. Energy resilience is of critical importance in preventing the swift takeover of Taiwan by Beijing. Right now, Taiwan is not optimally prepared: it imports 97.3 percent of its energy. Building the energy system’s resilience will depend on expanding storage capacity for the stockpiling of oil, coal, and natural gas as well as effective planning for the rationing and efficient redirection of energy to critical sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the resilience of critical infrastructure not only increases Taiwan’s ability to withstand coercion but also helps deter a blockade. Coal is particularly suited to enhancing resilience during a blockade due to its high energy density, ability to be stored either on- or off-site, and capacity to be dispatched as needed. Data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) maintains that Taiwanese oil stockpiles surpass 100 days. Taipower, the state-owned electricity company, is investigating potential sites to store enough coal to generate up to 50 days of electricity, and MOEA has reported that coal inventories will increase in the coming years. CPC Corporation, Taiwan’s state-owned petroleum and natural gas company, has plans to install additional storage tanks at each of Taiwan’s three LNG terminals to achieve a 24-day storage capacity by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;democratic-resilience&quot;&gt;Democratic Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of Taiwan’s ability to sustain a potential blockade and other war scenarios is the spirit of the nation. Taiwan is at the center of Chinese interference operations and attempts, and infiltration by Chinese intelligence and subversion actors is at an all-time high, as demonstrated during the January 2024 election. Yet the robustness of Taiwan’s election procedures and results has affirmed confidence in the island’s societal and democratic resilience. This is not pure luck but a result of a crafted system designed to recognize and respond to disinformation. Success is based on a decentralized network that relies equally on civic responsibility as well as media and information organizations, think tanks, fact-checking platforms, and general education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience against subversion is the most critical element, albeit the hardest to grasp, in the island’s long-term future. Hardly any other country has such acute awareness of China’s sharp power as Taiwan. Partners in the region can often learn more from Taiwan than Taiwan can learn from them in this regard. But continuous support in defending democratic resilience needs to become a staple going forward as the sophistication of influence operations and frequency of disinformation campaigns only increase. The acute awareness among the Taiwanese people of the critical role of civic responsibility to their nation’s resilience may also hold lessons of value for the United States, Japan, Australia, and other like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-could-do-much-more-to-deter-beijing-and-support-taiwan&quot;&gt;How Australia Could Do Much More to Deter Beijing and Support Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Lavina Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2024 ASEAN-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne in March, Australian foreign minister Penny Wong stated that the region is facing its “most confronting circumstances in decades,” including the expansion of military power without “measures to constrain military conflict,” “unsafe actions at sea” and in the air, and militarization of “disputed features,” noting that a major conflict in the region would be devastating. Her solutions were threefold: (1) leader-level and military-to-military dialogue between the United States and China; (2) a commitment to build “preventive infrastructure to reduce the risk of crisis, conflict and war by accident”; and (3) investments in military capability to deter a conflict. Diplomatic dialogue and building institutional frameworks to manage inadvertent escalation can be useful tools of statecraft if an adversary is content with the status quo and open to both. In other circumstances, military deterrence is essential to preventing conflict in the Taiwan Strait and other regional flash points in the South and East China Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wong’s strategic appraisal of the increasing risk of conflict reflects the assessments made in Australia’s 2024 National Defence Strategy, 2023 Defence Strategic Review (DSR) and 2020 Defence Strategic Update. In all three documents, Canberra assessed that Australia would no longer have warning time for a major attack on its territory or military assets and that there was an urgent need to develop enhanced deterrence-by-denial capabilities to prevent this from occurring. The DSR recommends changes to defense force structure and force posture to enhance Australia’s capabilities as well as support U.S. and allied force projection, also for the purposes of deterrence. This approach continues under the just released 2024 National Defence Strategy, which explicitly acknowledges that the “risk of a crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait is increasing.” The U.S.-Australia alliance and the AUKUS partnership are key to Australia’s development of deterrence-by-denial capabilities in the short and long terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s intent to advance its deterrence-by-denial capabilities — alone and with the United States and partners such as Japan — is the most effective response to increasing Chinese belligerence and coercion toward Taiwan. Stability in the Taiwan Strait can come only from deterrence, and deterrence is possible only with a favorable military balance of power and demonstration of capability, readiness, and willingness to act. Over its history, China has likely learned that long wars are disastrous, and the uncertain end to Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine may encourage China to have greater patience in its ambition of “reunification” with Taiwan. This gives Australia, Japan, the United States, and other like-minded partners a narrowing window of time to organize and develop capabilities for credible deterrence. However, any failure to do so urgently undercuts the credibility of strategic pronouncements about the growing risk of regional conflict and will increase instability in the Taiwan Strait. In short, China will be watching progress on this front and making assessments of both capability and resolve as it continues to expand and modernize its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, already a growing gap between the dire strategic assessments made in recent Australian defense policy reviews and Canberra’s willingness to commit to the necessary increases in defense expenditure or to make speedy and effective decisions on defense capability, posture, planning, and readiness. While U.S. intelligence reports that Chinese president Xi Jinping has asked the People’s Liberation Army to be ready to annex Taiwan by 2027, none of the Australian government’s current procurement decisions will significantly contribute to the deterrence of China before the end of the decade. At the earliest, Australia will receive its first Virginia-class submarine after 2032 and the first of six new Hunter-class frigates in 2034. Given the history of cost blowouts and delays in Australian defense procurement programs, the surface fleet is unlikely to grow in size until the mid-2030s. Further, Australia’s plans to acquire long-range strike capabilities depend on an expansion in U.S. defense industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Australian government works to stabilize its relationship with China, it also avoids speaking plainly to the public about the real risks of conflict, Australia’s interests in contributing to deterrence, supporting the U.S.-Australia alliance, and the economic and strategic consequences for Australia should war occur. In these circumstances, it becomes difficult to politically justify major procurement decisions such as AUKUS and the much-needed expansion in the defense budget. Indicative of the current government’s real commitment to deterrence, defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is predicted to increase from 2.0 percent in 2023–24 to 2.4 percent by 2033–34. Only an extra AUD 5.7 billion $3.8 billion) will be added to the defence budget over the next four years. Australia will only be able to make a meaningful military contribution to strategic stability in the Taiwan Strait after around 2033 — apart from having a useful strategic geography and making contributions to allied signals intelligence through joint defense facilities such as Pine Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting these worrying shortcomings aside, nonmilitary forms of deterrence can also make an important contribution to deterrence and strategic stability in the Taiwan Strait. Like other regimes, the Chinese Communist Party will base its decision to use force not only on military calculations but also on nonmilitary factors such as the impact on regime security and the personal interests and calculations of President Xi. Existing research identifies a range of nonmilitary costs that could be imposed on China should it choose the path of war, such as economic, diplomatic, institutional, and reputational consequences. A great lesson from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is the failure of the United States and European countries to signal their firm resolve to impose broad-based sanctions on Russia to influence and deter Moscow’s cost-benefit calculations. In the case of deterring Beijing, the choice between “national rejuvenation” and taking Taiwan by intimidation or force must be made clearer (i.e., that both are not possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More could also be done to increase and support Taiwan’s international relevance and counter China’s efforts to restrict Taiwan’s interactions with the international community. The greater Taiwan’s economic role and presence in the world are, the more prosperous it becomes and the more resources it will have to defend itself, contributing to strategic stability. More comprehensive engagement with Taiwan by more countries means that the risks and costs for China of military action increase. This should include support for Taiwan’s membership of international organizations where statehood is not a requirement for accession, renewed efforts to form bilateral trade agreements, and Taiwan’s accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which directly counters China’s ability to use economic levers of coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Australia’s approach of stabilizing diplomatic relations with China is preventing it from contributing to the nonmilitary aspects of deterrence. The government under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was prepared to pay a high price to clear a path for his November 2023 meeting with President Xi, dropping or suspending cases against China in the World Trade Organization (WTO) for imposing coercive trade sanctions from 2020 on a range of Australian goods — cases Australia likely would have won. Moreover, Canberra was slow to protest China’s use of sonar near an Australian frigate upholding the UN sanctions regime against North Korea in international waters, which injured four navy divers; it did so only after domestic political pressure. Renewed dialogue did not spare Yang Hengjun, an Australian human rights and democracy activist, from receiving a suspended death sentence by a Chinese court in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canberra has shown no interest in pushing Taiwan’s membership of the CPTPP and has given mixed messages about its eligibility to join. Neither has it sought to expand bilateral trade or intergovernmental engagement with Taipei. It may be some time before Australian leaders realize that stabilizing relations with China — a country that relies on escalation, intimidation, and tactical surprise — is a difficult, if not impossible, task. Rather, the more one concedes to Beijing, the more it demands. In the meantime, Australia is avoiding confrontation with Beijing and has little appetite to lead on widening Taiwan’s international space. In doing so and avoiding strong pushback against coercive behavior by Beijing, it fails to contribute to deterrence or stability in the Taiwan Strait through important nonmilitary tools of statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-dangerous-balancing-act&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Dangerous Balancing Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Richard McGregor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any ordinary democracy, the results of Taiwan’s January 2024 election would have heralded an era of continuity in politics, with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate winning a third consecutive term in the presidential palace. But continuity in Taiwan’s domestic politics conveys neither certainty, nor stability, nor peace, as Beijing will not accept the current status quo on an island it regards as its own sovereign territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPP’s roots in the island’s independence movement and its refusal over the last eight years to sign on to Beijing’s required One China formulations make the ruling party an avowed foe of China’s ruling communists. Beijing’s dark view of the DDP and its president-elect, Lai Ching-te (William Lai), will ensure that Beijing retains pressure on the ruling party through various means until it gets its way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of such ongoing pressure, Taiwan needs the same support from like-minded members of the international community as it did before the election. The essential elements of its survival are the same as well: a combination of internal resilience and external options, both necessary to ensure it retains a say in its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners are indispensable in this respect, but it goes without saying that outsiders can only do so much. The Taiwanese political system has to commit to using its own powerful economic and technological qualities to build the strength it needs for its own defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting Beijing’s actions in the immediate aftermath of the election requires context, most notably an attempt to understand how Chinese president Xi Jinping and the Politburo view the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPP did not enter the election with wind in its sails. After two four-year terms, the party’s standing suffered from the wear and tear of many long-standing governments. The party was also hurting due to domestic factors such as inflation, high housing prices, and shortfalls in staple foods such as eggs. However, the DPP’s greatest asset in the campaign was the disarray among the opposition candidates. If the DPP is the anti-China party, the opposition groupings collectively represented the “anti-anti-China parties.” Although both the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) oppose the DPP’s China policies, they cannot back policies that embrace Beijing in any real fashion because doing so is electoral poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the months prior to the election, Beijing’s interlocutors were fatalistic in private about the likelihood of a DPP victory and straightforward in saying such a result would almost certainly provoke a military response. That bellicose messaging moderated slightly in the weeks leading up to polling day, when the parties and candidates opposed to the DPP tried, and then spectacularly failed, to form a winning coalition for the presidency. Although a military response might still come, the expectation of large-scale exercises effectively blockading the island, as happened after the visit to Taiwan by then U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi in August 2022, has not come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a large display of force, Beijing has settled on calculated small-scale incursions near the island, seemingly designed to keep the incoming Lai administration on the back foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Chinese coast guard officials off the small island of Kinmen, near Fujian Province, boarded a Taiwan tourist boat, the first time such an interdiction has happened. People’s Liberation Army Navy research ships increased their patrols off Taiwan’s east coast, heralding a sharp uptick in such incursions. Beijing mounted another calculated psychological incursion in the diplomatic arena as well, announcing in the days after the election that the tiny Pacific island of Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Beijing has attempted to keep the incoming president off balance and under pressure ahead of his inauguration while retaining room for escalation both before and after the ceremony in May. Beijing may have taken some solace and thus may have acted with a modicum of restraint because the DPP did not win a majority in the parliament, the Legislative Yuan, in the January election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KMT and TPP, if they join forces, can now block DPP legislation. In such a scenario, there will be ample opportunities for Beijing to sow instability in Taiwanese politics, long one of its core aims. Still, the underlying reality of Taiwanese domestic politics is that the population overwhelmingly supports the island’s current governing arrangements of de facto independence from China, and they vote accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many scholars in Beijing are realistic enough to recognize the reality of Taiwanese public opinion, but communist party leaders in Beijing do not accept it. The long-standing cross-strait standoff — in which Beijing puts political, economic, and military pressure on Taiwan while the government in Taipei tries to fend it off and cultivate support from the United States and its allies — is often broadly referred to as the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the term “status quo” has been enshrined in core U.S. policy pronouncements and those of U.S. allies and partners in the region, promoted as something that should be defended and protected. Increasingly, however, the term is becoming dangerously misleading in describing the situation in and around the island. Far from static, as the term implies, the cross-strait status quo is dynamic and changing inexorably in Beijing’s favor. The status quo today is very different from the status quo of even a decade ago. China’s military now dwarfs that of Taiwan and can blockade the island in the space of a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of Taiwan’s election, Beijing wants to shift the status quo even further in its favor. Xi wants concrete, visible progress of the kind Taiwan will not give unless it is coerced into doing so. China does not have the means to easily invade and occupy the island, nor does it appear to have a set timetable to do so. But the PLA does have a large and growing military advantage across the strait and the means to move quickly on the island, and Xi has tasked it to be ready to do so by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also made it clear that Xi’s “one country, two systems” model for unification, enshrined in a speech in late 2019, has not shifted, despite many reports to the contrary. Xi’s use of the phrase “one country, two systems” in 2019 was widely seen to have been a disaster for Beijing’s aims in the wake of Hong Kong. But while Taiwanese voters and outside commentators may have seen Xi’s use of the term as a self-harming mistake, Beijing has shown no sign of doing away with the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang Huning, a member of the party’s top body, the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, has been in charge of forging new policies for unification since the 20th National Congress in October 2022. Wang, who has been a leading ideologue at the top of Chinese politics for more than a decade, has stuck with the formula while rolling out initiatives — largely economic ones — to add ballast to Beijing’s plans for the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s democracy has been essential to developing an identity independent of China. It also has been beneficial to its people, who lived under authoritarian rule until the late 1980s. But the United States and its partners, including Japan, Australia, and Europe, while supportive and admiring of the island’s democratic system, should not overly focus on this quality in marshaling support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the key to building support for Taiwan beyond the United States and its closest allies and into the rest of Asia and Europe is a focus on stability and, by extension, the global economic devastation that would flow from any armed conflict — the worst-case scenario of an invasion. The same messages might gain traction in Beijing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese scholars do not countenance at any length the idea that the threat of economic catastrophe from a cross-strait war could deter Chinese military action, other than to suggest that Taipei and its friends are playing with fire in resisting unification. Privately, the message is acknowledged, if not taken on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it makes sense that the threat of economic devastation could work to restrain Beijing. Economic growth over the past five decades is the foundation stone of the party’s standing among the Chinese people. It is not something that Beijing wishes to damage, especially now that the economy is slowing. For countries such as Australia, Japan, and the United States to reinforce that point in dialogue with China thus makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-australia-can-reduce-timidity-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;How Australia Can Reduce Timidity on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Rory Medcalf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Australian foreign policy accentuates stabilizing relations with China, it would be easy and tempting for Canberra to entrench timidity in its policy regarding Taiwan. Instead, now is the time to invest in understanding and explaining why Taiwan matters to Australia’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the moment to creatively explore the boundaries of what Australia can do to engage and support Taiwan as a vital part of the regional and global economy and a dynamic and progressive democratic society. This effort should extend to using the middle-power agency Australian statecraft extols. More can be done to operationalize the sophisticated position Australian governments have defined: a One China policy that acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s One China principle, which insists that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Australia is emerging from years of confrontation, friction, and freeze in relations with China, its largest trade partner. The Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, elected in May 2022, prides itself on ending this painful phase, with disciplined diplomacy captured in the mantra of “cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, and engage in the national interest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has gradually eased most of the coercive economic sanctions it imposed in 2020 when a conservative Australian government called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although Chinese president Xi Jinping presumably came to realize the coercion was not working in the face of Australia’s hardened public attitudes and political resolve, he needed a face-saving way out, and a change of government in Canberra provided that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is long-standing bipartisanship in Australia on foreign and security policy. Both the conservative Liberal-National Coalition and Labor support the U.S. alliance, partnership with other Indo-Pacific powers such as Japan, engagement with Southeast Asia and the South Pacific, and a relationship with China that combines massive trade (especially in Australian iron ore exports) with U.S.-led strategic balancing. The fact that the current government remains committed to AUKUS, an arrangement through which the United States and United Kingdom will help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines, confirms that Labor is conscious of China as a source of grave geopolitical risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are political differences in Australia on China policy. Labor’s emphasis on engagement with Asia is sometimes miscast as being soft on China. It has been in China’s interests to play up — and make real — the perception that some Australian governments are more accommodating of its priorities than others. This strategy aligns with the fact that Canberra is treading with great care when it comes to Taiwan. Long has this been so. After all, it was conservative foreign minister Alexander Downer who in 2004 questioned the applicability of the U.S. alliance in a Taiwan context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in recent years has something of a divide emerged in Australian politics on Taiwan, with current opposition leader Peter Dutton saying on the record, contra Downer, that Australia would support the United States in a Taiwan conflict — or more precisely, that not doing so would be “inconceivable.” While Dutton may rightly be criticized for seeking to exploit the China challenge for partisan advantage, it should be uncontroversial to express the judgment that the U.S.-Australia alliance would be broken if Australia stood aloof while the United States went to war with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Albanese Labor government has studiously avoided explaining Australia’s defense modernization and the intensification of the U.S. alliance in terms of a hypothetical Taiwan conflict, even though this is a plausible contingency that would profoundly engage Australian interests. Instead, for example, Canberra’s April 2024 National Defence Strategy presents a general case for power projection, deterrent capability, the U.S. alliance, and various Indo-Pacific partnerships — all in terms of preventing future coercion and threats to the connected regional economy on which Australia’s prosperity and survival depend. Some critics of the AUKUS arrangement distort it as a precooked deal to lock an Australian submarine force into a Taiwan war under U.S. command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artificially narrow debate, plus Beijing’s insinuation that closer Australia-Taiwan contact would put stabilization at risk, unhelpfully reduces Taiwan in the minds of many Australians to a source of trouble or a proxy for a U.S. primacy imperative, with no political character, rights, or agency of its own. Instead, Australian governments should not be afraid to remind their people (including the business community) of the truth: Taiwan is a self-ruled and democratic polity with its own complex cultural and political history. It is a vital part of the Indo-Pacific and global economic order, particularly given the critical place of its advanced semiconductor industry in global technology supply chains. Bilaterally, Taiwan is hardly insignificant: it is Australia’s sixth-largest export market for goods and services and its seventh-largest partner in two-way trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Taiwan also have in common the fact that they are liberal democratic islands, with similar population sizes of more than 20 million people, which seek to navigate a complex and contested region where many of the other political systems are much less friendly to individual rights. Taiwan upholds the values a democratic and progressive Australia cares for — inclusion, diversity, self-determination, free expression, transparency, accountability, civil liberties, and respect for First Nations peoples — more than anywhere else in Asia. Australians who care about their democracy would also do well to note that Taiwan is a laboratory for identifying and countering electoral manipulation; it functions as an early-warning system for their own and others’ democratic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australias-options&quot;&gt;Australia’s Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current economic relations between Australia and Taiwan are strong and could be bolstered through appropriate ministerial contact. Domestic prosperity and international stability intersect in many portfolios other than the obviously sensitive areas of foreign affairs and defense. Australia could follow New Zealand’s example and negotiate a free trade agreement, plus support Taiwan’s membership in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a quality trade arrangement where Taiwan eminently belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialogue, parliamentary engagement, and education are three obvious areas where Australia and Taiwan could do more together to build each other’s awareness and resilience in an era when middle-sized democracies benefit from sharing best practices. Dialogue could occur in the purely informal space of the think tank, or academic “second track,” or in a grayer zone where government observers and even occasionally government-affiliated voices could share their expertise. There is no fundamental reason why private sector experts and representatives of subnational governments could not also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides would benefit enormously from sharing knowledge and policy innovations in such fields as critical infrastructure, supply chains, cybersecurity, and social cohesion. They could thus collaborate in providing security to their economies and societies in ways that do not touch on sensitive questions of diplomatic recognition or military cooperation. Likewise, in preparedness and emergency response — whether against natural disasters and climate impact or more state-directed strategic threats — Australia and Taiwan would find it mutually beneficial to swap notes on their hard-earned experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, parliamentary engagement is a promising avenue. The April 2024 visit to Taiwan by a cross-party group of some of Australia’s most forthright and active parliamentarians is a significant example. It may also be worth considering minilateral variants of parliamentary dialogue that bring together parliamentarians from two or more democracies, such as Japan, the United States, and European nations. Such dialogue would reinforce messages of democratic solidarity while providing cover for any one country should Beijing translate displeasure into punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education provides another channel of connection while also building Taiwan’s capacity. The minilateral Global Cooperation and Training Framework set up in 2015 brings together Australia, Japan, the United States, and Taiwan as education powers and is a logical pathway for Australian education providers to contribute to Taiwan’s resilience while benefiting from its human capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia should seek to maximize its use of this channel while encouraging wider participation. The framework provides a potential vehicle for other democratic education powers, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, India, and South Korea, to deepen their connections with Taiwan as part of the global research, teaching, and training ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Australia, a stable geopolitical and geoeconomic environment involves much more than a permanently fragile stabilization with China. Australian statecraft has the wit to balance stabilization with the diversified interests and values that define Australia’s democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving-new-era-operational-challenges-to-execute-the-overall-defense-concept&quot;&gt;Resolving New-Era Operational Challenges to Execute the Overall Defense Concept&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Mick Ryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the current debate about deterrence and potential war over Taiwan centers on the physical and moral elements of national fighting power. In the physical realm, a stalemate over military assistance in the U.S. Congress, the inability of the West to mobilize the defense industry quickly enough, and the kinds of weapons to be procured for Taiwan’s defense are dominant themes. In the moral arena, debate includes the extension of military service models and the will of the Taiwanese youth to defend their nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a third element must be considered. Generating strategic advantage for Taiwan also demands mobilization of intellectual capacity. The need for this third leg of a twenty-first-century mobilization trinity of industry, people, and ideas is most compellingly demonstrated in the Russo-Ukraine war. After two years of destructive mass warfare in Ukraine and beyond, both sides remain waging a twenty-first-century war with twentieth-century ideas. Any change in the trajectory of that war will require improved and synchronized mobilization of people, industry, and new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same challenges and opportunities exist with the defense of Taiwan and deterring Chinese aggression. Until recently, Taiwan has persisted with older ideas about defending itself based on conventional capacity and outdated assumptions about the Chinese military. Having watched events in Ukraine in the past two years, Taiwan has been shocked into reassessing its defense. The Russo-Ukraine war has demonstrated that a smaller yet technologically sophisticated nation can forestall the territorial aspirations of larger authoritarian nations if it has the will to do so. It has breathed new life into an older Taiwanese strategy, the Overall Defense Concept, which anticipated the approach Ukraine adopted after the Russian invasion of February 2022. But this is just a starting point for thinking about the defense of Taiwan. More development is needed, and Taiwan’s partners — particularly think tanks and professional military education institutions — could work collaboratively with Taiwan in this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unpopular-term-good-concept-the-overall-defense-concept&quot;&gt;Unpopular Term, Good Concept: The Overall Defense Concept&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Taiwanese admiral Lee Hsi-min proposed the Overall Defense Concept, which redefined how the Taiwanese government views “winning the war” should China seek to absorb Taiwan by force. The core of this revised theory of victory is that winning the war is defined as “fail[ing] the enemy’s mission to occupy Taiwan.” This was a shift in traditional thinking about defense and national security in Taiwan. However, many in the military resisted its implementation. As one article on this topic describes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Overall Defense Concept was more popular with American analysts and officials than it was with currently serving Taiwanese generals and admirals. Driven by personal animosity and the fact that true asymmetry undercuts the rationale for pursuing high-profile, high-prestige, and high-cost weapons, these military leaders and civilian enablers purged the Overall Defense Concept as soon as Lee retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unpopularity of the concept in some circles, it remains a more suitable military strategy for a country in Taiwan’s circumstances given the magnitude of changes in China’s conventional military capabilities over the past three decades. Seven key ideas underpin Lee’s theory of victory to ensure that the mission of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to occupy Taiwan fails:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abandon the traditional war of attrition and adopt concepts of asymmetric warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop and adopt the concept of denial instead of control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shape battle space conditions and engage PLA forces where and when they are at their weakest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus on preventing PLA mission successes and attacking their center of gravity rather than on the total destruction of PLA forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prevent PLA forces from establishing beachheads on Taiwanese soil.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better utilize Taiwan’s geography and civilian infrastructure in a holistic plan of defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prepare for and conduct insurgency and other resistance operations to ensure that the PLA — if it can land — cannot effectively control Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phases&quot;&gt;Phases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Overall Defense Concept divides the defense of Taiwan into three key phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1:&lt;/strong&gt; The initial phase is a force protection phase. It would include physical hardening, deception, electronic warfare, continuous redeployment of military units, stockpiling, and air and missile defense activities to ensure that Taiwan’s military and civilian infrastructure (and its leadership) can absorb and survive initial PLA air and missile strikes. As Lee writes, “Without proper force protection measures, most of Taiwan’s military power could be destroyed or neutralized in the initial phase of war.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The second phase is the pursuit of a decisive battle in the littoral. Extending 100 kilometers from the Taiwanese shore, this would integrate shore-based antiship missiles, sea mines, naval warships, and air force aircraft to attack high-value PLA air and maritime targets. Key targets would include large Chinese amphibious ships, command and control nodes (on ships and in the air), and other PLA platforms considered mission critical for a successful amphibious landing. Along with more conventional weapons, an important capability in this phase would be Hsiung Feng missiles mounted on trucks. The missiles would be dispersed in Taiwan’s urban and mountain regions to survive initial PLA strikes and then would be launched at PLA ships during an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3:&lt;/strong&gt; This phase aims to destroy PLA forces landing on beaches in Taiwan. At most, 14 beaches on the Taiwanese mainland are suitable for amphibious landings. Taiwan’s navy would lay sea mines in the waters off these potential landing beaches. A fleet of mine-laying ships is being constructed and launched for this purpose. Concurrently, swarms of small fast-attack boats (crewed and uncrewed), similar to those developed by Ukraine for its Black Sea operations, and truck-launched antiship missiles will engage high-value targets in the PLA invasion force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the defense strategy is appropriate for a nation of Taiwan’s geography, location, technological capacity, and human resources, many operational challenges remain to execute this strategy. As the war in Ukraine has demonstrated, new technologies introduced to the modern battlefield have resulted in new war-fighting challenges that are as relevant to Taiwan as they are to Ukraine. The following five key operational challenges provide focus for a mobilization of intellectual capacity in Taiwan, supported by key security partners such as Australia, Japan, and the United States to enhance the implementation of a future version of an Overall Defense Concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrating old and new technology. The first challenge is effectively and rapidly integrating new technology (e.g., meshed civil-military sensor networks, drones, and democratized access to digital command systems) with old technology (e.g., tanks, helicopters, and artillery). No military can afford to get rid of all old equipment and recapitalize with new technology; it is a gradual process. But this process can often be unevenly distributed throughout an institution. In particular, the security of data and communications links between different systems is a major challenge. The integration of old and new technologies has tactical, operational, strategic, and institutional elements and relies on growing links between the military and industry as well as faster sharing of battlefield lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The massing versus dispersion predicament. A new-era meshed civil-military sensor framework has resulted in an environment where all the signatures of military equipment, personnel, and collective forces can be detected more accurately and rapidly. When linked to digitized command and control systems and precision munitions, it significantly reduces detection-to-destruction time in military operations. Massing military forces for ground combat operations, large-scale aerial attacks, or naval operations, therefore, becomes a high tactical and operational risk. Even if an array of hard- and soft-kill measures can protect massed forces, they are almost assured of detection, which makes achieving surprise difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is equally a challenge in the maritime environment, whether in the Taiwan Strait or in the sea lanes connecting Taiwan and its military partners. Modern military forces must be able to operate in both dispersed and massed forms across domains, and they must minimize their detection signatures when they mass in a way that ensures an improved chance of surprising the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Lowering the cost of defending against missiles and drones. While enormous investments have been made over the past couple of decades in the development of remotely controlled autonomous and semiautonomous uncrewed systems, the capabilities to counter these systems have lagged in investment. This has changed since the beginning of the Russo-Ukraine war, particularly with Ukraine’s introduction of long-range aerial and maritime strike drones and shorter-range battlefield first-person view (FPV) drones. But there remains a massive gap between the capabilities of uncrewed systems and those that counter them. The Chinese missile, rocket, and drone capability deployed within striking distance of Taiwan is even more significant than that deployed by Russia against Ukraine. There remains a large disparity in the cost of missiles and lethal drones and the systems that defend against them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As such, the aim must be not only to reduce the cost of hard- and soft-kill systems but to entirely flip the cost equation. As such, a key operating challenge for Taiwan is to develop a variety of low-cost hard- and soft-kill systems for use against PLA uncrewed vehicles and missiles, which also imposes costs on China, not on those who defend against them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The right balance of long-range strike and close combat. The Overall Defense Concept includes a mix of different short- and long-range combat capabilities. Both are required. But getting the balance of investment in aerial and maritime strike weapons, on one hand, and close combat capacity, on the other, is crucial. As such, a key operational problem for Taiwan and its partners to address is the appropriate balance in the deep battle and the close fight (with appropriate support mechanisms for both). Not only must the balance of investment be mostly right, but there should be an effective operational synchronicity within the Overall Defense Concept between these two military endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Closing with the enemy. Modern combat forces require new-era techniques that are quicker, lower signature, and more survivable at crossing the operational and tactical spaces between them and their objectives. Ukraine’s struggle to penetrate Russian minefields and defensive belts in southern Ukraine exemplifies the failings of current Western military doctrine. Although this might largely be seen as a tactical challenge for ground, air, and naval forces, it is also an operational and strategic problem. How might U.S., Japanese, and other allied forces approach an operational area around Taiwan in a contingency in a way that minimizes detection and targeting by the PLA?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solving-operational-problems&quot;&gt;Solving Operational Problems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The literature on previous military innovations and adaptation provides insights from historically successful military transformations relevant to Taiwan. Some of the most important characteristics of leading successful military transformations in the modern era are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SPECIFICITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military organizations need clear ideas of the operational problems to be addressed. As Williamson R. Murray and Allan R. Millett wrote in Military Innovation in the Interwar Period, “A number of factors contributed to successful innovation. The one that occurred in virtually every case was the presence of specific military problems, the solutions of which offered significant advantages to national strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COLLABORATION WITH SECURITY PARTNERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, NATO countries provided support to each other in developing strategic and operational concepts and shared relevant doctrines and technologies. They also developed NATO standards for equipment, training, and logistics. A similar approach will be necessary in the Western Pacific, less the NATO alliance architecture. Support may include input on technological and conceptual lessons from Ukraine and co-development of new technologies and tactics. It should also include joint testing and experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TESTING AND EXPERIMENTATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an operational problem has been recognized, the nature of the challenge clarified, and the idea to solve it identified, the new ideas for operating concepts must be tested. This is important for several reasons. First, it ensures expensive, time-consuming organizational changes are not launched without some notion of whether they will work. Second, it provides transparency into new ideas, allowing for more robust examination and critique. Finally, experimentation is an important part of building institutional buy-in for change. As Don Starry wrote in “To Change an Army,” “Changes proposed must be subjected to trials. Their relevance must be convincingly demonstrated to a wide audience by experiment and experience, and necessary modifications must be made as a result of such trial outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DIFFERENT MEASURES OF EFFECTIVENESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of successful adaptation is an institutional view of what makes an organization effective in the operational environment. In Winning the Next War, Stephen Peter Rosen found, “Wartime innovation has been most effective when associated with a redefinition of measures of strategic effectiveness by the military organization.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBEDDING NEW IDEAS IN DOCTRINE AND INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE TRAINING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When operational problems have been specified and solutions have been tested and approved, these must be embedded in military doctrine. New doctrine is crucial because this is the foundation for all individual and collective training within military institutions. This is the way true institutional change occurs. It ensures that new ideas are standardized across the entire military organization and with security partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINKING TACTICAL INNOVATION TO INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New ideas — and the new organizations that accompany them — guide the adaptation of existing materiel and development of new equipment. New operational concepts developed for Taiwan will also require changes in how current equipment is used. It is also likely that new kinds of equipment and munitions will be required. The process that links new ideas and new defense production must be sped up and potentially distributed among Taiwan’s security partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helping-taiwan-deter-aggression-by-providing-war-fighting-solutions&quot;&gt;Helping Taiwan Deter Aggression by Providing War-Fighting Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan should not have to address these operational problems alone. Nations such as Australia, Japan, and the United States can assist Taiwan with evolving its operational concepts, solving difficult military challenges, and implementing a 2020s version of the Overall Defense Concept. Doing so will necessitate rigorous simulation, testing, and experimentation. It will also demand a collaborative Taiwanese security partner approach to developing new methods of effectiveness for war fighting in modern conditions, as well as improved links between military adaptation and rapid industry production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, good political and military leadership is essential to ensuring that the solutions to these issues are embedded into Taiwanese strategic and operational doctrine, individual and collective training methodologies, and promotion systems for senior officers. Given the pace of military development in the PLA, this transformation must be led and executed with one eye on the clock.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團　若不信納李家田證供　仍須考慮能否肯定為本案串謀者&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MySStQ1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周三（21日）在高等法院踏入第77天審訊，法官張慧玲第4天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官指，陪審團若不信納被告李家田的證供，認為他不只在旁觀察，更有份參與「屠龍」行動，涉暴動、縱火等罪行，但此為本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。官強調，有關行動僅可作背景參考，須考慮控方能否令陪審團肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及曾管有手槍和彈藥。官另總結黃振強、彭軍壕轉任從犯證人的經過。其中黃振強稱良心發現希望交代事件，改為認罪，否認為最多50%減刑而作供；黃一度投訴被捕時遭警施襲，但在庭上稱無法界定是否被打。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周二指，自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強事前著隊友毋須帶裝備，但另與其他小隊談及用汽油彈，著陪審團考慮黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」，隊友是否在知情下參與「殺警計劃」。官又指，一被告選擇出庭作供，若陪審團認為其說法真實、可能真實，或未能肯定控方說法，就應裁定罪名不成立；官另指，擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為，亦交由陪審團決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官即使不信納李家田證供-仍須考慮能否肯定他為本案串謀者&quot;&gt;官：即使不信納李家田證供 仍須考慮能否肯定他為本案串謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲周三續總結證供，就案中唯一選擇作供的被告李家田，控方盤問時詳細問及李在「屠龍」群組內的訊息，李遂一解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指，控方盤問以顯示李的證供不可信，例如李供稱於示威現場只在旁觀察。官強調，陪審團即使不信納李的證供，認為他有份參與「屠龍」行動，非只在旁觀察，而是衝擊警方及擲汽油彈等，但此屬本案中沒被控訴的行為（uncharged acts），不代表李有干犯本案串謀的犯罪傾向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官表示，陪審團應先考慮是否信納李的證供，若能肯定控方的說法，認為李不可信，才須考慮其沒被控訴行為，用作背景考慮李是否本案串謀者。官重申，陪審團應考慮控方能否令其肯定，李家田為案中串謀者，以及他是否曾管有手槍和彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官另提及被告張銘裕和嚴文謙的被捕經過，其中嚴一方稱警方沒宣布拘捕、襲擊嚴等；警員否認。法官強調，由陪審團決定是否相信警員證供，但嚴行使其權利沒出庭作供，故庭上沒證供顯示他曾被打。至於張銘裕則表示「咩都唔知」，警員亦沒搜出與案有關物品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官總結黃振強轉任控方證人經過&quot;&gt;官總結黃振強轉任控方證人經過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就從犯證人、自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強，法官總括黃由被捕後，至轉任控方證人的經過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指，黃投訴被捕時遭警員施襲，但在庭上作供時稱無法界定是否被打，指應交由專家判斷。參與拘捕行動的警員分別作供，指拘捕時黃激烈反抗，故須以武力將其制服，但否認曾「打、嚇、氹」黃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黃的錄影會面，黃承認部分說法與其庭上證供有分歧，例如錄影會面稱不願試槍，故欺騙同謀者吳智鴻指自己受傷；但黃庭上則指，他在中大事件受傷而無法出席試槍。官覆述黃的解釋，指被捕時記憶混亂、狀態差，但否認錄影會面時欺騙警員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續指，黃振強原否認串謀謀殺等罪，至2023年5月時，黃要求會見警員，指希望改認罪和交代事件。官引述，黃供稱良心發現而交代事件，並非為求獲得最多50%減刑而出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官另指，黃在盤問下同意，他所承認的認罪案情部分不正確，例如案情指9月的台灣軍訓屬本案串謀一部分，但黃在庭上供稱，於11月才與吳智鴻達成協議，「屠龍」一方加入殺警計劃的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官須考慮彭軍壕早與警達協議抑或搞錯咗&quot;&gt;官：須考慮彭軍壕早與警達協議抑或「搞錯咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就另一從犯證人彭軍壕，官覆述其證供，彭指得悉吳智鴻等人被捕後，已預料自己亦將被捕，屆時將會認罪。官引述，彭被捕後拒絕提供手機密碼，又指沒特別留意轉任控方證人最高可獲50%減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官提及，辯方盤問時特別關注，彭曾去信律政司，指據雙方早前同意（as agreed），將撤銷《反恐條例》下爆炸罪和串謀謀殺的控罪。彭解釋，信件由囚友撰寫，寄出後才發現內容出錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官表示，陪審團須考慮，彭是一早與警方達成協議，或是如彭所言「搞錯咗」。官另指，彭父為警署警長，彭供稱沒要求父親與律政司「講數」；而處理本案的警員亦稱，沒因彭父為同袍而對彭「輕手啲」，強調會公平處理各個被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underground in an anonymous building in the Kharkiv Oblast is one reason for Ukraine’s defensive prowess against a numerically stronger and well-armed aggressor. Military teams work from makeshift briefing and ops rooms leading off corridors stacked with dusty and discarded office furniture, intently focused on an array of computers that access, control and act on live feeds from the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Attention”, says one member, standing up, his voice slightly raised, and the room instantly stills. “There will be a Russian helicopter attack at 1230”. His warning gives soldiers on the front a mere 10 minutes to pack up their artillery and move it discretely away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a high-stakes gaming saloon, complete with Ninja-pro gaming chairs and many donning heavy metal goth T-shirts. “The toughest lesson”, remarks one commander, codenamed “Cuba”, is the “cost of a mistake, in many cases irreversible”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous day, 11 Russian tanks had attacked the Khartiia Brigade positioned north of Kharkiv. Five tanks were knocked out by a mix of missiles, artillery and mines dropped by drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstairs, the unit wargames Russian positions and movements, with intelligence fed by a combination of reconnaissance, open sources, local knowledge and intercepts. A chart with toy soldiers covers the table, while a three-dimensional depiction is screened on the wall behind. The aim is to interpret patterns from even one single troop movement, as the unit tries to discern Russian intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war of national survival has transformed some units to enable them to operate at “NATO standard”, one soldier explains. This war is producing, pound for pound, possibly the most effective armed forces in the world in Ukraine – even if not the best-equipped or trained – and certainly the most resourceful, innovative and now with significant battlefield experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side of this, however, is that the Russians have also learned fast, although not quite at the same tempo as the Ukrainians. Their development of glide-bombs, each with 2,000 kg warheads, now being produced at a monthly rate of 30,000, has delivered a cheap, immensely destructive shock weapon. Russia’s size and improving prowess should keep European defence planners up at night and remind them that they have an enduring strategic stake in Ukraine’s success, no matter how much some Western politicians may want to cut and run from Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-time-to-micro-manage-kyiv&quot;&gt;No Time to Micro-Manage Kyiv&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is not the time to micro-manage the risk in Ukraine’s actions, hold back supplies or maintain strict caveats on the use of equipment, especially against military targets in Russian territory, out of fear that Putin might escalate, perhaps with a nuclear option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, Ukrainians have learned that the externally imposed stipulations of keeping the war inside the boundaries of Ukraine have only enabled Russia, and tragically left Ukraine in a lethal war of attrition. It is still too early to say if Kyiv’s surprise military incursion into Kursk Oblast, launched in early August, was the right approach, although it has succeeded in buoying Ukrainian troops and civilians alike, especially after the failure of its vaunted 2023 counteroffensive against stubborn (and closely knit) Russian defences. Ukrainians and allies have all been concerned that the maths of overwhelming Russian numbers would over time only serve to give Russia the upper hand against the plucky but quantitatively disadvantaged Ukrainians. Even though Russia has already suffered 600,000 casualties, with as many as 15–20% of them killed, its population is at least four times that of Ukraine and its economy 15 times the size. This is reflected in comparative mobilisation personnel numbers, as well as the ability of Russia’s defence industry to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian intervention into Kursk has several aims, says Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of Kyiv’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, including relieving the pressure on the front elsewhere and offering a physical buffer zone for hard-pressed Ukrainian army units around the eastern town of Sumy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Kursk advance offers space for diplomatic brinkmanship to seize the moment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically it also shows, he says, “that we can turn the tide … and show the results to Western taxpayers”. He is hopeful that the Kursk operation will provide a similar impact as the “Prigozhin mutiny”, referring to the drive from Rostov-on-Don towards Moscow in June 2023 by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner Group. It ended in negotiations with a surprised Kremlin, but if nothing else, illustrated just how hollowed out and vulnerable the Russian state is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kursk advance offers space for diplomatic brinkmanship to seize the moment. Until now the political dimension for peace has been behind the military curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;linking-war-and-peace&quot;&gt;Linking War and Peace&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s move into Russia should not be seen in isolation from the 10-Point Peace Plan proposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But for peace to take root, not only will Ukraine have to demonstrate to the Russians that there is more to be gained from peace than continuing the war, and that there is a method by which this can be achieved, but also that all external powers are pushing the parties to the negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Experience”, says Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in a meeting with us in Kyiv in August 2024, “teaches us that Russia only negotiates in good faith when it is placed under pressure, and negotiation is the only option. And we also have learned from our own history that facilitators want to end the war rather at the expense of Ukraine, which is also often true for cases of war in other parts of the world”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enormous challenges remain, not least among the group of states that put narrow interests before people, and where politics trumps human rights. A number of key African and Latin American states, for instance, fall into this category, including Colombia and South Africa. The latter has been willing to pressure Israel over Gaza through the world courts, but not Russia, its ally in BRICS, over its invasion of Ukraine. Egypt and Ethiopia are similarly among the African fence-sitters, indicating as much about their preference for Putin’s type of democracy as their interests in arms transfers and geopolitical allegiances. Brazil and China, with their own peace formula, are running essentially a rival to Ukraine’s own process – one which might even have Russia’s tacit approval as a fellow BRICS country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rival processes usually expect Ukraine to make concessions that China, Brazil or any other BRICS member would be unwilling to concede. Most Ukrainians are committed to a single negotiating principle: the return of all Ukrainian territory as per the 1991 borders, including Crimea. That Ukraine is striving for its sovereignty should be important to African states in particular, given the continental propensity for weak borders that criss-cross ethnic allegiances and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutrality in this war usually means being in favour of Russia. And victory for Russia would lead only to the conclusion that, as Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister, explains to us, “Dictators International would be”. This has consequences for democrats everywhere, from Venezuela to Zimbabwe, as civilians struggle against authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals also matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s demands are not just about territory and its return. As the Ukrainian Nobel laureate Oleksandra Matviichuk clarifies in the same meeting, it offers “an historic opportunity to change the approach to justice for war crimes”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War usually visits poor places, making them even poorer. Ukraine’s daily reality of war is brought home walking the streets of Kharkiv, where one drives by ravaged apartments and buildings eviscerated by supersonic missiles, and hears the distant thundering of artillery shells in battlefields north of the city. These distant booms are regularly interrupted by ear-piercing wailing sirens, alerting incoming air raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-costs-of-double-standards&quot;&gt;The Costs of Double-Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of discounting Russia’s wanton destruction of communities across eastern and southern Ukraine lies not only in the loss of civilian lives and destruction of civilian infrastructure. It’s that war puts the interests of the state above – and seemingly beyond – those of the individual, the opposite of the very premise of the human rights regime that followed the Second World War where, in the jurist Hersch Lauterpacht’s words: “The well-being of an individual is the ultimate object of all law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauterpacht was born close to Lemberg, now Lviv, in modern-day Ukraine. Other Ukrainians have taken up the same struggle, not least Matviichuk, whose Center for Civil Liberties has documented more than 78,000 war crimes so far. Digital technologies offer huge advances in tracking perpetrators, from soldiers to commanders and even the silicon chips and production lines responsible for the missiles and drones raining down on Ukrainian cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine will need safeguards, such as through eventual Ukrainian membership of the EU and NATO (with NATO-like security guarantees in the interim). The Ukrainian ambition is to achieve the former by 2029 ahead of the next round of European parliamentary elections, confirms Maria Mezentseva, a Rada member from Kharkiv tasked with Euro-Atlantic integration. NATO membership should be easier “since it is a political decision” she says, although admitting Ukraine while it is at war is unlikely. But even if the political risks of inclusion into Alliance remain, the obvious levels of NATO–Ukraine interoperability are routinely demonstrated by the likes of the Khartiia Brigade, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accelerating-integration&quot;&gt;Accelerating Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion has offered, in this way, an accelerant to Ukraine’s Western integration. This has not only been expedited through accession talks, but also through the movement of people – there are now more than 5 million Ukrainian refugees in Europe – and through the deepening logistics chains with the West, not to mention Ukraine’s now leading position in defence technology innovation. Much remains to be done, not least in improving governance, but the advantages of this inclusion are clear: Ukraine’s per capita wealth is just $2,200, well below the Eurozone average of $37,400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of Ukraine’s progress post-war will depend on the continued flow of money, and that will hinge on its role as a bulwark against Russia, but also its capacity to clean up its governance and put in safeguards against corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, the priority remains keeping money and arms flowing from the West, while talking peace, a balancing act so far carefully managed by Zelenskyy, with seemingly inexhaustible energy. This is driven by the fear of the costs of failure. When asked what he thinks about first thing in the morning, the governor of the Lviv Oblast, Maksym Kozytskyi, responds, “My overriding daily fear when I wake up is learning that a close friend has been killed. Everything else can be managed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine illustrates just how much technology matters to modern war. Without the internet and advances in drone technology, soldiers would be operating virtually blind. But it is also a reminder of war’s constants, of the importance of logistics, training, mass, manoeuvre and fighting spirit. A Khartiia officer proudly described his troops’ prowess with the Browning “5-oh”, he said, termed a “strategic weapon” by the Russians at its sharp end. But he also bemoaned the shortage of artillery ammunition, especially of “NATO standards”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine itself can do more, not least in mobilising troops, despite improvements through its Reserve-Plus and Army-Plus apps. Only infantry can hold ground, not (yet) drones. Even so, Kyiv feels very different to a wartime city – eerily normal as opposed to some version of London in 1942. Managing debt volumes and spending finances well require sacrifices, everywhere. Sometimes “your best isn’t good enough”, cautioned Churchill. “You must do what is required.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine should take care in this regard not to take offers of outside assistance for granted. Afghanistan is a recent reminder of the fickleness of friendships, no matter the catastrophic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-scenarios&quot;&gt;Four Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the ongoing Kursk intervention, leaving out the likelihood of Putin’s departure and Russian economic implosion, four peace scenarios are imaginable. The first would be Ukraine’s ejection of Russia, through military means or negotiations. This requires the on-time delivery of weapons promised by the West and required by Kyiv, and, for its part, Ukraine to turn out more trained and refreshed brigades. The second would be for Kyiv to negotiate from a position of weakness. A third would be to meet Putin’s demands, and not strive for Ukrainian security guarantees through NATO (or EU) membership. But this presumes that Putin abandons what former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko, who survived dioxin poisoning by Russian agents, describes to us as an “imperial project to recreate the Russian empire, an ambition of Putin’s which is impossible without including Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth, wild-card, possibility is that an outsider – Donald Trump (should he win the US election) or even President Xi perhaps – threatens Russia and Ukraine respectively with an escalation and a reduction of support to Kyiv in order to cut a deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While militarily fraught with risk, Kursk has successfully changed the narrative of the war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this presumes, of course, that most Ukrainians would back negotiations. While support for Zelenskyy has decreased from his peak of over 90% at the start of 2023 to just 54% in June this year (albeit before the Kursk invasion), fewer Ukrainians support negotiations if they involve conceding post-1991 territory. The share preferring to seek a compromise to negotiate an end to the war fell from 43% to 26% in favour when respondents were asked to choose between negotiating with Russia and continuing to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace will fundamentally be a political decision. “We have lost too many Ukrainian lives”, says the Mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, speaking to us while sirens wail outside, “which is why peace has to be accepted by society as a whole”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decoding-kursk&quot;&gt;Decoding Kursk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kursk incursion is intended to offset Russia’s inexorable economic and numerical advantage through surprise, manoeuvre and Ukrainian tactical cunning. Until Kursk, “it appeared that Ukraine was going to fall,” confesses Oleksandr Lytvynenko, a veteran intelligence officer and now the Secretary of Ukraine’s National Defence and Security Council, “one hundred to two hundred metres per day, very slow, but apparently unstoppable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating the tactical opportunity Kursk offers into strategic success will depend on many factors, not least, as Zelenskyy has pointed out, the scale, speed and type of international assistance. “It is undoubtedly important for us that our partners remove the barriers that prevent us from weakening Russian positions as required by the course of the war”, he said on 17 August, 11 days after launching the Kursk operation. “The long-range capabilities of our forces are the answer to all the most important, to all the most strategic issues of this war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this imperative can be added the need to construct a diplomatic case, support and method, maintain current and future economic integrity, and build and rebuild armed forces capable of resisting Russia’s war machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While militarily fraught with risk, Kursk has successfully changed the narrative of the war. Whether that is in itself enough to keep the taps of international support turned on through and beyond the November 2024 US election will depend on Kyiv holding its ground to use as a bargaining chip in negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the political spin, support for Ukraine or Russia is about support for or against the current international rules-based order, in particular the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. While Russia and its supporters want to deepen that principle internally, permitting the right to conduct their own affairs free from the threat of international condemnation on the grounds of human rights for example, they want to retain the right to interfere externally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Kursk, the stakes have got higher. And they could be raised even further if other similar surprise Ukrainian actions, such as over Crimea or elsewhere, were to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lytvynenko says that Russia’s approach towards his country is premised on the need to reject Ukrainian identity. “But”, he smiles, “we don’t think this way because, axiomatically, we are not Russian”. But he also warns against Ukraine trying to slug it out in perpetuity with Russia, given its relative numerical strength. Rather, Kyiv needs to focus on an asymmetric strategy, fighting a smart war. “We have no territorial claims against Russia”, he adds. “We don’t want to intervene in Russia to change its government or its way of life. We just want to determine our own future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This depends on success on the battlefield. Given the implications inside and outside Ukraine for the rule of international law, human rights and justice, and even more than Putin deserves defeat, Ukrainians deserve victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 16 months of civil war, Sudan increasingly resembles a “failed state”, with displacement and man-made famine driving one of the “worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory”. Following early setbacks, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) – bolstered by Iranian-supplied drones – made sizable gains in January and February, retaking tracts of Omdurman and Bahri, Khartoum’s sister cities. Though over-stretched, the opposing Rapid Support Forces (RSF) still holds much of the capital, including the sprawling Al-Jaili oil refinery, and has made inroads across South Kordofan, Geizra, and Sinnar State. Having seized four of Darfur’s five provincial centres, the group is also consolidating control over its western heartlands; only El-Fashar – home to 1.8 million people – remains in army hands and now faces a protracted siege. Described as Sudan’s “Srebrenica”, the battle is both a strategic milestone and the latest example of a distinct system of violence, one of mass atrocity and ethnic cleansing running parallel to the conventional conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, patterns evident at the outset of hostilities – namely, a proliferation and diffusion of fighting – have persisted, contributing to a confused and steadily fragmenting battlespace. Grand epithets – SAF’s “battle of dignity” or RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo’s “battle for democracy” – do little to clarify this landscape, implying a turf war between two “broadly coherent” blocs rather than a “mosaic of competing militia and rebel movements, each with their own interests and agendas”. Unfortunately, international diplomacy appears reliant on these bifurcated narratives in practice if not in rhetoric, ignoring the realities of Sudan’s political market and reducing “conflict resolution” to a choice between “anti-democratic” and “anti-state” forces. Faltering ceasefire negotiations in Geneva – though well-intentioned – risk becoming the latest iteration of such trends, raising questions over the internal dynamics of its would-be participants and the implications these have for peacemaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diplomacy-revamped&quot;&gt;Diplomacy Revamped?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late July, the US State Department pitched a new round of dialogue between SAF and the RSF, co-hosted by Switzerland and Saudi Arabia, to better enable humanitarian access and agree a ceasefire. Despite benefitting from unusual levels of regional buy-in, neither party ultimately engaged in negotiations – the army boycotted, and Hemedti reneged. Though not surprising, the outcome speaks to the inherent difficulties of brokerage, and the perseverance of those involved in achieving even incremental gains such as opening the Adre border-crossing between Chad and Sudan. But Geneva also reflects the same problems besetting past efforts in Jeddah, with its limited inclusivity and shelving of “broader political issues” eliciting little more than “motion without movement”. While a full appraisal of these shortcomings is available elsewhere, it is worth unpacking two overlapping dynamics in detail, given their impact on future interventions: the increasingly volatile disposition of Sudan’s warring parties; and the challenge of bridging elite bargains with more “meaningful solutions”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anti-state-spoilers&quot;&gt;Anti-State Spoilers?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RSF’s behaviour offers a classic vignette of a bad-faith actor. By accepting the invitation to Geneva, Hemedti once again attempted to exploit peace talks as a means of reviving his reputation, employing liberal jargon to boost his legitimacy and present himself as an “indispensable part of Sudan’s future”. In truth, his group – a “motley assortment of tribal militias and warlords” – has no real appetite for delivering stability, let alone peace, as gradually became self-evident. After lauding their own “determination to alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people”, his delegates abruptly withdrew from proceedings altogether, derailing the agenda in a cynical display of gesture politics. The experience – as with Jeddah – is damaging but also instructive, showcasing the RSF as a rapacious, ever more unwieldy criminal enterprise, one posing an existential threat to social cohesion with little incentive (or ability) to restrain the identity-based violence it benefits from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The outcome is nothing short of a routinised and systemic process of de-institutionalisation – vandalism in the absence of political vision&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemedti’s recent “political ploys” are, in many ways, a return to the half-baked proto-populism he has touted since 2019. For years, security across Sudan’s borderlands was outsourced to the RSF, with his men gradually assuming “social provision and insurance functions” alongside a stake in harvest management, healthcare and local infrastructure. Seed capital and vocational training were doled out “à la International Monetary Fund… recipes”; contract farmers profited from new irrigation systems, canals and solar cells; and company towns like Zurrug received clinics and prefab schools. Subsidised by a lucrative “enclave economy” (featuring everything from banking and tourism to mining and mercenaries), this pseudo-civic largesse enabled the RSF to market itself as a champion of social change, ostensibly empowering the country’s nomadic underclass. Of course, the framing was mostly cosmetic, used to drum up support among Mahariya clansmen while whitewashing Hemedti’s political credentials. Beneath revolutionary tropes and old egalitarian slogans, the group remained a patronage machine for the Dagalo family – an admixture of “employment bureau, protection racket, and commercial conglomerate” – rather than an authentic expression of rural emancipation. Nevertheless, it did start to reflect (and leverage) genuine grievances, building up the aesthetic of governance – from medical centres to a child protection office – as a means of laundering its public image. As journalist Matt Nashed reported back in 2021, there was a “coordinated plan to paint the RSF as the saviour of Sudan”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the outbreak of fighting, any semblance of this political project has disappeared. Colloquially dubbed the “Republic of Kadamol”, disparate experiments in paramilitary rule amount to little more than a “pillage state”, a synonym for atrocity, brigandage and sexual violence “indelibly coloured by a toxic Arab-supremacist ideology”. Reports of harassment, abuse, arbitrary arrest, and summary executions by RSF troops are widespread, with UN analysts investigating the deaths of 10,000 to 15,000 people in El-Geneina alone. Much of the violence appears ethno-centric, levelled at black African (Massalit, Fur, Burgo and Zaghawa) neighbourhoods using “tactics, techniques, and procedures” recycled from the early 2000s. Densely populated suburbs such as Ardamata were deliberately shelled before RSF and Tamazuj militia went “door to door, shooting young men” while shouting racial slurs (“abeed” and “nawab”). As several witnesses recall: “… people were rammed by vehicles, burned alive in their homes, and picked off in the streets by snipers”, their bodies “left to rot in the sun”. Once a regional hub, El-Geneina now resembles a “ghost town”, with analogous trends emerging across cities like Zalingei and Nyala. As Volker Perthes, the UN’s former Special Representative to Sudan, warned, the war in Darfur is akin to “ethnic cleansing, grand scale”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full scope of this self-induced anarchy remains unclear: not only is third-party access to RSF-run areas difficult, but the group still retains a sophisticated PR system. Proxy outlets in Dubai fabricate content for foreign consumption, showcasing the restoration of pharmacies and markets, (staged) reconciliation efforts, and aid distribution via the so-called Sudanese Agency for Relief and Humanitarian Operations. A string of “special bulletins” were even found circulating Westminster early in the conflict. At the same time, Hemedti has attempted (with some success) to project himself as a statesman, touring South Africa, Uganda, Djibouti, Ghana, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Kenya (on an Emirati jet) to improve his diplomatic standing. These are not just perfunctory but predatory exercises, helping to literally “scrub away … evidence of [RSF] crimes”. In reality, his gunmen continue to methodically destroy local infrastructure – telecommunication masts, hospitals, schools and wells – while starving communities of food and medical supplies. Tactical advances are often accompanied by a “collapse of …state services” and the “wanton looting” of “homes, warehouses, and vehicles”. Occupied districts of Khartoum appear “lawless”, the token deployment of RSF police and field-courts offering cover for mass-expropriation and asset-stripping. Across Nyala, any pretence of administration has been dropped entirely, with Abdel Raheem Dagalo, Hemedti’s brother, leaving “day-to-day governance” to native leaders – policies replicated in Wad Madani and Geizra State. As Suliman Baldo, a regional expert, explained to Al-Jazeera: “the RSF doesn’t have the capacity to manage population centres and to provide an alternative to government systems … they are not hiding it, and this is why they are asking people to do things themselves”. The outcome is nothing short of a routinised and systemic process of de-institutionalisation – vandalism in the absence of political vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, these conditions could deteriorate further. Following a massive ramp-up in wartime recruitment, the RSF is no longer a bounded entity under Dagalo control but a confederation of tribal groupings with discrete issues and interests. Yes, the pathology may be cross-cutting: “militarised masculinities” bred by a collective history of social marginalisation, resentment and deprivation. Many stakeholders also share similar aspirations, at least on an abstract level, of “building a home for people like them[selves], nomadic communities that want to rest … and … [find] stability”. But there is little prospect of delivery by a coercive regime bent on extraction, where “paramilitary colonels double up as administrators, skilled only in running [extortion] rackets”. Paramount chiefs received cars, money and military office in exchange for support and local knowledge, with much of the rank-and-file either forcibly conscripted or attracted by easy spoils. These ties are hardly sufficient for holding a coalition together, especially if land and loot run dry. El-Geneina is indicative as the new (RSF-backed) governor, Tijani Karshoum, quickly became sidelined by a raft of traditional leaders, “each controlling their own territory”. In this context, the so-called “Janjaweed rebranded” may be susceptible to the same patterns of fragmentation as its predecessor, with the aleutaawa – Arabs across Darfur and Kordofan – competing over resources, property and position. With the defection of Musa Hilal, a long-time rival of Hemedti and head of the Mahamid clan (kin of the Dagalo’s Mahariya), this disassembly could already be starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RSF’s involvement in peace talks therefore brings major challenges. With his men scaling up the genocidal tactics used two decades previously, any concessions to Hemedti under the rubric of “conflict resolution” risk contravening international humanitarian law and hindering urgently needed atrocity prevention. Importantly, his dependency on communal militias and “ethno-mercenaries” also leaves the resonance of elite-level bargains somewhat ambiguous. As leaders of a cartel united by little more than “conquest” and criminality, it is questionable how far the Dagalos could actually rein in the social upheaval they have unleashed, even if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anti-democratic-preferences&quot;&gt;Anti-Democratic Preferences?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted by Daniel van Oudenaren, there is a temptation (particularly online) to frame the war as a dialectic between “bad and less bad”, with RSF abuses making SAF appear palatable by comparison. Cast as a familiar fixture in the public imagination, the army’s “imperfections” are offset by claims of longevity, professionalism, and cultural appeal. Buoyed in part by state-centric preferences, similar sentiments are discernible in diplomatic circles, with US Special Envoy Tom Perriello testifying to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations: “we do see a future for [the armed forces] … it is an official institution … it has a proud history, as well as some not so proud moments. That is not the same as what we see with … the RSF”. Such distinctions are entirely valid. But, as Geneva shows, this does not necessarily mean that the SAF is itself plausible as a partner in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assume otherwise risks neglecting (or minimising) military culpability in both the conflict’s origins and later atrocities. Benefiting from a rigged process of privatisation under former President Omar al-Bashir, the army owns a sprawling nexus of corporate surrogates, charities and state-run enterprises, including an 86.9% share of Omdurman National Bank, Khartoum’s largest financial body. Giad, an SAF holding-company, boasts over 24 subsidiaries alone, and high-ranking officers – the “khakistocracy” – enjoy vast control over the country’s agricultural and manufacturing base, pharmaceutical industry and energy sector. This economic leverage has repeatedly stifled any attempt at reform, allowing the top brass to quickly undermine Sudan’s democratic transition. Tellingly, the final days of Abdalla Hamdok’s premiership – marked by (artificial) wheat shortages – were followed by the sudden availability of new military-linked brands on supermarket shelves. By launching the October 2021 coup in concert with Hemedti, SAF was ultimately key in quashing the drive for liberalisation and preserving a predatory, highly authoritarian system: “Bashirism without Bashir”. In doing so it also left Khartoum’s oligarchs overly dependent on the RSF, subverting (or inverting) traditional patron-client relationships in unsustainable ways. Given the centrifugal propensities of Sudanese kleptocracy, this “counter-revolution” consequently became a conduit for civil war, one abetted and facilitated by the army leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once hostilities began, both sides displayed an “utter disregard for … international humanitarian law”, albeit in different ways. While RSF violence is distinct in scale and intent, reflecting a deliberate targeting of specific populations, SAF’s atrocities are often incidental, the product of indiscriminate artillery fire, airstrikes and barrel-bombing. Many blame Hemedti for exploiting civilians as “human shields”, but it seems some of the generals are themselves indifferent to collateral damage – crimes that have marred much of SAF’s history. Having dusted off starvation strategies from the 1990s, for instance, the army is now “wilfully restricting humanitarian supplies”, leaving millions without access to food. At the same time, leaked documents allegedly reveal a plan to divvy up the country’s 25 ministries and Central Bank among just four security chiefs. While General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan’s cabinet, the Sovereign Council, may mimic state functions, it remains the face of a military syndicate, a profoundly anti-democratic structure opposed to any real change. Human-rights defenders and medical workers face prosecution as “RSF spies”; “Emergency Response Rooms” (ERRs) – community-run aid networks – are regularly coopted or shut down; and several activists have disappeared into local “ghost houses”. How this confection could possibly align with the political aims of Sudanese revolutionaries and Western donors is therefore unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Diplomacy needs to catch up with these new realities or risks reproducing faults that have hampered Sudanese peacemaking for years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second issue is that Sudan’s regular forces can no longer be considered a coherent entity. Dismissed as a “vanity project” well before the conflict, SAF has steadily become an alloyed army, reliant on various non-state outfits from Darfuri ex-rebels to the Central Reserve Police, self-mobilised Islamist brigades, and community defence forces. To offset early manpower issues, recruitment leant heavily towards “popular resistance” groups, an innocuous label for the inherently unstable blend of ultra-conservatives, religious extremists, “radical democrats”, and youth activists now bulking out SAF’s offensive capabilities. Temporarily aligned by fear of the RSF, rather than support for Al-Burhan, it is an ad hoc association based on the same logic – “counterinsurgency on the cheap” – that empowered Hemedti in the first place, diminishing any “official” monopoly over the use of force and ceding power to independent conflict actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put bluntly, “the army [hasn’t learnt] from its past”, a failure carrying dangerous implications. Several commanders, including al-Burhan’s deputy, have already expressed concerns over SAF “losing control of its … coalition” and facing “blowback” from erstwhile allies. Clashes between the military and local Beja fighters across Port Sudan allude to this risk, with the proliferation of arms re-inflaming tensions over land and resource access. The collapse of Wad Medani (Sudan’s second city), and subsequent setbacks in Sinnar State, have prompted cycles of recrimination along ethnic lines, and untrained conscripts – the mustanfareen – are establishing their own checkpoints, harassing residents and “arresting anyone [calling] for peace. The result is a jumble of contradictions, with authority devolved to local militiamen and Islamist groups like Al-Bara bin Malik fighting alongside progressive members of resistance committees. Plainly, such arrangements cannot be sustained. This heterogeneity is even causing issues among al-Burhan’s paladins; backroom bargaining in Manama, for example, was upended as ideologues and former National Congress Party officials in the Foreign Ministry advocated increasingly hardline positions, exposing a lack of mutually agreed strategy. With the mounting prominence of Darfur’s Joint Protection Forces (an amalgam of former insurgent groups now aligned with the army), decision-making appears ever more convoluted, raising doubts over how far the SAF can sufficiently appease its component parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;false-binaries-and-blinkered-strategies&quot;&gt;False Binaries and Blinkered Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently, SAF and the RSF are not the same, and their methodologies should not be conflated. One – at the upper levels – is a creature of kleptocracy; the other is anathema to the state itself. But both share an entropic logic, whether incidentally or intentionally, threatening any prospect of a democratic, equitable Sudan. Neither “strongman” has a workable roadmap for delivering peace. Hemedti’s “10 point-plan” is an affectation, and al-Burhan’s preconditions are a non-starter. More importantly, an already saturated political marketplace has decentralised and expanded significantly since April 2023, fostering parallel systems of conflict that no elite pact could conceivably reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the premise of internationally backed initiatives like the Geneva talks is still based on a SAF/RSF dichotomy, prioritising power politics above civilian agency. As Tahany Maalla notes, such mediation strategies effectively militarise civic discourse, “with military entities [steadily] shaping civilian agendas. Consequently, most new political alliances reflect this militarised voice, reinforcing militarised authority and legitimacy”. Though belated efforts have been made to improve inclusivity, the focus remains limited to proxy outfits like SAF’s Democratic Bloc or technocrats such as Hamdok, neither of which have much traction on “the street”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomacy needs to catch up with these new realities or risks reproducing faults that have hampered Sudanese peacemaking for years. The 2019 Transitional Government and later Framework Agreement, for instance, failed in part because the “men with guns” set the terms, tempering any incentive or opportunity for change. Recycling this formula would simply repeat the same outcome, empowering those benefiting from violence, or stall from the outset given the plurality of armed groups now active across the country. Crucially, both come at the expense of ERRs, resistance committees, and civil activists trying to preserve Sudan’s December Revolution, a short-sighted trade-off that does little to resolve the conflict’s underlying causes. Encouraging a top-down deal between al-Burhan and Hemedti may also void any chance of preventing or prosecuting complicity in war crimes, mass killings, and ethnic cleansing. With El-Fashar under siege, a ceasefire is essential, but international engagement cannot be confined to two competing flavours of reactionary politics: kleptocracy or genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russo-Ukrainian War may mark the beginning of a new era in naval drone warfare. In October 2022, small surface drones breached Russian defences and drove deep inside Sevastopol harbour, even targeting the Russian Navy flagship, foreshadowing a new phase in the war. Since that initial high-profile mission, Ukraine’s naval drones have played pivotal role in reshaping the conflict in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of Ukraine’s uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) is indisputable. The Russian Navy is now on the defensive, and consequently conducting minimal naval operations. It is one of the clearest examples of the success of asymmetrical threats against a larger, more powerful, opponent. The popular meme “Russia has lost another warship to a country without a navy, in a land war” contains some truth. The Ministry of Defence recently put it more soberly, noting that “The size of the Russian Black Sea Naval Fleet has proven no match for Ukraine’s maritime innovations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This remarkable shift, where the hunter becomes the prey on a grand scale, offers numerous lessons for navies both large and small. Crucially, this achievement has only been possible due to advances in uncrewed technology. Similar results would not have been possible if Ukraine had relied on crewed platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-drone-navys-success&quot;&gt;The Drone Navy’s Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about Ukraine’s remarkable naval success in the Black Sea. While the caveats that this is an ongoing war and that the situation could change at any moment apply, it is indeed incredible. Russia has lost sea control, and its fleet is for the most part holed up behind layers of boom defences in ports as far from Odesa as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the February 2022 full-scale invasion the Black Sea could, without exaggeration, be described as a Russian (and Turkish) lake. Other naval powers, not least the Ukrainian Navy, had minimal control. Certainly, short of direct Turkish intervention, Russia enjoyed almost complete freedom of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s flagship, the Krivak-III-class frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, was scuttled at its berth in Mykolaiv as the Russian advance drew close. Ships which did take on the Russians directly did not fare well. The patrol ship Sloviansk, which lacked significant air defences, was sunk on 3 March 2022 by Russian aircraft. Ships in Ukraine’s ports in the Sea of Azov were destroyed or captured as Russian forces advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, within days of the invasion the Ukrainian fleet was all but non-existent. Meanwhile, the Russians enjoyed complete dominance, able to sail off the Odesa coast with apparent impunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are clear signs that Ukraine is exploring automation, including for the “last mile” of an attack where electronic warfare may interfere with communications&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was to change in April 2022 when two of Ukraine’s Neptune anti-ship missiles ripped through the port side of the Black Sea Fleet’s flagship, the Slava-class cruiser Moskva. The ship subsequently sunk. This represented the first significant change, with Ukrainian anti-ship missiles (both the homegrown Neptune and Western-supplied Harpoon) driving the Russians back from the western side of the northwest Black Sea. But the land-based missiles could only threaten the Russian Navy so far. Threatening them further south and east, and ultimately throughout the entire sea, required boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These boats were USVs – small craft with a camera, satellite communications, and a warhead in the bow. Specifications vary, but they are generally the type of craft which can be built in a garage or small industrial unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main technological enabler has been high-capacity two-way satellite communications such as Starlink and Kymeta, both of which have been observed in use. These allow human-in-the-loop navigation and targeting throughout the entire mission. Humans have proven adaptable to the tactical situation and faster to deploy than fully automated equivalents. There are clear signs that Ukraine is exploring automation, including for the “last mile” of an attack where electronic warfare may interfere with communications. But communications were key precisely because Ukraine did not have to rely on automation from day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USV operations ramped up between the spring and summer of 2023, reaching a climax when the Ropucha-class landing ship Olenegorsky Gornyak was struck by one outside Novorossiysk. The ship was seriously damaged, only just avoiding sinking by being towed back to port. The Olenegorsky Gornyak survived, but others were less fortunate. Since then, another landing ship, a missile corvette, a patrol ship, a minesweeper and several landing craft and smaller boats have all been sunk or destroyed by USVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just ships being sunk that has had a tangible impact. The unsuccessful attacks, and mere threat of attack, have contributed. The Russian Navy has moved almost all its major assets to the port of Novorossiysk on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, rerouted its “Syrian Express” supply lines to no longer use the Black Sea, and generally minimised patrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has been building large numbers of these USVs – over 100 according to public information. The ones involved in offensive missions – at least the ones publicised – are operated by the GUR (Defence Intelligence of Ukraine) and SBU (Security Service of Ukraine), as opposed to the traditional navy. The GUR are known for the Magura drones, while the SBU are associated with the Sea Baby type. Both organisations have enjoyed significant successes and contributed to the overall situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;could-this-have-been-achieved-with-crewed-platforms&quot;&gt;Could This Have Been Achieved with Crewed Platforms?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to conceive of a way in which the same effect could be achieved with crewed platforms – in particular, the ability to put the Russian fleet at risk throughout the entire Black Sea, including close to the Russian coast where the full might of the Russian military can be brought to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-conventional-navy-option&quot;&gt;The Conventional Navy Option&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the February 2022 Ukrainian Navy, with one frigate and various gun-armed boats, there was nothing that could survive in open water against the Russians. Even if we imagine the arrival of the two MILGEM corvettes under construction in Turkey, the picture doesn’t change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vessels are thoroughly modern and have respectable point air defence and anti-submarine capabilities, but they are too few and, on their own, too vulnerable. While individually high-quality, they are exactly the type of navy that the Russians were geared up to fight. The moment they arrived in Ukraine you could expect them to be high-priority targets for the Russian Navy. They’d face a formidable wall of high-performance anti-ship missiles launched from ships, shore, aircraft and submarines. In port they’d be vulnerable to cruise missiles and stand-off bombs, and as they set sail, they could quickly face torpedoes. The one thing Russia isn’t short of is anti-ship missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This highlights the first major advantage of the USVs. Their small size means that they are not particularly vulnerable to anti-ship cruise missiles, while their speed and size provide decent defence against torpedoes. They are less vulnerable in port because they need minimal shore infrastructure to launch. There is no need to tie them up in port in a predictable way. Cruise missiles and stand-off weapons can potentially target their storage sites, but this is less of a threat than when they are tied up in a naval base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their one major vulnerability is from the air. Efforts have been made to address this, with air-defence missiles added, but the challenge remains. Yet this has to be kept in perspective. Their vulnerability decreases their effectiveness but hasn’t stopped them from performing thus far. And whatever their vulnerability, it is still less than that of most surface warships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mosquito-fleet-option&quot;&gt;The Mosquito Fleet Option&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has been able to build up its small craft, with numerous types supplied by Western governments. These now have the capability to patrol the coast and conduct amphibious raids and special operations. At the moment their impact is restricted to the northwestern Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amphibious raiding has proven valuable in northwestern Crimea, but has limited reach due to human endurance. Special forces missions – possibly involving underwater vehicles – have some potential, but these are isolated attacks. And none of this threatens a Russian ship in open waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the remaining mosquito fleet of assault boats, patrol craft and inflatables possibly be used in a similar way to the USVs? The problem is that the craft lack the endurance, and are too vulnerable, for sustained operations in the eastern Black Sea. And it is not just the vessels themselves that lack the endurance; their human crews would be stretched. The craft would need to carry more crew and have better accommodation and facilities, which would quickly result in bigger craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed vessels can be inexpensive so they do not need to return to base, effectively doubling their operational radius. Crewed vessels, meanwhile, would need some form of stand-off attack capability to allow them to return home after an attack, unlike the USVs which sacrifice themselves for the kill. The combination of needing half the fuel and no crew accommodation also means that the USV can be much smaller, so much so that detection on a ship’s radars becomes a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Anti-submarine warfare is inherently difficult&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crewed vessels would share the USVs’ vulnerability to Russian aviation. They could possibly be better defended by short-range missiles, but this advantage is likely marginal. And being larger, they would be much more vulnerable to traditional anti-ship missiles. The missions would thus be very high-risk for the crews, even suicidal. USVs, meanwhile, are expendable and attrition can be factored in without serious concern for crew morale or effectiveness. Ukrainian USVs are working at a ratio of around 10:1 losses to kills, but that’s still in their favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;creating-a-submarine-threat&quot;&gt;Creating A Submarine Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most promising alternative would be crewed submarines – possibly if recently retired or soon-to-be-retired conventionally powered submarines were transferred from Western navies, or new-build boats were acquired. Submarines could offer a stealthy, deadly and persistent threat throughout the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian Black Sea Fleet has, on paper, considerable anti-submarine assets, it is questionable how well they could deal with them. Anti-submarine warfare is inherently difficult. A lot of the Black Sea Fleet’s equipment is dated, and readiness levels are open to question. While one wouldn’t expect the Black Sea Fleet to sit back and let Ukraine dominate, this plays to the Russians’ weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are also major limitations which bring this scenario into question. Delivering the submarines would be the first challenge, since the Bosporus has been closed to Ukrainian and Russian combatants and submarines. Next, the submarines would have to spend a lot of time in port. They would, like frigates, be prime targets while doing so. Another challenge would be crewing. This also applies to surface combatants, but it’s greater with submarines. Training could be expedited, but it would still take many months. It is questionable whether Ukraine would have been able to train the crews in anything like the same timeframe in which the USV operations have taken place. There are still shore crew to be trained, including in the new set of drone piloting, but the time required is competitively less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s success in pushing Russia’s Black Sea Fleet back to Novorossiysk is in no small part down to the use of USVs. Together with the shore-based anti-ship missiles – later joined by Storm Shadow and ATACMS missiles – which threaten ships in Crimean ports, USVs have denied Russia sea control. And their viability stems directly from the fact that they are uncrewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece has not explored the limitations of these craft, or how they might evolve in the future – particularly as Russia becomes more adept at countering them. But that would not change the story. It is difficult to imagine any alternative means by which Ukraine could have achieved the same aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is equally difficult to imagine these vessels being anything like as effective if the full-scale invasion had occurred just a few years earlier, before the latest satellite communications like Starlink and Kymeta were available. In this one small aspect, the timing was perfect for Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navies and planners will no doubt be looking at the war closely. It redraws the threat picture for larger navies that are looking to prepare for future operations. And for countries facing similar threats, uncrewed platforms offer significant advantages. The age of naval drone warfare has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團　指須考慮被告是否知情下參與、擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VV9v0N8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【法庭線】《反恐條例》首案，7人不認罪，周二（20日）在高等法院踏入第76天審訊，法官張慧玲第3天總結供詞及引導陪審團。法官指，自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強事前著隊友毋須帶裝備，但另與其他小隊談及用汽油彈，著陪審團考慮黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」，隊友是否在知情下參與「殺警計劃」。官又指，一被告選擇出庭作供，若陪審團認為其說法真實、可能真實，或未能肯定控方說法，就應裁定罪名不成立；官另指，擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為，亦交由陪審團決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官周一簡述，控方指控關於「屠龍」的串謀，於2019年11月18日開始，因為當時自稱「屠龍」隊長的黃振強才確認共謀者吳智鴻有槍及炸彈；辯方則爭議「屠龍」有份的串謀，最早於12月3日才開始，因為當時才落實行動的日期及時間。被告張銘裕的辯方代表則認為，涉案協議於12月8日凌晨，當黃與吳確認行動實際地點後才開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官須考慮黃講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽-屠龍隊友是否知情下參與&quot;&gt;官：須考慮黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」 「屠龍」隊友是否知情下參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲周二續總結供詞，指控方相當依賴「屠龍」成員於「殺警計劃」前夕、12月6日至7日期間的對話，如被告嚴文謙問「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避」、同謀者林銘晧稱「喺嗰個位我哋引戰，引班狗一嚟開槍或者放煙，佢就嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，據從犯證人、自稱「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供，當時「屠龍」正商討如何配合共謀者吳智鴻一方的計劃，將警員引出；而過往「屠龍」亦不會使用「引戰」，故上述所指「引戰」必與「殺警計劃」有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，黃振強在行動前夕稱「我哋呢啲冇第二次機會，一次足以玩完」，故控方指稱可從中得知行動涉及槍和炸彈，與「屠龍」過往行動非常不同。法官強調，陪審團須先肯定各被告是否知情，「要同意成為一分子先得。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，黃振強在另一群組內，與勇武小隊「閃燈」、「蜘蛛」的代表提及，行動時將在油站附近擲汽油彈，以及每人放置閃燈在身。法官表示，「屠龍」早有共識不會親自用槍和炸彈，黃在事前又著隊友毋須帶武器和工具，惟黃卻與其他小隊談及用汽油彈，法官稱，陪審團須思量黃「講咗幾多嘢畀隊友聽」，隊友是否在知情下參與殺警計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一從犯證人彭軍壕，官指彭供稱擔心遭吳智鴻報復，故沒退出計劃。法官強調，彭父為警員，陪審團應考慮彭沒退出的真正原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官由陪審團決定擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為&quot;&gt;官：由陪審團決定擲汽油彈屬否恐怖行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就被告劉佩凝被控的串謀眾籌以作恐怖行為罪，法官總結證供指，黃振強、劉佩凝認識後，劉曾過款予黃，並稱「for 魔法仔女」；控方指稱魔法為汽油彈，而劉知悉「屠龍」行動涉及汽油彈。據控方早前指稱，擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官表示，擲汽油彈是否恐怖行為交由陪審團決定，及後亦會向陪審團解釋恐怖行為的定義。官續指，黃振強表示曾在電話中，向劉講述「殺警計劃」，著她加大籌款力度；官指兩人通話內容沒保存紀錄，僅屬黃的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;一被告選擇作供-官認為說法可能是真應裁無罪&quot;&gt;一被告選擇作供 官：認為說法可能是真應裁無罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;涉案7名被告中，唯一李家田選擇出庭作供。李否認全部控罪，即否認為「殺警計劃」的串謀者，亦否認曾管有手槍。官指，陪審團若認為其證供是真實，或可能是真實，就要裁定他罪名不成立。而假若不信納李的證供，但同時未能肯定控方說法，亦應裁罪名不成立，因舉證責任在於控方，被告沒責任自證清白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官覆述李的證供，指李希望就反修例運動製作紀錄片，故在示威現場蒐證資料，但從沒使用暴力或參與暴動。李表示，為「貪小便宜」、獲黃振強資助而留在「屠龍」，亦希望了解「屠龍」背後故事以啟發靈感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李共獲得約1萬元，為免失去資助而對黃言聽計從，例如剪接「屠龍小隊精華片」，但李在「屠龍」行動期間只在旁觀察，沒參與行動。官指，陪審團應思量，黃振強是否明知李沒參與行動，仍會資助他。&lt;/p&gt;

Enabling a solution for the global debt crisis may require the United States to incorporate loans into its international development strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global indebtedness has soared to unsustainable levels and requires a long-term solution, not an endless series of bailouts. The process for helping indebted countries is inefficient and does not serve U.S. interests. To be part of the solution for countries facing a debt crisis, the United States must refresh its lending practices and learn from the mistakes and successes that China has made in its lending to the Global South. It is time to seriously reconsider how the United States may be a part of the solution. Is there a role for concessional loans in the U.S. development portfolio? Is the current U.S. strategy of funding foreign assistance exclusively through grants always the right one? Tethering development finance to U.S. foreign policy objectives while producing fiscally sustainable outcomes is a component of great power competition with China that has yet to be satisfactorily assessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and 2022, government borrowing increased by almost 4 times in Asia and the Pacific, 3 times in Africa, 2.5 times in Europe and Central Asia, and 1.6 times in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rapid rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have worsened the fiscal outlook for many deeply indebted low- and middle-income economies, particularly commodity-exporting countries vulnerable to market volatility. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global public debt hit a record $97 trillion in 2023, with developing countries shouldering a disproportionate amount relative to their share of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As emerging markets default on their loans in record numbers, the institutions of the current multilateral debt architecture — including the IMF, Group of 20 (G20), and Paris Club — have struggled to provide comprehensive or timely debt service relief, concessional financing, and debt restructuring. At least 53 economies — including Argentina, Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka — either have defaulted on some of their debts or have debt levels that the IMF considers unsustainable. Despite representing only 5 percent of the global economy, these countries are home to approximately 20 percent of the world’s population and face the highest borrowing costs. This underlying “debt tsunami” poses a major threat to global financial stability and undermines efforts to finance lagging UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt service payments now account for critical percentages of national budgets in the developing world, preventing government spending on essential public services and other investments needed to attract business. According to a June 2024 UN Trade and Development report, approximately 48 countries encompassing a population of 3.3 billion people spend more on interest payments than on education or health. In 2022, low-income nations disbursed $49 billion more to their external creditors than they received in foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Debt service payments now account for critical percentages of national budgets in the developing world, preventing government spending on essential public services and other investments needed to attract business.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-development-financing-from-loans-to-grants&quot;&gt;The Evolution of Development Financing: From Loans to Grants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debt has long been recognized as a powerful tool for economic growth and innovation when used judiciously. The U.S. foray into development loans can be traced back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor policy in the late 1930s, at which time the United States began extending development loans to Latin American countries through the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM). Over the decades, institutions such as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), EXIM Bank, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and the World Bank Group have played significant roles in providing extensive lending programs aimed at fostering global development. For instance, in 2023 alone, the World Bank Group disbursed nearly $73 billion for various projects in sectors such as infrastructure, health, and education. Similarly, the recently constituted DFC has been instrumental in supporting economic development in emerging markets, authorizing $1.6 billion in loans and $1.2 billion in equity investments in 2022 across diverse sectors, including renewable energy, healthcare, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential benefits of debt, its use in development circles has often been contentious, with many policymakers favoring grants over loans due to concerns about overindebtedness and financial stability. This shift in perspective was significantly influenced by the 2000 Meltzer Commission’s recommendations, which advocated replacing up to 50 percent of World Bank and other development agency loans with grants. The commission argued that grant funding, particularly for critical needs such as sanitation and potable water, would prevent poor countries from falling into unsustainable debt. According to then U.S. secretary of the treasury Paul O’Neill, the philosophy of “more grants, less loans” was justified by the belief that the World Bank, by lending instead of donating funds to fight poverty, had driven poor countries “into a ditch.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Meltzer testimony recommended that international finance institutions use grants to improve the quality of life in low-income countries through humanitarian assistance efforts. The commission proposed that the grants be paid directly to service providers on evidence of completion from independent auditors. Grants would bypass corrupt governments, and auditing results would improve performance. The administration under President George W. Bush went on to start one of the largest aid programs in half a century, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program, which remains grant funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Meltzer Commission report came just a few years after the IMF and World Bank launched the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996. The initiative aimed to ensure that no poor country faces an unmanageable debt burden and offered significant debt relief to qualifying countries. Debt forgiveness was seen as one of the reasons many African countries began to move along a positive economic trajectory. During this time, influential actors such as the Catholic Church and U2 lead singer Bono advocated for debt relief. They supported and contributed to the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which urged the elimination of debt for many low-income nations. This activism swayed the opinions of several politicians and resulted in the approval of funds for international debt forgiveness by the Republican-led 106th Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the HIPC Initiative was supplemented by the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), providing 100 percent relief on eligible debts from institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, IADB, and African Development Fund. There was hope that this forgiveness would resolve the issue entirely. However, many debtor countries continued irresponsibly borrowing after the HIPC Initiative. Despite the significant debt relief provided by the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives, countries such as Bolivia, Haiti, Honduras, and Nicaragua continued to face fiscal challenges. Honduras and Nicaragua saw their debt levels rise again due to continued borrowing and economic mismanagement, while Bolivia and Haiti struggled with persistent poverty and political instability, which undermined the benefits of debt relief. The initiatives brought about a moral hazard as the massive wave of forgiveness offered only temporary relief without addressing the underlying issues of fiscal discipline and economic sustainability within debtor nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roots of the transition to a grants-based development strategy were planted before the HIPC and MDRI Initiatives or the Meltzer Commission. The “New Directions” strategy, embodied in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1973, marked a shift in thinking from large capital projects such as infrastructure and policy reform to technical assistance and meeting basic human needs. As a result, infrastructure investments as a percentage of total investment by multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank declined for decades before seeing a resurgence in the early 2000s. Projects in higher-income developing countries such as Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela were phased out as the new bottom-up approach was implemented and projects were allocated solely to nations with the lowest incomes. Loans represented about a third of total military and economic assistance until a decline in this figure began in the 1980s. By 2001, loans represented a mere 1 percent of aid. The decline was, in part, due to a response to the debt issues occurring at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the U.S. development portfolio is almost entirely grant based, with foreign aid in fiscal year (FY) 2022 totaling an estimated $70.4 billion, or about 1 percent of total spending. Of this aid, 25 percent was for humanitarian activities, 21 percent was for health programs, 18 percent was for peace and security assistance, 18 percent was for economic development assistance, and the remaining 18 percent was for program support, human rights, and multisector assistance, among other purposes. Most of this aid is implemented by nongovernmental organizations rather than foreign governments, emphasizing a model that prioritizes grants over loans to minimize the risk of debt crises in developing countries. The United States remains the largest foreign aid donor globally, accounting for around 29 percent of total official development assistance from donor governments in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-emergence-as-a-major-lender-and-its-use-of-predatory-loans&quot;&gt;China’s Emergence as a Major Lender and Its Use of Predatory Loans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loan-based financing of the Global South did not stop when the United States transitioned away from lending. Instead, countries sought loans from alternative sources, including China and commercial creditors. With immense borrowing needs and limited access to development finance, emerging markets have increasingly resorted to more expensive private sector and Chinese lenders operating outside of the official Paris Club regime, creating a more diffuse credit landscape with a far riskier profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loan-based financing of the Global South did not stop when the United States transitioned away from lending. Instead, countries sought loans from alternative sources, including China and commercial creditors.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paris Club, an informal group of official creditors from major economies, aims to find sustainable solutions to payment difficulties that debtor countries experience. It provides a platform for restructuring sovereign debt and operates based on consensus and shared principles of fairness, ensuring that all participating creditors agree to similar terms and that the debtor nation is treated equitably. This coordinated approach helps prevent disorderly defaults and maintains stability in the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s disregard for the Paris Club’s principles and practices poses significant challenges. China’s lending is often opaque, more expensive, and stringent, with undisclosed terms and conditions. This lack of transparency and coordination can lead to debt traps, in which borrowing countries find themselves unable to service their debts, potentially leading to a loss of sovereignty over key assets. This approach undermines the cooperative framework the Paris Club established and creates a riskier credit environment for emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s emergence as the largest official lender to developing countries has proved the main stumbling block in the escalating sovereign debt crisis, with estimates of Chinese debt exposure ranging up to $1.5 trillion. Beijing’s unusual lack of transparency and reluctance to forgive debt have paralyzed the IMF’s ability to provide technical assistance and implement financial stabilization programs that hinge on financial assurances from existing creditors. Emergency programs such as the G20’s Common Framework — developed in late 2020 as a channel for low-income countries in need of rapid debt relief — have been plagued by delays, coordination issues, and enforcement challenges. These issues are in large part due to China’s reluctance to provide significant debt relief concessions, as well as concerns that some creditors, especially China, are pursuing more favorable side deals than others. Additionally, there are concerns that IMF bailouts or hard currency inflows from aid or remittances would flow directly into Chinese pockets. As multilateral debt talks stall, borrowers in distress have waited years for a restructuring deal without receiving a cent from the IMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s emergence as the largest official lender to developing countries has proved the main stumbling block in the escalating sovereign debt crisis, with estimates of Chinese debt exposure ranging up to $1.5 trillion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s emergence as a major lender has been transformative for global development finance. As of 2017, China had become the world’s largest official lender, surpassing the World Bank, IMF, and Paris Club combined. The China Overseas Development Finance Database details 1,099 Chinese development finance commitments abroad, amounting to $498 billion between 2008 and 2021. This volume of lending equaled 83 percent of the World Bank’s sovereign lending during that time frame, making China’s direct foreign investments some of the most active worldwide. In China’s $80 billion annual development portfolio, the vast majority of loans are targeted toward low-income countries, with significant concentrations in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. Today, more than 5 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) consists of China’s outstanding claims. However, many of China’s loans are not categorized as development loans or are classified as concessional loans. From 2013 to 2018, 49 percent of Chinese foreign assistance, which totaled an average of $7 billion annually, took the form of concessional loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese loans, almost all of which come from official government or state-controlled channels, have drawn significant criticism for being opaque and predatory. Even though China’s lending is under state control, it is decentralized and managed by various institutions that are hesitant to accept losses on their loans. Since 2000, there have been 150 documented cases of default, debt restructuring, or other credit events involving Chinese loans to developing nations. The proportion of countries defaulting on these loans has more than doubled, exceeding 10 percent of all nations since 2016. For some nations, up to 50 percent of their foreign loans originate from China, with the majority spending over a third of their government revenue on servicing this foreign debt. Notably, Sri Lanka and Zambia have already defaulted, unable to meet even the interest payments on loans used for constructing ports, mines, and power plants. This rapid increase in defaults demonstrates the risks developing countries take due to China’s lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s lending strategy often involves high interest rates and stringent terms. Many of these loans are not reported in the most widely used official debt statistics, creating a hidden debt problem. This means debtor countries and international institutions alike have an incomplete picture of how much countries around the world owe China and under what conditions. For instance, an analysis discovered that Zambia owed $6.6 billion to Chinese state-owned banks, roughly double the amount previously thought. This systematic underreporting complicates global efforts to manage and restructure debt effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese lending is also widely considered transactional, driven by a desire to secure access to critical resources such as oil, minerals, and other commodities. Some experts believe Beijing’s willingness to finance infrastructure projects, even in high-risk environments, reflects this strategy. The approach has led to increased debt burdens for borrowing countries and has been criticized as a form of “debt trap diplomacy.” Countries such as Ghana, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Zambia have faced severe economic consequences, including defaults and significant reductions in essential services, due to their inability to manage high debt repayments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ascent as a major creditor leveraging state-owned enterprises for its lending activities has introduced a significant challenge into the global economic order and the existing debt crisis. Its lending terms often include nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality clauses, making it difficult for other creditors to gauge the full extent of a country’s indebtedness to China. This development has major consequences for global debt restructuring initiatives. China’s parallel system of development finance challenges the traditional Western approach to providing assistance and negotiating debt relief, which has dominated since the end of World War II. As China’s influence continues to grow, its lending practices and the resultant debt burdens on developing countries remain critical issues for the international community, especially the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;debt-damages-foreign-assistance&quot;&gt;Debt Damages Foreign Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the severity of the debt crisis, there are now a dozen key strategic developing countries — including Kenya, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Zambia — devoting more resources to paying interest on their debt to China than to public goods and services key for development, such as education and healthcare. Development assistance does not exist in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of foreign aid grants during periods of crisis and capital outflows is highly detrimental to aid effectiveness. Grants, which are non-debt-creating flows, are counted as reserves at central banks once they are converted to local currency and spent on staff or supplies inside the recipient country. Foreign assistance flows are deposited in developing country commercial banks so that they may be spent on aid projects. These deposits are created by the developing country’s central bank, a state-owned enterprise that accepts foreign grant dollars as central bank reserves and creates domestic currency deposits for the local commercial bank. Hence, the counterpart to this grant-funded local currency spending is central bank reserves used to stabilize the currency when domestic bondholders, Eurobond holders, foreign direct investment (FDI) investors, China, and commercial lenders seek to liquidate their investments in a crisis-stricken country. IMF programs attempt to stabilize the currency with whatever dollars are available in order to buy time to make fiscal adjustments. This practice invariably leads to currency devaluation, usually some form of capital controls, and budget cuts. Hence, the current institutional framework necessarily involves using U.S. government grants and remittances to meet central bank reserve requirements instead of using the international purchasing power of the aid grants to fund development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy tools such as budget cuts, devaluation, inflation, and multiple exchange rate mechanisms enable governments to convert foreign aid into reserves, thereby reducing the aid’s international purchasing power and impact. This weakens the impact of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) grants, which are meant to be spent on goods and services to stimulate development but are instead leveraged for outflows funding debt repayments as countries undertake structural adjustment programs. IMF research suggests an increase in overall aid (comprising both loans and grants) tends to reduce domestic revenues, though loans and grants have differing effects. While the borrowing country’s capacity to repay external creditors and rebuild reserves is closely monitored, insufficient effort is made to mitigate the risk that fiscal adjustments will simply allow redirection of central bank reserves to repaying Chinese lenders, commercial creditors, and local bondholders before devaluations and reserve depletion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since U.S. taxpayers fund reserves from aid flows, ignoring the use of foreign assistance to repay China could jeopardize critical foreign assistance budgets. As a result, the purchasing power and impact of aid grants diminish. More needs to be done to build the financial and institutional capacity of recipient countries to strengthen their ability to manage aid funds transparently. Providing technical assistance to improve their fiscal policies and debt management practices can reduce reliance on foreign aid for debt repayment. Negotiating debt-for-development swaps, for instance, can ensure that aid funds are used for their intended purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The money and resources granted to a low-income country can alter how it chooses to spend government revenue. Regardless of whether the assistance is from government to government, any time dollars are deposited in the central bank of a country in debt distress, those dollars are at a higher risk of being allocated to service the debt. Grants introduce budget volatility and dependency; they may be canceled from one year to the next. When a government receives increased aid, it has several options: it can lower revenues, raise expenditures, cut domestic borrowing, or adopt a mix of these strategies. This dynamic holds true whether the aid supports the budget directly or funds specific projects. When aid finances programs that otherwise would be funded domestically, the government must adjust its budget accordingly. Over a given period, increased aid can result in lower, higher, or unchanged revenues. Foreign assistance should not be used to pay debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;upgrading-the-development-toolbox&quot;&gt;Upgrading the Development Toolbox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ choice to shift away from loans was intended to mitigate the risk of overindebtedness and maintain financial stability in developing countries. This change aimed to provide more sustainable and predictable aid without burdening recipient nations with debt; however, the developing world today is not the same as it was 30, 20, or even 10 years ago. There is now a pressing need for a refined approach to development. Grants may not be as attractive as they once were. The pervasiveness of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) demonstrates the Global South’s willingness to take on debt in exchange for infrastructure. These nations aim to graduate from relying on foreign aid to becoming self-sufficient, with robust economic growth driven by private enterprise. Additionally, many developing countries now have more financial resources from taxes and access to capital markets, allowing them to finance much of their own development. Various U.S.-led infrastructure initiatives are underway, but much work must be done to “enable a better offer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of development finance, concessional loans emerge as an instrument for facilitating sustainable growth and institutional reform in developing countries and markets. Concessional loans can provide a structured approach to development finance, ensuring that recipient countries have both the incentive and the means to enhance their economic and governance frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;earning-a-seat-at-the-table&quot;&gt;Earning a Seat at the Table&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the merits of issuing loans through a geopolitical lens, how can the United States best counter China’s BRI? Insofar as the United States uses grants, it has no voice at the debt restructuring negotiation table (or creditor committees). Providing countries with aid through loans not only finances development projects but also offers crucial flexibility and crisis mitigation options through mechanisms such as debt restructuring and forgiveness. In the event of economic or financial turmoil, a country facing difficulties repaying its debts can negotiate with its creditors for restructuring or even partial forgiveness of its obligations. This ability to negotiate can help stabilize the economy by freeing up resources for essential public spending and investment, thereby preserving the nation’s development trajectory. One key element facilitating this process is creditor committees, which bring together representatives from different lenders, including multilateral institutions, governments, and private creditors, to negotiate unified responses. By acting collectively, these committees can enforce debt restructuring decisions across all creditors, ensuring that the burdens of economic crises are shared equitably. The United States should seek to have a seat at the table given the size of its investments in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unified response is enabled by instruments such as collective action clauses (CACs). CACs are provisions included in sovereign debt contracts that allow a supermajority of bondholders to agree to a restructuring plan that binds all bondholders, even those who did not vote for the plan. These provisions are crucial for preventing holdout creditors from derailing a restructuring deal or seeking preferential treatment, which could exacerbate a country’s financial distress. Including CACs and creditor committees also helps integrate a diverse range of creditors, such as China, commercial lenders, and Eurobond holders, into coordinated relief efforts. Their participation is significant, as these creditors may not adhere to established norms such as those of the Paris Club, which has a long-standing history of helping developing countries manage their debts in times of crisis. By acting as a majority creditor, institutions such as the World Bank and IMF can wield significant influence within creditor committees, steering decisions toward sustainable outcomes. This practice ensures that all parties contribute to an equitable resolution, allowing developing nations to recover from crises more swiftly, avoid default, and maintain their path toward sustainable growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing multilateral coordination is vital to support sustainable development. Multilateral institutions should strengthen frameworks to include collective action clauses and improve transparency, especially regarding Chinese debt. U.S. institutions and international financial institutions (IFIs) should leverage their influence as lenders within creditor committees to steer debt restructuring efforts toward sustainable outcomes. This approach ensures that restructuring is not only effective but also fair and transparent, helping to stabilize the global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;improving-institutions&quot;&gt;Improving Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loans tend to improve the institutions of recipient countries. There is evidence that an increase in the degree of concessionality of assistance is good for growth in countries with poor policy and institutional environments and low GDP per capita. By contrast, countries that have better policy environments or are richer seem to absorb less concessional (but larger) aid flows more effectively. However, it is inconclusive whether concessionality helps growth in highly indebted countries. A high degree of loan concessionality improves aid effectiveness in poor countries and in countries with a poor policy environment. These results hold true in different specifications of the econometric model and are robust to different estimation techniques. However, the results of empirical analysis provide only weak evidence that more concessionality leads to higher growth in countries with high levels of debt. These results hold for concessional loans as well as grants, with the level of concessionality varying across loans (the highest level of concessional lending is a grant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Providing foreign aid to developing countries in the form of loans rather than grants can offer substantial benefits extending beyond immediate financial assistance. One key advantage is that loans can drive long-term institutional improvements, as in the argument for the nontraditional gains from trade related to free trade agreements (FTAs). This theory posits that FTAs compel signatory nations to enhance their economic and regulatory institutions, fostering better governance and stronger economic foundations. Similarly, development loans can instigate institutional reforms, particularly in areas such as corruption control, fiscal discipline, and governance transparency. For instance, loans from institutions such as the World Bank and IMF often come with conditions that require recipient nations to implement specific reforms. These conditions may include measures to improve fiscal management and governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Providing foreign aid to developing countries in the form of loans rather than grants can offer substantial benefits extending beyond immediate financial assistance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By imposing these reforms, development loans can catalyze broader institutional change, fostering a more stable and accountable governance structure. For example, the World Bank’s support for Rwanda through loans includes conditionality and support for reforms aimed at enhancing governance, transparency, and anticorruption measures. Beyond direct conditionality, loan-based financial support can drive governments to reform financial systems, deepen domestic markets, improve institutional oversight, and address systemic issues such as corruption, fiscal mismanagement, and governance inefficiencies. Grants provide financial relief but may not foster the same level of sustainable development as loans tied to institutional improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;addressing-counterarguments&quot;&gt;Addressing Counterarguments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of counterarguments to concessional loans that need to be addressed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issuing loans would exacerbate the current debt crisis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There is a serious concern that the United States, by becoming a lender, would add to the problem. The worst policy prescription the United States could pursue would be to replicate what China has done elsewhere in the world or issue loans to nations already overindebted to China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As previously discussed, funds intended for development may be appropriated for debt relief. Development agencies have already become a player in the debt crisis, but they do not have a voice at the table. Such agencies need a seat at the table if they are going to be a part of the solution. China is not interested in nursing indebted countries back to health but, rather, in maximizing its payoff. If development agencies do not want countries to depend on China, but rather to graduate to self-sufficiency and have access to U.S. creditors, then they must help these countries by offering an alternative source for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If development agencies do not want countries to depend on China, but rather to graduate to self-sufficiency and have access to U.S. creditors, then they must help these countries by offering an alternative source for loans.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A forgiven loan is the same as a grant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Taking out a loan provides a sense of ownership and accountability for the country incurring sovereign debt. Borrowing responsibly, unlike receiving grants, builds a credit history that eventually leads to greater market access. One of the issues that hinders emerging economies is the absence of robust financial institutions. Domestic lending channels can eventually develop sophisticated finance institutions in those nations. The examples of Singapore and South Korea demonstrate how loans from the United States can help develop a finance sector capable of surpassing this point of friction and achieving greater capacity. It is difficult to imagine a country that is a long-term development success story that did not develop robust financial sector capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Loans can accelerate needed institutional change and develop financial institutions that can then serve other purposes in alignment with development goals. Unlike grants, loans can incorporate conditions for debt forgiveness, aligning with strategic goals even if circumstances change. Denominating foreign assistance as a loan provides options to resolve thorny issues. If desired, debt forgiveness may be tethered to milestones regarding democracy, human rights, transparency, good governance, and other pertinent metrics. The IMF, for example, tethers its lending to strict conditionality that aligns with its mission and its institutional risk management goals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;More research and case studies are needed regarding the efficacy of loans versus grants and concessional versus nonconcessional financing. Although it would be useful to know which mode of foreign assistance is least wasteful and most effective at institutional development and what conditions affect efficacy, the geopolitical angle makes a clear distinction between the two instruments. China issues debt to expand its influence in the Global South, but the United States lacks a formidable alternative. Although allocating more resources to infrastructure projects, regardless of financial instrument, might be an important component of responding to the BRI, there is also a clear demand for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and its allies already issue loans through MDBs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. contribution to MDBs is not a sufficient substitute for the United States offering its own lending instruments. The United States is not as influential in such multilateral institutions as it once was. These institutions are, in fact, multilateral by design; executing U.S. policy is not their mandate. Hence, the United States has found itself constrained in its ability to use multilateral institutions to advance policy preferences in a competitive environment, which reflects the multilateral nature of these institutions. Reassessing how to manage influence in such institutions is undoubtedly an important piece of a larger conversation on U.S. diplomacy, but lending agencies where the United States must compete for influence, such as the IMF, are not reliable tools for U.S.-specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewing the debt crisis through a U.S.-China prism is inappropriate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The foremost priority of the Global South is its own prosperity, not the U.S.-China rivalry, which explains the Global South’s willingness to accept Chinese-owned debt. While U.S. strategy should not be overly reactionary to China, U.S. motives are, in part, driven by the great power competition with China. Beyond the immediate debt crisis undermining U.S. foreign aid and indirectly funding Chinese interests, there are few alternatives to Chinese loans. This arena is yet another soft power void China has filled because the United States has failed to lead. China’s approach has shown imperial tendencies, as evidenced by its seizing of ports for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Beyond the geostrategic implications of inaction, there are opportunity costs. By reentering the loan business, the United States can establish a foundation in emerging markets, fostering future diplomatic relations and economic growth by playing a more prominent role in resolving the debt crisis. The United States is spending tens of billions annually, and more countries and higher-income developing partners can be reached through loans. Hence, adding this tool to the U.S. foreign assistance toolbox expands the envelope of aid and the geographic reach of U.S. assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-nuanced-approach-to-loans&quot;&gt;A Nuanced Approach to Loans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the insufficiency of MDBs, the Global South’s demand for infrastructure investments, geopolitical competition, and the ineffectiveness of foreign aid amid persistent debt crises, it is time to strategize how, when, and where to reintroduce loans, alongside grants, as a tool for international development. Whereas grants are indispensable for humanitarian aid and for sectors where revenue generation is not feasible, such as health and education, loans may well have a role in the U.S. development policy arsenal to help accomplish particular foreign policy objectives. The critical question is how to introduce loans effectively, ensuring benefits for developing countries, U.S. taxpayers, and diplomatic partnerships while countering China’s influence in the global arena. To achieve these goals, several considerations should be weighed to ensure the appropriate use of loans in development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy loans on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A systematic overhaul would take far too long, unnecessarily forfeit the practical and procedural expertise acquired in the current grant-based system, and severely weaken foreign aid in the short to medium term. Critically, loans should not be a one-size-fits-all solution; instead, they should be deployed on a highly customized case-by-case basis to ensure that the specific economic conditions and developmental needs of each country are adequately addressed. An effective loan-based strategy in an emerging market may not be appropriate for a low-income country.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, in a scenario where donating to a middle-to-high-income country may come at the expense of programs needed in lower-income countries, perhaps a loan to the middle- or high-income country would help resources go further. Foreign assistance to higher-income countries should not detract from resources available to poorer nations. A more balanced approach might look like the immediate humanitarian needs that grants address, with long-term growth potential facilitated by loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize significant sectors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Loans should be considered for projects that are economically viable and have potential to generate revenue, thereby enabling the recipient country to service the debt without compromising its financial stability. A win would be a project delivering on the developmental goals of the recipient country and the strategic interests of the United States, as well as creating a return on investment. Such projects could include the infrastructure, renewable energy, and technology sectors, which support workforce development, job creation, FDI, and other contributors to economic growth and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate country characteristics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Assessing the recipient country’s institutional capacity to manage and use loans effectively is crucial. This assessment includes evaluating governance structures, financial management systems, and transparency measures. Grants and loans perform better in countries with strong institutions. The United States does not want to make the same mistake China did with some of its BRI loans by overissuing loans to high-risk nations. A nation that has quality institutions or demonstrates a strong positive trajectory may be a good target recipient for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider political feasibility.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Loans may be reserved for instances where grants might have political costs. Loans could be a useful tool in moments where the size and timeline of an endeavor may seem too large of an undertaking with grants. For example, aid to Ukraine is detracting from aid allocated elsewhere while donor fatigue compounds. A lend-lease model, similar to the Lend-Lease Act for the United Kingdom during World War II, could be employed. This model provides substantial long-term support to a trusted ally through loans rather than grants, emphasizing strategic partnership and future repayment. Framing aid to Ukraine in this way, with the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, has helped sustain its defense while aligning long-term repayment with broader geopolitical stability. In instances where a large-scale aid effort is required, loans can be used to sustain support without overwhelming immediate budgets or political capital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not abandon grants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An approach to development that includes loans should not spiral into something unintended. Issuing loans must not be mistaken for a prelude to a new iteration of the HIPC Initiative. The U.S. development apparatus has spent decades acquiring valuable technical expertise regarding grants. It would be unwise for development agencies to abandon or heavily reduce grant-based projects, but there are adjustments that, if pursued, would foster some of the benefits of loans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Again, a major concern with grant-based development projects is that the central banks of indebted nations will convert the funds to local currency and use this to pay off loans owed to China. To help counteract this, the United States should disburse money as projects are completed, not up front, monitoring disbursements pursuant to project completion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should consider issuing loans in order to complement existing grant mechanisms, help nations navigate the Beijing-bolstered debt crisis, and act in the most strategic sense. Loans should be designed with concessional terms, including extended durations, low interest rates, and grace periods, to ensure that they remain manageable for recipient countries. Loans and grants can supplement each other: grants can address immediate humanitarian needs and critical infrastructure, while loans can fund revenue-generating projects that build long-term economic growth. This combined approach ensures that urgent issues are addressed without exacerbating debt burdens while also promoting sustainable development and financial independence in recipient countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. government should consider issuing loans in order to complement existing grant mechanisms, help nations navigate the Beijing-bolstered debt crisis, and act in the most strategic sense.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is exploiting nations by swapping debt for equity. This new era of mercantilism must be stopped. Reintroducing loans as a development tool, when done thoughtfully and strategically, can enhance the effectiveness of U.S. foreign assistance, foster sustainable development, create strong diplomatic ties, and effectively counter China’s growing influence in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union have each recently enacted legislation providing for an unprecedented volume of public investments in semiconductors, with the largest portion allocated to the establishment of new onshore chip production facilities. Substantial funds are also allocated to semiconductor research and development, supply chain security, and workforce expansion and training. These parallel initiatives have been prompted by an awareness in both regions of threats to economic and strategic security arising out of their dependency on foreign-made chips. The question posed by the enactment of the two Chips Acts is how such joint activities can be deepened, broadened, and leveraged by direct engagement between the United States, the European Union, and national authorities to address the vulnerabilities faced by both ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shared-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Shared Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and EU economies were disrupted by shortages of semiconductors during the Covid-19 pandemic. These emerged from unexpected surges in demand for chips (e.g., for electronic devices), which led to curtailed auto production in both regions. Reportedly, the U.S. automotive industry lost production of some four million vehicles due to chip shortages in and after 2020, while in Europe, a senior German official observed in 2023 that “we lost 1-1.5 percent of our GDP in 2021 because of a lack of semiconductors — or about €40bn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genuine post-pandemic vulnerabilities remain. Both the United States and the European Union are heavily dependent on chips fabricated in Taiwan and could experience catastrophic economic disruption if conflict between China and Taiwan shuts off the island’s semiconductor exports. Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in January 2024 that “all of the leading-edge chips that are critical to our infrastructure, to AI, to our national security ambitions, automotive manufacturing even, are being built in one part — a fragile part of the world [Taiwan].” Bloomberg Economics estimates that a war over Taiwan would cost the global economy $10 trillion in the first year. While this may overstate the risk, even a fraction of that loss would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the European Union share the reality that neither party has the capability to manufacture at scale the most advanced semiconductors, which are at the 2 and 3 nanometer (nm) nodes. That capability resides in part in South Korea but mainly in Taiwan. These chips are essential to produce new generations of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) as well as for 5G and 6G telecommunications, applications increasingly vital to national security and economic competitiveness. Efforts to catch up with the leaders in the production of the most advanced logic chips and to establish secure chip supply chains will require very large and sustained investments and significant technological effort. With the United States and the European Union facing the same strategic dilemma and seeking to avoid costly duplicative investments, it is not surprising that both Chips Acts call for international collaboration with allies and partners. (The U.S. CHIPS Act is an acronym: Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors. The EU Chips Act is not. When referring to them together, the authors have opted for Chips Acts. When referred to separately, they are referred to as U.S. CHIPS and EU Chips.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, U.S.- and EU-based chip companies have decades of experience collaborating on chip research and production at universities and research organizations such as France’s CEA-Leti, Belgium’s Imec, and the Albany NanoTech Complex. Companies based in the United States and Europe have operated chipmaking facilities and participated in collaborative research centers for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With the United States and the European Union facing the same strategic dilemma and seeking to avoid costly duplicative investments, it is not surprising that both Chips Acts call for international collaboration with allies and partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comparing-the-us-and-eu-chips-acts&quot;&gt;Comparing the U.S. and EU Chips Acts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad outlines of the U.S. and EU Chips Acts are similar, reflecting shared concerns. It is clear that, as the two acts were in their formative stages, each party took note of the measures being contemplated by the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both pieces of legislation envision industry-government partnerships with similar strategic goals: reducing dependency on offshore chip manufacturing, ensuring greater supply chain security and resiliency, encouraging production at the leading edge, and growing a workforce to support the achievement of these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The amount of direct public funding provided pursuant to both acts is roughly comparable. Each party allocates the bulk of the planned expenditure to investments in onshore chipmaking facilities. Most of the remainder will be directed toward applied R&amp;amp;D by public-private research organizations to enable “lab-to-fab” transfers of innovations from the research base to industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both acts emerged as policy responses to the geostrategic risks and eventual technological challenge of a rising China, compounded by the concentration of the world’s most advanced semiconductor production being in Taiwan, with its geostrategic and geological risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both the United States and the European Union acknowledge that existing interdependencies between them make collaboration imperative. Reflecting that awareness, EU-based semiconductor firms are eligible for U.S. CHIPS Act funding and U.S.-based firms can receive EU Chips Act support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Both parties are in accord that Japan must be involved in Chips Act–related initiatives, reflecting its “like-minded” democracy status and its dominance in many key semiconductor equipment and materials sectors. Importantly, Japan has recently launched a major initiative: Rapidus, a government-funded start-up foundry that is working in close cooperation with New York CREATES at the Albany Nanotech Complex and Belgium’s Imec with ambitions to regain Japan’s place at the forefront of global advanced chip production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they have similar objectives, the U.S. and EU Chips Acts are distinguishable in a number of respects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Aid Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; European Union competition law provides that “state aids” (subsidies) are prohibited unless approved by EU competition authorities pursuant to one of the exceptions to the general prohibition, such as aids for regional development, environmental and climate purposes, or research and innovation. The EU Chips Act’s public outlays by member states are subject to this approval requirement. In order to fit within one of the exceptions to the state aids prohibition, EU Chips Act funds must be directed to “first-of-kind” manufacturing facilities that fall under the exception for promotion of innovation (or other exceptions, such as regional development). The United States has no comparable rule or law limiting “state aids” or subjecting subsidies by U.S. states to prior federal approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal and State-Based Support:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. federal CHIPS Act subsidies are augmenting state government incentives for chip facilities, some of which are substantial — New York State, for example, is providing Micron Technologies $5.5 billion to support its investment in two new memory chip fabs near Syracuse. In contrast to the European Union, which must approve all state aid initiatives, the federal government lacks the authority to regulate such state outlays, leading some observers to warn of a subsidy race among U.S. states. It is worth noting, though, that in reality such subsidy races have existed among U.S. states and foreign governments for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New vs. Existing Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; A major difference is that “the EU Chips Act does not create new financial resources.” The U.S. CHIPS Act funding is “new money” — federal outlays appropriated by Congress for the first time. EU Chips Act expenditures consist primarily of funds being redirected from existing EU-funded programs, although within individual member states new funds seem to be available. Still, the European Commission is allocating €4.2 billion from its budget to implement the research elements of the Chips Act; of this, €2.7 billion is being redirected from Horizon Europe, the European Union’s umbrella research and innovation program, and €1.4 billion from the Digital Europe Program, which seeks to encourage the use of digital technologies by European businesses and public institutions. This “shuffling of funds” between EU programs is proving controversial. According to one member of the European Parliament, the result is “a shame for Europe because we are investing in chips, but we take it away from other priorities like cybersecurity. We trade our future against our security.” A European academic recently fumed that “Horizon Europe is not a lemon, so stop squeezing it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax Incentives:&lt;/strong&gt; In a major difference, the U.S. CHIPS Act provides substantial new federal tax incentives for investments in chipmaking facilities, while the EU Chips Act does not. The U.S. tax incentives are generous, providing up to 25 percent tax credits for investments initiated (not completed) by the end of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Frameworks:&lt;/strong&gt; The institutional framework for most U.S. CHIPS Act funding is relatively simple: a bilateral grant agreement between the Department of Commerce and individual industry recipients. The EU Chips Act has more layers and more players. Companies seeking public funding must first secure commitments from one or more individual member state governments, but those outlays must be approved by the European Commission pursuant to the EU competition rules. The EU Chips Act provisions for applied research emphasize public-private consortia involving multiple industrial and public actors and multiple member states. The U.S. programs are more straightforward, but some critics have suggested that they include a multiplicity of requirements that add complications in process and execution. The U.S. CHIPS Act also has “upside sharing” provisions which require firms receiving $150 million or more in federal funding which subsequently enjoy windfall profits to share a portion of their future returns above an established threshold. The government will use moneys received to support the purposes of the CHIPS Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; The EU Chips Act contains a provision to expedite the permitting process for first-of-kind chip facilities, even to the extent of allowing derogation from environmental requirements. The U.S. CHIPS Act has no comparable provision (although it is likely to need one). U.S. chipmaking facilities could be delayed for several years if the National Environmental Policy Act is allowed to apply to planned greenfield chipmaking facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;synopsis-of-the-us-chips-act&quot;&gt;Synopsis of the U.S. CHIPS Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 was enacted in August 2022, though the “CHIPS Act” incentives and research programs were initially established (unfunded) in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act authorized and appropriated $39 billion in grants, loans, and loan guarantees for chip manufacturing on U.S. soil.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act provided a 25 percent tax credit, initially valued by the Congressional Budget Office at $46 billion, for investments in chip manufacturing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act appropriated $2 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) Microelectronics Commons, along with $11 billion for Department of Commerce research and development programs. This included the establishment of a National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), a National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), a Manufacturing USA Institute, and funding for related National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) microelectronics research.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another $2 billion was initially set aside for legacy chips used in automotive and many other applications, though NIST sees the $2 billion figure as “a floor, not a ceiling.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Companies awarded subsidies under the CHIPS Act are subject to a 10-year ban prohibiting them from producing chips at nodes under 28 nanometers in China, Russia, and other “countries of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act also authorized, but did not appropriate, $174 billion for various federal science and research programs not directly focused on semiconductors and telecommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;governance-structure&quot;&gt;Governance Structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden and the Department of Commerce have taken a number of institutional steps to ensure the implementation of the CHIPS Act:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The White House, pursuant to the CHIPS Act, has established a Subcommittee for Microelectronics Leadership within the President’s National Science and Technology Council. The subcommittee is tasked with developing a national strategy for microelectronics research, development, manufacturing, and supply chain security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The White House has established the CHIPS Innovation Steering Council to “coordinate and develop the policies needed to effectively implement the [CHIPS] Act within the executive branch.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department has established two offices within NIST:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Program Office (CPO) is tasked with awarding CHIPS Act funding, engaging stakeholders, and coordinating semiconductor-related activities of the federal agencies. At the end of November 2023, Adrienne Elrod, director of external and government affairs at CPO, reported that CPO had hired over 150 staffers; as of July 2024, it had received over 670 expressions of interest from semiconductor firms proposing investments in chips research, production, and construction of facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The CHIPS R&amp;amp;D Office is to oversee the NSTC, the NAPMP, the CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute, and CHIPS metrology research, receiving advisory support from an Industrial Advisory Committee staffed with industry and academic experts in microelectronics fields.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the two offices are to jointly engage with comparable organizations in allied and partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation-to-date&quot;&gt;Implementation to Date&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers have criticized the slow pace at which the CHIPS Act has been implemented without regard for the novelty and scale of the program, but in late 2023 and throughout 2024 the Commerce Department made a flurry of major awards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On December 11, 2023, the Commerce Department announced its first CHIPS Act award, a grant of $35 million to the UK-based BAE Systems to quadruple its capacity for making specialized devices for use in F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, satellites, and other defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January 2024, the Commerce Department announced a CHIPS Act award of $162 million to Microchip Technology, intended to significantly increase its production of microcontrollers and mature-node semiconductors with applications in automobiles, cellphones, and the defense and aerospace sectors. The funds will be used to triple the capacity of the company’s fabrication sites in Colorado and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January 2024, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo announced the creation of the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (Natcast), a nonprofit tasked with operating the NSTC, which will be the “focal point for research and engineering throughout the semiconductor ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As noted, in November 2023, the Commerce Department outlined a plan to invest $3 billion in CHIPS Act funds to expand U.S. advanced packaging capability. The department noted that at present, “we do not have advanced packaging in the US capable of high-volume manufacturing.” The advanced packaging plan will include a pilot facility that will “provide a place to test the new equipment and processes” and “allow for hands-on workforce development.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, the Commerce Department announced the award of multi-billion-dollar incentive packages to major chip manufacturers for investments in wafer fabrication facilities in the United States:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In February, CHIPS awarded GlobalFoundries up to $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in loans, respectively, to expand its campus in Malta, New York, and to revitalize its fabrication plant in Burlington, Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In March, the Commerce Department announced the award of $8.5 billion in grants to Intel Corporation, making available up to $11 billion in federal loans. Intel indicated it would use the support for investments in Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In April, the Commerce Department announced the award of $6.14 billion in grants to Micron Technology for investments in two semiconductor memory facilities in Syracuse, New York, as well a third fab colocated with its existing facility in Boise, Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That same month, the Commerce Department announced the award of $6.6 billion in grants and up to $5 billion in loans to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to build a third chip fabrication facility in addition to its two facilities under construction in Arizona. The newest fab will reportedly manufacture chips at process technologies of 2 nm or below.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department also awarded $6.4 billion to Samsung Electronics to support its investments in a new chipmaking campus in Taylor, Texas, as well as an expansion of its Austin, Texas facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In May, the Commerce Department awarded $120 million to Polar Semiconductor, a maker of power and sensor chips, to double its U.S. production capacity in Minnesota. The deal will allow Polar to draw in another $450 million in U.S. private capital and $75 million from the state of Minnesota, helping to transform Polar to a majority U.S.-owned foundry.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May, the Commerce Department announced its first investment in the upstream semiconductor supply chain, granting up to $75 million to Absolics for a facility manufacturing next-generation glass substrates in Covington, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Although unconfirmed, according to Politico, $3.5 billion from the CHIPS fund has been reportedly diverted toward a “secure enclave” project to manufacture state-of-the-art and secure chips for defense purposes. Draft appropriations legislation passed by the House Committee on Appropriations shows $1.5 billion allocated for the secure enclave in FY 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A May 2024 study by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group forecast that with the CHIPS Act support, U.S.-based semiconductor capacity will increase by 203 percent by 2032, and that the U.S. share of global chipmaking capacity will increase for the first time in decades during the same time frame, from 10 percent to 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2024, Mike Schmidt, director of the CHIPS Program Office, said that “because of the CHIPS Act, every company capable of producing leading edge semiconductors at scale is now expanding in the United States . . .”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In July 2024, the administration announced that it was launching a “workforce partner alliance,” allocating some of the funds appropriated for the NSTC to award grants to as many as 10 workforce development projects with budgets ranging from $500,000 to $2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That same month, the CHIPS Office announced it would make several awards of roughly $150 million each, up to $1.6 billion total, for research activities to “establish and accelerate domestic capacity for semiconductor advanced packaging.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, the Commerce Department reached a $450 million grant agreement with South Korean advanced memory chip firm SK Hynix to support their planned $4 billion high-bandwidth memory production, packaging, and R&amp;amp;D hub colocated with Purdue University in West Lafayette. With this award, all five of the world’s leading-edge memory, logic, and packaging companies have now agreed to build in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Timeline of CHIPS Implementation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;darpas-initiative&quot;&gt;DARPA’s Initiative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal support for the semiconductor industry pursuant to the CHIPS Act will be augmented by activities at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), funded through the DOD’s budget rather than the CHIPS Act. DARPA plans to launch a domestic hub for prototyping advanced semiconductor fabrication techniques. Given DARPA’s extraordinary track record of breakthrough innovations, this development is significant, but its impact is likely to be felt only over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research center envisioned by DARPA will focus on 3D heterogeneous integrated (3DHI) microsystems, which feature the integration of diverse chip types into a single package for dramatically improved performance. DARPA regards this effort as potentially transformational for the U.S. economy and hopes to stand up the center by 2029. DARPA is establishing teams via a contract to pursue the initiative in two phases, each with a projected budget of $420 million. The goal is to create “a self-sustaining 3DHI center at an existing facility that is owned and operated by a non-federal entity, and accessible to users in academia, government, and industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3D projects bolster DARPA’s Electronics Resurgence Initiative (ERI) — launched in 2017, with a follow-on ERI 2.0 announced in 2022 — which is focusing on advanced manufacturing opportunities and enabling electronic systems to function in extreme environments. DARPA plans to spend $3 billion on this effort over the next five years. DARPA’s Beyond Scaling Initiative, launched in 2017, develops software to automate and optimize chip design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what is most significant about the DARPA initiatives is that they underscore that the CHIPS Act, while remarkable, will not be sufficient on its own to reinvigorate and grow this key industry in the United States. The U.S. effort needs to be sustained and at scale if it is to have the desired impact, particularly in light of other countries’ sizeable investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;synopsis-of-the-eu-chips-act&quot;&gt;Synopsis of the EU Chips Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably one major impact of the U.S. CHIPS Act was to stimulate a similar effort in Europe. The European Commission and European Parliament approved the European Chips Act in July 2023, with the act becoming effective on September 21, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, the EU Chips Act involves at least €43 billion in identified public funding, with the expectation that this will spur a roughly equal amount of private investment. Most of the public funding will be provided by the governments of the member states, not through the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the European Union, the €43 billion in public funds will include some private money and only €3.3 billion from the European Union’s budget, making the composition of the Chips Act funding less distinct. A 2023 analysis of the Chips Act conducted under the auspices of the Austrian government laments that “it is difficult to understand who is funding what, and how much fresh money is available for the Chips Act . . . the Chips Act is to be supported with an estimated overall level of policy-driven investment in excess of EUR 43 billion up to 2030. However, it remains unclear how much will come from the EU level, Member States and companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU Chips Act is designed to ensure Europe’s “strategic autonomy” and sovereignty by enabling a secure supply of critical chips. To do this, the European Union is creating three “pillars”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Joint Undertaking:&lt;/strong&gt; The first pillar is a public-private collaboration designated as the EU Chips Joint Undertaking (JU). It focuses on developing advanced chip technology (2 nm and below, quantum chips, and new production methods for such technologies). Themes include semiconductor research, pilot lines, standards, certification for energy efficiency and security of chips, skills, and networking of semiconductor research centers. Pillar one will reportedly be publicly funded with €11 billion. This effort roughly corresponds to the U.S. plan for the NSTC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Advanced Chip Production in Europe:&lt;/strong&gt; The second pillar, which is to absorb the bulk of EU public funding, will seek to establish vertically integrated manufacturing centers and “open EU foundries,” which will produce chips designed by others for third parties. To qualify, projects must be “first-of-kind” in the European Union, involving novel technology nodes, substrate materials, or other innovations that enhance chip performance, such as reduced power requirements and durability. Participating second-pillar companies will receive priority access to the pilot lines established pursuant to the first pillar. Companies participating in the second pillar are eligible for financial support from the European Union and member states, with funding reportedly totaling some $30 billion. Companies like Infineon and STMicro as well as Intel are seeking a portion of these funds to support new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Supply:&lt;/strong&gt; The third pillar will seek to ensure continuity of supply in the event of a chip shortage. It will involve monitoring to provide early warning of looming shortages, coordinated procurement, and a mandatory shift in production toward scarce chip types, with favorable investment terms offered to companies as a quid pro quo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance of the EU Chips Act will be divided between the European Semiconductor Board and the Chips Joint Undertaking. The board will comprise representatives of the member states and be chaired by the European Commission. The Governing Board of the Chips Joint Undertaking consists of representatives from participating member states, corporate representatives, and the European Commission. Within the commission, the Chips Act is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content, and Technology (DG-CNET).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implementation-to-date-1&quot;&gt;Implementation to Date&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe is making impressive progress with multiple major announcements. As in the United States, the prospect of public funding is having a major catalytic impact. It is also evident from investment announcements and approvals granted by the European Union and member states that implementation of the EU Chips Act will entail major collaborations with foreign partners, notably U.S. firms but also Taiwan’s TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A leading example is U.S.-based Intel, which has outlined its plan to invest $88 billion in expanding its chip research and manufacturing facilities in Europe. In 2023, Intel secured a commitment from the government of Germany for nearly $11 billion in subsidies, which will be used to fund a chipmaking facility in Magdeburg. For its part, Intel will invest €30 billion in this project. Intel will invest €12 billion in Leixlip, Ireland, to double its manufacturing space for Intel 4 process technology. In addition, Intel is investing $4.6 billion in an assembly and test facility in Poland, which will test Intel chips fabricated in Germany and Ireland. The Polish government is expected to cover about one-third of this investment. Intel is also investing in other chip projects in France, Italy, and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a cooperative effort, U.S.-based GlobalFoundries and STMicroelectronics have secured approval from the European Union to receive French government subsidies to build a chip fabrication plant in Crolles, France. The French will provide $8.13 billion to this project. GlobalFoundries is also investing in the expansion of its existing facilities in Dresden, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S.-based chipmaker Wolfspeed has announced plans to invest $3 billion in a new silicon carbide chip plant in Germany and expects the German government to provide 20 percent of this amount in subsidies to support the project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In August 2023, Infineon (Germany), Bosch (Germany), TSMC (Taiwan), and NXP Semiconductors (the Netherlands) announced plans to establish the European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to build a chip fabrication plant in Dresden that will be majority-owned and operated by TSMC. Total investments are expected to be €10 billion and receive “strong support” from the European Union and the German government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Germany’s Infineon announced plans to build a €5 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in Dresden to make power semiconductors and analog and mixed signals components. It is seeking €1 billion in public funding to support the project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The European Union has approved grants of €292.5 million from the government of Italy to STMicroelectronics to build a silicon carbide semiconductor substrate manufacturing plant in Catania. In July 2024, the Chips JU announced the availability of €325 million in calling for proposals for chips research, including the creation of “competence centers” to provide technical expertise and research support, particularly for small and medium enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-to-government-bilateral-engagement&quot;&gt;Government-to-Government Bilateral Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. and the EU Chips Acts mandate international collaboration, a recognition that neither region can achieve self-sufficiency in microelectronics. While the precise form such collaboration will take is not clear, certain broad themes have begun to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment of Export Controls:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the European Union are taking concrete steps to align their chip technology export controls with respect to “countries of concern,” principally China. The U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed strict controls on the export of U.S. chips and chipmaking technology to China. In September 2023, the government of the Netherlands established new export licensing rules which will prevent the Dutch maker of extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment from exporting its most advanced chipmaking tools and technology to China. The European Union has released a white paper that proposes to establish a system of export controls at the EU level, as opposed to the current patchwork regime in which member states unilaterally implement their own controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Multilateral Efforts:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. CHIPS Act creates a $500 million International Technology Security and Innovation Fund administered by the State Department to support the coordination of chip export controls between the United States and its allies and partners. Participation in the fund is contingent on countries “having export controls on semiconductor trade with China that are ‘substantially equivalent’ to those imposed by the U.S.” As previous CSIS analysis has argued, new arrangements for aligning export controls are critical for the success of these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment of Outbound Investment Screening:&lt;/strong&gt; In August 2023, President Biden signed an executive order restricting outbound U.S. investment into China’s semiconductor, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence industries. A senior administration official said that some U.S. allies, including the European Commission and Germany, were contemplating the imposition of “their own similar programs.” Some analysts have suggested that the multilateral approach that has emerged with respect to chip technology exports to China could serve as a model for multilateral controls on outbound investments in AI and other sensitive technologies to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Effective TTC Bilateral Working Group:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and the European Union have established a standing bilateral working group under the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC), which, among many other issues, is addressing semiconductor-related matters of concern to both parties. The TTC was established in 2021 to serve as a forum “to coordinate approaches to key global trade, economic and technology issues and to deepen transatlantic trade and economic relations based on shared democratic values.” The TTC comprises a number of working groups, including one focusing on “secure supply chains, including semiconductors” and another addressing “export controls.” Other working groups address themes such as climate and green tech, technology standards cooperation, and data governance. The TTC meets regularly, with recent meetings in May 2023, January 2024, and April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Early Warning System:&lt;/strong&gt; According to Adrienne Elrod of the CHIPS Office, the European Union and the United States, working within the TTC framework, have completed an early warning system to alert the two parties to potential disruptions in the semiconductor supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Transparency Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The parties have completed work on a transparency mechanism for sharing information about public support for the semiconductor producers of both regions, part of a bilateral effort to avoid a subsidies “race to the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has expressed the hope that the United States and the European Union will bilaterally address the European Union’s pending “Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive,” which proposes the phaseout of perfluorinated and polyperfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), which “are a critical component of the semiconductor industry, specifically, in the manufacturing of microchips. Currently, there are no viable replacements for this application on the market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precompetitive R&amp;amp;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Major research and development resources will be necessary to enable the U.S. and EU chip industries to remain internationally competitive. Both Chips Acts commit substantial funds to precompetitive R&amp;amp;D — in the European Union, this effort is led by the EU Chips Joint Undertaking and in the United States it will be led by the NSTC. The parties recognize that collaboration in the precompetitive space is essential given the sheer scale of the technological challenge — and, in some cases, the need to avoid duplication — although multiple paths toward similar research objectives can often be fruitful in unexpected ways. U.S. and EU companies, universities, and public research organizations are already engaged in a wide range of precompetitive R&amp;amp;D collaborations bringing together U.S. and EU researchers. The question is whether the new research initiatives envisioned by the dual Chips Acts can augment, inform, and perhaps coordinate these efforts or serve to reinforce them through a major injection of resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Need for Roadmaps?&lt;/strong&gt; An obvious role for the U.S. NSTC and its national and EU counterparts would be to serve as research hubs at the center of broader chip research networks to identify potential technological stumbling blocks in any aspect of the semiconductor ecosystem, from materials and tools through chip fabrication, assembly, test, and packaging. These challenges can then be addressed directly at the U.S. and EU hubs themselves or by delegation to other proven research entities in the network. The U.S. Sematech consortium, formed in 1988, served this function, overseeing the creation of a chip industry “roadmap” to spot looming technological hurdles and ensure that adequate research efforts were directed to surmount those hurdles, whether by Sematech itself or by other public or private actors. This role would require informed cooperative leadership and ongoing roadmap efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities for Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; On November 30, 2023, the European Union’s Joint Undertaking issued a €1.67 billion call for proposals to develop pilot lines for various chip technologies, thus giving an indication of the chip research themes most of interest to Europe. The pilot line awards were announced in April 2024. Some of the themes are coextensive with a number of U.S. industry and government chip technology concerns, and the areas of overlap could form the basis for bilateral collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Heterogeneous System Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Heterogenous systems integration and assembly involve the use of advanced packaging technologies to combine semiconductor materials, circuits, and components into a single compact system. This effort parallels the U.S. DARPA chip effort noted above as well as the packaging initiative under the auspices of the Commerce Department.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading-Edge Nodes:&lt;/strong&gt; The project of manufacturing nodes at or below 2 nm envisions closing or at least reducing the technological gap with Taiwan and South Korea in leading-edge chips — a major U.S. goal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (FD-SOI) toward 7 nm:&lt;/strong&gt; FD-SOI is a manufacturing process that improves chip performance and reduces power consumption. These devices have applications in the automotive sector, the Internet of Things, and telecommunications, among other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wide Bandgap Semiconductors:&lt;/strong&gt; Wide bandgap semiconductors employ materials that enable a chip to operate at higher voltage, frequency, and temperature than standard silicon chips. These devices have applications in power generation, electric vehicles, telecommunications, and aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of observers have noted that a collaboration between the NSTC and imec, the European Union’s foremost microelectronics research center, is an obvious way to launch a strategic effort by the United States and the European Union to coordinate their chip R&amp;amp;D agendas. Belgium-based imec has an unparalleled record of international collaborations in semiconductors and has been characterized by The Economist as “one of the most essential industrial research-and-development research and development (R&amp;amp;D) centres on the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imec has suggested a collaboration in which it concentrates on early-stage technology development closer to basic research with a 7–10 year time horizon (device architectures and process modules), while the NSTC focuses on development stages closer to the market, such as prototyping, scaling, and transfer to manufacturing, with a 4–6 year time horizon. Some cooperation reflecting this approach appears to be underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To enable a rapid and effective ramp-up, this effort should leverage existing chip research infrastructure — notably New York CREATES Nanotech Complex in Albany, imec in Flanders, CEA-Leti in Grenoble, and the German Fraunhofer centers focused on semiconductor technologies. These facilities have enormous advantages in terms of existing infrastructure and the ability to add on new capabilities at lower cost and with less regulatory overhang. They also benefit from the presence of established partners and protocols, long-standing state or regional support, and well-developed networks of related firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that proposals to construct “greenfield” facilities will encounter daunting hurdles in terms of the cost and regulatory delays associated with new construction, the time required for construction, and the need to recruit and staff a new facility. Indeed, the capital costs for a major new facility are beyond the resources of the CHIPS Act and certainly not envisaged in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult to identify any historical precedent for the current U.S.-EU effort to coordinate their industrial policies to achieve common objectives in a vital sector. Bilateral relations have long been marred by acrimonious disputes over agriculture, steel, and commercial aircraft. Nonetheless, the Atlantic community has experienced a common economic trauma — the Covid-19-driven chip shortage — and it now confronts a shared strategic and commercial challenge from China. Consequently, the drive for a more cooperative approach is real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the foundations for productive collaboration already exist in the form of the multiple transatlantic partnerships that have grown organically between the companies, universities, and research organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. Early developments of the TTC are arguably auspicious — the parties’ joint actions on export controls and the deliberations and cooperation in the TTC are both positive indicators of a will to cooperate at the political level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation, however, is harder in practice than in declarations, especially when competing perspectives and needs, differing capabilities, and the competing policies and practices of national and supernational bureaucracies come into play. Even so, the alignments in place suggest that current plans for cooperation among the regional cooperative research institutes are well suited — indeed best suited — to lead concrete, mutually advantageous cooperation in close consultation with the companies themselves and leading research universities. Providing the policy space for this organic cooperation based on the identification of productive opportunities may be in fact the best path forward, one that benefits from high-level approval but is driven by technological opportunity and commercial needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（19日）踏入第75日審訊，法官張慧玲第二日引導陪審團。張官引述控方立場指，Telegram 群組「行山討論區」是為了於11月16日試槍及炸彈而設，目的是將串謀付諸實行。辯方則指，若說試槍及炸彈是為促進串謀則太過早，因試槍當日尚未知道大行動落實的日期及地點。辯方指，最早於12月3日才知道大行動的落實日期。而代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成更認為，12月8日凌晨吳智鴻與黃振強在餐廳見面時，才正式落實大行動的地點，因此「屠龍」一方最早於上述時間知道串謀協議的全部詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官引述辯方立場-指屠龍123才知道大行動落實日期&quot;&gt;官引述辯方立場 指「屠龍」12.3才知道大行動落實日期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第二日引導陪審團。張官提及，陪審團需要考慮 Telegram 群組「行山討論區」之目的，控方的立場是群組為了測試槍械及炸彈而設，目的是將串謀付諸實行。辯方則指，若說試槍及炸彈是為促進串謀，則太過早，因試槍日期為11月16日，當時尚未知道大行動的落實日期及地點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方的立場是，最早於12月3日才知道大行動的落實日期。而代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成更認為，12月8日凌晨吳智鴻與黃振強在灣仔的薔紅餐廳見面時，才正式落實大行動的地點，因此「屠龍」一方最早於上述時間知道串謀協議的全部詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官若試槍屬將串謀付諸實行亦只針對吳智鴻團隊的被告&quot;&gt;官：若試槍屬將串謀付諸實行、亦只針對吳智鴻團隊的被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官又指，即使陪審團認為去西貢行山試槍是屬於將串謀付諸實行的行為，亦只可以考慮作為針對吳智鴻一方，即被告賴振邦及許湛榮的證據，而不可以考慮針對屬「屠龍」成員的被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官另表示，陪審團需要考慮 Telegram 帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」的使用者是否賴振邦，若認為是他的話，就要決定賴的行為是否顯示他屬串謀的一份子。至於許湛榮，雖然他在「行山討論區」群組並無發言，但警方在吳智鴻家中找到一張地圖，上面有許的指紋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官串謀有分工各人負責不同部分&quot;&gt;官：串謀有分工、各人負責不同部分&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於吳智鴻一方在11月25日在賴振邦的「3C 維修工作室」後樓梯，測試引爆裝置的事件，張官表示，若陪審團認為「屠龍」屬串謀的一份子，即使上述試爆事件「屠龍」成員並不在場，但也可以考慮屬串謀的一部分。張官解釋，因串謀當中有不同分工，有些人負責製作炸彈，有些人負責其他部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件明（20日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

Despite appeals made to national security, proposed constraints on open-source AI distribution might put defense supply chains at risk. This brief assesses those implications for the Joint Force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) priority. Software powered by generative AI foundation models — generalist systems that emulate human reasoning — might process reams of raw intelligence, automate Pentagon paperwork, or allow aircraft, trucks, and ships to navigate themselves. Many advancements in this sector originate in commercial and academic research. If generative AI sees wide adoption across the DOD, this base of commercial foundation model developers will become a critical part of the defense industrial base. The Joint Force thus has a stake in the commercial foundation model ecosystem and how it evolves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, DOD AI strategies hinge on continued commercial innovation in AI. To that end, the Pentagon has assigned new funding to acquire AI-powered systems, such as for its Replicator drones and Joint All-Domain Command and Control battle network, and new organizations to manage them, empowering the Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO), Task Force Lima, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this institutional buildup, the Pentagon should appraise proposed commercial foundation model market regulations. As with spectrum auctions or shipbuilding, civil sector policymaking will shape the DOD’s future choices. Policies that create a competitive ecosystem of market players could improve the supply chain for future DOD programs. Conversely, policies that accelerate consolidation — like the Jones Act or the 1993 “Last Supper” — might threaten it. The 2023 Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence has made unprecedented use of the Defense Production Act to regulate the commercial AI market. It is now worth asking where regulation of commercial markets could affect defense production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2BSADET.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-open-foundation-model-debate-a-litmus-test&quot;&gt;The Open Foundation Model Debate: A Litmus Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging civil society debates over AI safety — especially over open foundation models — merit particular attention. Unlike with closed models like GPT-4, developers of open foundation models like Llama, Mistral, or Qwen openly publish the models’ underlying parameters (“weights”), allowing them to be inspected, modified, and operated by end users. With the performance of open models approaching their closed counterparts (Figure 2), some have suggested that open model distribution could pose “extreme risks” for misuse. Others, meanwhile, have highlighted open models’ benefits for research, security, and national competitiveness. Though outcomes remain uncertain, proposals to limit the distribution of open models — such as through California Senate Bill (SB) 1047 — have recently gained legislative traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the open foundation model debate is resolved would have direct implications for the defense industrial base. As detailed in later sections, there are preliminary reasons to believe that a diverse open model ecosystem might benefit the DOD. The widespread availability of high-performance, open-source foundation models could improve the DOD’s ability to (1) competitively source and sustain AI systems, (2) deploy AI securely, and (3) address novel use cases. Considering these impacts, the open model debate represents a test case for how civil society evaluates defense priorities in AI policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlining these implications might also clarify, in White House Office of Science and Technology Policy director Arati Prabhakar’s words, an often “garbled conversation about the implications, including safety implications, of AI technology.” Indeed, in its flagship report on the subject, the Biden administration suggested that “the government should not restrict the wide availability of model weights” but that “extrapolation based on current capabilities and limitations is too difficult to conclude whether open foundation models, overall, pose more marginal risks than benefits.” The administration has not endorsed open model restrictions nor foreclosed future regulation. An accounting of defense industrial benefits might therefore contribute to this ongoing conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;terms-of-the-debate&quot;&gt;Terms of the Debate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source software and standards are already widespread in U.S. national security applications. Army smartphones, Navy warships, and Space Force missile-warning satellites run on Linux-derived operating systems. AI-powered F-16s run on open-source orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes, which is regularly updated, maintained, and tested by industry and the broader public. Open-source software is ubiquitous, permeating over 96 percent of civil and military codebases, and will remain a core piece of defense infrastructure for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What constitutes an “open” foundation model is less well defined. Developers can distribute foundation models at different levels of “openness” — from publishing white papers and basic technical information to releasing models entirely, including their underlying weights, training data, and the code used to run them. By contrast, developers of closed models, including GPT-4 or Claude, release fewer details or data, only allowing user access through proprietary application programming interfaces. In general, this brief defines “open” models as those with widely available weights, consistent with relevant categories in the 2023 AI executive order. Many of the risks and benefits discussed here flow from these definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims of extraordinary risk have motivated several recent proposals surrounding open-source AI. Analysts have expressed concern that malicious users might modify open foundation models to discover cybersecurity vulnerabilities or instruct users in the creation of chemical and biological weapons. Others have argued that public distribution of model weights could aid adversaries in advancing their AI capabilities. Given these apprehensions, some observers have proposed export controls, licensing rules, and liability regimes that would limit the distribution of open foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A competing school of thought has emphasized the societal benefits of open foundation models. Open distribution of weights, some argue, accelerates innovation and adoption: indeed, the key frameworks and innovations underpinning today’s large language models (LLMs), like PyTorch and the transformer architecture itself, were distributed openly. Others contend that the public scrutiny of model weights enables rapid discovery and repair of vulnerabilities, improves public transparency, and reduces the concentration of political and economic power as AI systems increase in importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most clear, however, is that this risk-benefit assessment remains incomplete. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s initial assessment is inconclusive, and AI safety literature has thus far lacked clear frameworks for identifying relative risk and benefit and whether they are unique to open models. Despite concerns over AI models instructing untrained users in biological weapon development, for instance, recent red-teaming exercises concluded that LLM-equipped teams performed similarly to those without. Similar concerns over AI-assisted cyber vulnerability discovery remain unclear, with some arguing that enhanced vulnerability detection may benefit cyber defenders over attackers, or that the balance of advantage would be case-dependent. Malicious use, meanwhile, continues to take place with closed models. In brief, more research remains necessary to unpack where the relative risks and benefits lie. The purportedly catastrophic harms of tomorrow’s foundation models have not yet come into clear view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the pace of technical change has been so uncertain that evaluating future benefits, harms, and policy interventions can be challenging. Whether a licensing regime is effective, for example, depends on how readily foundation model technologies will diffuse. And whether export controls benefit national security hinges on which analogy becomes relevant: Is restricting open models like restricting nuclear weapons exports, or is it akin to Cold War bans (now repealed) on public-key cryptography, a technology which now underpins online banking, e-commerce, and a multi-trillion-dollar digital economy? In the absence of a U.S. market presence, will Chinese open models take their place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, questions remain on how to implement AI policy. Definitional challenges abound; early AI policy approaches, including the EU AI Act, AI executive order, and California SB 1047, apply thresholds for “systemic risk” to models exceeding a certain amount of computing power or cost used in their development. However, such thresholds for triggering government review, such as the 1026 floating-point-operation threshold in the AI executive order, may incompletely capture the capabilities they aim to regulate. How to balance resourcing for AI policy implementation against other cyber and biological threat mitigations, such as for material monitoring or new cyberdefense capabilities, remains another open question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XwTS4zj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;open-source-and-the-joint-force&quot;&gt;Open Source and the Joint Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defense industrial assessment could thus contribute a valuable perspective to the AI risk debate. With AI industry trends favoring consolidation, the open foundation model ecosystem may become an increasingly important source of competition in the industrial base. Because end users can modify and run open models directly, they have become increasingly relevant for developing local, secure applications and embedded systems — needed by military users demanding low power usage, security, and reliability. And because open models can be publicly inspected, red teamed, and verified, they may present defense-related cybersecurity advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, however, the DOD has largely focused on AI adoption. In its flagship data, responsible AI, and adoption strategies, the DOD has focused on harnessing private sector innovations for national security end uses. It has embedded chief data officers in combatant commands; tested AI use cases in major experimentation initiatives, like the Global Information Dominance Experiment, Project Convergence, and others; and developed the Responsible AI Framework, emphasizing the use of traceable, transparent AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the DOD established Task Force Lima, an element within the CDAO tasked with “responsibly pursu[ing] the adoption” of generalist models. Alongside the CDAO and Responsible AI Working Council, Lima was chartered to “accelerate” AI initiatives, “federate disparate developmental and research efforts,” and engage across the interagency on the “responsible development and use of generative AI,” with a final strategy due for release in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarifying potential AI use cases within the DOD is a valuable first step in “mak[ing] life easier for program offices who want to do AI or add AI.” A valuable second step would be to identify the broader trajectory of the AI industrial base. The DOD will often rely on industry expertise to develop and identify more generative AI use cases; a broad ecosystem of model and application developers will be critical for this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, an assessment of defense industrial impacts is conspicuously missing from the broader debate on open foundation models. Arguments over model regulation are couched in national security language but should involve a broader swath of national security practitioners, including defense acquisition professionals. Accordingly, DOD elements, including the CDAO, should independently assess the national capacity to develop AI-powered systems and the impact of open foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Arguments over model regulation are couched in national security language but should involve a broader swath of national security practitioners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-adoption-strategies-to-industrial-strategies&quot;&gt;From Adoption Strategies to Industrial Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defense industrial accounting is needed because of preliminary evidence that open foundation models — and their supporting ecosystem — could be useful for the DOD. AI adoption remains a DOD priority, and open release has historically accelerated the rate of technology adoption. Open-source development may have positive competitive implications for defense acquisition. And open-source communities are accelerating developments in on-premises deployment, fine-tuning for specialized applications, model reliability, and other desirable characteristics for defense end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplier diversity.&lt;/strong&gt; In its 2023 National Defense Industrial Strategy (NDIS), the DOD prioritized the diversification of national component supplier bases. To improve competition for new entrants, for instance, it has developed new funding mechanisms, like Strategic Funding Increase contracts, and innovation organizations, like the Defense Innovation Unit. A robust ecosystem of open foundation model developers might improve defense supplier diversity and prevent market consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are strong incentives for consolidation in the foundation model industry. Unlike other software products, large foundation models are particularly capital-intensive to develop, rivaling the supply chain complexity of major defense hardware. Training a foundation model, open or closed, demands extremely large datasets, costly graphics processing units and accelerator chips, and talent, advantaging larger players. Operating them — a process termed inference — also imposes high energy costs. Due to these factors, industry leaders have spent tens of billions of dollars to develop and deploy so-called frontier foundation models. This high cost of entry increases the risk of industry consolidation and, consequently, capacity pressure on future DOD acquisition programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Would a robust open AI ecosystem relieve these pressures, creating competition for proprietary vendors and accelerating innovation? Open foundation models have begun to show competitive performance with closed, proprietary alternatives. To date, many competitive open foundation models have been developed by well-resourced actors. But community modification and experimentation have sped the development of new architectures and reductions in training and inference costs. Modified open models have also demonstrated high performance in highly specialized tasks; they might be similarly performant for those anticipated for defense applications, like flight control, business automation, or intelligence fusion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive sustainment.&lt;/strong&gt; More critically, the existence of open foundation models mitigate dependence on single vendors when sustaining AI-powered defense systems. Foundation models used in defense applications may need specialized retuning, including with government data, as the operating environment changes. High-performance closed models have also shown performance drifts over time; access to model weights and other information would help vendors diagnose emergent problems. In short, by building on open foundation models, the DOD could reduce barriers for vendors to compete on model integration, retuning, and sustainment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These imperatives resemble those motivating the Pentagon’s Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) for major hardware purchases. Lack of access to technical data has historically challenged the DOD’s ability to reliably and affordably sustain military hardware. Given these barriers, military services have increasingly demanded access to the data needed to service new helicopters, trucks, and ships. For its nearly $70 billion Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program, for example, the U.S. Army rejected a $3.6 billion lower bid over incomplete MOSA requirements, opting for a vendor that provided full access to aircraft technical data packages (TDPs) required for maintenance. Just as it is challenging to competitively source aircraft maintenance without access to TDPs, competitively sustaining AI-powered software may be difficult without access to model weights.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It would be challenging, however, to adopt such a modular approach with closed-model-powered software. Closed model developers are unlikely to relinquish access to model weights for other vendors to modify while performing their sustainment contracts. Moreover, to securely implement model-level changes to a defense application, national security customers would potentially need to certify both the application vendor and closed model vendor separately, adding additional friction to an already difficult acquisition process. Evaluating appropriate data rights for closed models could demand a further institutional lift.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A world with competitive open foundation models would allow the Pentagon to sidestep these sustainment challenges. While vendors would tune and adapt open models for proprietary applications, visibility into their underlying weights and architectures would make it easier for others to maintain and integrate them, potentially reducing the cost of sustainment. The presence of open options, moreover, could improve taxpayer bargaining power in negotiations with closed providers on complex data-rights matters. The DOD has already invested heavily in competitively sustaining military hardware. Those same lessons apply when sustaining AI-powered software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security and reliability.&lt;/strong&gt; Concerns over the confidentiality and reliability of foundation models remain key barriers to DOD generative AI adoption. The potential to locally operate open foundation models on DOD infrastructure therefore becomes a key advantage. Open models might present useful options for building AI-powered systems without needing to certify an external foundation model developer for sandboxed deployments. Like with Linux, Kubernetes, or other open software libraries, these models might become a secure baseline for AI that vendors modify with classified or specialized information.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A robust open research community could also drive advancements in AI model reliability and interpretability, reducing the number of hallucinations — nonuniform responses that do not reflect the information a user needs. Access to model weights is often crucial for diagnosing failure and evaluating model reliability in detail. Insofar as hallucinations remain a “showstopper” for defense AI adoption, innovations in the open foundation model ecosystem are worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, much like with open-source software, open access to weights might enable a greater possibility of detecting vulnerabilities. Indeed, the AI executive order places special emphasis on red teaming future foundation models; more open approaches to model publication allow a wider peer review of model performance. As Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency analysts have recently emphasized, there is “significant value in open foundation models to help strengthen cybersecurity, increase competition, and promote innovation.” Accordingly, future assessments might review the advantages and disadvantages open models present for hardened, defense-critical AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialized use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Lastly, a robust open foundation model ecosystem might enable AI use cases that receive less attention from closed-source providers. Because open models can be retrained, fine-tuned, and broadly customized, they can serve as a basis for national-security-specific applications. Further, open-source initiatives can drive innovation in national-security-relevant topics, such as for document and data search with semantic retrieval. These search algorithms leverage embedding models — a form of language model — to compare the semantic meaning of stored documents and return relevant results; open models largely dominate performance metrics for embedding generation. Domains overlooked by major commercial players could benefit from the dynamism of open development. Further investigation should assess use cases where open model performance meaningfully exceeds closed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-ai-last-supper&quot;&gt;An AI “Last Supper”?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary evidence suggests that open foundation models might benefit the defense industrial base. What is now needed is a quantitative assessment of the open ecosystem’s fiscal impacts. Beyond assessing pathways to adoption, defense policymakers should review the changing competitive landscape for foundation models and potential implications for the defense industrial base. Three recommendations follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In its forthcoming review of DOD foundation model adoption, Task Force Lima and partners should compare open and closed models in generative AI use cases.&lt;/strong&gt; Different foundation model architectures have roles to play in defense applications. For document summarization tasks, for instance, developers might use open- and closed-source models in a variety of architectures, from retrieval-augmented generation to in-context learning. Although technical details on performance are beyond this paper’s scope, a broad comparison of potential open- and closed-model use cases could provide useful context for acquisition professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NDIS implementation should include assessments of the foundation model industrial base, including data, infrastructure, human capital, competitive dynamics, and the impact of open model development.&lt;/strong&gt; The 2022 National Defense Strategy acknowledges that the DOD “will be a fast-follower where market forces are driving commercialization of . . . trusted artificial intelligence,” while the NDIS asserts that it must “diversify [the] supplier base” and “foster competition within the defense market.” An independent assessment of those market forces, including competition in the AI market, would be critical to implementing the NDIS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The DOD should collect data on where open foundation models are used in its systems, the number of nontraditional performers who leverage open foundation models, and models’ potential fiscal impacts.&lt;/strong&gt; As the DOD begins to adopt AI-powered systems, it should collect data on where open foundation models are being leveraged. Such data might inform future analyses on the health of the AI industrial base and the ability for new entrants to compete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a considerable risk in disregarding defense industrial impacts in the debate over open foundation models. Major consolidation in other sectors, such as in shipbuilding and aerospace, has come alongside major declines in defense acquisition speed and capacity. If open foundation models are indeed “dual-use” — and therefore critical to national security — the potential for consolidation deserves national security attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil sector policy decisions have created a shipbuilding base outproduced by China 230 to 1. Other deliberate choices over the nation’s industrial base have meant that demand now outpaces supply for missile defense systems, artillery shells, and AI talent. If production is deterrence, these are the stakes of the open-source AI debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others will not wait for the United States if it falls back. China and other states have made vast investments in stimulating their domestic AI industries, with top models “not far behind” Western counterparts. The United States’ competitors view open foundation models as a means of capturing global market share and advancing scientific and economic development. While the development of AI is not an arms race, it is a broader economic and social competition — one where U.S. priorities on democracy, transparency, and security should define global standards. The technology and value system to do so are already in place. Attention is all it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix-selected-model-performance-evaluations&quot;&gt;Appendix: Selected Model Performance Evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table compiles self-reported Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) scores, one of many benchmarks used to evaluate foundation model performance. Typical scores reported are “5-shot,” where five examples are provided before models are prompted with a question. “Open” models listed include those with publicly available model weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While MMLU is an incomplete representation of model performance, this benchmark was selected because it is among the oldest, allowing for consistent comparison over time. Writ large, the foundation model industry increasingly suffers from a benchmarking crisis, facing issues of model overfitting — internalizing existing benchmark results — and obsolescence. Developing trusted benchmarks has thus become a major Department of Commerce priority.&lt;/p&gt;

With expanded security, economic, and people-to-people ties, the partnership between the two states is set to deepen regardless of political changes on either side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2025, U.S.-Vietnam relations will mark two important anniversaries: 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War and 30 years since the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations. These anniversaries reflect the United States and Vietnam’s long journey toward strong bilateral ties. Ties reached a new high-water mark in September 2023 when President Joe Biden and the late Communist Party of Vietnam general secretary Nguyen Phu Trong elevated the relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership — the highest in Vietnam’s diplomatic canon. This made clear to every official in Vietnam that the country’s collective leadership prioritizes the bilateral relationship. The same is true of Vietnam’s recently concluded comprehensive strategic partnerships with Australia, India, Japan, and South Korea. There is no reason to think that any future leader in Vietnam would seek to slow the momentum in those deepening relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-cooperation-amid-political-transitions&quot;&gt;Strategic Cooperation amid Political Transitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong’s passing on July 19 after more than a decade in power marks a period of political transition that will continue at least until Vietnam’s 14th Party Congress, scheduled for 2026. But the Communist Party of Vietnam, regardless of its leader, will continue to prioritize Vietnam’s independence and agency amid great power competition. This has always been the bedrock of Vietnamese strategy. That means Hanoi will continue to deepen its relationship with the United States while seeking stable and productive relations with Beijing where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Trong became the first general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam to ever visit the United States, meeting with then president Barack Obama in the White House. To Lam, now serving as both president of Vietnam and general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, visited Washington for meetings with U.S. counterparts in 2019, as has nearly every Vietnamese prime minister and president in recent years. U.S. officials have reciprocated that attention, with every president since Bill Clinton visiting Hanoi at least once during their time in office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Trump administration, the U.S.-Vietnam relationship took significant steps forward with an increase in direct investment in the country and an emphasis on energy cooperation. In 2019, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a comprehensive energy partnership to boost energy market cooperation. Under the Biden administration, the United States doubled down on its commitment to Vietnam. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made Vietnam part of his first tour of the region in July 2021, alongside U.S. ally the Philippines and strategic partner Singapore. A month later, Kamala Harris became the first U.S. vice president to visit Vietnam. The visit yielded enhanced bilateral security and economic engagements, playing a critical role in the eventual formation of the comprehensive strategic partnership. Harris returned to Vietnam in November 2022 to meet with then president Nguyen Xuan Phuc, reaffirming the bilateral security and economic ties and showcasing greater U.S. commitment to Vietnam. So, whether Donald Trump or Harris occupies the White House in January 2025, the United States will have a president already well-versed in U.S.-Vietnam ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no matter what changes at the political level in Washington and Hanoi, the two states will continue to share similar views of regional security and anxieties about China. That has been and will remain the ballast in their security relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam faces maritime coercion from and shares a land border with China, which officials and the broader public view as a perennial threat. Vietnam repelled a Chinese invasion across that border in 1979 and fought a series of skirmishes with China over the next decade. It faces regular gray zone challenges from China’s navy, coast guard, and militia, which could escalate at any time. It maintains nearly 50 outposts in the Spratly Islands provisioned against a potential Chinese invasion or blockade in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the need to maintain ties with China, no Vietnamese leader will compromise on sovereignty, including in the South China Sea disputes. And as every available survey of public and elite opinion in the country shows, there is nowhere on earth more fearful of Chinese hegemony than Vietnam. That is why Vietnamese leaders value strategic ties with the United States and its allies as a counterweight to their necessary relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;No matter what changes at the political level in Washington and Hanoi, the two states will continue to share similar views of regional security and anxieties about China. That has been and will remain the ballast in their security relationship.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, U.S.-based observers forget just how far and fast security ties with Vietnam have evolved. Washington only lifted an embargo on arms sales to Vietnam in 2016. Yet over the last decade, the two have regularly engaged in defense exchanges, including visits to Vietnam by U.S. aircraft carriers. Vietnam has been a major recipient of U.S. maritime security assistance, including the delivery of Metal Shark patrol boats and access to the SeaVision maritime domain awareness platform used by most U.S. allies and partners across the region. In late 2022, Vietnam hosted its first-ever international defense expo, and major U.S. defense manufacturers, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, were there peddling their wares. This would have been unthinkable even a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooperation should be expected to deepen, but there will remain limits to how much the United States and Vietnam can do together in the short term and how much they will align on strategic issues beyond China. For instance, Vietnam maintains close ties to Russia, and Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Hanoi in June despite objections from Washington. Vietnam has not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has abstained from all UN votes on the issue. This does not mean that Hanoi supports Russia’s war; indeed, it allowed state media to report openly about the war, and there is considerable sympathy for the Ukrainian cause among much of the Vietnamese public. However, Vietnam’s government cannot afford to alienate Russia without compromising its own security. More than 80 percent of Vietnam’s military equipment is Soviet- or Russian-made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine makes it a strategic liability, and Hanoi knows it. As a result, it is accelerating the diversification of its military procurement, including exploring acquisitions from the United States and its allies. However, that will be a very long-term process. In the interim, Washington will need to accept that Hanoi cannot risk its own military preparedness by overtly condemning Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;growing-opportunities-the-us-vietnam-economic-partnership&quot;&gt;Growing Opportunities: The U.S.-Vietnam Economic Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s meteoric economic rise is a remarkable success story. From the launch of its Doi Moi reforms in 1986, fortuitous global trends and adept policymaking have led to rapid development. In the nearly 40 years since, Vietnam’s GDP per capita increased sixfold, from $600 to $3,700. The poverty rate was slashed from 14 percent in 2010 to 4.2 percent in 2022. Its rapidly growing middle class, stable political environment, and willingness to join economic agreements, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (an earlier version of which the United States abandoned) and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (of which the United States is a part), have made Vietnam an attractive investment destination for foreign firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-vietnam-economic-relations&quot;&gt;U.S.-Vietnam Economic Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the normalization of ties in 1995, the United States and Vietnam have become strong economic partners. The two countries concluded a bilateral trade agreement in 2001 that led the United States to grant Vietnam most favored nation status and support its accession to the World Trade Organization. Trade has greatly increased in the two decades since. U.S. goods and services trade with Vietnam amounted to $114.6 billion in 2022, a huge jump from $2.9 billion in 2002. The United States is the largest export destination for Vietnamese goods, ranging from textiles to footwear and electronics. In 2022, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided Vietnam with $142 million in official development assistance, including through projects addressing the legacies of the Vietnam War, such as dioxin remediation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s growing role in the regional economy of the Indo-Pacific makes it a vital partner for the United States. The Biden administration has made engagement with Vietnam a key priority in the region. Economics, trade, and investment cooperation were key tenets of the comprehensive strategic partnership concluded in September 2023: the two governments reaffirmed their commitments to create favorable economic conditions; facilitate the opening of each country’s market to the other, including by tackling barriers to entry; and support other mutually beneficial trade and economic policies. Vietnam is also partnering with the United States on semiconductor manufacturing under the International Technology Security and Innovation Fund established by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. The joint statement from Biden and Trong acknowledged Vietnam’s request for a review of its market economy status. On August 2, 2024, the Department of Commerce determined that Vietnam will continue to be classified as a nonmarket economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Vietnam’s growing role in the regional economy of the Indo-Pacific makes it a vital partner for the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of ever-intensifying U.S.-China competition, Vietnam, more than any of its Southeast Asian neighbors, has benefitted from the diversion of new foreign investment away from China. Vietnam is becoming a production destination for high-value electronic goods, from smartphones to semiconductors, with a growing renewable energy market and a nascent critical mineral production and processing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;semiconductors-and-electronics-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Semiconductors and Electronics Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam is often seen as a viable “friendshoring” partner for the United States and its allies as businesses seek to “de-risk” the high-tech sector. Its highly educated workforce and stable political environment have made it an attractive alternative for companies interested in relocating from China. Vietnam participates in 16 free trade agreements, more than its neighbors, and offers tax breaks and exemptions for high-tech projects. It boasts low labor costs and maintains a steady output of skilled students. USAID’s Partnership for Higher Education Reform has provided $14.2 million to boost teaching, research, and innovation in Vietnam’s three largest national universities. Moreover, the United States has committed $2 million to a joint initiative between the two countries to develop the semiconductor workforce. This closely aligns with Vietnam’s goal of expanding its semiconductor workforce tenfold to 50,000 engineers by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s semiconductor market grew 7.1 percent per year between 2016 and 2021 and was valued at $18.2 billion in 2022. Vietnam specializes in the assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP) process. By February 2023, its semiconductor chip exports to the United States reached $562 million, compared to $321.7 million in 2022. Vietnam has become the third-largest Asian semiconductor chip exporter to the United States. In April 2023, it accounted for more than 10 percent of semiconductor chips imported by the United States for seven consecutive months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel, a top global semiconductor manufacturer, began operations in Vietnam in 2006. Its ATP factory in Ho Chi Minh City is the largest in its manufacturing network. Amkor Technology, a packing and testing services provider, invested $1.6 billion in a new factory in Bac Ninh in 2023. U.S. semiconductor companies such as Intel, Marvell, and GlobalFoundries took part in a business delegation alongside Biden’s visit to Vietnam in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has also become a key destination for electronics manufacturers seeking to diversify and secure their supply chains. Apple has steadily been moving production into Vietnam, investing $15.8 billion in the country since 2019. It now operates 28 factories in Vietnam, mostly in the country’s northern provinces. Vietnam assembles a variety of Apple products and is projected to be responsible for a growing percentage of all Apple product production by 2025: 20 percent of all iPads and Apple Watches, 5 percent of MacBooks, and 65 percent of all AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewable-energy&quot;&gt;Renewable Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Geographically, it is very well placed to achieve this goal: The country possesses immense potential for renewable energy. Between 2018 and 2022, renewable energy production rose fortyfold. Vietnam must further develop its clean electricity grid to maintain and grow its manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Vietnam signed a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with the United States and other donor nations, which will provide $15.5 billion in public and private finance to support the country’s clean energy transition. Vietnam’s JETP Resource Mobilization Plan aims to create both a regulatory and infrastructural framework for the energy transition while working to reduce emissions and improve upon power transmission and energy storage systems. USAID cooperates with Vietnam on a series of projects aimed at lowering emissions and stimulating investments in infrastructure and energy. With $36.2 million in funding from 2020 to 2025, the USAID Vietnam Low Emission Energy Program aims to support Vietnam’s clean energy transition. Meanwhile, the $13.9 million Vietnam Urban Energy Security program works with the Vietnamese government to identify clean energy solutions to urban energy challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Vietnamese government’s approval in July of Decree 80 on Direct Power Purchase Agreements, direct sale of renewable energy to customers via private transmission lines and the national grid is now possible. Foreign businesses will be able to purchase renewable energy from private producers instead of relying on the state-owned Vietnam Electricity for power. In January, 15 U.S. companies had expressed an interest in investing $8 billion in Vietnam’s clean energy infrastructure contingent on the adoption of such a rule. The approval of Decree 80 and subsequent deregulation of the renewable energy purchasing process could prove to be appealing to more foreign partners seeking to set up shop in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;critical-minerals&quot;&gt;Critical Minerals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s critical mineral reserves could also prove crucial to its rise in high-value global supply chains. Rare earth minerals are vital to the production of modern devices ranging from electric vehicle batteries to smartphone screens. Vietnam has the world’s second-largest known reserves of rare earth minerals after China. Seeking an opportunity in the wake of global supply chain reorientations, Vietnam is increasing its rare earth mining exponentially. In 2022, it produced 4,300 tons of these minerals compared to just 400 tons in 2021. The country aims to process 2 million tons of rare earth ores and 60,000 tons of rare earth oxides by 2030. Under the auspices of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the two countries have signed an agreement to strengthen technical cooperation to help Vietnam improve its rare earths industry and attract investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Vietnam has enjoyed significant international attention and investment, it faces considerable challenges. Infrastructure constraints are giving many interested investors pause, particularly when it comes to the availability of clean water and energy — a shortage of the latter led to unexpected blackouts that affected many foreign manufacturing operations in 2023. The national and local governments are well aware of the need for major infrastructure upgrades but have been slow to grant approval and disperse funds for major projects because of the ongoing dot lo, or blazing furnace, campaign against corruption. Between 2021 and early 2023, the Vietnamese government launched criminal investigations of 7,500 individuals and indicted more than 4,400 for graft. The Communist Party of Vietnam has disciplined tens of thousands of its own, including high-ranking officials and eight members of the Politburo, the country’s top decisionmaking body. From early 2023 to mid-2024, two presidents, the National Assembly chair, and the permanent member of the Secretariat (the fifth-most-senior official) were ousted. The breadth of the anti-corruption campaign has created bureaucratic paralysis, with officials hesitant to make any bold decisions or approve large projects for fear of future prosecutions. As a result, many investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach until they can better assess the future of their investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trong’s death might lead to a slow winding down of the anti-corruption campaign, either before or after the 2026 National Party Congress, but that is unclear. High-profile arrests are likely to continue for some time, if only because of cases already under investigation. On July 22, for instance, police arrested five senior officials, including a former deputy environment minister, for violating mining regulations. Wherever the anti-corruption campaign goes, the atmosphere of bureaucratic caution is not going to ease overnight, so the slow disbursement of government funds and infrastructure shortfalls will continue to hamper growth for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the potential for a second Trump administration in the United States could complicate future progress in U.S.-Vietnam economic cooperation. A Trump administration would be likely to complain again about the growing U.S. trade deficit and may seek to address it via punitive measures, as it did the first time around with investigations into alleged currency manipulation and unfair trade practices. Given the huge U.S. commercial interest in Vietnam, a second Trump administration would be unlikely to reverse the trend of growing economic cooperation, but it could certainly slow the momentum of recent years. Despite these challenges, Vietnam will likely continue to enjoy sustained GDP growth over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-the-war-deepening-the-united-states-and-vietnams-friendship&quot;&gt;Beyond the War: Deepening the United States and Vietnam’s Friendship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the anniversaries of the end of the Vietnam War and of diplomatic normalization on the horizon, and a comprehensive strategic partnership in place, the United States and Vietnam have intensified efforts to reinforce people-to-people ties. The U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership should include redoubling efforts to address historical legacies, deepen linkages between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora, and expand educational exchanges. All three categories are critical in strengthening U.S.-Vietnam relations, providing opportunities for people from both countries not only to understand one another but also the complex history of war and reconciliation between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership should include redoubling efforts to address historical legacies, deepen linkages between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora, and expand educational exchanges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-legacies&quot;&gt;Historical Legacies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Vietnam have prioritized addressing the legacies of war. In April 2023, USAID announced a partnership with the War Remnants Museum (WRM) in Ho Chi Minh City. The partnership involves adding an exhibit to the WRM to showcase efforts by both countries to overcome the consequences of the Vietnam War. This historical exhibit marks the first time that the U.S. government has had a direct stake in how the war is memorialized in Vietnam. The WRM has previously faced many criticisms for lacking a balanced perspective, portraying U.S. soldiers as criminals while ignoring atrocities committed by North Vietnamese forces. The new collaborative exhibit showcases the United States and Vietnam’s joint commitment to address war legacies based on mutual understanding and an honest acknowledgment of history. The exhibit is expected to open in 2025, in time for both anniversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its strong commitment, the United States still has work to do to address the legacies of the Vietnam War. As of 2022, the remains of 1,244 U.S. service members killed or missing in action were still not accounted for, with 470 of those declared “non-recoverable.” Progress toward recovering remains has slowed, given the logistical and scientific hurdles involved. In 2023, only four service members’ remains were successfully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Austin, the U.S. defense secretary, and Vietnamese defense minister Phan Van Giang inked a memorandum of understanding in which the United States committed to assist Vietnam in locating, identifying, and recovering the war dead of Vietnamese forces. The Department of Defense intends to home in on relocation efforts by partnering with the United States Institute of Peace, USAID, U.S. academic institutions, and the Office of Defense Attache in Hanoi. While detailed implementation plans have not yet been established, the United States intends to target the following areas to aid in Vietnamese accounting efforts: archival research; digitization of documents; building technological accounting capacity; media outreach; exchanges between veterans, academia, policymakers, and technical and working-level people; and DNA analysis assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the recovery efforts of both U.S. and Vietnamese forces at play, the loss of lives affiliated with the former Republic of Vietnam (RVN or South Vietnam) has still not been officially recognized or addressed. While their war memorialization and recovery efforts thus far are commendable, the United States and Vietnam must include the RVN forces in these efforts to reconcile the Vietnamese-American community, a critical step in strengthening bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also continues to work with Vietnam to remove unexploded ordnance (UXO) and remediate soil contaminated by Agent Orange, an herbicide used during the war containing high levels of the deadly chemical dioxin. USAID completed a multiyear project to remediate soil at Da Nang airport; the project was launched during the Obama administration, and the agency is currently working to clean up Bien Hoa, a former U.S. air base containing high concentrations of Agent Orange. In December 2022, USAID awarded a contract to develop a facility to treat more than 100,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil at the base. The project is expected to cost $450 million and be completed in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the environmental remediation efforts are making considerable progress, more should be done to treat the victims of Agent Orange exposure. The U.S. government provides care and compensation for U.S. veterans exposed during the war, but more should be done in cooperation with Hanoi to treat Vietnamese victims. The U.S. and Vietnamese governments do not agree on who qualifies as being affected by Agent Orange exposure. Reaching such an agreement and increasing support to victims accordingly would mark an important step in reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States continues to support demining efforts in Vietnam, investing over $206 million as of 2022 and removing 5,979 mines and UXO from 1,247,425 square meters (308 acres) of land as of July 2021. In 2022, the Department of State initiated technological support to the Vietnam National Mine Action Center and two provincial mine action centers to develop the ability to carry out demining in Vietnam independently. The Department of State has also supported education on UXO risk in primary and secondary schools in affected Vietnamese provinces, including Da Nang, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue. Removal of all UXO from the war is a difficult feat, with millions of mines remaining undetected. The Vietnamese government speculates that, as of 2022, mines and UXO have caused over 40,000 deaths and 60,000 injuries since the war’s end. A notable nongovernmental organization (NGO) tackling this challenge is Project RENEW, a partnership established in 2001 between the Quang Tri Province government and international NGOs. Over 20 years, RENEW has successfully removed 815,952 explosives from Vietnam, less than half of what is estimated to remain. While it is impossible to remove all UXO, continued efforts are critical in decreasing safety risks throughout Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-vietnamese-diaspora&quot;&gt;The Vietnamese Diaspora&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the Vietnam War triggered a large-scale migration of Vietnamese nationals to the United States. At the end of the war in 1975, the United States evacuated around 125,000 Vietnamese nationals, many of whom had ties to the U.S. military and risked persecution by the victorious Communist government. The evacuation marked the first wave of Vietnamese refugees immigrating to the United States. A second wave began in 1978 and lasted into the 1980s, as many Vietnamese fled by boat to neighboring Southeast Asian states and were eventually resettled in third countries. Today, around 1.3 million Vietnamese immigrants reside in the United States, and the Vietnamese-American population totals more than 2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnamese Americans play an important role in U.S.-Vietnam relations. Most second-generation Vietnamese Americans have never been to Vietnam and many Vietnamese immigrants and their children remain fervently anti-communist. The community’s role in the deepening U.S.-Vietnam relationship has been conflicted, with many Vietnamese Americans eagerly forging new cultural and commercial ties, but others lobbying the U.S. government to adopt a more critical stance toward Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Vietnamese government refers to Vietnamese Americans as Viet Kieu, or “overseas Vietnamese.” After the war, the term was initially considered derogatory. But Vietnam’s relationship with the diaspora has evolved since the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations. Hanoi has worked to embrace the Vietnamese-American community, identifying it as a source of inspiration for Vietnamese at home. The cultural and political disconnect many Vietnamese Americans feel toward Hanoi will not disappear any time soon, but it is steadily shrinking. To further reconciliation efforts, the U.S. and Vietnamese governments should continue to support programs that allow Vietnamese Americans to return to Vietnam for cultural and educational exchanges. But they must also acknowledge and address the trauma suffered by Vietnamese on both sides of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;educational-exchanges&quot;&gt;Educational Exchanges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 30,000 Vietnamese students currently study in the United States, more than from any other country in Southeast Asia. The U.S. government is encouraging educational institutions to accept more Vietnamese students over the coming years. Vietnam has also welcomed U.S. universities to develop partnerships with Vietnamese institutions and even open campuses in Vietnam. The University of Arizona notably offers a collaborative program with Hanoi Law University (HLU) to earn both a bachelor of laws degree from HLU and a bachelor of arts in law degree from Arizona in only four years. Meanwhile, Troy University is currently partnered with Vietnam National University, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, and Saigon Technology University to offer a variety of undergraduate programs in Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF) played an instrumental role in the early normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations via educational exchanges. Established by Congress in 1999, the VEF was a flagship education exchange program created to advance Vietnamese science and technology capacities. The VEF, which operated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2016, allowed Vietnamese scholars of academic merit to study in the United States. Over its run, the VEF brought in 600 Vietnamese nationals to pursue graduate degrees in the United States and over 40 U.S. professors from U.S. universities to teach at Vietnamese universities. The VEF’s foundational first steps toward normalizing educational exchanges inspired emerging programs such as the Fulbright Program to continue encouraging exchanges between the United States and Vietnam, with the two programs developing a strong working relationship until the VEF officially closed its doors in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, through the Fulbright Program, gives U.S. professionals an opportunity to study, teach, or research in Vietnam while learning about Vietnam’s language and culture. The Fulbright Economics Teaching Program emerged out of a 1994 partnership between Harvard University’s Vietnam Program and University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City. The program is now part of Fulbright University Vietnam, Vietnam’s first independent nonprofit university. Fulbright University Vietnam was commended in the announcement of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for its “growing role as a regional hub for public policy training,” as well as for its recognition of the importance of investing in human capital “as a critical resource for future prosperity, security, stability, and development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the Peace Corps sent its first delegation of volunteers to Hanoi after 18 years of negotiations between the United States and Vietnam. The Peace Corps has championed “world peace and friendship through community-based development and intercultural understanding” since 1961. Internationally established and a hallmark for strong bilateral relations, the Peace Corps’ establishment in Vietnam marks a historic win for U.S.-Vietnam relations. The United States and Vietnam had been negotiating the bilateral agreement for the Peace Corps since 2004, inking a formal agreement in 2016 during the Obama administration. Implementation agreements were finalized in early 2021, formally recruiting staff later that year. With the Peace Corps’ Vietnam program established, the United States gives its citizens more opportunities to engage in both cultural and educational exchange opportunities, which are critical steps toward deepening mutual understanding between both nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-bright-future-for-us-vietnam-relations&quot;&gt;A Bright Future for U.S.-Vietnam Relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral relationship between the United States and Vietnam is only beginning to prosper. Expanded government-to-government ties have created deeper institutional linkages between the two countries. Their bilateral friendship will be able to endure changes in administrations in each country, regardless of their respective domestic political environments. Economic engagement in Vietnam is growing steadily in the wake of Western companies de-risking from China. In the semiconductor production sector, renewable energy sector, and critical mineral sector, among others, there are significant opportunities for a U.S.-Vietnam economic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the United States and Vietnam continue to earnestly acknowledge their historical war legacies, paving the road toward an eventual mutual understanding between the two nations. Their strengthened bilateral relationship opens educational opportunities for people of both nations, including Vietnamese Americans, to play a role in the United States and Vietnam’s complicated and deepening friendship. And with important anniversaries of both the end of the Vietnam War and diplomatic normalization quickly approaching, the United States and Vietnam will only work to continue the momentum in their growing relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官提醒陪審團 指污點證人有強烈誘因作供、有機會作假冤枉被告&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ib6TDiF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（16日）踏入第74日審訊。控辯雙方已完成結案陳詞，法官張慧玲開始引導陪審團。張官提醒，3名污點證人有強烈誘因協助控方作證，他們希望獲減刑，故有機會剪裁證供，甚至作出虛假證供，冤枉被告牽涉本案，因此陪審團需謹慎處理其證供。張官又指，陪審團毋須考慮是次檢控是否公平，並提醒「唔好畀自己個人嘅同情或者偏見影響，要用持平中肯嘅態度」。張官亦指，串謀者毋須以書面或正式的形式達成協議，可用身體、語言、手勢或動作等達成協議，其中3個情況則不屬參與串謀，包括：對串謀不知情、無意圖加入串謀、「詐諦」加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陪審團需考慮被告是否128計劃的串謀者&quot;&gt;官：陪審團需考慮被告是否12.8計劃的串謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方已完成結案陳詞。法官張慧玲開始引導陪審團。張官指，2019下半年由於政府想修改《逃犯條例》，引發一連串社會事件，包括：遊行、示威、非法集會及暴動，當中亦有堵路及投擲汽油彈等破壞行為出現。而本案是關於12.8事件，有人串謀用炸彈及槍對付警察。控方指稱其中一名主謀是吳智鴻，他為一個無名組織的領導者，該組織負責準備槍械及炸彈。而另一組織「屠龍」，黃振強則自稱為隊長，並指他們會作「勇武」行為如投擲汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據證供所指，在12.8串謀之中，吳及其成員會將一大（12kg）及一小（8kg）炸彈放置軒尼詩道，即民陣遊行路線的一部分。而「屠龍」成員則負責「裝修」以引警察到細炸彈，並將他們推向大炸彈。槍手蘇緯軒會在大廈的高處以步槍射殺警察，然後各人會到場「執槍」。由於事前警方「收到風」，故串謀最終未有實行。警方在串謀當日的清晨6時拘捕部分被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱，本案首4名被告為「屠龍」成員，最後兩名被告則屬無名組織，上述6人均屬串謀者之一。第七被告劉佩凝則被指透過眾籌作恐怖主義活動。辯方的立場則指各被告沒有參與串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官提到，陪審團需考慮各被告是否12.8計劃的其中一個串謀者，而劉是否串謀籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為。張官指，舉證責任在於控方，被告無責任證明自己清白。陪審團負責考慮相信哪些證人的證供，本案共有31名控方證人，以及兩名辯方證人，當中包括選擇作供的李家田。張官指，就每名證人，陪審團可選擇相信部分或全部證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官污點證人有誘因協助控方有機會作假證供冤枉被告&quot;&gt;官：污點證人有誘因協助控方、有機會作假證供冤枉被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官指，本案其中3名串謀者以「污點證人」身份作供，包括黃振強、彭軍壕及蘇緯軒。3人已認罪，承認自己是12.8串謀的一份子。張官提醒陪審團必須緊記，3人有強烈誘因協助控方作證，他們是希望獲得較輕判刑，最高可獲50%折扣。3名證人有可能會剪裁證供，甚至作出虛假證供，冤枉被告牽涉本案。因此，陪審團需要謹慎處理他們的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，由於黃及彭獲律政司的豁免起訴書，若他們誠實作供的話，即使其證供透露自己曾參與暴動及縱火等行為，亦不會遭起訴。張官表示，對兩名證人而言這屬於利益、「有著數」，或驅使他們作虛假證供，以免失去豁免起訴的保障。張官再次提醒陪審團要謹慎處理他們的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陪審團毋須考慮檢控是否公平勿被個人同情影響&quot;&gt;官：陪審團毋須考慮檢控是否公平、勿被個人同情影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官又指，陪審團毋須考慮律政司是次檢控是否公平，「唔好考慮點解告佢哋」，亦毋須考慮其他涉案者的去向。張官又提醒，「唔好畀自己個人嘅同情或者偏見影響，要用持平中肯嘅態度」考慮本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官串謀者毋須書面正式協議詐諦加入並不屬參與&quot;&gt;官：串謀者毋須書面正式協議、「詐諦」加入並不屬參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官解釋控罪的元素，以及控方需要證明甚麼。就首6名被告被控的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，及其交替的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪。張官表示，不能兩罪同時成立；若陪審團認為首罪不成立，就要考慮第二條控罪是否成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，張官指根據條例，本案控罪之「訂明標的」是指「公用場所」，串謀者計劃將炸彈擺放於灣仔軒尼詩道，明顯是公用地方。而本案的炸彈亦屬於控罪所指的「爆炸性裝置」，這點並不受爭議。另外，控罪亦要求控方證明被告是有「非法理由」作出此行為，並有意圖導致他人死亡或身體遭受嚴重傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控罪中的「串謀」，則需要證明有兩個人或以上達成犯罪協議。串謀者必須有意圖達成協議，而自己可促進犯罪目的。串謀者毋須以書面或正式的形式達成協議，可以用身體、語言、手勢或動作等達成協議。一旦協議達成，即使事後退出亦屬犯罪。串謀協議達成之前的商討，則可用作證明協議的存在。張官表示，有3個情況則不屬參與串謀，包括：對串謀不知情、無意圖加入串謀、「詐諦」加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不能以本案其他行為對被告有偏見&quot;&gt;官：不能以本案其他行為對被告有偏見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官總結，就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀謀殺」罪及「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪；控方需要證明4個元素，包括串謀協議肯定存在、協議是與控罪上的其他人達成、被告有意圖達成協議，以及被告或其他人打算將協議付諸實行。張官提到，就「串謀謀殺」罪，控方必須證明被告有意圖殺死他人，而非只是令其身體受嚴重傷害。張官最後指，陪審團需要決定串謀是否存在，以及被告是否屬串謀一方。張官又指，案發時被告沒有犯罪紀錄，其可信性較高，犯罪傾向性較低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官亦指，庭上證供顯示被告曾參與其他示威行為，但這些是「不被控告的行為」，只屬背景，不能作為對被告不利的揣測，亦不能因此對被告產生任何偏見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件下周一（19日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsea fiber-optic cables, a critical information and telecommunications technology (ICT) infrastructure carrying more than 95 percent of international data, are becoming a highly consequential theater of great power competition between the United States, China, and other state actors such as Russia. The roughly 600 cables planned or currently operational worldwide, spanning approximately 1.2 million kilometers, are the world’s information superhighways and provide the high-bandwidth connections necessary to support the rise of cloud computing and integrated 5G networks, transmitting everything from streaming videos and financial transactions to diplomatic communications and essential intelligence. The demand for data center computing and storage resources is also expected to increase in the wake of the artificial intelligence revolution. Training large language models takes enormous, distributed storage to compute, and if those networks are globally oriented, they will require additional subsea capacity to connect them. These geopolitical and technological stakes necessitate a consideration of the vulnerabilities of subsea systems and the steps the United States can take to fortify the digital rails of the future and safeguard this critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;undersea-cables-why-do-they-matter&quot;&gt;Undersea Cables: Why Do They Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsea cables are critical for nearly all aspects of commerce and business connectivity. For example, one major international bank moves an average of $3.9 trillion through these cable systems every workday. Cables are the backbone of global telecommunications and the internet, given that user data (e.g., e-mail, cloud drives, and application data) are often stored in data centers around the world. This infrastructure effectively facilitates daily personal use of the internet and broader societal functions. In addition, sensitive government communications also rely extensively on subsea infrastructure. While these communications are encrypted, they still pass through commercial internet lines as data traverses subsea infrastructure. Subsea cables carry a much larger bandwidth and are more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable than satellites; consequently, they have been credited with increasing access to high-speed internet worldwide, fueling economic growth, boosting employment, enabling innovation, and lowering barriers to trade. These networks are now indispensable links for the modern world and are pivotal to global development and digital inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cable-laying-ownership-and-control&quot;&gt;Cable Laying, Ownership, and Control&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea cables are built, owned, operated, and maintained primarily by private sector companies. Approximately 98 percent of the world’s undersea cables are manufactured and installed by four private firms: in 2021, the U.S. company SubCom, French firm Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN), and Japanese firm Nippon Electric Company (NEC) collectively held an 87 percent market share, with China’s HMN Technologies, formerly known as Huawei Marine Networks Co., Ltd., holding another 11 percent. Commercial undersea cables can be owned by a single company or a consortium of companies, including telecommunication providers, undersea cable companies, content providers, and cloud computing service providers. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft now own or lease around half of all undersea bandwidth worldwide. The companies that build and own these cables often lease out bandwidth on their cables through indefeasible rights of use (IRUs), which grant long-term access to a portion of the cable’s capacity. IRU holders can also lease this bandwidth to other third parties, creating a layered leasing market that extends the cable’s reach and utility across various sectors and regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapid emergence as a leading subsea cable provider and owner has been the centerpiece of Beijing’s ambitious Digital Silk Road initiative launched in 2015, which aims to capture 60 percent of the global fiber-optic cable market by targeting emerging economies in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific. While Chinese companies have been recently blocked from subsea cable projects involving U.S. investment and firms due to U.S. concerns about the national security risks that come with HMN Technologies’ unbridled growth, the company has provided 18 percent of the subsea cables (in terms of the total length of cable) that have been laid worldwide over the past four years. HMN Technologies has also become the world’s fastest-growing subsea cable builder over the past 10 years. A 2020 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) report referenced the fact that HMN Technologies has “built or repaired” almost 25 percent of subsea cables and is due to build only 7 percent of the cables currently under development globally, perhaps indicating a potential trend of the Chinese firm’s slowing control over international cable construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-vulnerability-of-cable-systems-and-the-potential-for-chinese-exploitation&quot;&gt;The Vulnerability of Cable Systems and the Potential for Chinese Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea cables can be highly vulnerable to a variety of factors. Most cable damage is unintentional, mainly stemming from accidental human interaction with the cables. Still, potential hazards to the cables range from anchoring and fishing equipment to extreme weather such as earthquakes and landslides. Damage to submarine cables is relatively common — an estimated 100 to 150 cables are severed each year — mostly from fishing equipment or anchors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The scale and exposure of undersea infrastructure also make it an easy target for saboteurs operating in the gray zone of “deniable attacks short of war.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale and exposure of undersea infrastructure also make it an easy target for saboteurs operating in the gray zone of “deniable attacks short of war.” In 2023, Taiwanese authorities accused two Chinese vessels in the area of cutting the only two submarine cables that supply internet to Taiwan’s Matsu Islands, plunging its 14,000 residents into digital isolation for six weeks. Although there was no clear confirmation of a deliberate attack, Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pointed to a remarkable frequency of Chinese vessels causing cable disruptions — 27 times since 2018 — and accused Beijing of harassing Taiwan in a classic case of “gray-zone aggression.” Similarly, in October 2023, a Baltic Sea telecom cable connecting Sweden and Estonia sustained damage at the same time as a Finnish-Estonian gas pipeline and cable. Carl-Oskar Bohlin, Sweden’s minister for civil defense, said the Swedish-Estonian cable was damaged as a result of “external force or tampering” and that Estonian officials had concluded that the three incidents were “related.” An investigation focused on a Russian-flagged ship and a Chinese-owned vessel operating in the area as the likely sources of the alleged sabotage. Private cable firms have also identified the South China Sea and the Red Sea as two notable choke points in the international undersea cable network. In the Red Sea, a spate of Houthi attacks has indirectly damaged cables in this major artery connecting Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OJXSKVX.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This regional snapshot of the web of subsea cables in the Indo-Pacific displays at once both the interdependence and vulnerability of these systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less likely, but still of concern, geopolitical rivals such as China could potentially collect the data flowing through this infrastructure. U.S. officials have sounded the alarm over the involvement of Chinese firms in new global seabed cable projects, suggesting that China could monitor data running through the cables or even sever entire countries from the internet either through software or interfering at coastal landing stations for the cables. As concerns grow over Chinese delays with granting permits, challenges facing cable repair, and even the potential of state tampering with cables, U.S. and allied-country companies have rerouted planned subsea cable systems away from landing in Chinese territories and other vulnerable areas. For example, the U.S. government and the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector, also known as “Team Telecom,” denied issuing a submarine cable license for the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) system that was meant to connect the United States with Hong Kong, citing “national security and foreign ownership concerns” with the direct connection to China-controlled Hong Kong. However, the segments of the PLCN system that were already going to land in Taiwan and the Philippines were still approved. Two other applications for planned cable systems that connected with Hong Kong were withdrawn and redesigned due to similar national security considerations. At the same time, Chinese authorities in recent years have been delaying approval or denying the use of subsea cables altogether that would move through the South China Sea. China’s territorial claim over the South China Sea has prevented the subsea cable industry from accessing the region for north-south connectivity in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The overreliance on Chinese repair ships due to limited alternatives in the marketplace is another vulnerability if, during a time of military conflict, the Chinese government prohibits access to its repair ships and subsea cables are left damaged without timely repair.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another backdoor vulnerability is the challenge of high-risk vendors. While a trusted supplier may install subsea cables, they can be maintained by a repairer from a high-risk vendor, some of whom are Chinese. The overreliance on Chinese repair ships due to limited alternatives in the marketplace is another vulnerability if, during a time of military conflict, the Chinese government prohibits access to its repair ships and subsea cables are left damaged without timely repair. Therefore, U.S. and allied officials have warned that the repair and maintenance process of undersea cables in the Pacific Ocean makes them even more vulnerable to espionage from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or other state actors. State-controlled Chinese company S.B. Submarine Systems (SBSS) repairs international undersea cables, including those owned by U.S. companies such as Google and Meta, and it appears that SBSS has been hiding its vessels’ locations from radio- and satellite-tracking services without plausible explanation while operating off Taiwan, Indonesia, and other coasts in Asia. There are concerns that Chinese cable repair companies such as SBSS could tap undersea data streams, map the ocean floor to conduct reconnaissance on U.S. military communication links, or obtain highly specific location data from the internal documentation of cable systems that would allow belligerent parties to cut cables with speed and precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-threats-to-undersea-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Russian Threats to Undersea Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the international focus in this theater has largely been on the competition between the United States and China, Russian threats to subsea infrastructure are their own significant concern. Russia relies significantly less on subsea cables than either the United States or China due to its position as a continental power with internet connectivity to Europe and Central Asia and less of a focus on international trade. This makes Russia less vulnerable to disruptions in subsea cable infrastructure and potentially more willing to exploit these vulnerabilities in other nations. Recent activity by Russian naval and intelligence assets, including the spy ship Yantar and specialized submarines such as the Losharik, has raised alarm among Western defense and security officials. Yantar, for instance, has been observed loitering near undersea cable routes, equipped with submersibles capable of cutting or tapping into these cables, signaling a clear intent to exploit these vulnerabilities in a potential conflict scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic importance of undersea cables has not been lost on Russia, which views this infrastructure as a critical point of leverage against the security of Western nations. This perspective is emphasized in statements from high-ranking Russian officials such as Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, who, following the Nord Stream pipeline explosions in 2023, indicated that Russia could target undersea communication cables as retaliation for alleged Western involvement in the blasts. This rhetoric, coupled with physical evidence of Russian activities near this vital infrastructure, has brought about concerns within NATO and allied nations about the potential for Russian sabotage aimed at disrupting Western economies and communications in times of heightened tensions or outright conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The strategic importance of undersea cables has not been lost on Russia, which views this infrastructure as a critical point of leverage against the security of Western nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-to-counter-undersea-great-power-competition&quot;&gt;Recommendations to Counter Undersea Great Power Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is critical that the United States and its allies leverage development finance institutions (DFIs), multilateral development banks (MDBs), export credit agencies (ECAs), government agencies, and the private sector to support host countries and help U.S. and allied firms compete with their Chinese and Russian counterparts and secure allied systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Subsea cable projects are expensive. The cost varies from $30,000 to $50,000 per kilometer for subsea communication cables. Even though HMN Technologies (formerly Huawei Marine Networks Co., Ltd.) is still perceived as offering lower-quality technology than its competitors, it can offer dramatically cheaper contracts than Western firms can afford. HMN Technologies’ bids to work on undersea cables projects are priced 20 to 30 percent lower than its rivals, which could help China secure more deals moving forward. For now, U.S. government campaigns have successfully thwarted Chinese companies from winning contracts where U.S. companies were also bidders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For example, the United States successfully ousted HMN Technologies from the Southeast Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 6 (SMW6) subsea fiber-optic cable system, which links Singapore to France. To do so, the United States used both sweeteners and warnings. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency offered training grants valued at a total of $3.8 million to five telecommunications companies involved in the selection process and located in countries on the cable route. This offer was conditional on them choosing the U.S. firm SubCom as the supplier. The U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) also extended support to SubCom. SubCom won the $600 million contract for SMW6 by offering specifically designed training assistance. SubCom landed the contract also thanks to the work of U.S. diplomats, who warned foreign telecommunications carriers about the security risks surrounding HMN Technologies and the crippling sanctions that the United States was planning to impose on the Chinese company, putting their investment at significant risk. This bilateral U.S. diplomatic effort helped SubCom ultimately win the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States is also financing undersea cables in strategic areas such as the Indo-Pacific, one of the primary theaters of geopolitical competition between the United States and China. In that region, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) committed to providing a loan of up to $190 million to Trans-Pacific Networks, who partnered with Telstra International, to support the construction of a 15,200 km submarine fiber-optic cable connecting Singapore, Indonesia, and the United States. The new cable will expand and enhance internet access across the region, including to isolated Pacific islands.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;DFIs, such as the DFC, and MDBs, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, also provide essential funding, risk mitigation, and project development capabilities that enable U.S. and allied companies to compete against Chinese state-subsidized firms. The DFC’s ability to operate in middle- and upper-middle-income countries can be improved by increasing its investment cap, which currently stands at $60 billion. These institutions can also offer loans and guarantees, reducing financial risks for large-scale infrastructure projects. ECAs, including EXIM and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, play a crucial role in supporting the development of trusted undersea cable infrastructure by providing insurance and credit facilities that protect against political and commercial risks. This financial backing is vital for developing and maintaining undersea cables, ensuring that this critical infrastructure remains under the control of trusted entities. Greater coordination between these financial bodies will ultimately lead to more effective resource allocation and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should lessen the vulnerabilities of subsea cables by building repair capacity, increasing funding for cable ship repairs, and streamlining the permitting process, improving the security and resilience of cable networks.&lt;/strong&gt; The global fiber-optic network is designed with a certain level of redundancy to handle frequent damage. Most countries are linked by multiple underwater cables, enabling data to be redirected smoothly if one or two lines are affected. However, repairing is complex, costly, and time consuming in the event of more significant damage. According to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) — an organization that promotes the safeguarding of submarine cables, facilitates collaboration among industry and government stakeholders, and whose more than 215 members own 98 percent of the world’s undersea cables — cable repairs average between $1 and $3 million, require “specialized cable ships with highly trained crews that cost tens of thousands of dollars per day,” and can take months to complete. Submarine internet cable provider Seacom reported that repairing the damaged Red Sea cables would take at least eight weeks due to the permitting requirements needed to begin the process. Restoration costs sometimes exceed repair costs due to the need to reroute communications over unimpaired systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To reduce the vulnerability of critical cable systems, the United States should consider increasing current federal funding to augment the industrial base for U.S. cable repair, deployment, and maintenance. The Cable Security Fleet (CSF), implemented in 2021 and modeled after the Maritime Security Program, is a federal infrastructure protection program — partly overseen by the Pentagon — meant to address the lack of rapid response and repair capacity of U.S. ships in case of a national emergency or war. SubCom, one of the world’s largest subsea fiber-optic cable developers for telecommunication and technology firms and the sole cable contractor for the U.S. military, was awarded a $10 million annual contract in 2021 by the U.S. Department of Transportation to operate the CSF. The CSF consists of two U.S.-flagged and crewed cable ships, the CS Dependable and CS Decisive, which are required to be available for laying, maintaining, and repairing critical cables. The CSF funding requires an annual appropriation by Congress, as each ship operator receives a $5 million stipend annually if the ship meets contractual and statutory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing the resilience of submarine communications cable systems would involve increasing redundancies, introducing more cables with greater carrying capacity, and improving capabilities to promptly maintain and repair cable systems. The supply chain for many of the components of cable systems is global. For instance, optical and power components for undersea repeaters are manufactured in China and some Southeast Asian nations. Securing a good supply chain is also essential to ensure that cables from ASN, NEC, and SubCom can be manufactured (and spares can be manufactured for existing cables). Given the costs associated with the installation of more cables with greater carrying capacity, prompt repair capabilities provide a more effective method of introducing resilience in the cable system. This effort is complicated by the shortage of cable repair ships, especially given the rapid increase in subsea cables built over the past five years. The U.S. government and its allies should consider investing in the construction of new repair ships, as many existing vessels are aging and nearing retirement. The cost of a new cable ship can reach over $100 million. But even with prompt repair capacity, there needs to be a “break glass” capability to deploy new cables rapidly. This would include classified cable route planning and surveys ahead of the need date so that there are no delays in initiating new cable deployments should existing routes be compromised. Regional capability to partially re-lay new systems destroyed due to massive intentional cuts would also enhance resiliency. The Tonga volcano cuts in 2022 are a good illustration of how long it takes to find new cables and create a solution, especially when a repeater is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should ensure that domestic and international legal and regulatory frameworks, including permitting and liability regimes, are structured and operated to facilitate efficient and effective subsea cable repairs and installations while minimizing undue delays and costs. However, this efficiency cannot come at the cost of security, so the U.S. government and allies should not turn to untrusted repairers for speedy restoration. Electronic monitoring systems could enhance the physical and data security of subsea cables by detecting any changes or anomalies in the seabed environment and alerting operators. Electronic protection in the form of an end-to-end encryption system also reduces the risk of surveillance, tapping, and spying.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. government must prioritize developing and implementing a cohesive legal and international framework to defend the submarine cable network.&lt;/strong&gt; The current legal and international framework is complex and fragmented, with different international legal regimes determining responsibility and punishment for sabotage depending on where the cables are laid. When cables are sabotaged in international waters, there is no regime to hold the perpetrator accountable. The United States is not even a signatory to the latest international treaties that address subsea cable protection. There also needs to be an increase in naval security from governmental bodies — in the event of war, there needs to be greater capacity to repair undersea fiber-optic cables in order to improve the United States’ wartime resilience. The United States could better leverage the ICPC to prevent damage, establish internationally recognized protections, and provide an apolitical forum for discussions about best practices, regulatory harmonization, data protection standards, and security measures. Participation in the ICPC may further the private-sector-led “businesslike attitude” toward cable building, repair, and maintenance; provide the architecture for international standards and practices and cooperative public-private management of critical communication infrastructure; and generate an environment to develop relationships with trusted vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should update its burdensome domestic permitting processes.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States lacks a comprehensive regulatory environment to streamline the issuance of cable permits. Under the Cable Landing License Act of 1921, all submarine cable operators must acquire a license from the FCC. For cables with significant foreign ownership or that connect the United States with foreign landing points, applications must be reviewed by the Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector. Cables must receive a federal permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate their potential impact on the environment and any endangered species, but if the cables are placed in marine sanctuaries, then the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration exercises authority. Yet if cables are dropped on the continental shelf, authority rests with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. These requirements are just at the federal level — excluding necessary state and local permits. Overall, the combined licensing processes can take up to two years. That is bad for business and good for the CCP’s cable suppliers. Rather than this jungle of jurisdictions and lengthy national security reviews, the United States might consider centralizing the monitoring of undersea cables under one agency in a way that coordinates existing actors and has the authority to streamline the approval process for cables as critical infrastructure. After all, according to a Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council report, “federal agencies often fail to coordinate among themselves and with their state and local counterparts on even an ad hoc basis to ensure submarine cable protection.” The United States is also unique in how burdensome its national security review and ongoing obligations are, creating strong disincentives to locate subsea cables in the United States. Greater transparency, speed, and uniformity, as well as the development of due process protections, are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should closely collaborate with its allies in two capacities: engaging in regulatory cooperation and providing technical assistance to developing countries and emerging economies.&lt;/strong&gt; The current state of the international regulatory framework is a major concern among industry leaders, as cable companies have repeatedly expressed frustration over the disparate processes in each country, which significantly extend the time required to obtain permits before construction can begin. Establishing an international body to help countries create uniform regulatory processes across the globe could streamline these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In 2019, Japan outlined the Data Free Flow with Trust(DFFT) concept, which promotes the free flow of data and the protection of individual privacy, national security, and intellectual property by connecting undersea cables only with allies and partner nations. At its May 2023 summit in Hiroshima, the G7 endorsed the creation of the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership, which puts the DFFT into action. In the same vein, the Quad — a strategic security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — launched the Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience in 2023 to strengthen submarine cable systems in the Indo-Pacific by leveraging the four countries’ expertise in designing, manufacturing, laying, and maintaining undersea cables. Under this partnership, Australia will establish the Indo-Pacific Cable Connectivity and Resilience Program, which will commission technical and policy research frameworks in addition to providing technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States, through the Quad 2023 partnership and its $5 million CABLES program, will provide technical and capacity-building assistance on the security of undersea cables. Development agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have also emphasized the importance of fostering digital connectivity in developing countries, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, and ensuring that these countries have the capacity to effectively implement and manage the undersea cables once they are landed. For example, USAID has been providing technical assistance to support the development of a $30 million undersea cable spur that will connect Palau to the DFC-financed Singapore-U.S. cable — the longest in the world. The Palau cable spur is part of a larger U.S. government initiative to build greater telecommunications infrastructure throughout the Pacific islands, which, in turn, is meant to promote innovation, connectivity, and development throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In parallel, in April 2024, Google announced an additional $1 billion investment in digital connectivity as part of its Pacific Connect Initiative, which includes multiple cable systems it is building in the Pacific, specifically designed with branching units to connect Pacific island nations with little to no existing connectivity. This multilateral initiative by Google, which includes geopolitical collaboration from multiple governmental bodies, aligns with the U.S. government’s efforts and presents an opportunity for greater public-private partnerships in this space. The Marea cable, connecting Virginia with Spain and developed by Microsoft, Meta, and telecommunications company Telsius, is also part of a network of advanced cables that promotes digital connectivity, upgraded global internet infrastructure, and greater speed and resiliency. By collaborating with private sector leaders, the United States can further enhance its initiatives and make strides in bridging the digital divide around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undersea cables are critical to global communications infrastructure, supporting everything from financial transactions to national security communications, making them a prime target in the escalating great power competition between the United States, China, and Russia, as well as for other state and non-state actors. As the lifelines of the digital age, these cables support economic activities, military operations, and everyday internet usage. Thus, their security is paramount. The threats posed by state actors — particularly Russia and China — highlight the urgent need for measures to protect this infrastructure. Russia’s strategic use of specialized submarines and espionage vessels to potentially sabotage undersea cables, combined with China’s rapid expansion in subsea cable construction and control, underlines the vulnerability of these critical systems. Without coordinated international efforts to safeguard these cables, the risks of disruption, espionage, and economic instability will continue to grow. As well as threatening Western interests, China’s dominance in the subsea cable industry could undermine numerous countries’ economic and digital sovereignty, particularly in emerging markets. As such, the United States must take proactive measures, including harnessing the power of DFIs and facilitating international cooperation, to safeguard these cable networks and ensure a secure and resilient future for the world’s communications infrastructure under the sea. This involves not only defending against physical threats but also protecting the integrity and reliability of the data transmitted through these cables. By prioritizing the protection of undersea infrastructure, the United States and its allies can mitigate the risks posed by adversaries and secure the digital backbone of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial capacity commands increased attention among like-minded allies and partners around the globe in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war has highlighted the need for defense industrial resilience in the West, given the rapid depletion of matériel and the limits on surge production capacity that have illuminated fragile defense supply chains. Meanwhile, the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region has continued to deteriorate. China’s coercive actions around Taiwan and across the East and South China Seas, combined with North Korea’s repeated provocations, are clear reminders that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” as Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio famously said in a speech in June 2022. The United States and its allies, including Japan, have demonstrated a shared commitment to enhancing defense cooperation and promoting broader networks of security cooperation. Developing a more robust and resilient defense industrial ecosystem is a key element of this common strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this worsening regional security environment, Japan has taken unprecedented steps to strengthen its defense posture, with significant increases in defense spending and plans to acquire advanced capabilities, including long-range counterstrike. It is also taking steps to enhance defense cooperation with the United States and other partners, such as Australia and the Republic of Korea. As part of this broader strategy, Japan has identified strengthening its defense industrial base as “virtually defense capability itself.” Strengthening the defense industrial base dovetails with U.S. defense strategy, which also stresses the importance of building a resilient defense ecosystem and collaborating with allies toward that end. The Department of Defense’s (DoD) first National Defense Industrial Strategy includes supporting “a resilient defense industrial ecosystem among the U.S. and close international allies and partners” as one of its four strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan has taken unprecedented steps to strengthen its defense posture, with significant increases in defense spending and plans to acquire advanced capabilities, including long-range counterstrike.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeper defense industrial cooperation requires deliberate investment and planning, and it can take several forms, including codevelopment and coproduction of complete systems at the high end and supplying subcomponents to a shared system at the low end. The former is the hardest to achieve, given the need to identify common requirements and align technology and manufacturing capacity in a way that benefits both countries. Cooperation in integrating supply chains of subcomponents is often a more practical approach. The challenge in both cases is identifying appropriate opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) are an increasingly important capability where both the United States and Japan are making investments to counter new and existing threats. The U.S. Replicator initiative, which aims to field large numbers of small drones on a rapid timeline, is an innovative approach to counter China’s defense industrial scale and mass. Japan is focused on the critical need for UAS, necessitated in part by a declining population that is impacting manpower in the Self-Defense Forces. Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD) has announced a plan to invest JPY 1 trillion (USD 7.1 billion) over the next five years to develop uncrewed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the subcomponent level, electro-optical sensors have become one of the largest needs for both the consumer and defense markets. They are critical components for weapons and platforms (including for long-range precision targeting, consistent radio communications, automation networks, cryptanalysis, etc.), but capacity shortages have limited their production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from the MOD’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) conducted a study to explore avenues for enhancing U.S.-Japan defense equipment and technology cooperation, with an emphasis on UAS and electro-optical sensors as potential targets of opportunity. The methodology included a literature review of analysis on the two case study topics; reviews of government policy documents; case studies on previous examples of bilateral cooperation, as well as international trade data; and interviews with experts at nine U.S. and Japanese companies with relevant expertise. The team also held two private research workshops to discuss opportunities and challenges with a broader range of industry participants. The interviews and workshops were held under the Chatham House Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report starts with an overview of Japan’s defense industry. It next briefly summarizes the history of U.S.-Japan defense industrial cooperation and then presents the two case studies, examining current challenges in the industrial supply chain and assessing how Japan can best plug in to the U.S. defense ecosystem. The report also addresses structural impediments to U.S.-Japan cooperation and concludes with insights that can assist in overcoming those barriers to support the strategic objectives of both governments and help build a more robust and secure defense supply chain globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-overview-of-japans-defense-industry&quot;&gt;An Overview of Japan’s Defense Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following World War II and the introduction of Japan’s postwar constitution in 1947, the Japanese defense industry essentially collapsed. The war-renouncing clause in the constitution (Article 9) and Japan’s decision at the outset of the Cold War to prioritize economic development over investments in the military limited the development of Japan’s domestic defense industrial base (DIB). Throughout the Cold War, Japan focused on a policy of “exclusive self-defense” (senshu bouei), relying heavily on the United States for its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan introduced strict restrictions on arms exports as part of its postwar policies. The Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, adopted in 1967, limited arms transfers by prohibiting exports to communist countries, countries subject to embargoes under UN Security Council resolutions, or countries engaged in or likely to be engaged in international conflicts. Japan imposed additional restrictions in 1976 that virtually prohibited arms exports, a policy that was sustained with little change for the next 40 years. These limits on exports were combined with policy that limited Japanese defense spending to about 1 percent of GDP. Consequently, Japan’s defense industry relied exclusively on the government for contracts to support the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), a small market that was adequate for meeting Japan’s defense needs but prevented the development of a robust and competitive defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, concerns about the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs and China’s rapidly advancing military capabilities prompted the Japanese government to place a renewed emphasis on defense. The government issued National Defense Program Guidelines in 1995, 2004, and 2010, all of which emphasized enhancing defense cooperation with the United States. Japan released its first National Security Strategy in 2013, adopting a more ambitious strategy aimed at further strengthening Japan’s defense capabilities — albeit still within the framework of strict 1 percent limits on defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan had previously taken modest steps to enable defense industry cooperation with the United States, during this period it began to ease broader restrictions on defense exports for the first time. In 2012, Japan introduced modest measures to allow exports of equipment for peacekeeping operations and participation in international joint development and production of equipment. In 2014, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, Japan revised its policy to allow exports in several categories of non-lethal equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history of limits on exports, combined with relatively small budgets centered on equipment for self-defense, has long limited opportunities for bilateral cooperation. Nevertheless, there have been a handful of high-profile bilateral projects. Most significant was collaboration in jointly developing the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block IIA ballistic missile defense interceptor that began in 2006. Japan also collaborated with the United States on the F-35 stealth fighter through in-country final assembly and maintenance of aircraft, as well as production of some components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of Japan’s second National Security Strategy in December 2022 — and the attendant increases in defense spending and support for the defense industrial base — signaled a new era of opportunity in defense industrial cooperation. In December 2023, Japan further eased export rules to allow exports of complete systems manufactured under license, in addition to the export of parts and components. Restrictions on the categories of equipment approved for export (largely limited to nonlethal systems) remain in place, however — a factor that will constrain opportunities in the near term, absent broader reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-for-japans-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Challenges for Japan’s Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s defense industry has a structure unique among advanced economies. As a result of the history described above, there are no dedicated defense “primes” in Japan. Rather, defense manufacturing is centered on a limited number of large industrial conglomerates for which defense is but a small share of overall business. The four major Japanese defense companies — Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), Fujitsu, and Ishikawajima Heavy Industries (IHI) — have secured positions on the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) list of top 100 defense companies worldwide, but the broader landscape reveals a more mixed story. Until recently, Japan’s defense industry risked entering a spiral of decline. Over 100 smaller enterprises that support the major firms have withdrawn from the defense industry since 2003, according to the MOD, and even some larger enterprises have cut back on defense business. For example, Sumitomo Heavy Industries recently halted machine gun production, while Komatsu discontinued armored vehicle development for the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors have contributed to this trend. As noted, limits on defense exports mean that the JSDF has been the sole customer for most of these companies. Japan has lacked state-run defense facilities and relies solely on the private sector to manufacture defense equipment for the JSDF. Low demand and meager profits mean that returns on investment were too low for Japanese companies to stay in the defense market: other nations’ defense companies enjoy operating profit margins exceeding 10 percent, while Japan’s defense industry remains at only 2–3 percent. Legislation passed in 2023 attempts to directly target these deficiencies and will be addressed further below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline of Japan’s defense industry has been a source of deep concern in the Japanese government, which prompted the focus on strengthening the industrial base captured in the new National Security Strategy. The MOD has publicly recognized that the challenge with incentives “not only interferes with the stable procurement of defense equipment essential for the SDF operations, but also causes the loss of proper competitive environment and innovation in the long term, resulting in losing its ground on Japan’s technological superiority in security.” Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensuring that Japan’s defense industry remains capable of meeting national security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-partnership-experience&quot;&gt;International Partnership Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defense industries of partner nations can contribute to their common defense in multiple ways. One is cooperative development, where common requirements lead partner governments to collaborate on complete systems. A second example is one in which a contractor in one nation serves as the lead integrator of a system and brings in companies from other nations to provide subsystems or components. Two recent examples of U.S.-Japan partnership are summarized as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SM-3 Block IIA, jointly developed by Raytheon and MHI, is an example of cooperative development. Japan agreed to fund roughly half of the project and manufacture critical missile components for use by both countries. The approach of “component compartmentalization” had the benefit of featuring clean dividing lines between each country’s contributions, with each government managing their respective industry partner and managing the budget for their portions. This approach to joint acquisition reflected constraints on policies and practices in place at the time, but kept industry-to-industry engaement at arm’s length. Future joint acquisition programs seem more likely to follow the precedents now being set by Japan’s participation in the Global Combat Aircraft Program (GCAP) and the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is Japan’s participation in the F-35 fighter jet program. Though not one of the founding partners of the F-35 consortium, Japan “is acquiring the most [F-35s] of any international customer.” MHI operates a F-35A Final Assembly and Checkout (FACO) facility, where it conducts maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade (MRO&amp;amp;U) activities for Japanese and U.S. aircraft in Japan. Japanese companies, including MHI, Mitsubishi Electric (MELCO), and IHI Corp., manufacture radar parts, electro-optical distributed aperture system (EODAS) components, and engine parts for Japan’s F-35 fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy restrictions in areas such as export control and information security impacted the implementation of F-35 production and support in Japan, its eventual success now provides important operational as well as industrial base benefits for both countries that could be expanded further in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;revitalizing-japans-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Revitalizing Japan’s Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the SM-3 Block IIA and F-35 programs, Japan has a long history of manufacturing U.S.-origin equipment under license. Some examples include the F-15J (manufactured by MHI), the CH-47J Chinook (manufactured by KHI), and the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) air and missile defense interceptor (manufactured by MHI). Japan has exported components of both earlier PAC-2 systems and the F-15 engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these efforts, however, Japan has a thin record of international cooperation on defense equipment; it has recently introduced a range of new policies and regulations to strengthen its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Buildup Program, released along with the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy in December 2022, set out capability priorities for Japan’s buildup over the five years from 2023 to 2027. One of seven priorities listed in the buildup program is uncrewed systems, including “utility/attack UAVs and miniature attack UAVs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan has a thin record of international cooperation on defense equipment; it has recently introduced a range of new policies and regulations to strengthen its defense industrial base.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan subsequently enacted new legislation in October 2023 to enhance its defense industrial base. The new law aims to achieve three key priorities: ensuring national security independence, bolstering deterrence, and contributing to domestic industries through technology spillover. To achieve this, the legislation emphasizes strengthening the DIB as a top priority while also importing technology and pursuing joint development. The focus extends beyond finished products to maintaining technological superiority and stable manufacturing of parts and components. As the policy states, “both prime contractors and suppliers are equally essential to stably manufacturing defense equipment.” The law provides for the government to take ownership of defense manufacturing facilities; provides subsidies to strengthen supply chains, as well as for investments in areas like enhanced cybersecurity; and provides funding to modify equipment for export. Although Japan’s approach places a heavy emphasis on indigenous development and production, it recognizes the vital role of collaboration with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on these steps, and after lengthy discussions among Japan’s ruling political parties, export policies were revised in December 2023 to allow exports of complete systems manufactured under license to the country of origin and other likeminded states. These modifications expanded the scope of nations eligible for importing defense equipment from Japan and also opened the door for the export of lethal weapons, though exports to nations involved in conflict are still barred. In March 2024, Japan’s ruling parties announced an agreement to allow exports to third countries of a new fighter aircraft to be developed with the United Kingdom and Italy under the GCAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-potential-to-expand-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Future: Potential to Expand Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recent policy reforms are sparking change in Japan’s defense industry and increased interest in international partnerships. According to interviews with industry representatives conducted for this study, some Japanese firms are increasing capital investment in their defense businesses and assigning more personnel to the defense sector. Simultaneously, U.S. companies have noticed increased engagement from their Japanese counterparts. Some U.S. firms primarily involved in commercial manufacturing have shifted their focus toward defense discussions with Japan in the last two years. Other U.S. companies are closely monitoring developments in the Japanese regulatory system and contemplating increased collaboration with Japan across a range of products. These dynamics suggest an evolving landscape that could further advance U.S.-Japan defense industrial cooperation over time. Three current efforts in particular highlight the potential for expanded Japanese defense industry engagement in the international marketplace: GCAP, the GPI cooperative development program, and the Loyal Wingman drone project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL COMBAT AIR PROGRAM (GCAP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy announced a multinational initiative to develop a sixth-generation fighter. With the goal of introducing the aircraft into service by 2035 — an ambitious timeline — it is the first major program undertaken by Japan with a partner other than the United States. The three partners have established a joint program office to oversee the effort, but as of this writing, they have yet to finalize agreement on workshare for the project. The recent revision of Japan’s export policy was instrumental in allowing this project to go forward, as it projected confidence in Japan’s defense market potential. After intense internal negotiations, the ruling coalition in Japan approved GCAP exports to third countries but did not announce broader reforms; steps to allow exports of lethal equipment were set aside for the time being. If successful, GCAP could serve as a driver for broader defense industry reform and revitalization in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLIDE PHASE INTERCEPTOR (GPI) COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida announced plans to pursue joint development of a glide phase interceptor to counter the threat posed by hypersonic missiles. On May 15, 2024, the Missile Defense Agency and MOD finalized the GPI Cooperative Development Agreement. This project will strengthen industrial base capabilities in both countries to develop and produce advanced counter-hypersonic systems. While project management will resemble that used for the earlier SM-3 Block IIA missile, its workshare provisions reportedly allow for more direct industry-industry collaboration in sharing experiences related to all areas of missile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LOYAL WINGMAN DRONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also exploring cooperation with the United States and Australia on developing drones for military operations through the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. In a statement released after Prime Minister Albanese’s visit to Washington in September 2023, the White House announced an “intention to explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on Unmanned Aerial Systems. Our cooperation aims to enhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.” This would be the first time that these three nations worked together on a specific project. In April 2024, the U.S. Air Force selected Anduril and General Atomics to build “production representative” test CCA, the first phase of the project. Future rounds of CCA acquisition are expected to involve “most strategic” U.S. partners. Japan’s role in future CCA projects remains under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-one&quot;&gt;Case Study One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-to-uas&quot;&gt;Introduction to UAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aircraft (UA) is a blanket term for flying vehicles without a human on board. The nomenclature for these systems has evolved over time, with the term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) common in the past and then replaced by the term remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The U.S. Air Force popularized RPA to draw attention to the non-autonomous nature of these aircraft; ultimately, a human is still designing, controlling, and operating these systems. Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) is the latest iteration in terminology; in this report, it is used to encompass UA, UAV, and RPA. (Note that “drones” is another common term.) UAS refers not just to the aircraft itself, but also to the various subsystems and operating networks required for successful flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD categorizes UAS into one of five groups depending on speed, operating altitude, and weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-uas&quot;&gt;The Role of UAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS have been used for decades, initially for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). UAS can collect information in greater detail over longer periods of time than crewed aircraft. Uncrewed aircraft also require fewer personnel and have somewhat lower operating costs per hour. Other defense applications include early detection of enemy aircraft or missiles, as well as delivering weapons to targets, much like a piloted aircraft delivers a missile or bomb. UAS can also be used for suicide missions where they divebomb targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aUI4TEj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: UAS Systems Classification.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/18249&quot;&gt;U.S. Army UAS Center of Excellence, “Eyes of the Army”: U.S. Army Roadmap for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Fort Rucker, AL: U.S. Army UAS Center of Excellence, January 2010)&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-threat-and-proliferation/missile-basics/unmanned-aircraft-systems-uas/&quot;&gt;“Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Basics,” Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, July 17, 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries also use UAS for close air support, cargo and resupply, and communications relay. UAS can replace certain crewed missions, including aerial refueling, air-to-air combat, strategic bombing, battle management and command and control (BMC2), suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, and electronic warfare. Looking ahead, UAS experimental concepts include aircraft system-of-systems (SOS) development, AI-enabled manned-unmanned teaming (MUMT), mission support or “loyal wingmen,” autonomous dogfighting, swarming, and lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS). The Missile Technology Control Regime, of which both the United States and Japan are members, has been a brake on some UAS cooperation for larger systems, but U.S. reinterpretation of the regime in 2020 loosened these restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS also have commercial applications. Examples include capturing video from above (e.g., for data mapping or even filming scenes for movies), but the most common commercial use is in agriculture. Farmers use drones to monitor both livestock and water levels, in addition to producing imagery to analyze details of crop health. Today, Japan uses more than 3,000 drones for agricultural purposes. Other notable applications include disaster recovery and surveying land, and parcel delivery has also been explored as a use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS offer advantages over crewed aircraft. If UAS are shot down, no warfighter is harmed or lost. UAS are effective against certain targets where a mission using crewed aircraft would be more risky and costly. They can be harder to detect and destroy given their minimal signature, and they are generally less expensive to produce. Cost efficiency allows more UAS to be deployed and therefore support a higher volume of fire. This has proven to be very effective in the Russo-Ukrainian war, with Russia using inexpensive Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses before deploying cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS are especially significant for missions that can be characterized as “dull, dirty, or dangerous.” “Dull” refers to lengthy missions that might be repetitive, such as long reconnaissance missions that do not need onboard pilots. “Dirty” refers to potential human exposure to chemical, radiological, or biological contamination. “Dangerous” missions are those that directly put operators in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the figure below, the worldwide demand for UAS has increased, placing a premium on capability to produce UAS at scale. This could create an opportunity for the United States to partner with other countries by leveraging industrial base strengths, which would mitigate U.S. production challenges and supply chain constraints. Japan’s industrial capabilities could be useful in efforts to fill gaps in U.S. industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eZPa6Hp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-uas-demand-collaboration-and-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Japan’s UAS Demand, Collaboration, and Industrial Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has been relatively slow to adapt military drone technology, primarily using UAS for reconnaissance purposes. In years past, Japanese authorities assumed that because low-cost drones were unable to fly across the ocean, they would add little value to Japan’s national security. Attitudes now reflect increased emphasis on the importance of UAS to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) in particular. For example, UAS could prove crucial to improving Japan’s situational awareness around the Senkaku Islands. UAS, in addition to uncrewed maritime vehicles, are arguably critical in providing consistent and cost-efficient surveillance of these islands, which are under near-daily pressure from Chinese Coast Guard vessels. The uptick in Japanese UAS interest also reflects JSDF recruitment and retention challenges. UAS can help ameliorate this shortfall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of Japan’s drone manufacturers produce commercial systems. Japanese companies that develop and produce UAS for military use tend to be bigger players, such as MHI, MELCO, and Subaru Corporation. The Japanese government has steadily begun to increase its investments in domestic UAS technologies. The MOD is seeking to develop combat UAS capable of “breakneck maneuvers,” with Subaru working on remote and flight control systems and MHI and MELCO developing information dissemination capabilities between aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Japanese government has steadily begun to increase its investments in domestic UAS technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of Japan’s UAS manufacturing capabilities varies across application (commercial vs. defense) and class (Groups 1–5 listed in Table 1). Japan has historically invested in its smaller commercial drone market, leading to the emergence of Japanese UAS manufacturers such as Autonomous Control Systems Laboratory. In contrast, the United States mostly relies on imports from other suppliers, particularly China, for smaller consumer and commercial drones. The company DJI China controls more than 70 percent of the global drone market via its manufacturing of consumer and commercial drones. However, even commercial drones have proven to be dual-use technologies, and civilian drones made by DJI can be adapted for battlefield use, as has been seen in the Russo-Ukrainian war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-opportunities-for-us-japan-uas-industrial-collaboration&quot;&gt;Current Opportunities for U.S.-Japan UAS Industrial Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States plans for significant investments in UAS systems, but collaboration with international partners could prove challenging. One issue is specific to existing systems with heritage supply chains. Bringing new suppliers into the network, including international partners, can require significant costs for engineering, testing, and other inputs, and even with those investments the components would start higher on the production cost learning curve. New programs offer fresh opportunities for industry, including from partner nations, to compete to become part of the initial supplier landscape. The United States has initiated two relevant efforts that may yield new opportunities to join the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New programs offer fresh opportunities for industry, including from partner nations, to compete to become part of the initial supplier landscape.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;replicator-initiative&quot;&gt;Replicator Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the DoD launched the Replicator initiative, a program to “quickly scale and field thousands of attritable autonomous systems within the next 18 to 24 months, leveraging AI, robotics, and commercial technology.” This initiative seeks to better integrate emerging private sector technologies into the military’s operational framework; lower costs by deploying smaller uncrewed systems that require less maintenance; and overcome the “valley of death” — the period between developing a new technology and introducing it to market in a viable application where new technologies often run into obstacles and get interest and funding to make the transition to a program of record. Accomplishing these goals could prove challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. government acquisition approaches are often complex and lengthy, with additional delays not uncommon when projects include multiple contractors from the defense and commercial sectors. Once UAS requirements are set, another challenge may be preparing the U.S. industrial base for rapidly scaling UAS production, as the smaller U.S. UAS industry has spent years struggling to compete against lower-cost imports from China. As a military program, Replicator will lead to an increase in domestic production of small UAS, but the United States will need to leverage ally and partner capacity to help meet its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan can make a significant contribution to Replicator via its strength in manufacturing small, commercial UAS. Japanese industry can be leveraged to fill the gap in U.S. production and enhance interoperability, especially considering that Replicator’s initial purchases will be small UAS. U.S. capability gaps in two specific areas offer potential opportunities for Japanese engagement: increased survivability for UAS and high-volume small UAS production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent challenge for allies and partners in industry is understanding the Pentagon’s requirements and knowing where to pitch their capabilities — a challenge often shared by small businesses in the United States. The Pentagon will need to provide more granular detail in its plan for operationalizing Replicator to enable Japanese industry to effectively plug in. In addition to a more detailed directive of what capabilities it wants these UAS to possess, the DoD will need to provide actual contracts with funding. Japan could usefully emphasize the importance of DoD information sharing as a tool to better facilitate cooperative efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;collaborative-combat-aircraft-cca&quot;&gt;Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, CCA is a U.S. Air Force initiative designed for UAS to accompany crewed missions. These UAS are intended to act as a force multiplier to offer ISR support and additional offensive firepower capability to fifth- and sixth-generation fighters. The United States plans to field around 1,000 CCAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Force has stressed that there is no single model for CCA, and that a variety of aircraft can offer different capabilities. This opens the potential for nations to develop UAS that are compatible with the larger CCA program. Japan and the United States could direct collaborative efforts toward a CCA that (a) is useful for Japan’s strategic threat environment and (b) effectively and efficiently utilizes its industrial capacity, with specific emphasis placed on its component production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE POTENTIAL FOR COLLABORATION ON COMPONENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s industrial capacity and skills could prove valuable when considering international collaboration under CCA. Interviews with industry conducted for this project identified several areas of potential strength for Japan, including microelectronics, wiring boards, UNICORN radar system and other radar systems, disaster relief pods, calibration services, avionics boxes, engines, landing gear, and other electronic components. Japan also has advanced capabilities in maintenance, repair, overhaul, and sustainment of batteries, engines, and actuators. U.S. industry additionally highlighted Japanese strengths in software development and data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations-for-uas-cooperation&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations for UAS Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New programs should provide opportunities for allies and partners to engage and invest in UAS programs. However, there are potential roadblocks specific to UAS technology worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States has used operational experience to inform its product development. UAS have made critical contributions across a range of conflicts since the beginning of Operational Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001. This has allowed the United States to capitalize on a feedback loop of combat exposure and innovation. Japan, on the other hand, lacks the combat experience that could shape its design and development plans and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the MOD has directed money into UAS research and development (R&amp;amp;D) but has yet to make UAS a formal procurement requirement. The MOD’s R&amp;amp;D push has allowed Japanese efforts to focus on building out a broad set of Japanese capabilities rather than gearing toward a partner-first approach. This incentivizes Japanese industry to focus on redeveloping and domestically reproducing technologies — from land-based vehicles to undersea vessels — that already exist. This limits Japan’s ability to enter effective partnerships if the partnering nation already has those capabilities. A continuing instinct for indigenous development of new systems thus poses risks for the future competitiveness of Japanese industry in the UAS market. Based on interviews with industry conducted for this study, the Japanese government is not sending a strong demand signal for UAS production. Unless the Japanese government invests in its industry or subsidizes production processes, Japanese industry may remain hesitant to partner with U.S. industry — and U.S. industry will be less likely to pursue partnerships with Japanese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-two&quot;&gt;Case Study Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electro-Optical Sensors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-to-eoir-systems&quot;&gt;Introduction to EO/IR Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) systems consist of visible and infrared sensors that help the user to operate in adversarial environmental conditions. The use of EO/IR systems enables warfighters to achieve higher battlefield awareness through ISR capabilities. Other defense applications for EO/IR systems include night vision devices, visible-light cameras, laser range finders, and more. EO/IR sensors provide real-time situational awareness and surveillance capabilities — detecting, tracking, and identifying potential threats — which supply critical information for military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are generally two types of EO/IR sensors: non-imaging EO/IR systems (point targets) and imaging EO/IR systems (extended targets). Depending on the mission, one sensor may be more appropriate than another. A point target sensor operates by detecting energy emissions rather than imagery. For example, if an adversary launches a missile, a point target sensor will detect the immense energy emitting from the launch and relay that to the operator. Conversely, an extended target sensor will generate detailed imagery rather than a point of heat. Extended target sensors are often fielded on satellites, aircraft, and other optics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-eoir-systems&quot;&gt;The Role of EO/IR Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EO/IR applications are segmented by platform: land-based, air-based, and sea-based. The sea-based segment of the market is experiencing large growth as maritime assets are becoming a priority for operational plans, especially in the Asia-Pacific theater. Unlike the radar technology traditionally used by ships, which relies on emitting active radiation signals and waiting for a return signal, EO/IR sensors are passive and detect signals naturally emitted by objects. This passive operation is a key strategic advantage as it assists Navy ships in avoiding detection and prevents them from becoming targets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is upgrading MSDF vessels by incorporating advanced sensor systems to allow them to identify targets, detect and perform threat assessments, and support weapons engagement for both offensive and defensive engagements. One example is the advanced integrated combat information center developed by MHI for the new stealth frigate commissioned by the MSDF. Mitsubishi Electric supplied the radar and the EO/IR sensor. Another is the Shipboard Panoramic Electro-Optic/Infrared (SPEIR) system developed by L3Harris for the U.S. Navy to enhance fleet protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne platforms are a major user of EO/IR systems. The explosive growth in the use of small UAS for this and other purposes has propelled industry to design smaller EO/IR systems that can be fitted to these platforms and that can dissipate heat so as not to disrupt the function of the UAS. EO/IR systems provide significant improvement over visible light surveillance cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-based EO/IR systems have a multitude of applications such as night vision goggles; drone detection; target recognition, identification, and location; and laser terminal guidance. Systems are continually being upgraded as threats evolve. For instance, the U.S. Army is developing a self-contained Laser Target Locator Module III (LTLM III) that meets updated performance requirements for its next-generation laser target locator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-eoir-sensor-history-collaboration-and-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Japan’s EO/IR Sensor History, Collaboration, and Industrial Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Japan has developed its national sensing architecture to counter Chinese and North Korean threats and has produced EO/IRs under license or indigenously toward this end. The foundations for Japan’s sensor architecture lie in its technical cooperation with the United States. In 1980, the United States and Japan established a joint Systems and Technology Forum between the DoD and the then Japan Defense Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this cooperation, the United States was able to access Japan’s advanced technology base in electro-optics and other electronics. Figure 2 shows the length and depth of U.S.-Japan trade in dual-use EO sensors within the context of global U.S. trade in the same. Long a source of U.S. imports, the rough trade balance parity since 2009 speaks to Japan’s ongoing comparative advantage in this sector. In 1983, the DoD dispatched a team of senior scientists to assess Japan’s electro-optical manufacturing base and identify any technologies that could be incorporated into U.S. defense supply chains. The technologies flagged by the DoD analysts in 1983 eventually found their way into U.S. systems and were credited with supporting the United States’ success in the 1991 Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1980s, the development of advanced sensors has been a priority for Japanese defense. In 1988, Japan awarded contracts for the development of Aegis destroyers as a component of its efforts to develop a robust sensor architecture. In 1989, the JSDF united its disparate sensor and shooter systems under the auspices of the Base Air Defense Ground Environment (BADGE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UED8rc8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan eventually began to procure more foreign-designed sensor systems at the turn of the millennium, generally featuring licensed production arrangements that preserved the Japanese EO/IR industrial base. Among others, these systems included Northrop Grumman’s E-2C Hawkeye and the Lockheed P-3 Orion. Additionally, Japanese military electro-optical production coincides with the development of indigenous systems, such as the OH-1 light helicopter or armored vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s sensor architecture was further strengthened by the procurement of air defense systems and other “shooters.” The United States is Japan’s primary source of missile defense systems, but Japan has long manufactured (under license) Patriot missile defense systems for its own use. The recent announcement of the export of these systems to the United States represents the culmination of U.S.-Japanese strategic cooperation in developing Japan’s sensor-to-shooter architecture over the course of several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-for-industrial-collaboration&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Industrial Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has been cultivating an interconnected regional security architecture with Australian, Japanese, and South Korean engagements and with increased multilateral sensor information sharing. In December 2023, the United States, South Korea, and Japan finalized an agreement to share real time missile-warning data from their various sensor networks to strengthen trilateral monitoring of North Korean missile tests. All three states possess sensor capabilities which are arrayed against North Korea; with the agreement to share data in place, allied cohesion is substantially strengthened. These initiatives are strengthened by other networking and digital lines of effort. During Prime Minister Kishida’s visit to Washington in April 2024, the two governments announced plans for an integrated air and missile defense architecture with Australia in the years ahead. At the industry level, in January 2024, Northrop Grumman and MELCO signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a joint networking solution for Japan’s air and missile defense systems to leverage the sensor-to-shooter architecture to its fullest with efficient fire controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-eoir-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Japan’s EO/IR Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s EO/IR industrial base is concentrated around the capabilities of a small group of enterprises, with Mitsubishi Corporation listed as the prime contractor for the majority of identified EO/IR records in the data. Along with final assembly, Japanese EO/IR production includes subcontractor participation, opening up the market for a broader range of opportunities. For example, MHI’s sensors may include circuitry and optics developed by the Nippon Electric Corporation. This characteristic of the Japanese EO/IR sensor industrial base is important when considering the possibilities and limits of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GRbjdlJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Japanese Manufacturers of EO/IR Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Janes Defense Markets Forecast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leading prime contractor for Japan’s recorded EO/IR sensors is MHI — even factoring in traditional U.S. defense contractors. In fact, most of the identified U.S.-made sensors belong to technologies fielded on the F-35, the Mitsubishi F-2, and select naval vessels. Across the recorded platforms, advanced fire control capabilities consistently recur as U.S. exports to Japan. In CSIS’s interviews with industry representatives, a continuous frustration highlighted by Japanese interviewees was the lack of codevelopment opportunities for higher-end systems. Japanese interviewees asserted that Japan likes to codevelop with the United States and wondered why their workers could not be brought into certain programs that are relevant to their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A continuous frustration highlighted by Japanese interviewees was the lack of codevelopment opportunities for higher-end systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has gradually developed its EO/IR industrial base to match its security needs. These investments are unlikely to decrease, as the threats that prompted the development of Japan’s EO/IR sensor architecture persist. Japanese EO/IR producers have consistently plugged into either U.S.-produced or U.S.-licensed systems. As Japan begins to deepen its security role in the region and as its concepts of counterstrike continue to materialize, this field will remain important for bilateral and multilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-insights&quot;&gt;Key Insights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing defense industrial cooperation is a stated goal of the Japanese and U.S governments, and the two nations are well positioned to work together. The nations have a Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA), which allows them to request priority delivery for defense items. They also have a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreement, which has benefits including some exemptions from “Buy America” provisions. The nations have a track record of working together successfully, including on the SM3 Block IIA missile, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and other programs. Collaborations include both the codevelopment of systems and the integration of Japan into the supply chains of systems designed and produced in the United States, experiences which provide a foundation for future work. In the course of this research, the authors identified both opportunities and challenges for defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for cooperation is the urgency of the security environment. Both countries view China as the core national security challenge, and they share a common view that action is needed to sustain deterrence. That said, the recognition that “production is deterrence” will open up opportunities only if governments create funded requirements and issue contracts for specific items. While collaboration in the form of codevelopment requires the buy-in of both governments, individual governments can encourage — and even fund — domestic industry with the goal of building capabilities and capacities to help them compete for participation in global supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors found a number of sticking points that government action could potentially alleviate or reduce, either directly or by providing incentives to industry. Other challenges are more intractable; the role of government in those can be education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-policy&quot;&gt;Government Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: Increases in equipment orders and the need to increase production may create challenges for firms involved in Japan’s defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. industry recognizes the opportunities in Japan that stem from budget increases and revisions to defense export policy. Many Japanese companies in the defense sector are responding to these changes, and some are making substantial investments in facilities to allow them to increase production of dual-use or defense-specific items. However, these developments also create new challenges, particularly related to industrial capacity. For example, while the defense budget has increased, the overall size of the workforce at most companies has not, although some firms are reallocating personnel into the defense business. Japanese defense manufacturers have nearly exclusively sold to the domestic market based on a near-flat defense budget for over half a century, so the increase in orders from the MOD puts a strain on defense companies as they look to grow across the full scope of capabilities necessary for production. MHI may be an exception, as the company moves personnel from its commercial aircraft or commercial shipbuilding business into its defense business, but other companies are less well positioned to do this. The challenge is that no matter the strength of the present-day demand signal, Japanese companies may be cautious about making significant investments in growing capacity given the uncertainty of demand over the longer term. Investment that grows capacity also increases costs — and without sustained increased demand over time, a higher cost basis could make companies less competitive for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 2: Broader defense equipment export reform in Japan will be essential to advancing international cooperation and building a globally competitive Japanese defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The still-limited reforms to defense export policy, coupled with the increased spending on defense, have resulted in Japanese industry continuing its principal focus on supplying the JSDF. While legislative reform will serve to make this business more profitable in the short term, it will do little to improve the competitiveness of Japanese industry internationally. Japan’s attractiveness to U.S. industry as a partner will hinge on increased confidence that items codeveloped or coproduced can be exported to third countries, not to mention that Japanese regulatory policy will adjust to encourage this possibility — a prospect that remains limited today. The mixed messages sent by the Japanese government about the priority to be placed on defense equipment exports continues to send a chilling signal to both U.S. and Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 3: Japan’s lingering instinct for indigenous, national solutions for high-end capabilities poses obstacles for international cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are promising areas of international collaboration under Japan’s new policies — including GCAP, GPI, and CCA — there are also numerous examples of the MOD seeking to develop indigenous capabilities despite the existence of international options that could be adapted to meet Japan’s requirements. Examples include Japan’s ambitious simultaneous investments in multiple variants of the Type-12 cruise missile; extensive R&amp;amp;D funding for multiple classes of UAS; and the stated intent to develop an autonomous “kill-chain” architecture to support counterstrike capabilities, tied together with an indigenous C2 network. While every industrialized country seeks to preserve some degree of autonomy in defense production, this focus on indigenous development — a long-standing feature of Japan’s defense strategy — over existing international options risks inefficient use of resources, delays in capability delivery, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 4: Increased early engagement between both Japanese and U.S. industry and government would facilitate industrial cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are important opportunities for U.S.-Japan cooperation on the horizon, such as the CCA and the Replicator program as discussed above. Japanese domestic programs could in future iterations tie into a larger U.S. program, but this incorporation could be at risk if early steps are not taken to lay groundwork for future cooperation. The U.S. Air Force has announced its intention to cooperate with partner industries in the future with regard to the CCA and is understandably focused on getting the details of this global approach right. Cooperation would benefit from increased and consistent forward-leaning communication to government and industry leaders in both countries on what steps they should be taking now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic&quot;&gt;Economic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: U.S. industry often views international codevelopment and coproduction of new systems as more expensive than indigenous production and may be hesitant to pursue opportunities absent government incentives and encouragement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International codevelopment and coproduction have clear benefits from an alliance perspective, including interoperability and expanded defense industrial capacity, but the challenges need to be recognized up front so that strategies can be developed to overcome them. International cooperation adds complexity and costs to programs because of the challenges of coordination, including requirements setting, decisionmaking timelines, different resources and acquisition systems, and cultural variance. Interviews conducted for this project revealed that U.S. industry often views international collaboration on new systems as challenging, particularly when partnering with an international company for the first time. A U.S. company may judge codevelopment or coproduction with a Japanese company to be more expensive than what a U.S. company can do either (a) on its own or (b) with another U.S. company — even when collaboration has clear technological and manufacturing benefits. Nevertheless, many U.S. firms express a strong desire to collaborate with Japan to take advantage of strong Japanese industrial capabilities and technological expertise, in recognition of the robust alliance between the two nations. (Project interviews highlighted particular interest in microelectronics and certain subcomponents, such as composite materials and airframe structures.) Government encouragement and policy focus, including through the creation of subsidies designed to support codevelopment by covering some of the costs of collaboration, could be useful and perhaps necessary to facilitate cooperation. Of course, without a requirement or a government contract with funding, cooperation is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial&quot;&gt;Industrial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: Japan has advanced manufacturing capabilities that prove especially important to U.S. commercial companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has advanced capabilities in various technologies — including microelectronics and carbon fiber composites — and is proficient in high-quality and high-volume commercial marketplace production. The United States has very limited capacity in some of these arenas, including wiring boards, which have been offshored to Southeast Asia. Japan’s comparative advantage in these fields underpins its bustling commercial industry, which has allowed it to become a key source of supply for a number of large foreign industrial producers, including Boeing. Bringing these capabilities and capacities to collaborative efforts could give Japanese industry market access while helping U.S. firms overcome their own limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 2: Modular open systems provide a framework for cooperation on codevelopment and coproduction, but current U.S. policy and industrial regimes do not tap into the full potential this architecture offers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modular open systems approaches, which allow for the incorporation of subsystems produced by different companies into standard interfaces, represent a possible means of expanding U.S.-Japan cooperation. Interviews with Japanese industry professionals conducted for this project found limited awareness of open systems approaches, however, which could be related to a lack of incentives for industry. The success of this framework is dependent on U.S. approval for technology developed and produced abroad to be incorporated into U.S. systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（15日）踏入第73日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表劉佩凝的大律師馬維騉表示，控方立場指毋須證明本案眾籌款項僅用作12.8的用槍及炸彈計劃，只需證明款項用作投擲汽油彈及破壞公共設施等恐怖主義活動。惟辯方反駁，控方沒有分析過2019年是否真的發生過恐怖主義活動。辯方反問：「警方發言人、政府、國際媒體有冇話香港好多恐怖份子？大小審訊入面，有冇話邊單係恐怖活動？有冇聽過任何人形容2019年事情係恐怖主義活動？」辯方指，2019年騷亂只是被定性為暴動，他從未聽說過政府將暴動定性為恐怖主義活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方舉例指恐怖主義活動包括911事件&quot;&gt;辯方舉例指恐怖主義活動包括911事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉佩凝的大律師馬維騉進行結案陳詞。辯方指，針對劉的控罪是「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，控方需要證明劉意圖及知悉籌得的金錢是用作進行恐怖活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bBmqLT6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表劉佩凝的大律師 馬維騉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，本案為香港首宗就《反恐條例》審訊的案件，控罪涉及恐怖主義活動，此罪並不常見。辯方舉例解釋甚麼是恐怖主義活動，包括2001年的911事件，當時阿爾蓋達組織挾持客機撞向美國的大廈；而1972年慕尼黑奧運，有巴勒斯坦激進份子挾持以色列代表團，導致十多人死亡。辯方續指，1995年奧姆真理教教主麻原彰晃指示成員在東京地鐵施放沙林毒氣；2005年倫敦地鐵爆炸案，目的是想推翻政府。辯方指，上述均為人所公認的恐怖活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方將暴動歸類為恐怖活動但從未聽過政府如此定性&quot;&gt;辯方：控方將暴動歸類為恐怖活動、但從未聽過政府如此定性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據條例，恐怖主義活動有數項要求，包括要針對人的嚴重暴力、導致財產嚴重損害、危害其他人生命，以及對公眾構成嚴重危險。而上述行為目的是為着推展政治、宗教或思想主張，並強迫政府、國際組織或威嚇公眾人士而作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，若本案12.8計劃得以付諸實行，相信沒有人會爭議這是否恐怖主義活動。但控方的立場卻指，毋須證明本案眾籌的款項只是用作12.8計劃，因投擲汽油彈、破壞公共設施亦屬恐怖主義活動，因此只需證明款項用作這些行為。控方又指，本案證據依賴「育龍」頻道的精華片段，內容包括投擲汽油彈。辯方卻認為，控方針對黃的「恐怖活動」指控一直是12.8計劃，從無提及其他活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，控方沒有分析過2019年是否真的發生過恐怖主義活動。辯方反問：「警方發言人、政府、國際媒體有冇話香港好多恐怖份子？每個禮拜都有恐怖活動？大小審訊入面，有冇話邊單係恐怖活動？有冇聽過任何人形容2019年事情係恐怖主義活動？」辯方指，2019年騷亂只是被定性為暴動，他從未聽說過有人將暴動定性為恐怖主義活動，且因此要受審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方若以2019年社會氛圍作考慮是不公道&quot;&gt;辯方：若以2019年社會氛圍作考慮，是不公道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於控方於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀不言而喻。辯方卻認為，這是絕對不可取的態度，「呢個好危險嘅思維」，因等同將法庭以外的訊息帶入案件，做法並不公道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，即使精華片段內容屬實，卻沒有證據顯示暴動屬恐怖活動。另亦沒有證據顯示理大及中大事件屬於恐怖活動。即使「育龍」頻道曾發布關於「五大訴求，缺一不可」的訊息，但辯方反駁合法示威人士亦會叫這個口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強為擔任控方證人將劉佩凝拖落水&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強為擔任控方證人，將劉佩凝「拖落水」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就污點證人黃振強，辯方批評他有很大誘因作供，即為了獲得減刑，而其供詞亦受到質疑。黃在2019年12月8日被捕後，直至2023年2月案件交付上高院，他仍維持不認罪。相隔一個月，黃被加控「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，劉亦被控同一罪名。警方於同年5月開始接見黃，其後黃去信與律政司商討認罪協議，最後選擇認罪。在協商條件下，黃更承認並非事實的事情。辯方認為，黃為了擔任控方證人，故將劉「拖落水」。他直至被捕後的3年7個月，才首次提及劉的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黃獲得律政司的豁免起訴書，但條件之一是要坦誠作供，辯方形容對黃而言「等同佢頭上嘅一把刀」、「睇吓佢乖唔乖」。辯方亦質疑，黃的證供並不可信、「大話連篇」，不應照單全收，「將事實真相舞弄喺手掌之中嘅人，我哋畀幾多信任佢？」辯方強調，不能以黃認罪這個因素，來考慮劉是否有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方沒有證據劉看過屠龍精華片段&quot;&gt;辯方：沒有證據劉看過「屠龍」精華片段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就證供方面，辯方指控方必須證明劉有意圖或知悉黃振強將錢用作恐怖主義活動。控方指，劉得悉「育龍」頻道上的「屠龍」精華片段。但辯方反駁，沒有證據劉有看過上述片段。另外，黃在「育龍」成立後，沒有再參與示威行動，除了中大事件。辯方又指，黃只是將資金用作賭波，其紓壓的解釋亦站不住腳。他亦不肯將錢分給「出生入死嘅朋友」，亦拒提供10萬資金予「國難中醫」。辯方又指，黃與劉相識僅一個小時，黃就向劉表示要錢買槍，劉並不知道黃是否「講真」，而實際上黃沒有買槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方劉只是兼職會計文員妹老細叫佢做咩都做&quot;&gt;辯方：劉只是「兼職會計文員妹」、「老細叫佢做咩都做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再指，當黃向劉表示將會有大行動後，劉傳送掩面的表情符號。辯方指其意思是「冇眼睇」，因黃的說法虛無縹緲，兼「都唔知噏乜」。辯方指，黃聲稱曾與劉通電話，向她交代「屠龍」在大行動中會配合其他隊伍，並著她加緊眾籌力度，以準備「走佬Plan」。辯方認為黃實際是「看圖作故事」。辯方指，劉案發時為年僅20歲的「小女孩」，並對黃言聽計從。辯方總結，劉只是一個「兼職會計文員妹」，「老細叫佢做咩都做，佢冇人工收添㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方一度哽咽感謝陪審團專注聆聽&quot;&gt;辯方一度哽咽感謝陪審團專注聆聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，對劉而言公正、公義及公平的裁決，是被判無罪。辯方一度哽咽對陪審團說：「呢滴眼淚唔係關於劉佩凝嘅，而係見到你哋咁細心、聚焦、專注聽我嘅陳詞，我更加覺得感動，令我嗚咽。」他補充，陪審團制度是很多國家仍然採用的制度，「係一個好好嘅制度」，全靠市民願意犧牲時間，良好的司法程序才得以保存，「如果個個都話唔做，可能第日冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（16日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（14日）踏入第72日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第六被告許湛榮的大律師陳偉彥指，許在串謀形成前已退出，控方針對許的證供「空洞無物」，不足以證明他有罪；但控方仍然堅持檢控，實屬不公，只是「有殺錯，冇放過」。控方又屢向陪審團表示「交畀你哋諗」，辯方認為實際目的是「拋個波畀你哋」，並引《聖經》故事為例子，指負責審判耶穌的羅馬官員彼拉多，明知耶穌無罪但不將他釋放，反而推卸責任，「任由民眾將耶穌送死」、「美其名交畀民眾決定」，上述例子與本案有「異曲同工」之處。辯方希望陪審團判無罪，並引用馬丁路德金的名言：「Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.」，又指「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義，不過遲到好過冇到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方針對許湛榮的證供空洞無物&quot;&gt;辯方：控方針對許湛榮的證供空洞無物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第六被告許湛榮的大律師陳偉彥進行結案陳詞。辯方指，控方針對許湛榮的證供「空洞無物」、「薄如蟬翼」，遠遠不足以證明許有罪，並強調：「控方舉證失敗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許在串謀成形前已退出&quot;&gt;辯方：許在串謀成形前已退出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，許在本案串謀協議成形之前已經退出，即「Left Before the Plan」，辯方以簡稱「LBP（Low Back Pain）」協助陪審團記憶。因此，許應該是無罪。辯方認為，控方模糊化協議成形的時間及內容。辯方希望陪審團以「3個W」考慮本案的串謀協議，即「What（何事）」、「When（何時）」及「Who（何人）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方解釋，本案的串謀協議是計劃在12月8日的民陣遊行途中放置炸彈。而協議是在計劃前的5天、即12月3日才成形，據證人黃振強的證供，吳當日透露計劃落實於12月8日執行。但當日許並不在場，因此他不知悉計劃。辯方指，控方沒有證據證明許在12月3日之後有參與過串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方不應將許歸為吳智鴻團隊即使好友亦唔係佢條蟲&quot;&gt;辯方：控方不應將許歸為吳智鴻團隊、即使好友亦「唔係佢條蟲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方將許歸納為吳智鴻的團隊，並指吳一方早於7月表示要找鄉黑「覆桌」，於10月已經有殺警察的「思維」，因他們曾討論打算在10.1遊行用真槍及炸彈攻擊警察，但最後煞停。辯方批評，控方的基礎是「荒天下之大謬」，因上述兩事件均與本案串謀無關，而且許當時並不在場，故此不知情。辯方質疑：「咁樣入佢數，公唔公道呀？」，並指控方一直模稜兩可，未能清楚說出串謀協議在何時成形。辯方認為，實際上根本沒有任何串謀協議，「因為佢哋（控方）知道冇任何串謀成形，梗係唔會認啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又批評，控方一直將許歸納為吳智鴻的團隊，「用呢個概念將所有人歸成兩邊」，但辯方希望陪審團獨立考慮針對許的證據，而「唔好好似控方咁鬆散、求其」。辯方強調，雖然許是吳的好友，但「唔係佢心入面條蟲」，因此不代表許知道吳參與「咁激進瘋狂嘅串謀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方做法是有殺錯冇放過&quot;&gt;辯方：控方做法是「有殺錯冇放過」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，吳獨自安排不同事情，故「好多嘢都係得佢知」。而控方卻含糊其詞、魚目混珠，將許及吳歸納成同一隊人，辯方形容其做法是「一竹篙打沉一船人，寧枉勿縱，有殺錯冇放過」。辯方強調，彭軍壕身為吳智鴻的「左右手」，作供時卻沒有提及許在行動中的角色及分工。另根據彭的證供，許在11月17日之後「消失咗」。辯方認為，彭是有動機指證被告的「污點證人」，但他卻不敢表明許是參與串謀者之一，因此這是最直接及最強的證據，證明許並非串謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指根據對話紀錄，有人曾問「群組入面有冇邊個唔可以知道最新訊息，榮係其中一個」。辯方指，這顯示許被排除在外，他根本不是串謀者，因此不能知道最新消息。辯方又指，有證據顯示許對吳的計劃並不知情，因許在吳被捕之後，發訊息指「認真，我個人唔係好信嗰把係真槍，我覺得一係改大咗嘅氣槍，一係一把閹槍」。辯方反問：「當大家一直話真槍，點解大行動佢（許）仲覺得係講笑，唔係真槍？」辯方強調，許根本不相信名校出身的中學同學兼好友，「夠膽死用真槍殺警察」，這再次顯示許並非串謀一份子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許得知吳有真槍後刻意疏離&quot;&gt;辯方：許得知吳有真槍後刻意疏離&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，許湛榮在參與西貢行山試槍後，拒絕與吳智鴻聯絡。辯方認為，可以想像許首次見到真槍及炸彈等危險品後，拒絕參與兼決定不與吳再有交集，因此刻意疏離並消失。控方指，吳於12月7日在香港華仁書院組裝炸彈時，兩度致電許，但許卻拒接電話。辯方認為，許明顯刻意不接聽，進一步顯示在行山之後，他刻意不與吳有交集。辯方提到，既然兩人都是「華仁仔」兼好友，許理應是協助組裝炸彈的「最佳人選」，但吳並沒有這樣做，「點解唔係揀信任嘅好朋友？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦提到，警方即使「地氈式搜證」，亦未能在閉路電視找到許的身影。辯方強調：「如果許湛榮一心想參與串謀，必然會出現喺準備行動之中，唔會完全消失。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方針對許的其他證供，包括許曾參與台灣軍訓，辯方指不能因此推論他有參與大行動。而且許亦沒有加入與其他被告商討迫政府妥協，顯示他並非激進份子。另一證據是警方在吳住所找到有許指紋的地圖，因此可推論許在行山之前曾與吳視察路線。辯方則反駁，沒有證據證明指紋何時出現，因指紋沒有時間指向性；再加上地圖上有其他人的指紋，證明有很多人接觸過。辯方強調，上述證據沒有價值，這正正突顯控方對許方面案情的絕望，陪審團不能由此推論許有份計劃行山路線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項控方提出的證據是，在吳被捕之後數小時，許在「台灣按摩旅行團」群組發訊息表示「清嘢」。辯方反駁，據吳電話的紀錄顯示，許在發訊息前已退出群組，因此許可能是得悉吳被捕後，為免被其他人牽連而重返群組，並作出提醒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許被捕後獲保釋但無離港因相信自己無辜&quot;&gt;辯方：許被捕後獲保釋但無離港、因相信自己無辜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後指，許在吳被捕後沒有離港，事隔一個多月至2020年1月8日，許亦被捕。辯方強調：「殺警察指控咁嚴重，如果佢有份，做乜嘢留喺度博拉？」另外，許在被捕後曾獲保釋，但他一直沒有離港，相隔1年3個月才被起訴，為本案最後一人被起訴。辯方反問：「如果真係有份串謀殺警察，可以走的話，會唔會真係留喺度？」辯方強調，許真的相信自己無辜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方盲目起訴許屬不公檢控&quot;&gt;辯方：控方盲目起訴許、屬不公檢控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提到，控方是「盲目起訴」許湛榮，是次檢控屬不公正。辯方指，由案發至今已達5年，控方在開審前一早閱畢所有文件，心知證據「幾多斤兩」，而許只是「局外人」。但控方仍堅持盲目起訴無辜的許，或有可能是同案其他被告棄保潛逃，因此才選擇起訴許。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方明知證據不足-卻不撤控&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方明知證據不足 卻不撤控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述律政司的《檢控守則》，其中一項為「檢控人員的角色及職務」，提到「檢控人員代表社會，行事不偏不倚，負責秉行公義。為此，檢控人員必須公正客觀地協助法庭找出真相，於社會與被控告之間，依法秉公行義」。至於另一項則關於「覆核和停止檢控」，提及「檢控人員有責任持續覆核已展開的檢控工作。隨著情況有變，假如在任何階段重新應用檢控驗證標準而顯示有關證據不再足以確保有合理機會達至定罪，或繼續進行檢控不會符合社會公義，便應停止檢控」。辯方續指，控方證據顯示許沒有參與本案串謀，「點解唔申請撤回對許湛榮嘅控罪，終止檢控？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方拋個波予陪審團與彼拉多要求民眾審判耶穌相似&quot;&gt;辯方：控方「拋個波」予陪審團、與彼拉多要求民眾審判耶穌相似&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方認為，控方在結案陳詞多次向陪審團表示「交畀你哋諗」，實際目的是「拋個波畀你哋」。辯方又引用《聖經》故事作為例子，指負責審判耶穌的羅馬官員彼拉多（Pontius Pilate），明知道耶穌無罪但不將他釋放，而「任由民眾將耶穌送死」。辯方形容，彼拉多「美其名交畀民眾決定」，實質上只是「wash their hands of」，即推卸責任。辯方補充：「我唔係話許湛榮係耶穌，但係係咪同樣推卸責任、有異曲同工嘅地方？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許坐住監等審訊人生被摧毀&quot;&gt;辯方：許「坐住監等審訊」、人生被摧毀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方重申，刑事案件的舉證標準極為嚴格，必須達至毫無合理疑點，以「保護各位不會被錯誤不公檢控之下，無辜受罪」。辯方指，控方沒有可能在毫無合理疑點下證明許有罪，而許沒有案底、年僅二十多歲，但卻「坐住監等審訊，白白浪費青春，冇人賠畀佢」。辯方強調：「無理控告摧毀佢哋嘅人生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義不過遲到好過冇到&quot;&gt;辯方：「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義，不過遲到好過冇到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後引用馬丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）的名言：「Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.」辯方對陪審團指：「控方唔公正起訴許湛榮，同樣可以起訴各位嘅親人、朋友、摯愛」、「唔好對不公視而不見，聽而不聞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，刑事法的金科玉律提到「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義」，但補充：「不過遲到好過冇到」，「如果你哋還佢公義、自由，我依然衷心感謝你哋。」辯方指，基於疑點利益歸於被告下，許應該被判無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳偉彥完成陳詞，案件明（15日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指賴振邦「踢保」後無離港、證明無辜 又指「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IrNRF4o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（13日）踏入第71日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第五被告賴振邦的大律師是香媛指，賴在「3C 維修工作室」工作，雖然店舖是「黃店」並貼有「文宣」，但辯方強調：「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警。」辯方提醒陪審團考慮案情時，撇開賴的政治理念。辯方又指，涉案電話並非屬於賴，控方依賴電話有其生活照就確立推論，基礎十分牽強。對於「污點證人」彭軍壕指賴振邦別名為「Bobby」，而電話通訊紀錄顯示曾發訊息自稱「Bobby」。辯方反駁這是普通名字：「電視藝人歐陽震華都叫 Bobby，任何人都可以用。」辯方亦指，警員即使迫賴喝「滴露」，亦未能得到其招認，因此找彭協助將行為編派在賴身上。辯方最後指，賴振邦「踢保」後無離港，證明他是無辜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴的電話維修工作室為黃店但思想係黃唔代表會殺警&quot;&gt;辯方：賴的電話維修工作室為「黃店」、但「思想係黃唔代表會殺警」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第五被告賴振邦的大律師是香媛進行結案陳詞。辯方強調，賴振邦並沒有參與本案串謀。據早前證供透露，賴於2020年1月在位於香港工業中心的「3C 維修工作室」被捕。辯方描述警方拍攝的照片指，工作室門外寫明「10分鐘特快維修」、「破解密碼鎖」、「修復資料」，同時亦貼有2019年社會運動的「文宣」，明顯是俗稱的「黃店」。至於店內則有嬰兒圍欄，辯方指這證明不止賴一人出入工作室。辯方指，賴有胞姊，而姊夫為張堅順，他同涉本案曾經被捕。辯方強調，即使有政治理念亦不代表會做涉案行為，「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警。」辯方提醒陪審團考慮案情時，撇開賴的政治理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方電話並非屬於賴警方沒有查問過&quot;&gt;辯方：電話並非屬於賴、警方沒有查問過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方證據指警方在「3C 維修工作室」檢獲的 iPhone 8 Plus 電話，必然屬於賴振邦。電話內經復原的 Telegram 程式顯示，已登入用戶名稱「接完紙鶴未？」，這用戶為「行山討論區」的成員之一。至於「Google Maps」則登入了賴的帳戶。辯方則指，電話並不屬於賴，他並非唯一使用者；而帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」亦不是由賴使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，店舖內擺放多部電話，涉案電話「只不過係工作枱上，芸芸眾多電話嘅其中一部」，該電話是唯一毋須密碼開啟。賴沒有作出招認表示電話屬他。辯方認為，警方得悉本案牽涉 Telegram 訊息，而到場其中一個目標是要檢取電話。不過警方並沒有查問哪一電話屬於賴，辯方質疑，警員「只要搵到一部電話與案有關，就會話屬於賴振邦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方以電話有個人照判斷電話屬賴基礎非常牽強&quot;&gt;辯方：以電話有個人照判斷電話屬賴、基礎非常牽強&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;負責檢取電話的警員供稱，曾打開涉案電話查看相簿，發現部分是賴的生活照。辯方卻指，電話其中一個已登入的 Apple ID 屬賴，因此照片可能是從另一部電話經過 iCloud 同步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，該警員在查看前沒有獲上司批准，事後沒有記錄在記事冊，亦無匯報上級，「係咪可以信呢？」辯方另質疑，警員為了掩飾故虛構有向賴查問。辯方又指，電話內的炸彈相片來自吳智鴻，並非由涉案電話拍攝。辯方強調，控方以個人照片來判斷電話擁有人是賴，此基礎非常牽強。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方bobby屬普通名字電視藝人歐陽震華也用&quot;&gt;辯方：「Bobby」屬普通名字、電視藝人歐陽震華也用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「污點證人」、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕，指賴振邦別名為「Bobby」；而電話內的「Line」程式中，曾發訊息指：「Hi I am Bobby」。但辯方立場指「Bobby」並不是賴，「Bobby 係好普通嘅名，電視藝人歐陽震華都叫 Bobby，任何人都可以用。」辯方總結，控方未能在毫無合理疑點下，證明賴是電話的唯一使用者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員檢取店內4萬資金目的阻黃店運作&quot;&gt;辯方：警員檢取店內4萬資金、目的阻「黃店」運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，警員在店內檢取4萬多元現金，明顯是店舖的營運資金及收入。辯方質疑，沒有證據顯示金錢與案有關，而警方目的是要阻礙「黃店」運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕逢大必縮遇到大事就會撇清關係&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕「逢大必縮」、遇到大事就會撇清關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後批評本案「污點證人」、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕。辯方指，彭為本案年紀最大的被告，案發時33歲及無業，其父親為警署警長。辯方強調，彭在本案中「逢大必縮」，每當遇到「大件事」，就會撇清關係並指與自己無關。另外，彭作供時「選擇性記憶」，他在細節上記得清楚，但被問及重要的事就表示不記得。辯方批評，彭作供期間亦經常背誦關鍵詞、在邏輯上表現混亂，內容亦自相矛盾，「一方面講到自己好叻，但係大件事就話唔關佢事，推落人哋到，自己只係睇，冇參與。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，從彭的證供可見吳智鴻與彭志同道合，吳想為7.21元朗事件復仇時，第一個是找彭。辯方認為彭是吳的左右手。但當彭參與示威活動時，則僅僅旁觀，並無親自行動。另外，彭有些說法並非屬實，例如他說在 Red MR 的會面中有交代台灣軍訓日期，但紀錄顯示當時尚未決定好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，在台灣宿舍期間聽到吳及賴談論要進行破壞「迫政府妥協」，辯方卻質疑屬彭虛構：「呢幾個字係咪好文雅？啲人講嘅時候會唔會用呢啲字眼呢？」，「點解咁啱次次都畀佢聽到呢啲咁嘅內容？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭曾供稱，自己於10月3日與吳、賴及許湛榮到灣仔「卓軒旅舍」打算投擲鏹水彈。辯方質疑沒有任何證供支持彭的說法，「又係得佢把口講。」而對話紀錄亦無顯示吳邀請其他成員參與。彭表示各人打算投擲時，自己則「落街買嘢食」。辯方質疑彭的說法不合邏輯：「去到重要時刻，點解會落街買嘢食？掟完先食又得嘅啫！又要作到無自己份。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭另稱，於11月14日與賴到城大及浸大的實驗室「爆 Lab」，但對話顯示由彭率先問誰人會參與。彭早前指，在被捕後抱「僥倖心理」，因此部分說法並非事實全部。辯方卻反駁，彭既然明知自己「走唔甩」，亦打算認罪，為何仍會抱着這個心理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭想拉人落水減低自己參與性&quot;&gt;辯方：彭想拉人落水、減低自己參與性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭證供透露，他與賴等人有參與11月16日晚的西貢行山試槍。惟彭卻強調自己負責「睇水」，沒有親自「落手落腳」。辯方質疑彭再次塑造出自己無份參與大事，「次次都係負責睇。」辯方亦指出，當日環境昏暗加上各人蒙面，而且沒有太多對話，因此彭未能確定參與者身份，他只是虛構賴有出席，目的「想拉人落水，盡量減低自己嘅參與性」。辯方最後指，若然如控方所言，賴有份參與行山，為何會容許其他參與者用電話拍攝並留下定位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴並非製造炸彈者&quot;&gt;辯方：賴並非製造炸彈者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的證供提及，賴負責製作炸彈及引爆器，但辯方強調根本沒有證據支持，實質彭「佢一個人鍾意講乜就講乜」。辯方補充，吳曾向被指為賴振邦的用戶表示：「我個炸彈佬要用」，這顯示賴並非製造炸彈的人。辯方重申，彭只是將其他人的行為放在賴身上。彭亦稱曾到「3C 維修工作室」的後樓梯進行「試爆」，在場人士包括賴，而自己只是旁觀角色。辯方質疑：「去到重要時刻，如果佢淨係去睇，使乜帶埋佢去？佢嘅作用係咩啫？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警方即使迫喝滴露賴亦拒招認故找彭協助虛構&quot;&gt;辯方：警方即使迫喝「滴露」賴亦拒招認、故找彭協助虛構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，12月3日在荃灣酒吧內各人會面討論大計劃，在場的包括賴。閉路電視拍攝到賴出現。黃振強供稱，賴當時在酒吧內表示有閉路電視，要求各人不要討論計劃。辯方強調，賴沒有說過上述說話，亦無從猜測他有說過。辯方又指，不想揣測黃是否在警方探訪後改變證供。辯方亦強調，黃的證供顯示4名涉計劃的「首腦」已在「松記糖水」傾談好，因此毋須再次討論。辯方反問，既然彭想塑造成賴是小心謹慎的人，為何他會不設置電話密碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的證供提到，賴於12月8日應吳的要求拿電池盒到香港華仁書院協助製作炸彈。但辯方質疑，吳只是開始製作炸彈不久，為何電池盒如此快溶掉。對於控方指閉路電視並非360全角度，因此未能拍攝到賴在場，辯方質疑說法不合理：「冇就係冇，點能夠話有去不過影唔到。」辯方又指，在場的煙頭及擺放炸彈的背包，只驗出彭及吳的 DNA。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，彭在被捕後的供詞完全沒有提及過賴振邦的名字，直至警員向彭表示賴即是「Bobby」，他才知道。辯方認為，警員即使迫賴喝「滴露」，也未能得到賴的招認，因此最後找彭協助，「將 Bobby 做嘅嘢編派喺賴振邦身上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴振邦踢保後無離港證明無辜&quot;&gt;辯方：賴振邦「踢保」後無離港、證明無辜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，控方表明吳一方在9月30日的皇后街會議後，已經對用槍及炸彈襲擊警察有「思維」。惟辯方強調，思維與串謀是「兩碼子嘅事」。而賴並沒有參與上述會議，控方亦無提出賴何時加入串謀。另外，辯方指吳一方沒有在群組交代12.8計劃之目的及執行形式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，賴於2020年1月17日首次被捕，2日後獲保釋外出，同年6月16日獲警方批准毋須再擔保，直至9月他再次被捕。辯方指賴在6月後其實可隨時離港，但由於他是無辜，所以才繼續坦蕩蕩留港工作：「如果賴振邦真係控方所指嘅人，點會唔走佬？點會留喺香港等人拉啫？」辯方又指，警方在首次拘捕後已檢取賴的電話，若他知道電話內容對自己不利，就會選擇離港。辯方希望陪審團裁定賴罪名不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（14日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold War military bases frequently displayed the quote “Our Job in Peace is to Prepare for War”, reminding people that the peacetime role of the armed forces was to be ready for war. Hardly a new idea, variations on the theme appear in Sun Tzu, Clausewitz and in Vegetius’ famous dictum “si vis pacem, para bellum”. The connection between training and war is well established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At RUSI’s Land Warfare Conference 2024, the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) argued for more productive armed forces, and endorsed the new Chief of the General Staff’s ambition to increase the lethality of the Army. The Strategic Defence Review must consider these issues, alongside the size of the Defence budget needed to deliver the stated ambitions. And while many of the headlines will be focused on the physical elements of capability – the people, equipment and stockpiles – capability is more. In Ukraine, Russia’s numerical superiority in people and equipment has not delivered the quick victory it hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence describes capability as a function of many factors, encapsulated in the acronym TEPIDOIL. There is a reason that Training comes ahead of Equipment, People, Information, Doctrine, Organisation, Infrastructure and Logistics: it is the glue that binds the other elements and gives the force its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training (and education) not only coheres the elements of capability, but also connects the three components of fighting power. It ensures that the physical component can be used to the full, enhances the conceptual component, and underpins the moral component by building and sustaining trust and people’s willingness to fight for each other. Collective training forges strong and integrated units, Services and alliances. Just as capability is more than equipment, so too is interoperability – the ability to exchange data and cue each other’s sensors and shooters still requires people to cooperate, and human interoperability is founded on trust, which requires shared experience. Training, therefore, needs to be an integral element of the Defence Review and not the Cinderella function to be ignored in favour of its more glamorous sisters such as air and missile defences, artillery, cyber and digital backbones. Nor can training be confined to a human resources analysis independent of operational requirements, which the Strategic Defence Review’s terms of reference might suggest is how it is seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite renewed focus on training – the Royal Navy’s collaborative synthetic training that connects Portsmouth to the US Navy in Norfolk or San Diego, the Army’s Collective Training Transformation Programme and the RAF’s aggressor training, together with a more dynamic exercise programme in recent years, including through NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force – there are concerns that the current approach to training in the UK is outdated. While many of the issues impacting individual training are well known, collective training does not adequately prepare the forces for state-based conflicts, despite it being almost a decade since the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) which described a resurgence in state-based threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The content of training must change to reflect the threats and experience of recent wars, and this is currently not responsive enough&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commentary highlights a potential tension in the desire for enhanced productivity and preparing the armed forces for war, before considering four issues that impact on collective training’s ability to meet threats: capacity; the scale at which training takes place; the content, including questions about risk; and funding. So, while there is much that is positive about collective training and exercising, there are challenges that the Strategic Defence Review team should address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-productivity-gap&quot;&gt;A Productivity Gap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having productive armed forces is important, but the yardstick against which productivity is measured is crucial. Productivity generally concerns how much input is required to produce a given output; how the output is defined is therefore crucial. If the measure is how much use is made of the armed forces in delivering routine peacetime activity that shows an immediate return against the Defence budget – greater equipment availability from the same fleet with fewer people, or military aid to the civil authorities – these tasks will be prioritised, even if the forces have less time to train to win the wars they may be called on to fight. If the job (output) of the armed forces in peace is to prepare for war, this is a different measure of productivity, one that is hard to gauge in advance, but which may require training for war to be prioritised above the forces’ routine use. However, it would be unrealistic to think that the defence budget should only fund the armed forces as a break-glass emergency capability; they must add value short of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice is not binary: credible, lethal armed forces can deter many adversaries, where they have the right type and volume of equipment that can be used to the full through realistic and demanding training. Where that training is conducted can have deterrent and reassurance effects, so whether the British Army Training Unit in Suffield, Canada (BATUS) is the right location for a European threat is worth consideration. BATUS offers permissive land and air space for large-scale training – including for the use of drones – that is hard to find in Europe, but is a long way from the potential fight, so there is a judgement between training value and deterrent effect. However, if technology can help coordinate live and virtual forces dispersed across multiple European training areas, Defence could step between the horns of that dilemma. And, if the definition of productivity as routine use is adopted, deterring adversaries and reassuring allies through practised interoperability in the likely theatre of operations makes an immediate contribution to outputs which should be just as legitimate as sending small training teams around the world, or providing military aid to the civil authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology, through simulation, also enhances productivity by reducing the use of physical equipment, increasing its life (for example, fewer live flying or sea hours allowing more of a fleet to be operational) and reducing the need for fuel, spare parts and maintenance. However, those who fuel or service the equipment (or people) also need to be trained for wartime conditions, and industry may depend on repeat orders of parts to keep production lines and supply chains open; simulation is therefore not the complete answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capacity-constrained&quot;&gt;Capacity Constrained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of the individual and collective training systems is heavily constrained, both in the number of training places and the estate. The military flying training system’s problems are well-known, but capacity elsewhere has been “optimised” for the force size and requirements described in the 2015 SDSR, as adjusted by the Army cuts in the 2021 Defence Command Paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With training capacity already matched to small armed forces with a commensurately limited throughput, the situation will be worse if the Strategic Defence Review concludes – as it should – that numbers must increase. This will be a particular issue for the Reserves in the event of mobilisation. One deduction may be to give the volunteer reserve a role in training for mobilisation, creating a nucleus of trainers who can prepare the second and subsequent echelons, expanding capacity quickly when required. The way Reserves were involved in training the Ukrainian armed forces under Operation Interflex offers a potential template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another capacity constraint is the ability to release people or units for training. Justin Bronk observes that in several NATO air forces (including the RAF), pilots and engineers are overstretched by concurrent requirements for maintaining basic flying currency, major exercises and operational deployments. Consequently, many non-US NATO air forces cannot conduct the large-scale complex training sorties necessary to regenerate the skills needed for high-intensity missions. Similarly, the Royal Navy’s small fleet is regularly bounced between deployment and rigorous training packages, leaving little time for rest or maintenance, which contributes to retention and serviceability challenges across the fleet. Armed forces busy doing today’s tasks cannot be preparing properly for tomorrow’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;size-matters&quot;&gt;Size Matters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant weakness in UK collective training is its scale. At the Land Warfare Conference, Major General Mark Pullan described NATO’s aspiration for Corps-level training, which significantly exceeds the UK’s current training effort that often takes place below brigade level. Similarly, in the maritime and air domains, collective training and exercises often focus on small formations, not the larger ones that would be needed in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology could expand the ability to generate scale by combining live and virtual assets: the synthetic training system Gladiator – used by the RAF and the Australian, Canadian and US Air Forces – and the Advanced Tactical Augmented Reality Systems are good examples. Expanding the ability to connect all domains to such systems would also help training and exercise scheduling, enabling virtual participation with or from other Services or partners. This could overcome the limitation of platform numbers – for example, as the British Army expands its ground-based air defence capabilities, not having to wait for the RAF to provide a fast jet or drone might allow for more responsive, assured and predictable training. And something in the vein of a simulation Red Flag-like exercise (Sim Flag) could contribute to interoperability and mass without the high cost and lengthy planning involved in physical exercises. However, technology is not a complete replacement for live training – simulating the aggregate friction inherent in large-scale operations is still difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;train-hard-fight-easy&quot;&gt;Train Hard, Fight Easy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content of training must change to reflect the threats and experience of recent wars, and this is currently not responsive enough. Speakers on the multi-domain integration panel at the Land Warfare Conference highlighted how the design of many exercises and collective training remains rather traditional across the maritime, land and air domains. The modern battlefield’s ubiquitous intelligence gathering, swarming drones, unconventional weapons (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) and fast-adapting electromagnetic environment that undermines the ability to integrate forces are absent from too many exercises, and rarely present in combination. Moreover, with a primary focus on the learning benefit to combat forces, the logistics elements are often underplayed, whether supply, medical or engineering – including wet-gap crossings – meaning the vital enablers are not tested as they would be in conflict. Exercises also assume that the force is already at war, rather than testing the transition to war, which would stress different parts of the armed forces and society. Similarly, exercises often pay little, if any, attention to post-attack recovery. Greater integration of industry and partners across government is needed in exercises and collective training events to build the understanding, processes and trust that will be needed in war. And while there are examples of this, notably the Joint Expeditionary Force, it is not as common as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk is another constraint on the conduct of training. Understandably, the safety risk in training is managed closely, but whether or not the balance is right is being challenged. The Defence Safety Authority (DSA) – which “aims to reduce and ideally prevent loss of life, avoidable harm and damage to the environment” – discharges its responsibilities seriously, but this can lead to a preference for risk that is “as low as reasonably practicable”. Whether the DSA and the wider legislative framework that impacts on the armed forces’ training for war are calibrated correctly should form part of the thinking during, or be tasked as subsequent work by, the Strategic Defence Review team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitudes to operational risk also need review. Those playing the adversary need relevant capabilities, whether as organic functions – such as the US Air Force aggressor squadrons – or contracted capabilities such as Draken who support the RAF. This requires not only financial but also intellectual investment to understand how an adversary might fight you – not just how they have fought against others – and how to defeat them. This in turn requires a willingness, even an enthusiasm, to fail. But with few opportunities for collective training, unit commanders are disincentivised to be radical for fear that their only exercise report in command will indicate they did not pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The question of training is fundamentally one of the Defence mindset, and the Strategic Defence Review needs to help Defence reset how it thinks and acts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology can expand access to training, allow for experimentation, and confine the risk of death or injury to avatars in the virtual world. Moreover, the simulated/augmented reality environment may be the only place certain capabilities such as cyber attack, urban operations in cities and F35s can be tested without providing an adversary with intelligence on the extent of one’s capabilities, or for practical reasons. And while the temptation may be to invest in the front-end virtual/augmented reality systems, Defence needs the foundations to allow single Service systems to integrate, nationally and with key allies. Ideally, standards for technical architectures, acquisition and data would operate at the NATO level, but UK Strategic Command’s Integration Design Authority has an important role to play, and it needs to be enabled to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secure-funding&quot;&gt;Secure Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training is expensive, and funding represents a critical challenge. The money comes from in-year running costs – the resource departmental expenditure limit (RDEL) – (which is often overcommitted, frequently resulting in cuts to activity, including training. Moreover, while RDEL savings will impact on the regular component, they pose greater risks to the operational effectiveness of the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predictability of funding over many years is hugely important for effective exercise planning, especially given the need to exercise at greater scale and with allies and partners whose own planning needs to be considered. A financial settlement that moves to the promised 2.5% of GDP, but that ties that growth to capital expenditure or specific RDEL elements, such as pension contributions – as happened under the last government’s 2019 spending review – or the new government’s pay award, which requires some of the 6% pay rise to be found by reprioritisation and savings, could leave training funding vulnerable. An option might be to protect the exercise budget by ringfencing the funding settlement, providing predictability for planners, both UK and allied. While this constrains budget flexibility, which is generally undesirable, it may be essential in protecting the capacity to train meaningfully. And while large-scale exercises are costly in both money and time, in Peter Drucker’s memorable words, “if you think training is expensive, try ignorance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of training is fundamentally one of the Defence mindset, and the Strategic Defence Review needs to help Defence reset how it thinks and acts – an approach to preparing for war that avoids risk, prioritises routine activity over large-scale preparation for conflict and sees training as a cost to be reduced is not one that will deliver lethal, battle-winning forces that could prevent war by deterring those who would do us harm. With many of the constraints impacting on training and exercises, investing in technology in a more systematic and coordinated way could compensate for the limitations the forces are operating under, and raise their readiness to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidly increasing lethality is most likely to be achieved through more effective use of what is currently available; the equipment and people are important, but training is as important for coalescing the components of capability and making them more than the sum of their individual parts. The Strategic Defence Review, therefore, must ensure that when decisions are made about the capabilities the forces need, the requirement for access to realistic, demanding and predictably funded training is secured. If the job of armed forces in peacetime is to prepare for war, this will also deliver CDS’s demand for enhanced productivity, perhaps more so than their use in delivering peacetime services to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：李家田視「屠龍」為「飲飲食食群組」、被警員「打嚇氹」後才招認&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/F9ce4iY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（12日）踏入第70日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第四被告李家田的大律師林芷瑩表示，李加入「屠龍」是希望訪問隊員及「攞錢」，對於當時經濟環境不佳、戶口僅剩個位數的李而言，他因有人資助「飲飲食食」而逗留隊內，李實際上是參與「飲飲食食嘅群組」。辯方指，只有黃振強及吳智鴻等知道大計劃，而被告則蒙在鼓裡，「你有你 plan，我有我打算，黐飲黐食。」辯方另指，李在家中廁所被警員「打嚇氹」之下，才作出招認，而控方未能解釋其中一個「謎團」，就是為何重點搜查隊沒有搜查廁所。雖然涉事警員否認，但辯方強調：「冇人會認自己打過人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田加入屠龍為有錢攞認為自己參與飲飲食食群組&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田加入「屠龍」為「有錢攞」、認為自己參與「飲飲食食群組」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第四被告李家田的大律師林芷瑩進行結案陳詞。證供顯示，李家田是「屠龍」成員，他曾加入 Telegram 群組「滅龍」並參與對話；至於「皇馬龍利號」群組，李則已經退出。辯方指，不能以被告等人經常去暴動現場，而推論他們必然會參與本案的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何李家田會加入「屠龍」，辯方指他並非真的想加入本案的串謀，只是他對社會事件有興趣，並因在浸大修讀電影高級文憑課程，於是到暴動現場搜集資料及拍攝片段，同時希望訪問「屠龍」。辯方指，李加入「屠龍」的另一原因是「有錢攞」，對於當時經濟環境不佳、戶口僅剩個位數、「唔夠錢洗」的李而言，有人資助他「飲飲食食」而令他留在隊內，絕對是可以理解，「如果咁嘅經濟狀況之下，有人畀錢你飲飲食食，你會唔會留喺呢個 group？」辯方強調，李實際上是參與「飲飲食食嘅群組」。辯方指，只有黃振強、吳智鴻及林銘皓知道槍械炸彈計劃，而被告則蒙在鼓裡，「你有你 plan，我有我打算，黐飲黐食。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田並非核心人物&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田並非核心人物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方屢質疑李為何不詢問群組訊息的意思，辯方則反駁：「用生活邏輯去諗，係咪每一樣嘢都會問到篤？」辯方強調，李家田並非核心人物，「佢喺群組係咪咁重要？」，加上李並不在「行山討論區」群組。辯方補充，李並沒有與隊員前往泰國旅行，「如果李家田係咁重要，點解成隊人唔等埋佢？」他對於隊員去了泰國亦不知情。辯方亦指，李並非在警方的監察名單當中，閉路電視亦拍攝不到李的出現。辯方質疑：「證供咪好似好弱雞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強證供不可信屬一派胡言&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強證供不可信、屬「一派胡言」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方依賴的背景證供包括，李曾參與11月16日凌晨至17日早上的西貢行山試槍，並接收吳智鴻提供的手槍，其後他參與11月17日晚的大鴻輝會議，並匯報過程。「屠龍」於11月18日開始加入本案串謀，因此控方依賴這日之後的證供，作為串謀的證據。據污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供，李有出席11月25日的荃灣三陂坊會議，以及12月5日何文田訪問後的會議，會上黃交代吳團隊會使用槍械炸彈，而「屠龍」將負責引警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方批評，黃振強的證供不可信亦不可靠，屬「一派胡言」，實際上李沒有出席上述3個會議，並多次缺席「屠龍」的會議。根據李供稱，他於11月17日晚上被困理大，根本沒有出席會議，而且當時理大遭圍封，李沒有可能離開後再進入，「警方重重包圍之下，點樣入返去呢？幾鍾意參與社會事件嘅人，都唔會想咁嘅情況被警方拘捕。」辯方又提到，證供透露吳是一個小心謹慎的人，他不會將手槍交給不認識的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強有作供動機為減刑及罪行一筆勾銷&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強有作供動機、為減刑及「罪行一筆勾銷」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方解釋，黃振強有作供動機。黃原被控5罪，成為控方證人只需承認兩罪，其餘3罪則可獲存檔法庭，當中包括最高判囚終身的「串謀謀殺」罪。另外，黃獲得豁免起訴書，內容涵蓋暴動及非法集結，可以「將佢以前干犯嘅罪行一筆勾銷」。辯方續指，如黃的口供被接納，他最高可獲50%減刑。辯方質疑：「佢會唔會作假口供指證其他人呢？一定會！」辯方又指，黃在錄影會面、無損權益口供及庭上的證供，均有眾多出入之處，部分亦不合邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕拒提供電話密碼可在法庭天花龍鳳咁講&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕拒提供電話密碼、可在法庭「天花龍鳳咁講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一污點證人、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕，辯方亦指他在作供後獲撤回「串謀謀殺」罪，因此他亦有作供動機。辯方批評，彭供稱被捕後一心打算認罪，並交代事情始末，但他在錄影會面期間卻行使緘默權，並拒絕提供電話密碼予警方。辯方質疑，沒有獨立證供支持彭的說法，因此他可以「齋噏」、「喺法庭天花龍鳳咁講」，而且令人懷疑彭所說的是謊話，加上其證供有多處前後矛盾，「可唔可以相信一個唔肯開電話嘅人嘅片面之詞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，由於警方知道針對李的證供薄弱，因此才要求彭在口供表示吳智鴻將槍交李，而彭起初並無提及此事。辯方指，這個版本是警方重組而成，務求令彭及李的說法一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田證供可信他被警員打嚇氹下才作招認&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田證供可信、他被警員「打嚇氹」下才作招認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，李家田的證供則是可信，他本人亦在庭上表示，作供目的是希望法庭能夠找出真相及還他公義。即使陪審團不信任李的證供，亦不代表控方能證明他犯罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦依賴李的招認口供，李分別作出口頭招認、記事冊上的招認，以及進行錄影會面。辯方指，李家田在家中廁所被警員「打嚇氹」之下，才作出招認。辯方指出，控方未能解釋其中一個「謎團」，就是為何重點搜查隊沒有搜查廁所。辯方指，顯而易見的是警員在廁所對李「打嚇氹」。雖然涉事警員否認，但辯方強調：「冇人會認自己打過人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方進一步指，拘捕李的警員早前亦曾拘捕黃振強，而證供顯示黃當時也受到毆打。辯方遂指：「點解同一批警員唔會做同樣嘅嘢？」辯方指，由於黃身上有傷痕，故警員改為對李使用不留痕跡的「水刑」。控方一度質疑為何李記憶清晰，他當時回應：「冇經歷就會唔明白，係性命攸關嘅狀態」，辯方又指：「佢經歷你哋不能想像、你哋冇人經歷過嘅事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，李被捕期間一直沒有見過同在家中的母親，因此不敢即時作出投訴。辯方另指，李承認對他最有害的招認，即自己曾接收吳給予的手槍。辯方質疑，李若非被打，根本毋須承認。對於控方指「肥警察好難彎腰」，辯方卻反駁：「一個人有肚腩唔代表佢唔可以打人」，並補充：「加上我唔覺得佢肥。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方招認內容並非屬實&quot;&gt;辯方：招認內容並非屬實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，李被捕時，警方已經成功檢獲涉案的3支手槍，分別從吳智鴻、摩星嶺及蘇緯軒檢到。辯方質疑，警方卻沒有就手槍向李查問。辯方另指，李沒有必要「大模廝樣」保留曾裝手槍的綠色袋在家，因這屬對他不利的證據。辯方又表示，控方沒有提出證據證明手槍上找到李的指紋。而李的招認當中，大部分是為了迎合警員而虛構的，否則，「點解李家田咁傻，要作一啲對自己不利嘅版本？」辯方強調招認內容並非屬實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員曾捏造證供不可信&quot;&gt;辯方：警員曾捏造證供、不可信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦批評，警員的證供不可信亦不可靠，有部份是謊言。辯方舉例指出，警員沒有即時向李發出羈留人士通知書，原因是不想李知道自己有找律師的權利。警員亦無應李的要求給他閱讀搜查令。辯方總結，警員對上司的訓示置之不理，沒有讓同僚搜查廁所，因他們當時在廁所毆打李。辯方又指警員曾捏造證供。當被問為何有相片顯示桌上有被指裝過手槍的綠色袋，有些相片卻沒有時；警員回應起初把手槍放在證物袋，經提醒下才記起未拍照，因此再放回桌上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後對陪審團指，希望大家細心考慮證供，「呢個公義係你哋先可以畀到佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師林芷瑩完成陳詞，案件明（13日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黃振強斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備 辯方：諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SoCUnan.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（9日）踏入第69日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第三被告嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷指，為「污點證人」的「屠龍」隊長黃振強，其證供屬「爛牌」，但由於需要證明「屠龍」有參與串謀，因此控方「冇咗呢隻牌唔得」。辯方又指，證據顯示「屠龍」成員沒有打算參與行動，因黃在群組批評隊員在行動前一日推搪表示未能協助搬運裝備。辯方質疑：「如果聽日係6月6號，諾曼第登陸，唔知你哋有冇聽過，第二次世界大戰，會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強口供屬爛牌&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強口供屬「爛牌」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第三被告嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷進行結案陳詞。辯方指，嚴沒有參與軍訓，而警方的監視名單中亦沒有嚴。辯方其後就污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供作出評價。辯方指，控方在結案陳詞階段沒有表示黃是誠實可靠的證人，「係唔記得，定唔方便講？」辯方又形容黃的口供屬於「爛牌」，但由於需要證明「屠龍」有參與串謀，因此控方「冇咗呢隻牌唔得」，否則罪責程度會有分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃有莫大誘因說出對自己有利的事情&quot;&gt;辯方：黃有莫大誘因說出對自己有利的事情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃本人卻持有3張「好牌」，有莫大的誘因說出對自己有利的事情。首先黃因作供指證隊友而獲豁免起訴「串謀謀殺」罪，其次他因獲得豁免起訴書，即使在庭上透露曾參與暴動及縱火的行為，亦不會被起訴。第三，他可因此獲得減刑。辯方形容黃作供有如「意識流」，會在不同時間調整字句。當黃被問及有否被警察打，他卻迴避地回答遭對方使用一定程度武力，辯方表示：「以為係警務處長解釋警察點解打人𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員三顧草廬探訪黃質疑他們稱心理輔導是否屬實&quot;&gt;辯方：警員三顧草廬探訪黃、質疑他們稱心理輔導是否屬實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，警員三顧草廬到羈留所拜訪還柙中的黃，警員在作供時表示，黃希望認罪，而在探訪過程中他們著黃通知律師、向他提供心理輔導，以及閒話家常。辯方指：「3個警員加埋唔知有冇10萬蚊人工，閒話家常3個鐘，有冇話畀審計署長聽？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，串謀協議需要一方提出想法，另一方真心同意及了解。根據黃的證供，他無法肯定其他隊員已經答應。辯方又指，即使有海量的 Telegram 訊息，但未能知道他們所說孰真孰假。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警方以小學畢業邏輯推論避彈衣屬嚴&quot;&gt;辯方：警方以「小學畢業邏輯」推論避彈衣屬嚴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，嚴在12月7日於安全屋被捕，警方否認將嚴按在床上。警方在嚴及張銘裕的房間內發現兩件避彈衣，並以「小學畢業邏輯」推論避彈衣屬他們。惟辯方質疑：「點解要擺兩件避彈衣？準備出擊？咁其他 Gear（裝備）呢？」警方亦搜出嚴藏有數十張餐廳及超市現金券，包括：麥當勞、肯德基、唐記包點蒸飯及百佳。辯方質疑證物與案無關，「證案喎！高等法院！喺全香港審案最高級法院，（控方）畀呢啲你哋？」他又指上述現金券，「證明咗啲咩？證明咗佢成日唔喺屋企食飯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備-辯方諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢&quot;&gt;黃斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備 辯方：諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃在群組批評隊員在行動前一日推搪，表示未能協助搬運裝備。辯方質疑：「如果聽日係6月6號，諾曼第登陸，唔知你哋有冇聽過，第二次世界大戰，會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？」辯方另指，黃供稱嚴當晚應其要求留在安全屋陪他，「咁顯示佢哋準備參加大行動咩？」辯方又指，嚴是「冷淡教友」，經常以「陪女友」為由不參與小隊活動，而且嚴並非最積極的隊員。辯方指，嚴「錯在嗰晚喺安全屋」及平日「口多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方形容黃是商業奇才&quot;&gt;辯方形容黃是「商業奇才」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指：「個個都話黃振強唔好，但係天生我才必有用，每個人都有優點，佢好似幾得到女仔歡心。」辯方形容黃是「商業奇才」，不但「喊苦喊忽叫人捐錢」，又找泰國女友為他開戶口，更有「一班傻仔幫佢跑出跑入」，「如果唔係呢個情況，可能佢喺商界有好大作用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黃在行動前一晚沒有在安全屋向隊員講解計劃，反而不斷與「閃燈隊」的 Kristy 對話。黃問 Kristy「有冇得偷走？」，對方回覆「出面凍冰冰」，黃再指「我好熱，暖吓你」。黃其後稱：「你唔驚俾佢睇到你啲 message 咩？佢喺你隔離喎」、「我真係唔想認，但係真係掛住你」。辯方質疑：「咁點解冇時間同隊友講計劃？好懷疑佢聽日係咪去打。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，黃在不同場合有不同面目，是「度身訂造的語言藝術」。他在錄影會面期間表現淡定，在庭上接受主問及盤問時則有其他態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（12日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：彭軍壕是「Police Baby」 其父親為警察、未知警方有否包庇&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y6FOLAC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（8日）踏入第68日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。辯方指「屠龍」隊長黃振強承認刻意不讓隊員知道炸彈及槍手位置的地圖，「唔講 Location，分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」，這導致隊員未能衡量自身安全，亦未能選擇是否參加。至於另一污點證人彭軍壕，辯方指他亦非誠實可靠。辯方解釋，彭一早認罪，其父親是警察，故「有冇包庇我唔知道、唔想講」。辯方又形容他是「Police baby」，「差人見到佢就閒話家常、安撫情緒。三十幾歲人喇！」辯方亦指，彭一直拒絕交出電話密碼，警方卻未有破解並擷取其電話內容，「點解唔用？我唔知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方隊員不知炸彈接近油站分分鐘自己都畀人炸死&quot;&gt;辯方：隊員不知炸彈接近油站、「分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第二被告張銘裕的大律師姚本成進行結案陳詞。辯方指，吳智鴻一方沒有要求「屠龍」成員協助製作引爆器及遙控。辯方又指，即使張曾向群組發送遙控器的照片，但不代表照片是從吳一方收到，因沒有相關紀錄，而且成員經常會將收到的資訊分享並公諸同好。辯方續指，不能因此推論張參與殺警計劃。辯方又指，「屠龍」隊長黃振強隱瞞事實，在隊員背後自行計劃在12月1日使用炸彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另指，對話顯示直至行動前兩日，有隊員仍然問將會執行哪一計劃，這顯示隊員仍然不知道計劃。辯方提到，隊員不知道行動「好大鑊」，而且後果不堪設想，導致「會死好多人」。另外，辯方引述黃承認刻意不讓隊員知道炸彈及槍手位置的地圖，只有黃、吳及槍手知道。辯方指，地圖顯示炸彈地點接近油站，但黃卻隱瞞地圖，「唔講 Location，容乜易連自己都畀人炸埋，分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」，這導致隊員未能衡量自身安全，亦未能選擇是否參加。黃在盤問下承認交由隊員自行判斷，辯方形容其說法是「你死你事」。辯方又指，黃承認未有向隊員交代行動後要離港。辯方質疑，黃沒有為隊員提供後路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強的證供可靠性是零&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強的證供可靠性是零&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，即使張在行動前一晚身處安全屋及管有避彈衣，亦不等於準備要執行大行動，因黃在行動日的凌晨才知悉行動實際內容。黃在視察路線後更沒有向隊員交代情況。辯方最後指，黃的可靠性及信用是零，其證供亦前言不對後語，不能以其證供定任何人的罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭軍壕父親為警察-辯方質疑是police-baby有冇包庇我唔知&quot;&gt;彭軍壕父親為警察 辯方質疑是「Police baby」、「有冇包庇我唔知」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一污點證人彭軍壕，辯方指他亦非誠實可靠的證人。辯方解釋，彭一早認罪，鑑於其父親是警察，故「有冇包庇我唔知道、唔想講」。辯方又形容他是「Police baby」，因此：「差人見到佢就閒話家常、安撫情緒，三十幾歲人喇！」辯方認為，彭的證供原本是用作針對吳，因彭是其「左右手」，但後來吳選擇認罪，因此其證供變為針對本案被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警察未有破解彭電話&quot;&gt;辯方：警察未有破解彭電話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，彭一直拒絕交出電話密碼，警方卻未有破解並擷取其電話內容，「點解唔用？我唔知道。點解電話內容唔畀人知呀？因為有啲嘢唔可以話畀人聽？」辯方總結，沒有證供證明張自11月18日起，在知情下參與串謀，因此唯一合理的決定就是判張無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（9日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

While it is often treated as a luxury, it builds the baseline of defence and enables a whole host of terrestrial capabilities that are essential to modern-day warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is essential to everyday life – think GPS, for example – but its equally vital role in defence is often forgotten. This is partly because, unlike the other domains, space is not immediately obvious or visible. Space is often the invisible enabler and, because it is usually operating smoothly, it is not just taken for granted, but altogether forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Defence has stated that “the vast majority of operations could not be sustained without space capabilities”. This includes several elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPS for navigation and crucial timing signals, used not only for the tracking of troops, but also for guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satellite Communications (SATCOM) for beyond line-of-sight communications (including ships and aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space-enabled intelligence (such as satellite imagery and radar information) that provides surveillance and reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is not altogether new to space and as such owns the legacy system Skynet, which provides secure SATCOM links. In other areas, however, the UK is still in the process of collating its capabilities. For example, the sovereign constellation ISTARI, intended to supplement ISR, was announced at the same time as the Defence Space Strategy in 2022, but the project launch is not planned until 2026. Often, the UK relies on other states for capabilities. For navigation, for example, the UK is entirely reliant on the US for the availability of GPS (the European version, Galileo, is no longer accessible to the UK as a result of Brexit). The UK also depends on commercial providers – for example, Babcock manages and operates the Skynet constellation. With UK sovereign space assets limited, this spells two necessities for the future: resilience, and commercial tie-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-resilience&quot;&gt;The Importance of Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has highlighted the fact that space is by no means off limits in modern conflict: the satellite-enabled internet provider Viasat experienced a cyber-attack on the morning of the invasion in February 2022. Shortly after, Starlink seemed to have been targeted via electromagnetic and cyber means. Since the Russian troops achieved their originally planned positioning, widespread GPS jamming and spoofing has been taking place, also affecting Western weapons systems such as Excalibur, HIMARS and JDAM. It is evident that disruption in the electromagnetic spectrum is to be expected in any future conflict; this could mean the limited availability, if not complete absence, of certain communications systems and navigational data. This means that resilience is required to ensure the availability of crucial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Space is often the invisible enabler and, because it is usually operating smoothly, it is not just taken for granted, but altogether forgotten&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications systems already have a PACE approach – primary, alternative, contingency and emergency – to ensure there are several layers on which to fall back. It would be useful to apply a similar thinking to space systems, especially for positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), where the UK is entirely reliant on the US GPS system. The MoD’s Space Industrial Plan included a proposal for “MoD Time” as a “system of last resort” to ensure that timing signals are available continuously. A further way to increase the resilience of space systems is the use of the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-with-the-commercial-sector&quot;&gt;Working with the Commercial Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial space sector has seen exponential growth over the past decade, in some cases outpacing the developments of sovereign space actors with its innovations. Making use of the commercial sector – by buying into already existing services, rather than procuring a sovereign asset – makes sense. This is happening to some extent already; however, the commercial sector often laments the lack of clarity for requirements and the overbearing bureaucracy of procurement processes, which are often unfit for smaller space companies. Meanwhile, the lack of communication around long-term planning and asset procurement makes it difficult for industry to plan ahead and provide services accordingly. This is despite the promise stated in the Defence Space Strategy that “defence investment through a blend of assured commercial and military grade solutions will continue to increase flexibility, adaptability, tempo, resilience and overall agility of the Armed Forces”. One solution might be found in the communication of a clear strategy that guarantees open channels of communications – similar to the US Space Force Commercial Space Strategy, which further sets out questions of increased risk for commercial companies – for instance, what happens when a commercial asset is attacked while in the service of a government actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Space Strategy outlined the concept of “own, collaborate or access” (OCA): the ways in which space services can be procured. The realisation has already set in at Space Command that perhaps the order of priority of OCA is misguided, and tie-ins with the commercial sector and allies should be prioritised more, similar to the US Space Force approach of “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must”. Clear priorities must be set in accordance with the diversity of space services and assets required – there is no “one size fits all” approach when it comes to the complex and multi-layered system of space defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-detection-of-and-response-to-space-threats&quot;&gt;The Detection of and Response to Space Threats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final consideration is the detection of and response to space threats. While we have observed non-kinetic attacks on satellites through electromagnetic and cyber countermeasures in Ukraine the UK’s competitors and adversaries are capable of further threats – not only kinetic anti-satellite weapons, but also in-orbit surveillance and potential intercepts. Russia demonstrated its capability to kinetically destroy a satellite in 2021, using a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon – a system that China tested back in 2007. Further, Russian satellites have been seen moving close to US military satellites and a joint French-Italian constellation. Whether these missions served the purpose of photographing the sensitive assets, or potentially intercepting their signals, or if they were simply activity intended to cause concern is difficult to tell. However, not all threats to satellites are of a nefarious nature: space debris does not choose its victims and neither do solar flares that can expose satellites to increased radiation and atmospheric drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lack of communication around long-term planning and asset procurement makes it difficult for industry to plan ahead and provide services accordingly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether environmental or nefarious space threats, the UK must be able to keep an eye on its own assets and their surroundings, and be able to respond to potential threats in a timely manner. With the radar facility at RAF Fylingdales, the UK receives access to the space data provided by the US, which host the most comprehensive space data collection available. It is important, however, that the UK continues to invest in its own Space Domain Awareness capabilities to improve its threat assessment processes, enabling fast and apt reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the new UK government sets its sights on a new defence review, it is evident that space can and should not be forgotten – to do so would be to undermine the very foundation on which UK defence capabilities are built. Not investing now in the ability to detect and respond to threats, as well as the resilience of space assets, risks limiting the UK’s ability to act and react in potential conflict scenarios in the future. It is important to invest now in the resilience of systems and guarantee access to systems through tie-ins with allies and commercial partners. NATO, as it builds up its space capabilities through its member states, will continue to be a crucial conduit for Western space collaboration. This, however, should not prevent the UK from looking for further like-minded allies with whom to invest in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, both in the Western and Ukrainian media, there has been a discussion about the problems associated with the recruitment of new military personnel into the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This coverage presents the current situation in a distorted form, which often does not correspond to reality and completely misdirects uninitiated and even partially initiated observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, this concerns the very facts of mobilisation in Ukraine. From the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024, changes to the Law “On Mobilisation Preparation and Mobilisation” were adopted in Ukraine, which were supposed to simplify its procedures, and were accompanied by sharp political debates regarding some of its controversial proposals. In connection with this, much speculation began to appear to the effect that Ukraine allegedly has not mobilised, and therefore is not able to provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the necessary manpower. Such assessments are incorrect and do not reflect the real problems that Ukraine is trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the protection of its sovereignty and territorial integrity – although entrusted to the Armed Forces of Ukraine – is the duty of every citizen. From the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian government decided to impose martial law and declared general mobilisation, along with a ban on men aged 18 to 60 leaving the country. Although general mobilisation was announced, this did not mean that all men were to be drafted into the Armed Forces at the same time. In accordance with procedure, general mobilisation is carried out in several waves: first, the mobilisation of the operational reserve – that is, persons who already had combat experience in the course of repelling Russian aggression in Donbas in the period after 2014 – is carried out; in the second wave, there is a mobilisation of former military personnel who did not have such combat experience; in the third wave, persons who underwent military training while studying at civilian universities are mobilised; and only then are all other persons who do not have age or health restrictions called up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The number of volunteers traditionally falls after the first year of a war, as other European countries have repeatedly experienced before – for example, during the First World War&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, the number of people willing to join the army significantly exceeded the Armed Forces’ needs, and at that time there were queues at enlistment offices. In total, as of July 2022, the Defense Forces of Ukraine numbered almost 1 million people, most of whom were mobilised. Throughout 2022 and 2023, constant mobilisation measures were carried out to replenish losses, replacing the dead and seriously wounded. These measures also did not require excessive efforts; usually, the military commanders simply sent out a significant quantity of summonses and the number of people who appeared for them was sufficient to complete the necessary reserves. Difficulties with the recruitment of new military personnel began to arise only at the end of 2023, after the Ukrainian counteroffensive was choked off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the decrease in the number of those willing to mobilise was the general awareness that the war has acquired a protracted nature – that is, it can and will last for years – as well as the lack of demobilisation mechanisms. In other words, mobilisation began to be perceived as a one-way ticket, where the only way to end service is to die or become disabled. Under such conditions, joining the army entailed a practical rejection of hopes for a normal life, destroyed families, and being forced to leave one’s profession forever. After more than two years of war and without any indication of when soldiers could be demobilised, military service began to be perceived as slavery, and not as a temporary, albeit very difficult duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, this did not change Ukrainians’ perception of the war as an existential threat, nor did it significantly reduce the country’s readiness to resist aggression, but it did reduce the number of people who are willing to join the ranks of the Armed Forces without coercion. There is nothing surprising in this, since the number of volunteers traditionally falls after the first year of a war, as other European countries have repeatedly experienced before – for example, during the First World War. With the decrease in the number of volunteers, it became clear that the system of recruiting and even registering conscripts in Ukraine was working extremely unsatisfactorily, and enlistment officers often do not even have a clear idea about where exactly potential recruits live. Mobilisation began to demand certain efforts from the government for which it was not ready, and experiments with the use of coercion in mobilisation were not always successful. The public debate about the problems facing the government has not been very helpful either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has become a pattern for Ukraine, modern technology came to the aid of the government. Understanding the military’s inability to form a single system of accounting for conscripts, the Ministry of Defense launched the mobile application “Reserve+”, in which every man could update data about his location, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as clarify his military accounting specialty, rank and state of health. In the first days of the application’s operation, more than a million reservists were registered; as of the beginning of July 2024, more than 2 million people had been registered in “Reserve+”. Taking into account the fact that before the occupation of the south of Ukraine – where several million Ukrainians live – the total number of people suitable for military service was about 6 million, as well as the fact that Reserve+ is not the only system for joining the reserve and works in parallel with the usual appeal to the enlistment offices, such results are more than satisfactory. It can be hoped that by the end of August 2024, the vast majority of reservists will be registered on the mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It must be recognised that in today’s highly mechanised and hi-tech war environment, manpower without weapons and military equipment has no meaning&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the positive prospects of such an initiative, which has significantly improved the situation with regard to mobilisation by immediately finding several million potential soldiers, it is not able to solve the most fundamental shortcoming. The new Law “On Mobilisation Training and Mobilisation” did not provide an answer to the question of when demobilisation should take place and how many years a mobilised person should serve, which in the conditions of a protracted war creates unnecessary uncertainty and reduces motivation to join the army. Solving this problem is possible by changing approaches to the composition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – namely, increasing the total number of military professionals who must sign three-, five- and seven-year contracts, as well as establishing a maximum limit of service for those who are mobilised, which could be three years. Ukraine had such an experience in 2015–2016, when demobilisation and replacement of mobilised persons by professionals took place while maintaining the total strength of the Armed Forces. At that time, a significant number of those who had been mobilised signed contracts and continued to serve. In Russia, where the government has tried to avoid an unpopular mobilisation, recruitment into the Armed Forces is largely done through individuals signing short-term – even one-year – contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, one must recognise that in today’s highly mechanised and hi-tech war environment, manpower without weapons and military equipment has no meaning. Ukraine definitely needs to increase the manpower of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and replenish losses, and initiatives such as “Reserve+” demonstrate that it is capable of doing this. However, the combat effectiveness of units depends not only on their number, but also on the level of provision of military equipment. There are still more than 30 territorial defence brigades in the Armed Forces, armed only with small arms and mortars, although they could be transformed into full-fledged mechanised brigades if they were to be provided with armoured vehicles, artillery, electronic warfare equipment and so on. The insufficient amount of weapons and military equipment is also a problem for regular brigades. For example, the 14 reserve brigades created by Ukraine cannot be used in combat zones due to the delay in the delivery of equipment that was promised by partners. Thus, success depends in the end not only on the improvement of Ukrainian recruiting, but also on the quality of Western logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security situation in Europe is rapidly worsening, with several concurrent trends making direct conflict with Russia before the end of the 2020s a serious risk. In conjunction with serious financial constraints, this will likely force the new UK government to make major course correction decisions in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most pressing concern is that Ukraine is increasingly struggling to contain slow but steady Russian advances on multiple parts of the frontlines, especially near Pokrovsk. The situation can still be salvaged, but doing so will require increased support over a sustained period from the UK and other allies, as well as changes on the Ukrainian side to reform mobilisation and training. Second, the US is increasingly militarily overstretched and unable to defeat aggression by China and Russia at the same time. Third, a potential second Trump presidency would likely weaken the political credibility of US security guarantees to NATO. Fourth, Russia’s economy is now on a war footing, and is producing large quantities of equipment, ammunition and vehicles, alongside a sustained mobilisation and training rate which has seen its forces in Ukraine grow to over 470,000 by early 2024. By contrast, the UK’s own stockpiles of ammunition, equipment and trained personnel have been left dangerously hollowed out by decades of underinvestment relative to political ambitions. Worse, the situation is similar in many other European countries, despite notable exceptions such as Finland and Poland – so relying on allies to fill the gaps is not a credible strategy in key capability areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine is defeated either in part or in full, and/or if the US is perceived as either unable or unwilling to come to Europe’s defence at scale, then there is a serious risk that Russia might invade part of a NATO member state’s territory within the next 3-5 years. Such aggression would likely be intended to trigger an Article V call from a member state over a limited amount of territory, gambling that European states could be deterred from taking the risk of going to war to eject Russian troops by force. The incentive for Russia to take such a gamble if it thinks it can get away without a coherent military response from Europe is huge, since such an outcome would fatally undermine the credibility of collective defence through NATO on which the whole European security architecture is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, defence may not have been a key vote-winner at the last election, but the scale and potential imminence of the threat to European security from Russia means that this government may be tested on the readiness of the UK’s defences within the term of this Parliament in a way that has not been seen since the Falklands War. Being perceived as having failed such a test in the face of Russian aggression is one of the few foreseeable scenarios that could all-but-guarantee a defeat at the next election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is very significant combat potential that could be rapidly unlocked with the right investments in core aircraft fleets that the RAF and Royal Navy already have&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, investing in regenerating the combat power of the UK’s existing combat aircraft fleets offers a route to rapid increases in meaningful combat capabilities that Russia would have to take significant account of in any decision to risk war with NATO. Russian military strategists and leaders alike rightly fear NATO airpower, because they understand that the Russian Army would be rapidly and decisively destroyed by multirole fighters and attack helicopters if NATO was able to gain air superiority over a contested area. The Russian Army is not some insurgent force that can try to hide from air strikes among the civilian population; to pose a threat it must deploy its tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery, logistics and electronic warfare equipment in the field and keep them there. If air superiority can be gained and exploited, Europe’s relatively large numbers of fourth-generation jets and helicopters could efficiently conduct close air support and interdiction missions to rapidly destroy the Russian Army in any contested territory. While the specialised standoff weapons needed to gain air superiority are very expensive, direct-attack munitions such as Paveway and JDAM series bombs cost only a few tens of thousands of pounds per weapon, and each fighter can use them to destroy multiple Russian vehicles per sortie once air superiority is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat is why Russia has invested so much resource and effort in developing its formidable ground-based air defence (GBAD) network. Currently, only the US has the capacity to conduct a full suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) campaign against that GBAD network, so Europe on its own would struggle to win air superiority against Russian forces. However, these GBAD systems are finite, have suffered some attrition in Ukraine already and have known weaknesses. They also represent a target set that NATO Air Command fundamentally understands how to defeat in technical and operational terms. The problem is not that solutions are not available, but rather that no European member states have yet invested in the necessary combination of suitable aircraft, weapons, specialist training and enablers, although some are making progress in this area. As one of the leading European NATO members, the UK can and should help plug this gap. Doing so would help rapidly reestablish Europe’s ability to fight for, win and exploit air superiority in a way that would mean Russia would be highly unlikely to risk a direct military clash. Achieving the same deterrent effect with UK land forces or maritime assets is almost certainly impossible, at least this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the British Army, which has struggled to effectively design and procure replacement vehicles for its Warfighting Division after configuring for counterinsurgency, the RAF has already been largely recapitalised with a balanced mix of relatively modern platforms across all its core mission sets. In a somewhat ironic twist, the slow nature of defence procurement programmes – especially in the air domain – now makes it easier to adapt the RAF to the new Russian threat paradigm. This is because many RAF aircraft and weapons systems were originally designed for Cold War scenarios against Russia’s currently deployed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Typhoon FGR.4 was designed specifically to overmatch Russian “Flanker” family fighters in air-to-air combat, especially using the very long-range European Meteor air-to-air missile, which was also designed with the same threats in mind. In addition, it is a capable close-air-support and long-range cruise missile launch asset. Its primary weakness is that as a multirole aircraft that forms the bulk of UK combat air capability, the fleet is constantly deployed all over the world for a range of operations, international exercises and standing commitments. Pilots also fly significantly less than they did a decade ago, and much of the flying that they do get is on long transits or patrols as part of overseas deployments that provide little training value for high-intensity mission sets. With so many mission sets to train to, even modernised and well-employed synthetic training in the simulator cannot allow the Typhoon crews to be adequately trained and ready across the board with such a task load. To regain the very high levels of capability in the air-to-air domain that they had in the mid-to-late 2010s, the Typhoon force needs additional financial and maintenance resources to increase core flying training hours; additional stocks of AIM-132 ASRAAM, AIM-120 ARMAAM and Meteor air to air missiles; and above all a reduction in discretionary overseas activity to allow the Force to focus on training for high-intensity mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the F-35B flown by the RAF and Royal Navy was designed specifically to destroy Russian GBAD networks. It features a combination of stealth, onboard electronic attack capabilities and unmatched sensors and software that can rapidly identify, locate and designate hostile radars for attacks. Despite drawbacks including high operating costs, and delays to new deliveries and retrofit schedules for important TR3 hardware and software upgrades within the programme, in the air the aircraft already provides genuinely unmatched combat capability against high-end Russian threats. The author has seen both from the ground and from the cockpit during NATO exercises how even a few F-35s can greatly enhance the survivability and lethality of the fourth-generation fighters around them by providing electronic attack support and real-time situational awareness on threats, as well as using their own limited internal weapons capacity to destroy particularly serious threats. However, the RAF/RN F-35B fleet is very small, with only 34 aircraft at the time of writing, and 48 due to be in service by the end of 2025. Royal Navy Carrier Strike Group deployments also take the bulk of the operational fleet far from the UK for months at a time every few years. Plans were at an advanced stage under the previous government to purchase 27 additional F-35Bs, but with delivery spread out over dates up until 2033. The UK has a high level of dependency on the F-35 not only for the Carrier Strike Group, but also as an essential force multiplier and SEAD/DEAD asset for the RAF against Russia in Europe, and for the British Army to provide targeting data for its planned long-range precision strike assets. Therefore, since the fleet is manifestly too small to meet the many requirements of it, there is a strong argument for the planned additional tranche of aircraft to be acquired as fast as possible, in order to deliver increased capacity in the mid-to-late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest limitation for the UK’s F-35Bs at present, however, is the lack of suitable weapons. For ground attack the fleet only has Paveway IV free-fall bombs, which are totally unsuitable for use against high-end Russian GBAD systems or targets protected by them. No other F-35 operator has such illogically constrained air-to-ground weapons options, and the SDR should prioritise fixing this deficit as fast as possible. The UK has developed the MBDA SPEAR 3 missile, designed specifically to work with the F-35’s sensor suite to reliably destroy Russian air defence targets from safe stand-off ranges even when those targets have ceased emitting and are repositioning. It is an almost ideal weapon to allow UK F-35s to address the core challenge preventing European NATO forces from gaining air superiority over a Russian force by destroying their GBAD network. However, in classic UK fashion a combination of very small order quantities, slow development and disagreements between industry and the Ministry of Defence has led to a very high cost-per-weapon. Large-scale orders in exchange for aggressive investment by MBDA in speeding up deliveries and increasing production capacity should be explored. Multinational production deals with allies should also be explored, since the weapon is not only ideal for the F-35 but could also provide significant SEAD/DEAD capabilities for Typhoon and potentially other fourth-generation jets due to its powered standoff range. In the interim, the UK should procure an urgent stopgap order of the US-made GBU-53/B. This is a relatively affordable glide bomb with an active millimetric radar seeker for terminal guidance against hostile vehicles like SAM systems, and is available quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The E-7A Wedgetail airborne warning and control system is ideally suited for providing early detection and wide-area tracking of incoming Russian cruise missiles fired from bombers in the Arctic. However, too few have been ordered to guarantee one on station for the medium term – a task which requires at least four and ideally five, rather than the three on order. The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is the finest airborne anti-submarine asset available today, and is already operated by the UK’s most important allies in the task of tracking Russian submarines in the North Atlantic and the Arctic – the US and Norway. The RC-135W Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft, meanwhile, has been instrumental in collecting vital signals and electronic intelligence on Russian forces in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is very significant combat potential that could be rapidly unlocked with the right investments in core aircraft fleets that the RAF and Royal Navy already have. The fleets are smaller than they would ideally be, almost across the board, but the more urgent problem is a lack of sufficient weapons stocks to fulfil the RAF’s key potential combat roles within NATO against Russia in a conflict. By investing urgently in procuring significantly increased numbers of key weapon types, increased spares and maintenance capacity to enable more flying hours and focusing training time on core high-intensity mission sets, the combat power of the RAF in a NATO context could be greatly enhanced in just a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The SDR should prioritise investment in weapons, maintenance capacity and high-end training to regenerate the combat power of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm as part of NATO over the coming years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, combat capability is not the only consideration for the government when looking at balance of investment choices. There will be a natural desire to invest in long-term programmes that bring value to the UK defence industry, international partnerships and trade. The most obvious and high-profile of these is the Global Combat Aircraft Programme (GCAP) with Japan and Italy. Perhaps the defining political choice of this SDR will be the degree to which the government invests limited resources in these long-term projects as opposed to plugging the capability gaps in the current force to enable it to play a core role in defending NATO against Russian aggression this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to those for whom long-term ambitions such as GCAP or AUKUS submarines are the top priority, it is worth stressing that those programmes are themselves dependent on avoiding a wider war with Russia in Europe this decade. Unless swiftly and decisively repelled, a Russian attack on NATO territory would see a scramble to desperately shore up national defences with whatever was immediately or rapidly available, coupled with serious economic destabilisation. Such an outcome would almost certainly spell disaster for long-term industrial programmes like GCAP that aim to deliver capability in the mid-to-late 2030s. Furthermore, if the UK’s current fast jet fleets fail to perform as they should against the Russian threat they were designed to fight due to inadequate weapons and core flying training resources, it would undermine the political narratives in the UK and elsewhere about the unique edge that such combat aircraft supposedly bring to defending countries against aggression. That too could be devastating for the long-term prospects of the UK’s combat aircraft industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR should prioritise investment in weapons, maintenance capacity and high-end training to regenerate the combat power of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm as part of NATO over the coming years. The UK will then be able to look to future programmes from a position of much greater strength and security against the enduring belligerence of Russia and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;
