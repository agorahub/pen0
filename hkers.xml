  &lt;li&gt;蓬佩奧對華演講納黎智英文章觀點 未具名引述免惹麻煩 黎：不知情&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/We9XrSy.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（13日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第109日審訊，黎智英第17日作供。辯方圍繞國安法生效之後黎的意圖提問，提及2020年7月27日至8月7日的事件。時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧在2020年7月23日（香港時間7月24日）發表對華政策演講數日之後，黎的私人助手Mark Simon轉發時任美國國務院政策規劃辦公室主任的訊息，對方表示曾旁聽黎的公開對談講座，當中談及美國可以道德權威幫助香港；對方指蓬佩奧的演講部份論點，其實是取自黎在《紐約時報》的文章，但是他們未有具名引述黎，因為覺得對黎未必是好事，又指「他們想保守秘密，因為不想被指責帶給任何人麻煩。」被問到是否對此知情，黎表示：「即使演講之後，我也從不知道，可能我看漏了這個論點吧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon轉發國務院職員訊息-指蓬佩奧演說取用黎智英觀點&quot;&gt;Mark Simon轉發國務院職員訊息 指蓬佩奧演說取用黎智英觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日證供提及，時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧在2020年7月23日（香港時間7月24日）發表對華政策演講，同日黎智英的Twitter發布帖文轉載相關新聞，並讚揚：「很棒！蓬佩奧說得好！自由世界一定要戰勝這個暴政。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭展示黎與其私人助手Mark Simon之間的Signal對話。Mark 在2020年7月28日，向黎轉發時任美國國務院政策規劃辦公室主任 Peter Berkowitz 的訊息，指他在2019年10月旁聽史丹福大學胡佛學院（Hoover Institution）黎的公開對談講座，期間黎被問到美國可以做什麼去協助香港爭取民主和自由，黎當時回答香港不需要美國向中國施以「坦克和關稅」，但是他希望美國不要為自己的道德原則而感到難堪。Peter Berkowitz 又在訊息中指，蓬佩奧的演講稿乃由其助手 Mary Kissel 準備，但她承認撰寫講稿是巨大工程，有很多人投入其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon轉述 Peter Berkowitz 所指，蓬佩奧的演講部份論點，其實是取自黎在《紐約時報》的文章，但是他們未有具名引述黎，因為覺得對黎未必是好事，又指「他們想保守秘密，因為不想被指責帶給任何人麻煩。」、「他們很擔心你的安全。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎當時似乎誤解了Mark Simon的訊息內容，回覆說：「感謝他們的支持，請告訴他們不要擔心，他們（中國）不會對我做任何事。他們想向商界和國際社會證明，國安法平息了香港但沒有影響市民的自由或損害法治。從國際社會的強烈反應、商人準備撤出香港以及想移民離開，他們便可知道他們已做錯了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，記不記得他在胡佛研究所對談的時候，被問到美國可以做什麼，當時怎樣回答。黎指正如較早前所說，他籲美國使用道德權威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示黎在《紐約時報》刊登的文章「What the Hong Kong Protests Are Really About」，日期為2019年7月1日。當中提到：「It recognized them as the first salvo in a new cold war, one in which the otherwise unarmed Hong Kong people wield the most powerful weapon in the fight against the Chinese Communist Party: moral force.（中國理解反修例示威是新冷戰的第一炮，在這個對抗中共的戰鬥裡，手無寸鐵的香港人使用最強大武器：道德力量。）」、「In much of the West, moral force is underestimated.（在很多西方國家，道德力量被低估）」、「The values war is the real war. For the West to prevail, it must support the tiny little corner of China where its virtues now operate: Hong Kong.（價值之爭才是真正的戰爭。西方若要領先，便要支持中國的一個細小角落：香港，而它的優勢正在發揮作用。）」、「The West’s moral authority is its most powerful weapon.（西方的道德權威是最強大的武器）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否知道蓬佩奧將他的論點納入演講中？黎表示：「即使演講之後，我也從不知道，可能我看漏了這個論點吧。」被問到有否留意演講中含有他的論點，黎表示沒有留意。被問到 Mary Kissel 有否告知，黎則重申對方在美國國務院工作時並沒有聯絡過她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黎在訊息中指中國從國際反應知道自己做錯了，問黎是否錯判形勢？黎則解釋，他當時認為國安法生效後，中國可能忌諱國際社會的反應，會減弱國安法力度，甚或不動用國安法，但是這是他的一廂情願。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳智思美國銀行帳戶遭取消-黎認同特朗普所作的事&quot;&gt;陳智思美國銀行帳戶遭取消 黎：認同特朗普所作的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與負責管理Twitter帳戶的「徒弟」李兆富之間的WhatsApp 訊息，2020年7月29日黎向李傳送《蘋果》英文版新聞「US bank cancels account of senior office-holder Bernard Chan」，有關時任行政會議非官守召集人陳智思的美國銀行帳戶被取消，黎並說：「This I’m sure is only a tip of the iceberg, overwhelming sanction against those oppressions of freedom will spread through ranks. Bravo! President Trump!（我肯定這只是冰山一角，針對那些打壓自由者的壓倒性制裁，將會蔓延至不同的職級。真棒！特朗普總統！）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到黎的訊息使用「壓倒性制裁」一詞，黎則指李兆富可能較謹慎，並會幫他修改字眼。辯方指黎的Twitter帳戶並未發現任何與上述訊息有關的帖文。黎指可能李最後未有發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎上述訊息是否讚揚特朗普針對陳智思的制裁？黎一度表示：「我容許。（I approved）」辯方追問黎他「容許」是什麼意思。黎說即是他認同特朗普所作的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問如果相關文字在黎的Twitter發布的話，會否是呼籲向打壓自由的人實施制裁？黎否認，堅稱他不是在呼籲制裁，他只是說「冰山一角」，因此上述說法是他的推測（conjecture）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方說：「讓我問你一個假設性的問題」，如果黎的Twitter帳戶有某個帖文，而該帖文與特朗普有關，黎認為會否構成鼓勵特朗普進一步實施制裁？黎反問：「我在鼓勵特朗普？我怎樣鼓勵特朗普總統？我只是在喝采。」惟法官李運騰指辯方的問題有些問題，而且相關問題應該留待法庭判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問及李兆富是否無償替黎工作-訊息顯示黎給予2萬元&quot;&gt;官問及李兆富是否無償替黎工作 訊息顯示黎給予2萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官問及，李兆富返回美國之後，繼續替黎管理Twitter 帳戶，黎有否給他酬勞（remuneration）？黎表示不知道，即使李身在香港的時候，也不知道李有否獲得酬勞，不肯定Mark Simon有沒有給李酬勞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，黎的意思是李無償地替黎管理Twitter？黎一度稱李是無償工作，但強調他多年來也無償地替李做事，例如李會詢問他意見、透過他獲取資訊等，因他是李的「師父」。杜官追問，若然李替黎無償工作的話，李依靠什麼維生？黎指李是一名作家，仍然可以依靠撰稿維生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭追問，黎認為李兆富是否應該獲得一些酬勞呢？黎則指李每日發布Twitter的時間只是約一小時，而他仍然有撰稿的工作。李素蘭再度追問下，黎表示當時未有詳細想過這個問題，可能Mark Simon有給李酬勞，但是黎從不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與Mark Simon之間的 WhatsApp 訊息，2020年7月8日（即辯方相信李兆富離港的前一天）黎傳送訊息，提醒Mark 他們已經向提供Twitter內容的人士支付1萬元，以及向李兆富支付2萬元。黎確認該2萬元是有關Twitter，亦確認是他自己出資。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦確認，若李兆富不再管理 Twitter 帳戶之後，Mark Simon 需接手，惟因為 Mark 不懂閱讀中文，若由李擔任此工作會較方便。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;對談節目稱基於疫情延後選舉是假的藉口-黎否認有意煽動憎恨&quot;&gt;對談節目稱基於疫情延後選舉是「假的藉口」 黎否認有意煽動憎恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月30日，黎智英參與網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，主持人Mark Clifford 提及有消息指政府擬「取消」立法會選舉，黎指疫情只是一個「假的藉口」，真正的原因是民主派初選成功舉辦，市民因國安法而被激怒，因此親政府的建制派很大機會落選，而民主派會勝出選舉。翌日，時任特首林鄭宣布基於疫情而押後立法會選舉一年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上被問到為何認為疫情是「假的藉口」，黎稱因為其他國家在疫情期間仍然會舉行選舉，所以有上述言論。他否認意圖煽動市民對特區和中央政府的憎恨，他只是道出自己的想法和推測，而且其預測最後也成真。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對談中黎提到中國未準備好跟美國打仗，因中國害怕美國的軍事實力。辯方問黎是否想貶低中國的軍事實力，藉以引起市民憎恨中央政府？黎否認，反稱他只是分析局勢，包括兩國的軍事實力等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在對談提到中美在科技產品和技術方面的交易脫鉤，辯方問黎是否想引起憎恨特區和中央政府。黎稱他只是表述當時形勢，雖然美國已經斷絕晶片及相關科技的貿易，但是他們未必在其他範疇的貿易脫鉤，反而美國會增加科技以外範疇的貿易，以補償損失。他又指不能抽空脈絡地理解他的對談內容，他只是嘗試分析整個形勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在對談中指前一晚有「4名小朋友」因國安法被捕，要觀望接下來會如何，可能他們會被移送至中國受審，但黎認識機會不大。法官杜麗冰指，黎未有在對談中說明該4人是涉及什麼罪名而被捕。黎則相信當時新聞有報導，又強調他沒有意圖去煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示黎的Twitter帖文，轉載有關警方於7月29日拘捕「創制獨立黨」鍾翰林等4人的新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問黎邀請嘉賓立場傾向美國民主黨還是共和黨&quot;&gt;官問黎邀請嘉賓立場傾向美國民主黨還是共和黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示訊息紀錄，Mark Simon向黎提議下集網上對談節目嘉賓，包括漢學家林培瑞（Perry Link）、時任自由亞洲電台總裁葉望輝（Steve Yates）、英籍歷史學家 Mike Gonzalez及前美國中情局反情報分析師 Peter Mattis 等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎被問到邀請對談嘉賓時，會選擇什麼立場的人士，黎稱會邀請信奉自由市場的人。被問到對華立場又如何？黎則指他的嘉賓通常對中國沒有認知，大部份都是專注經濟範疇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰表示出於好奇，指黎邀請的嘉賓大部份均為美國人，問黎他們的立場通常是傾向民主黨還是共和黨？黎指大部份是共和黨，估計因為彼此價值相近，皆信奉自由市場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問及Mark Simon是否有任何政治聯繫。黎指他是美國共和黨黨員（Republican）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;轉發羅傑斯帖文-遭官質疑推制裁-黎認為李兆富出錯-但自言須承擔責任&quot;&gt;轉發羅傑斯帖文 遭官質疑推制裁 黎認為李兆富出錯 但自言須承擔責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月30日黎的Twitter帳戶轉發（retweet）了「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Roger’s）的帖文。而羅傑斯的帖文轉發了一名香港記者的帖文，指公民黨郭榮鏗、楊岳橋、郭家麒鄭達鴻在立法會選舉被DQ，羅傑斯加上評論：「So the disqualifications start even as #HongKong government considers postponing Legislative Council elections. Total disenfranchisement. Totally outrageous. @DominicRaab it is time to add #CarrieLam and #HK and #China officials to the #Magnitsky sanction list.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎想透過轉發（retweet）來表達什麼訊息？黎稱他沒有負責轉發，而是李轉發，他亦未曾留意該帖文。李素蘭指，黎早前又稱會為李所作的事負責，那麼黎轉發的意圖是什麼？黎稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否想透過轉發羅傑斯的帖文來鼓勵外國制裁？黎否認。辯方又問，黎是否想在英國推動針對中港官員的 Magnitsky Act?黎亦否認，指這只是羅傑斯的說法。辯方追問，雖然這的確是羅傑斯的言論，但是黎的帳戶曾轉發相關帖文，問黎想透過轉發來說什麼？黎說：「只是轉發，透過轉發它，我們同意它。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭隨即質疑，黎稱同意他所轉發的帖文，那麼他是否透過轉發羅傑斯的帖文，來推動制裁中港官員呢？黎僅指，當時未有留意自己的帳戶轉發了，也不知道。但黎其後表示：「這並沒有使我免於承擔責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問道，黎有沒有意圖透過轉發羅傑斯的帖文，來推動制裁林鄭和中國官員？黎否認。辯方追問，黎剛才說「承擔責任」，是什麼意思？黎回答：「無論李兆富代表我做了什麼，我都要負責任。」辯方追問：「你意思是怎樣的責任？」黎僅說：「怎樣也好。（Whatever.）」辯方問黎有沒有意圖叫李代表他去做犯法的事？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後主動要求發言，表示：「我認為我要為李代表我所做的事完全負責任，就算他有疏忽或出錯。」辯方追問：「你認為他有出錯？」黎同意：「我覺得這是他出錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎經常說轉發帖文是李負責做的，然而黎有否曾經向李表達不認同該些轉發？黎表示，他未曾留意上述轉發，直至現在庭上看到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章草稿指自由國家組成科技封殺聯盟-黎否認提議封殺中國&quot;&gt;文章草稿指自由國家組成「科技封殺聯盟」 黎否認提議封殺中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月，黎智英向台灣《蘋果》社長楊懷康傳送一篇文章草稿給楊修改。惟黎稱不記得文章後來有否被刊出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到新冠疫情使各國仇視中共，而中共卻「戰狼一擊，撕毀國際公約的《基本法》」，在香港硬推國安法，倫理道德的價值觀差異，造成中美對峙的局面。文章提及蓬佩奧的對華政策演講，亦提及美國發動「淨網」行動，封殺 Tik Tok、微信、中電信、阿里巴巴和騰訊等中國網絡平台，黎指美國將封殺科技產品和技術出口到中國，其他自由世界國家也會加入，形成一個「科技封殺聯盟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指「科技封殺聯盟」並非一個正式的聯盟，但是他們會攜手合作，至於「自由世界國家」除了美國之外，還有英國、德國和一些歐盟國家。他亦指，如果美國禁止出口科技產品和技術到中國的話，其他自由世界國家要跟從，否則會被美國封殺。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，既然「科技封殺聯盟」並非一個正式的聯盟，那誰人起這個名字？是否黎？黎表示可能是從新聞讀到，然後拿來使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否透過上述訊息，向楊懷康提議應該封鎖或封殺中國？黎否認，稱只是預計會發生什麼事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（16）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;蓬佩奧演講提制裁 黎智英Twitter轉載讚「說得好」 惟否認提倡敵對行動&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MEV9jbr.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（12日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第108日審訊，黎智英第16日作供。辯方圍繞國安法生效之後黎的意圖提問，提及2020年7月21日至27日的事件。時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧在7月23日發表演講，提到要聯合不同國家應對中國挑戰，「我們的財政部和商務部已經制裁，以及將損害和濫用全世界人民的最基本權利的中國領導人和企業列入黑名單。」黎同日向負責管理 Twitter 帳戶的「徒弟」李兆富傳送訊息，形容「這是揭開了冷戰的戰幔。（“This is Cold War curtain raising.”）」，吩咐李就演講發布帖文。其後黎的 Twitter 轉載相關新聞，並評論：「很棒！蓬佩奧說得好！自由國家一定要打敗這個暴政。」黎認為蓬佩奧部份演講內容在提倡對中國的敵對行動，但他稱只引用部份演講字句，否認在 Twitter 帖文提倡敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，黎被問到他口中的「爭取自由運動」是指免於什麼的自由，黎回答免於中國侵蝕和獨裁統治的自由，法官杜麗冰問是否免於中國內地的自由？黎同意。惟杜官隨即質疑黎即是想香港獨立？黎否認，強調：「我沒有說香港獨立，我只是想香港在法治之下！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不同意中美會打仗-亦不想中美開戰&quot;&gt;黎不同意中美會打仗 亦不想中美開戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭繼續主問，他指2020年7月21日，黎 Twitter 帳戶轉載《蘋果》英文版新聞，有關哈佛大學社會科學院榮休教授傅高義指中美之間打仗是有可能，惟黎加上評論，表示不同意傅高義的觀點，他認為中美打仗是不可能，因美國軍事力量比中國更強，而「中國只是紙老虎，不敢與美國開戰（“China is a paper tiger that won’t dare to fight with the US.”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否想中美打仗（hot war）？黎說不想，所以他才會談論冷戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美勒令關閉中國駐侯斯頓領事館-黎私人訊息讚特朗普明智&quot;&gt;美勒令關閉中國駐侯斯頓領事館 黎私人訊息讚特朗普明智&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月23日，黎與負責管理 Twitter 帳戶的「徒弟」李兆富有 WhatsApp 對話。李兆富向黎說：「美國要求中國關閉侯斯頓的大使館（註：應為領事館）」，黎回覆：「Trump is using a series of sanctions exerted against China as he campaign strategy. Very smart. While Biden can only say but he acts. Action is louder than words!（特朗普利用一系列針對中國的制裁作為他的競選策略，非常明智，然而拜登只能光說，但特朗普行動。行動勝千言萬語！）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎的 Twitter 帳戶在發布帖文，轉載《蘋果》的帖文，關於美國勒令關閉侯斯頓（Houston）的中國領事館，以譴責中國「前所未見的行為及威脅作出報復」，並給予中國72小時限期。黎並加上評論：「Trump is taking actions through different measures, while Biden can only make claims. Action is louder than words!（特朗普透過不同措施來作出行動，然而拜登只光說不做。行動勝千言萬語！）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎在 WhatsApp 訊息中提及「制裁」，問他有沒有意圖透過李來提倡制裁？黎否認有這樣的意圖，並指訊息字面意思非常清晰。辯方追問，那麼黎的意圖是什麼。黎表示：「我在談論特朗普可能會做什麼」，並指他是在回應李的訊息，「我假定他會用我的訊息作為我的帖文。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，黎傳送給李的訊息，有時會用作 Twitter 帖文，有時沒有，而事實上黎也沒有向李明言想訊息字句放在帖文與否，問黎怎樣理解二人之間的協議。黎則指二人之間沒有協議，他只是讓李自行判斷是否放在 Twitter，並假定二人理解對方，而黎會為帖文負責任。黎並指二人已認識超過十年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否想藉向李傳送訊息，來美化特朗普對中國所做的事？黎笑指這不是美化，他只是道出事實，以及他的想法。辯方指，後來發布出來的 Twitter 帖文並沒有提及「制裁」。黎則指他和李沒有討論過帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認為關閉領事館屬制裁和敵對行動黎認為關閉領事館屬制裁和敵對行動&quot;&gt;黎認為關閉領事館屬制裁和敵對行動黎認為關閉領事館屬制裁和敵對行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭指，黎在訊息中使用「制裁」一字，問他會否視關閉領事館為「制裁」的一種？黎稱，至少當時是這樣認為，但他的想法可能不準確，並確認他當時的確覺得關閉領事館可以代表「制裁」。辯方問黎會否視之為「敵對行動」？黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著問黎有否鼓吹關閉中國駐美領事館？黎否認，並指他只是講述特朗普會在爭取連任的時候這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎 Twitter 帳戶在2020年7月23日發布帖文，轉載《蘋果》英文版新聞報導〈Firms with Hong Kong ties face US sanctions, linked to human rights abuses in Xinjiang〉，並說：「The most effective way to prevent human rights violations is to hold people who do the heinous act personally accountable.」辯方指，帖文內容沒有提及「制裁」，但是轉載的新聞標題卻含有「制裁」字眼。黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指運動爭取免於中國侵犯及獨裁的自由-法官一度質疑即港獨&quot;&gt;黎指運動爭取免於中國侵犯及獨裁的自由 法官一度質疑：即港獨？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎 Twitter 帳戶在2020年7月23日發布另一則帖文，轉載《蘋果》英文版新聞〈U.K. launches lifeboat for Hongkongers with focus on younger generation with new BN(O) visa〉，並說：「這是緊急及有需要的。我們的年輕人是爭取自由運動的脊柱，他們處於最危險的境地。（“This is urgent and necessary. Our young people are the backbone of our freedom movement. They’re in the most danger.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問哪些人是帖文所提及的「年輕人」？黎指是年輕的示威者，也可以是泛指香港的年輕人。辯方指，黎形容他們是「爭取自由運動的脊柱」，然而黎早前供稱當時運動已經不存在。黎則稱帖文是指較早前的運動，在國安法實施之後，香港已再沒有任何示威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官問到，說「爭取自由運動」，那麼是指免於什麼的自由（“freedom from what?”）？黎指是免受中國侵蝕自由、免受獨裁統治等。法官杜麗冰問，黎是指免於中國內地的自由嗎（“freedom from China?”）？黎回答是。杜官隨即問，那麼你是想香港獨立嗎？黎強調：「我沒有說香港獨立，我只是想香港在法治之下！」杜官追問，可是你說自由。黎重申：「我剛才說想香港有法治，因為世上沒有絕對的自由。」杜官追問，「但是你說自由，那麼必定是免於某種東西的自由。」黎重申，他是說免於中國侵蝕的自由、免於限制的自由，以及在法治之下的自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎支持英國政府向港人提供支援-惟沒想過是否構成對中港制裁&quot;&gt;黎支持英國政府向港人提供支援 惟沒想過是否構成對中港「制裁」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎期望年輕人在未來做什麼。黎表示：「我不知道，但是我期望他們得到政治庇護。」被問到為何說「最危險的境地」，黎指是因為《國安法》。他指有需要及急切地向年輕人提供前往英國的出口，代表通往自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示《蘋果》報紙的中文報導〈毋須持有效護照 英設BNO簽證 供港人家屬鋪路入籍〉，當中一段提到：「前香港眾志秘書黃之鋒表示，英國容許BNO港人及近親申請居英權，是港人在中共陰霾下的『救生艇』，亦反映國際間認同香港年輕人於反送中運動中的貢獻，尤其1997年主權移交前出生的香港年輕人。雖然有關安排仍待明年1月實施，但他相信，若港版國安法執法力度加大，必須會導致實施日期推前。」黎表示他無牽涉報導的過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否支持英國政府向港人提供支援，黎表示同意。當他再被問到會否視英國設BNO簽證是一種對中國或香港的制裁，黎表示沒有詳細想過，也沒有相關詳情，因他只是閱讀了報導的標題。辯方向法官補充，他的提問可能看似愚蠢，但是控方指控之一是指稱英國向香港年輕人批出BNO是構成制裁，因此有需要就此向黎提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，黎與《蘋果》高層之間，有沒有任何協議或共同的理解，認為中央收緊香港自由？黎堅稱他們沒有共同的理解，「我有自己的想法，他們有另一些想法。」黎亦否認他的想法與高層的想法吻合，並強調沒有下達編採方針或政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報頭橫額含光時旗相片-黎新聞相片不犯法讓同事自行判斷&quot;&gt;報頭橫額含光時旗相片 黎：新聞相片不犯法、讓同事自行判斷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，報紙頂部顯示日期和頁數的橫額，含有「兩制蓋棺」字眼，以及國家主席習近平的半張臉、「光復香港，時代革命」旗幟的照片。黎稱他不涉橫額的製作，又指橫額有時出現在不同版面，視乎新聞的主題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否理解同事為何擺放習近平的相片、是否有意將習描繪成不討喜的形象。黎則表示沒有任何理解，強調讓同事自行作出決定，而他不會插手。至於習的相片，黎指「這不是關於描繪他，而是關於《國安法》的影響」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「光時旗」，辯方提及7月的「飯盒會」討論過採訪時若提到「港獨」、「光復香港」相片，只是報道、不涉鼓吹宣傳的話便可以出。黎認同，指他們曾經徵詢過律師，而律師告訴他們新聞相片並不構成罪行，所以他們才敢擺放「光時旗」的圖片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，報紙的前一日並沒有關於「光時旗」的新聞，為何《蘋果》會在報頭橫額中使用相關相片。黎表示：「我甚至未有察覺到它」，他並不會看得如此仔細，因為該相片太細小，如果不是好像庭上電腦畫面般放大或近看，人們根本不會見得到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，該相片出現在報頭橫額一段時間，問黎閱讀報紙時有沒有留意？黎同意出現，但同時強調相片太細小。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，黎與《蘋果》高層之間，有沒有任何理解，在報頭橫額上持續展示該相片來鼓吹分裂國家。黎則回答：「反過來說，我們之間有一個理解就是我們從來不應使用『香港獨立』，這是回答了你的問題。」辯方追問，黎在當時有否知道「光時」可以帶有將香港分裂出去的意味？黎表示有留意它可能構成罪行，因當時有人因為「光時」旗而被拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，假如黎留意到報頭橫額上有「光時」旗相片的話，黎會怎樣做？黎則表示：「我不認為我會做任何事，因為我讓他們（同事）在工作上自行判斷。」辯方問黎有否作出干預？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國前資深顧問傳送蓬佩奧演講辭-黎否認參與準備&quot;&gt;美國前資深顧問傳送蓬佩奧演講辭 黎否認參與準備&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎的電郵紀錄，美國國務院前資深顧問惠頓（Christian Whiton）於2020年7月24日向黎智英、Mark Simon、美國國防前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 和退休軍官 Jack Keane，傳送時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的演講辭。辯方亦指，不爭議的事實是蓬佩奧在7月23日（即香港時間7月24日），在 Nixon Library 發表演講〈Communist China and the Free World’s Future〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，根據黎的證供，惠頓已經沒有在白宮工作，當時在華盛頓擔任游說工作，問黎知不知道為何惠頓會傳送蓬佩奧的演講給他？黎估計「這是游說工作者的做事方式」，因他們要保持人脈關係，例如傳送資料和消息給前顧客，以保持彼此關係。而黎確認自己是惠頓的前顧客，曾在2019年7月美國之行聘用他聯絡美國議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指惠頓不只傳送給黎，還傳送給 Mark Simon、Paul Wolfowitz 和 Jack Keane。黎指 Mark Simon 是他的助手，而另外兩者則是他的好友。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在收到電郵3小時之後回覆「謝謝」。黎稱，當他在早上醒來打開電郵時，他很大可能未有打開附件閱讀演講辭，只是回覆一句「謝謝」，但其後為何會知道演講內容，是因為從新聞得知、還是在同日下午閱讀了附件，則不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否參與準備蓬佩奧的演講辭？黎失笑並反問：「我怎樣參與其中呢？」辯方繼而問黎有否直接或間接作出貢獻？黎否認，但他其後補充，不排除蓬佩奧一方有使用他在《紐約時報》撰寫的文章中字句。辯方追問他們使用之前有徵詢過黎的同意嗎？黎說沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎訊息指冷戰戰幔揭開籲李兆富轉載蓬佩奧演講&quot;&gt;黎訊息指「冷戰戰幔揭開」籲李兆富轉載蓬佩奧演講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與李兆富之間的訊息，李在7月24日向黎傳送蓬佩奧演講的《彭博》報導，並指：「這是非常強烈的言論，蓬佩奧呼籲終止與中國的協議，並以一群理念想近的國家取而代之，是一個新的民主國家聯盟」，黎其後草擬Twitter帖文字句並傳送給李，並說：「請在我的 Twitter 用蓬佩奧的演講，以及我的評論。這是揭開了冷戰的戰幔。（“This is Cold War curtain raising.”）」李回覆會盡快處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否透過李兆富來提倡中美冷戰？黎否認。辯方問黎是否想中美冷戰？黎反問：「我想有冷戰？這是合理嗎？我不能夠想要一場冷戰。」辯方要求黎正面回答，黎其後說不想有冷戰。辯方提及黎剛才說不想中美有戰爭（hot war），黎同意，但是他只是說冷戰經已成形。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到，黎傳送給李的字句，有部份與蓬佩奧的演講字眼一樣，問黎是否從惠頓傳送給他的演講稿中，複製了部份蓬佩奧的言論？黎說不是，估計自己是複製了《彭博》報導的字句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意蓬佩奧提倡敵對行動-twitter轉載相關報導因部份字句說得好&quot;&gt;黎同意蓬佩奧提倡敵對行動 Twitter轉載相關報導因部份字句說得好&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指蓬佩奧在演講中提及：「我們的財政部和商務部已經制裁，以及將損害和濫用全世界人民的最基本權利的中國領導人和企業列入黑名單。（“Our Departments of Treasury and Commerce have thus sanctioned and blacklisted Chinese leaders and entities that are harming and abusing the most basic rights for people all across the world.”）」以及「我們不會獨自面對這個挑戰。聯合國、北約、G7、G20，我們集合經濟、外交和軍事力量，是足以應對這個挑戰，如果我們夠堅定和勇氣的話。（“So we can’t face this challenge alone. The United Nations, NATO, the G7 countries, the G20, our combined economic, diplomatic, and military power is surely enough to meet this challenge if we direct it clearly and with great courage.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，蓬佩奧是否提倡針對中國的敵對行動？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日黎的 Twitter 發布了兩則帖文：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「“The old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won’t get it done. We must not continue it. We must not return to it” @SecPompeo」（轉載《美聯社》的報導，並引用演講字句：過往盲目地與中國交往的範式已經不管用。我們不能再繼續下去。我們不能再重回舊路。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「Bravo! Well said @SecPompeo! The free world must triumph over this tyranny. If we bend our knee, our children will be at the mercy of the #ChineseCommunistParty. If the free world doesn’t change Communist China, Communist China will change us.」（轉載《彭博》報導，並加上評論：很棒！蓬佩奧說得好！自由國家一定要打敗這個暴政。如果我們屈膝，我們的下一代便會任由中共的擺佈。如果自由國家不改變中共，中共便會改變我們。）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎從蓬佩奧的演講中取用了一些他認為說得好的字句，放在 Twitter，然而上述兩則帖文分別轉發《美聯社》和《彭博》的新聞，問黎是否提倡敵對行動。黎否認，否則他會使用其他字句，而他只是用了「暴政」的字句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎的 Twitter 帳戶亦轉載了美國國務院的 Twitter 帖文，載有蓬佩奧演講的影片。黎稱沒有要求李兆富轉載相關影片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指蓬佩奧助手曾任職華爾街日報-駐港逾10年&quot;&gt;黎指蓬佩奧助手曾任職《華爾街日報》 駐港逾10年&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與楊懷康之間的訊息，顯示楊於7月24日向黎轉發蓬佩奧演講的新聞。黎回覆指：「對這是非常有力的演講。這演講必定啟動了與中國的新冷戰！真棒！（“It’s very powerful speech. This speech means to have kicked off the new Cold War with China! Bravo!”）」黎又指：「Mary Kissel 應該與這演講有關，為我們的朋友感到十分驕傲。（“Mary Kissel should have something to do with it. So proud of our friend.”）」楊同意黎，又提到：「你協助建立那友誼，無人能及。（“You helped build that friendship like nobody else.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，Mary Kissel 是蓬佩奧的得力助手，認為她有份準備演講稿。黎又提到，Mary Kissel 曾任職《華爾街日報》，駐守香港超過10年，負責亞洲新聞，她在香港的時候，黎是她的好朋友。黎指，Mary Kissel 返回美國之後，繼續任職《華爾街日報》，負責撰寫社評，後來擔任蓬佩奧的助手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到何時知道 Mary Kissel 擔任蓬佩奧助手，黎表示不知道，而他過往使用她的《華爾街日報》電郵來聯絡她，她離職之後便無法聯絡她。後來在2019年7月到美國會見蓬佩奧時，才得悉她成為其助理。黎亦提到，由於二人是好友，見面時會擁抱，惟在會見蓬佩奧之前，Mark Simon 曾提醒他不要擁抱她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎文章稱美國等西方列強將陸續推出制裁和懲罰措施-惟否認呼籲&quot;&gt;黎文章稱美國等西方列強將陸續推出制裁和懲罰措施 惟否認呼籲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年7月26日刊於黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」文章〈有種回力鏢……自插心臟〉。當中提到：「表面看來中共滿意國安法的震懾效果，先按兵不動，不立即進行拉人封艇，隨後才收拾傳媒和一些抗爭運動的關鍵人物。事實上是事前未想過，毀了香港原來是咁大鑊。更想不到國安法撕毀《基本法》這國際公約，公然羞辱國際文明價值倫理，引發國際圍攻。美國等西方列強的強烈反彈，將會陸續推出制裁和懲罰措施，中國外交和貿易將陷於自經濟開放以來最慘烈的低谷，比當年六四屠城後還要慘烈。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否意圖藉文章呼籲國際「圍攻」中國？黎否認，並強調自己只是預計未來發生的事。辯方又問，有否意圖提倡「制裁和懲罰措施」？黎亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續指：「合理的做法當然是回歸法律正途，遵守任何牴觸《基本法》的法律都是無效的原則。例如《港區國安法》第4條和第20條容許和平示威，只是派發傳單宣揚分裂國家，也是容許的，不過若試圖直接破壞香港特別行政或中華人民共和國的機構，藉此分裂國家和破壞民族團結，即使該等行動不涉及武力，譬如黑客入侵電腦，都是犯罪行為。希望以舉出明確例子，向世人解釋清楚，國安法混淆了《基本法》那些的法律條文。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問上述段落有何用意、是否在提出建議。黎指純粹舉例，講述如何為香港補救，因想表達《國安法》有非常模糊的紅線，使他十分疑惑，而且想描述《國安法》混淆《基本法》，因此想舉例說明紅線在哪裡。他又強調，只是「希望」說出紅線，但事實上除了當局之外，沒有人能夠指出真正的紅線在哪裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認為中共不可信-惟否認文章煽動憎恨中共&quot;&gt;黎認為中共不可信 惟否認文章煽動憎恨中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章最後指：「不過，這樣做現在還有用嗎？國際社會還會相信中共遵守承諾的誠意嗎？中共何時遵守過合約承諾？WTO？《基本法》？中共沒有一次遵守合約承諾的，試問世人對中共的誠信又從何說起呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認他認為中共不可信，惟否認有意藉上述段落煽動憎恨中共，「我只是說出事實和舉例。」辯方追問相關例子是什麼？黎僅指中共從沒信守承諾，指中國與世界貿易組織（WTO）簽訂了一些承諾，但是不記得具體是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認文章意圖煽動他人循不合法途徑改變香港的現有政制，亦否認邀請其他人不守法，反指文章只想表達，即使現在回歸法律正途，也已經沒有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;蓬佩奧助手查問觀點 黎智英否認嘗試鼓勵美國撤銷香港特殊地位&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0vNkxjE.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（11日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第107日審訊，黎智英第15日作供。辯方圍繞《國安法》生效之後黎的意圖提問，提及2020年7月14日至19日的事件。Mark Simon 曾轉發時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 訊息，問及黎對撤銷香港特殊地位的觀點。黎回答美國撤銷「可能是正確的決定」，因會更輕易地迫使中國正視美國的要求。黎在庭上強調當時僅推測美國為何想取消香港特殊地位，否認嘗試鼓勵美國藉著撤銷香港特殊地位，來更易迫使中國正視美國的要求。他亦堅稱從沒有與蓬佩奧助手直接聯繫，並否認 Mark Simon 是二人之間溝通渠道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，庭上檢視黎的專欄文章〈時間就是武器〉，當中指香港在《國安法》的專橫之下，獲警方批出不反對通知書的機會不大。黎指《國安法》下沒人敢上街示威。法官杜麗冰質疑，黎基於7月1日很少人上街示威，便得出結論指《國安法》侵害示威權利。黎則稱，雖《國安法》提到會保障人權，但是他不相信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認透過前領事向特朗普和拜登施要求強硬&quot;&gt;黎否認透過前領事向特朗普和拜登施要求強硬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年7月14日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息：「郭明瀚整理了前美國駐港領事一封信件，向特朗普和拜登施壓，要求他們強硬。（“Just FYI, Jim Cunningham organised a letter from the past US consul general’s on Hong Kong meant to press both Trump and Biden people to be tough”）」，黎在7月15日回覆：「聽到這消息真好！（“Good to hear! Thanks. Jimmy”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否透過前美國駐港澳領事郭明瀚和 Mark Simon，向特朗普和拜登施壓，要求他們強硬？黎否認，並稱他只是回應 Mark Simon 的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，兩日之後即7月16日，有相關新聞報導，指郭明瀚要求華盛頓向港人批出政治庇護。辯方問黎在回覆 Mark Simon 的時候，有沒有留意到郭明瀚在做什麼事情？黎則指，當時未有相關新聞和細節，重申他只是回覆 Mark Simon 的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter提及行動-黎指譴責中國或與之對話&quot;&gt;Twitter提及「行動」 黎指譴責中國或與之對話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月11至12日，民主派舉行初選投票。黎的 Twitter 帳戶於2020年7月15日發布帖文，轉載「國務卿蓬佩奧就香港民主派初選的聲明」(STATEMENT BY SECRETARY MICHAEL R. POMPEO - On the Pan-Democratic Primary Election in Hong Kong），並寫道：「@SecPompeo and @USAinHKMacau thanks for your support to #HKers, it is more important than ever the world to voice out and to take actions to defend against suppression of freedom by the #CCP.（國務卿蓬佩奧和美國駐港澳領事，感謝你們對香港人的支持，全世界發聲和作出行動去保衛香港自由，免受中共打壓，這是前所未有地重要。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎相信帖文是由「徒弟」李兆富撰寫，估計蓬佩奧只是想透過聲明作出鼓勵，因這是一個很大的幫助。辯方問帖文中的「行動」是指什麼？黎指可能是發聲、跟中國對話，或者甚至譴責中國。辯方追問，一個國家怎樣譴責另一個國家？黎指可以責備或批評他們，及基於人權而質疑他們的正當性和合法性。辯方問黎認為一個國家批評另一個國家，會否構成「敵對行為」？黎表示當時未有想過這個問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，黎口中「跟中國對話」是以什麼方式？黎稱可以與中國講道理（reasoning with China）。當被追問可以怎樣與中國講道理時，黎稱未有深思過這問題，相信美國政府會知道怎樣做，「這並非我們的份內事去想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾向同事及民主派等人傳送美國行政命令內文-含shit-list字眼&quot;&gt;黎曾向同事及民主派等人傳送美國行政命令內文 含「shit list」字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日，時任美國總統特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act），法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，早前證供顯示，黎於7月15日分別向時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏、時任總編輯羅偉光、民主黨何俊仁、李永達、林卓廷和工黨李卓人等，傳送美國行政命令內文，訊息並含有「I’d say we should work up a shit list on those involved in censorship」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前供稱訊息是來自美國白宮相關人士，他未閱讀整個訊息便複製然後傳送給上述人士，因此不知訊息含有「shit list」字句。黎今稱，可能訊息是從郭明瀚或美國國務院前資深顧問惠頓（Christian Whiton）得到，惟在辯方提問下，黎指後者已不在美國政府工作，當時任職游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，從黎的訊息和電郵紀錄，找不到任何人傳送上述訊息給黎，問黎可曾刪除有關訊息或電郵？黎則稱沒有，因他不認為自己做過任何犯法的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李兆富提議寫制裁由銀行開始-黎叫停提倡制裁太危險&quot;&gt;李兆富提議寫「制裁由銀行開始」 黎叫停：提倡制裁太危險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與李兆富之間的訊息，李於2020年7月15日傳送《日經新聞》連結給黎，並提議字句「The Liaison Office should have bank accounts in HK. Sanctions may begin with banks dealing with the Liaison Office（中聯辦在香港應該有銀行戶口，制裁可能從與中聯辦交易的銀行開始）」，惟黎回覆：「Advocating sanctions may be too dangerous as they treat it as subversion or collusion. Maybe we can use other comments.（提倡制裁可能太危險，因為他們視之為顛覆或勾結，我們可以使用其他評論。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何在訊息中用「太危險」一字？黎表示，因為提倡制裁「比犯法更甚（“… it’s more than illegal.”）」。辯方問，換言之，黎在當日已經知道提倡制裁是犯法的？黎同意並表示：「我當時非常敏感。」辯方指根據紀錄，黎的 Twitter 帳戶最終不見任何關於上述訊息的帖文。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon轉發蓬佩奧顧問訊息-黎改稱撤銷香港特殊地位是正確決定&quot;&gt;Mark Simon轉發蓬佩奧顧問訊息 黎改稱撤銷香港特殊地位是正確決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與 Mark Simon 之間的 Signal 訊息，2020年7月15日，Mark Simon 轉發蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 的訊息：「黎智英不想美國完全斷絕與香港的聯繫，這是否真確？（“Mark, is it true that Jimmy don’t want the US to break all the ties with Hong Kong?”）」，並說：「以上是 Mary 的問題，因為他們有點疑惑，因為有傳媒報導指你說不想美國完全斷絕與香港的聯繫。（“Jimmy this is a question from Mary as they are a bit confused, as some press reports had do you saying that you would prefer US not break all ties with Hong Kong”）」黎回覆：「我是說撤銷香港特殊地位是不需要的，因為在《國安法》下，香港怎樣也好都會完蛋。重點不在於香港而在於中國。制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港。但是就此思考後，我認為他們撤回香港特殊地位是正確的，因為一旦美國和中國之間脫鈎，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國正視美國的要求。（“I said that it’s not necessary to revoke the special status of HK because with national security law HK is finished anyway. The point is not HK but China. Sanction China as to stop it from clamping down on HK. But after I thought about it I think they’re right to revoke HK’s special status, because once US and China decoupled HK would be a way out for China. To close this outlet of China would force it to come to term easier to demands of US.”）」其後 Mark Simon 回覆：「謝謝，會傳達。（“Thanks… will relay”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在5月的時候曾向美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 稱不想香港被撤銷特殊地位，然而到了7月的時候，卻改變說法指撤銷特殊地位是正確決定，問黎為何有這樣的轉變。黎則稱相關理由已在上述訊息中說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，當時美國尚未撤銷香港特殊地位，問黎是否在訊息中提倡撤銷特殊地位？黎否認，因為 Mark Simon 問他問題，所以他便回應。辯方問是否有美國官員想知道他的看法？黎同意。黎被問到是否嘗試鼓勵美國藉著撤銷香港特殊地位，以更易迫使中國正視美國的要求，黎否認，反指他可能是推測美國為何想取消香港特殊地位，他堅稱不同意這樣做，但是思考過後認為美國的決定可能是正確。黎強調上述回覆 Mark Simon 的訊息只是「推測（deduction）」或「揣測（speculation）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰引述黎的訊息指「因為一旦美國和中國之間切斷聯繫，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國面對美國的要求」，由此可見這是黎的「想法」多於「推測」，不是嗎？黎起初同意，惟他指稱某程度上也是一個「推測」，重申他當時是猜測和揣測美國政府的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官追問，可是當時美國尚未簽發行政命令。黎重申他只是在談論背後的理由。在辯方提問下，黎表示發送訊息的時候，他未有機會閱讀特朗普的行政命令。辯方追問，若然黎尚未有機會閱讀行政命令，那為何黎會思考行政命令的背後理由。黎則指，美國正打算撤銷香港特殊地位，所以推測原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎從沒與國務卿顧問直接聯絡&quot;&gt;黎：從沒與國務卿顧問直接聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎強調，他並沒有給予蓬佩奧助手任何提議，他們之所以透過 Mark Simon 向他提問，「可能他們從我的訪問和文章得知，而他們感到疑惑，然後問我問題。」他亦強調：「我從來沒有從 Mary 收過任何訊息」，當他撰寫上述訊息的時候，他其實是回覆 Mark Simon 所轉發的問題，並堅稱從沒與 Mary 直接聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問黎為何沒有與 Mary 直接聯繫。黎認為與美國政府官員直接聯絡是不正確的，因為 Mary 處於一個敏感的位置，作為她的朋友應該尊重她，不想把她置於不方便的境地。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，這會否就是 Mark Simon 替二人轉發訊息，成為二人之間溝通渠道（conduit）的原因？黎則否認 Mark Simon 是溝通渠道。法官杜麗冰指，然而從訊息可得知 Mark Simon 怎樣理解自己的角色，他收到黎的回覆後表示：「謝謝，會傳達（“Thanks… will relay”）」，問黎認為 Mark Simon 會替他傳達嗎？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認帖文提倡取消香港特殊地位-稱僅提問&quot;&gt;黎否認帖文提倡取消香港特殊地位 稱僅提問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年7月16日，黎的 Twitter 帳戶發布帖文：「While #HK is dead with #NationalSecurityLaw, does the revocation of HK special status close also China’s window to the finance, technology and commerce of the outside world? Are US and China decoupling?」，並轉載《蘋果》的 Twitter 帖文，當中提到中國對於美國解除香港特殊貿易地位而作出反擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在帖文發布之前，黎透過 WhatsApp 訊息向李兆富提供相關評論文字，李其後修改部份字眼。黎確認他傳送給李的評論文字反映他當時想法，使用問題形式是因為他在評論一些還未發生的事情，只是一種猜測（conjecture）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問是否嘗試藉著上述帖文，去提倡美國與中國脫鈎？黎否認，他當時只是好奇中美是否正在脫鈎，因這是很矚目的新聞。辯方又問，黎是否嘗試透過帖文提倡取消香港特殊地位，以關閉中國對外窗口？黎亦否認，重申他當時僅嘗試提問，並沒有提倡任何東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;slack群組顯示員工關注國安法雷區和紅線&quot;&gt;Slack群組顯示員工關注國安法「雷區和紅線」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示通訊軟件 Slack《蘋果》員工群組訊息。2020年7月15日「飯盒會」之前，不同員工關注《國安法》帶來的影響，有人問及「國安法的雷區和紅線」：「本報是否一如過往，請作者任意批評中共領導人及香港高官，甚至是情緒發洩？如據昨日律師講座，這種做法明顯踩界，構成風險，但過於自我審查，又有違新聞自由及言論自由，此中如何把握，請各位指教。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有同事表示：「國安法後，同事對報導的部份用字及角度想有明確指引，例如『武漢肺炎』是否仍可用，內地權鬥及中資掠水是否仍可寫？公司昨日安排的法律講座有實用性，想有更多具建設性的的講座或培訓，教導面對不同情景，例如國安處政治部是找同事傾談、打聽公司情況，而非直接拘捕，同事應採甚麼技巧回應？」該同事亦擔心個人資料外洩，問公司會否提供一些方法例如「太空卡」給同事傾談敏感話題、會否採用類似「閱後即焚」的系統，令同事安心處理敏感話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有港聞員工轉述兩岸版同事關注：「想知日後發生烏坎村這類維權事件，是否會再派人前往採訪？本報當年大標題罵時任汕尾書記的鄭雁雄（現任國安署長）是狗官，日後可否再起這類標題？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有法庭組員工表示：「國安法生效後，理解不少同事關注究竟那些題材和字眼可以報或不可以報，可是現在的紅線不是我們定，甚至不是港府定，任誰也說不到正確準則，就算是律師也只能說存在風險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英回應個別留言：「到時討論」，對於有員工希望公司多安排法律講座，黎回應：「已有講座，以後還會有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上表示，從會議紀錄可見，對於員工的關注，當時並未有具體的解決辦法，而「按自己良知」是很含糊的說法，至於「不用過於害怕，但要謹慎」則泛指報導時採用的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官質疑黎基於示威人數減少而說國安法侵害權利&quot;&gt;法官質疑黎基於示威人數減少而說國安法侵害權利&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」於2020年7月19日發布了文章〈時間就是武器〉。黎在文章說：「遊行集結是我們應有的憲法權利，但是在今日國安法凌駕法律的專橫下，我們以後遊行示威，能得到警方不反對通知書的機會不大，再沒有一百幾十萬人遊行抗爭、令當權者震驚和令世人矚目的震撼場面，我們以後抗爭行動只好化整為零，以不同的行動不同的形式，集腋成裘的方法爭取抗爭的力量，還是會有效的，但不會像以前一樣了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認他認為《國安法》侵犯人權，包括遊行、集會和示威權利。在法官杜麗冰追問下，黎確認他閱讀過《國安法》，知道《國安法》聲稱保障人權，但是強調因為《國安法》凌駕《基本法》，反問：「我怎樣相信我們的遊行示威權利會被保留？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，《國安法》生效之後看不到任何示威活動，所以認為《國安法》侵害市民的示威權利，沒有人敢上街示威，恐懼瀰漫。他指，雖然7月1日有人示威，但是人數很少，由此可見《國安法》為示威活動帶來終結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，黎基於7月1日很少人上街示威，便得出結論指《國安法》侵害示威權利，這是黎的說法嗎？黎同意，並補充因為《國安法》凌駕《基本法》。被問到有否閱讀過《國安法》，它提到會保障人權。黎則說：「《國安法》保證會保障人權，但是我不相信。」法官李運騰則澄清，《國安法》條文是指，若然《國安法》與「本地法」有牴觸，便以《國安法》為先，而不是說《國安法》與《基本法》有牴觸時凌駕《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否嘗試鼓勵人們繼續以「以不同的行動不同的形式」參與運動？黎表示：「我想運動以不同的方式繼續下去，但這是我一廂情願，這是不會發生的。」法官李運騰指，當時政府已經撤回了《逃犯條例》修訂草案，問黎為何想運動繼續下去。黎澄清他口中的運動是指「反抗中國對香港自由的侵害」，而他視《國安法》為「對自由的侵害」。黎又指，「以不同的行動不同的形式」意思是採取不同抗爭的方式，而又不干犯《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章稱要像橡膠靈活-官質疑鼓勵抗爭&quot;&gt;文章稱要像橡膠靈活 官質疑鼓勵抗爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的文章指：「國安法震懾下，不少抗爭運動人士已離開香港，或在計劃離去，留下來的有些已意興闌珊，離隊迴避風險，生命誠可貴，自由價更高，無人有權置喙他們的選擇，或扔出第一塊石頭。留下謹守的人是抗爭運動的脊樑，更要珍惜我們的力量。」辯方問黎是否鼓勵留在香港的人，以靈活的方式抗爭？黎則引述文章「留下來的有些已意興闌珊」，指留港的人會放棄。在辯方追問下，他否認鼓勵別人抗爭，反稱只是籲人成為社會良知的「脊樑」，「要珍惜我們的力量⋯⋯我們僅有的力量。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續指：「我們本來僅是高牆下的雞蛋，現在人數少了，我們的力量更脆弱，因此我們的身段必須靈活柔軟，若然硬崩崩一成不變，雞蛋扔向高牆便爆爛，我們的力量很快便會被消耗殆盡，若然我們身段柔軟，雞蛋外殻像橡膠，扔向高牆可以彈跳回來，我們力量便可以堅持下去作持久戰。」法官李素蘭問黎是否叫人行動有如「像橡膠」？黎同意，即是靈活有彈性。李素蘭追問，那麼黎即是鼓勵人抗爭？黎否認，強調他沒有鼓勵不在香港的人抗爭，而是鼓勵仍然留下的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否意圖煽動他人使用暴力？黎否認，重申他是叫人要靈活、謙卑、不要固執和死守原則。法官李運騰提到文中：「納入基本法附件三的《港區國安法》，令有些人抗拒簽署確認書，立場是正確，但策略是錯誤的」，問黎是否叫人透過簽署確認書來抗爭？黎指他意思是叫人不要執著於原則。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章指若國安法不被使用則美國放緩制裁-黎太天真&quot;&gt;文章指若國安法不被使用則美國放緩制裁 黎：太天真&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章指：「國安法掀起國際政府的反彈前所未有，最後國際對中國的制裁會比當年六四更有過之而無不及，而正好是中國經濟、社會和外交上，遇到經濟開放四十年以來最大危機。」辯方指，文章刊出的時候，《國安法》已經實施了19至20日，而特朗普亦已頒布了行政命令，問黎是否鼓勵特朗普做他所做的事？黎否認，因特朗普已經頒布了行政命令，他只是思考未來會發生什麼事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章亦指：「更重要的是要讓美國等西方國家看到，儘管有國安法，為的只是平息抗爭的震懾效果，還是按法不動的，讓他們放緩制裁等懲罰措施，不要給水深火熱的習近平再添麻煩。」辯方問黎為何會說「按法不動」？黎表示這只是他一廂情願的想法，當時認為如果香港的運動被平息，《國安法》不會被使用，美國和西方國家便不會再實施制裁，但是形容自己想法「太天真」。辯方指黎的文章提到「放緩制裁」，問黎想鼓吹增加制裁嗎？黎指不是，他是說如果《國安法》沒有被使用的話，他想放緩制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章最後指：「我也不相信美國等西方國家對中共的制裁會放緩，中共與美國等西方國家的關係大勢已去，暫時是無法逆轉的。我更不相信中共對香港最後不會拉人封艇，進一步打壓。」黎表示，他的意思是不相信美國和西方國家對中共的制裁會放緩。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否在文章鼓勵外國向中國實施制裁、封鎖或敵對行動？黎否認，重申他只是揣測未來會發生什麼事，而沒有鼓勵任何事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述控方專家證人、城大法律學院教授、梁美芬丈夫王貴國證供指，黎在此文章認為制裁是有效措施。黎則否認，指文章沒有說過制裁有效，也沒有談及制裁的效用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

However, the threat it faces is significant, and it falls short in many important dimensions of resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines Taiwan’s resilience in the face of external threats, especially from the People’s Republic of China. Taiwan’s geopolitical, technological, and economic importance in the Indo-Pacific region has made it a focal point of U.S. strategic interests, especially in countering Chinese influence and aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this report, resilience refers to the will and ability of a country, society, or population to resist, mitigate, and recover from external pressure, influence, or potential invasion, as well as non-geopolitical threats, including climate change, natural disasters, and global pandemics. The report develops a framework for assessing a country’s resilience that includes eight components: strategic design and command structures, legal authorities, strategic communications, civil defenses, critical infrastructure, will to fight, nonviolent resistance and stay-behind networks, and integration with allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assessing these areas, the report concludes that Taiwan has taken important steps to strengthen resilience over the last several years. But its efforts thus far are insufficient considering the enormity of the near- and long-term threats it faces. For example, while the Taiwanese government conducts annual drills such as the Han Kuang, Wan An, Min An, Tung-Hsin, and Tzu Chiang exercises, which simulate responses to invasions and blockades, there is little evidence of a coordinated and effective civilian readiness program that addresses economic and social disruptions. This gap is critical, especially considering current and future Chinese activities that could target Taiwan’s financial systems, electricity grid, telecommunications network, and other aspects of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of the readiness and resolve of Taiwan’s civilian population to resist in the event of foreign aggression also remains concerning. Historically, sentiments seen in widespread public support for movements like the Sunflower Student Movement in 2014, which opposed closer ties with China, suggest the potential for resilience and resistance. However, without clear, robust civil defense education and mobilization strategies, the extent to which ordinary Taiwanese would engage in active resistance remains unclear. As evident in Ukraine’s heroic response to Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion, a population’s will to fight is vital not only to the act of resistance but also for galvanizing international support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Taiwan has taken important steps to strengthen resilience over the last several years. But its efforts thus far are insufficient considering the enormity of the near- and long-term threats it faces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also concludes that there is a lack of U.S. and international attention and effort to systematically assess Taiwan’s resilience and develop a comprehensive assistance plan to improve resilience. Much of the U.S. military focus has been on providing military capabilities and training to Taiwan to help resist a conventional invasion. The United States has also engaged with Taiwan through initiatives like the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue (EPPD), which includes a focus on technology and security. However, U.S. efforts have not been sufficient to help Taipei meet the full spectrum of threats it faces, including increasing pressure in the gray zone, or to prepare society as a whole to withstand external threats and coercion. As this report’s review of historical cases suggests, a population that lacks resilience is vulnerable to external aggression and internal division. A robust societal resilience strategy is essential not only for deterrence but also for the long-term survival of Taiwan and its society in the face of Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help improve resilience in Taiwan, this report contains specific recommendations in such areas as (1) raising threat awareness among the people of Taiwan through a more systematic strategic communications plan; (2) improving ties to the private sector, including companies involved in critical infrastructure; (3) bolstering Taiwan’s energy infrastructure, especially in such areas as the power grid; and (4) increasing strategic reserves and redundancy of food and energy. The report also makes specific recommendations for the United States and other international supporters in such areas as enhancing the effectiveness of the EPPD, bolstering and expanding the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF), strengthening cooperation between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service and the Taiwanese Ministry of Agriculture, and expanding U.S. military coordination, including in such areas as bolstering the population’s will to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A robust societal resilience strategy is essential not only for deterrence but also for the long-term survival of Taiwan and its society in the face of Chinese aggression.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other steps would not only help strengthen Taiwan’s will and ability to resist external pressure, influence, and potential invasion but also strengthen deterrence by raising the costs and risks for an aggressor, reducing the overall risk of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chater-1-introduction&quot;&gt;Chater 1 Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Is this a call to war? Does anyone pretend that preparation for resistance to aggression is unleashing war? I declare it to be the sole guarantee of peace.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-winston-churchill-october-16-1938&quot;&gt;— Winston Churchill, October 16, 1938&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all previous Chinese leaders, President Xi Jinping has warned that he “will never promise to give up the use of force” and that he reserves “the option to take all necessary measures” to formally annex Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Despite this being Beijing’s long-standing policy on Taiwan, past leaders did not have the military capabilities to make good on this threat. But because Xi does, the United States and Taiwan have focused on strengthening defense cooperation to deter the direct use of military force, whether in the form of an invasion or a blockade. There has been far less focus, however, on how China might undermine Taiwan’s critical infrastructure, disrupt its economy, leverage a crisis to undermine public morale, or otherwise undermine its overall resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is not hypothetical: Beijing probes Taiwan’s resilience daily. In early 2023, a Chinese vessel was suspected of intentionally damaging an undersea cable linking one of Taiwan’s islands to the mainland, disrupting online bank and point-of-sale machines. More recently, a China-linked hacker entity was discovered targeting Taiwan-based semiconductor and aerospace companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serious questions remain about how resilient Taiwan would be in the face of a Chinese invasion or gray zone activity. Taiwan’s electricity infrastructure, last significantly updated decades ago, is a critical vulnerability. The grid frequently experiences failures, notably during peak demand periods or extreme weather events. Similarly, Taiwan’s communications networks, still reliant on older technologies, face threats of disruption from both physical attacks and cyberattacks, which could isolate communities during crucial times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there has been little comprehensive analysis of resilience in Taiwan. In addition, the United States and other governments have not developed systematic frameworks to assess the resilience of Taiwan or other countries in the face of foreign threats, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and design aid packages accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, U.S. military and diplomatic aid to Taiwan has largely neglected the resilience of Taiwan and its society. Much of the U.S. focus has been on ensuring Taiwan has the capabilities to resist a conventional invasion, including providing or selling such weapons systems as F-16 fighter jets, M1 Abrams main battle tanks, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) multiple rocket launchers, Harpoon coastal defense systems, and Javelin antitank weapon systems. The United States has also provided limited direct training to Taiwan’s military, largely owing to the restrictions and ambiguities of the One China Policy, which governs the United States’ unofficial relationship with Taiwan. Although these somewhat limited efforts are necessary to strengthen deterrence, U.S. actions and boldness have not been sufficient to help Taipei meet the full spectrum of threats it faces or prepare Taiwanese society to withstand significant external coercion. As a review of historical cases suggests, a population that lacks resilience is in danger from external aggression and internal collapse. As North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg observed in 2020, “Our military cannot be strong if our societies are weak.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-resilience&quot;&gt;The Challenge of Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s dilemma, however, is not unique. Many countries must manage the risk of aggression from powerful neighbors, and Taiwan can learn much from their example. Some countries focus heavily not just on a strong military but also on building societal resilience, an elusive concept involving all of society. The Swedish Ministry of Defence defines resilience in its Resistance Operating Concept as “the will and ability to withstand external pressures and influences and/or recover from the effects of these pressures or influences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As used here, resilience is the will and ability of a country, society, or population to resist and recover from external pressure, influence, and potential invasion as well as major natural disasters such as hurricanes and pandemics. In practice, resilience has many aspects ranging from practical questions, such as how to keep the lights on, to ineffable but vital issues such as building a will to resist and will to fight among the population. Resilience is related to resistance, which includes nonviolent and violent activities to reestablish independence after conquest by a foreign power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world saw such resilience in practice in Ukraine. After Russia seized Crimea in 2014 and then fomented an insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian government and society responded effectively to Russian cyberattacks and aggression below the threshold of conventional war. After Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukrainians quickly rallied to resist the occupiers. Their resistance efforts, ranging from removing road signs to confuse occupiers to sabotage and assassination, slowed advancing forces, providing valuable time to organize Ukraine’s military forces to repel invaders and gain international support. In addition, resilience made life better for ordinary Ukrainians, preserving vital health services and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although resilience is vital in a crisis, its greatest value lies in amplifying deterrence. If a country is seen as difficult to disrupt, conquer, or occupy, it becomes a less attractive target, and could change the calculus for the aggressor. Conversely, if an adversary perceives a country as lacking resilience, it may be an appealing target. The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy emphasizes the need to build resilience to help advance collective NATO security. Indeed, democratic societies can excel at deterrence by strengthening resilience, drawing on whole-of-society approaches more effectively than autocracies. Finnish scholars have referred to this logic as the idea that “even the biggest bear will not eat a porcupine.” During the Cold War, the Baltic states, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and other countries pursued a “porcupine” strategy, and some have renewed these programs in the face of renewed Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, both NATO and the European Union have embraced resilience. The European Union has a Critical Entities Resilience Directive that provides mandatory standards to EU members. Europe, in general, is also improving its standards. NATO has had resilience goals since the 1950s, but often, until recently, these were honored in the breach. Not surprisingly, since the invasion of Ukraine, NATO has emphasized that all its members should build resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Taiwan become more resilient, it would be far better able to resist pressure from China, and strengthening deterrence would make an invasion less likely. Before a crisis, Taiwan’s infrastructure and morale would be more difficult to disrupt, and various gray zone strategies to create instability would fail. If crisis looms, Beijing’s leaders would know the Taiwanese will resist and are well-prepared to do so. Further, should China occupy all or part of Taiwan, this propensity to resist would dramatically complicate Beijing’s plans to fully annex the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and Taiwan are not alone. Autocracies often use hybrid warfare and other means to undermine resilience and weaken liberal democracies. Thus, lessons that apply to these and other countries are relevant to a wide range of U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-research-design&quot;&gt;Methodology and Research Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To examine resilience in Taiwan, this report asks three questions. First, what is resilience, and what are the various factors that comprise it? Second, how resilient is Taiwan in the face of a threat from China? Third, what steps can Taiwan, the United States, and other partners take to increase resilience in Taiwan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this paper draws on several sources. First, it draws on a large volume of secondary literature on resilience. Second, it examines secondary and primary sources from NATO and resilience leaders like Finland. Instead of conducting comprehensive case studies, the authors integrated lessons from several countries with a history of resilience, such as Estonia, Finland, Israel, Switzerland, and Ukraine. Third, the authors conducted interviews on background about resilience in the United States, Taiwan, Finland, Estonia, Ukraine, and Israel. The interviews were conducted on the condition of anonymity; in some cases, a general descriptor is provided, while in others the person is not acknowledged as the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is important to examine lessons from other countries for Taiwan, resilience is context specific. For example, Finland’s history (including the November 1939 Soviet invasion during the Winter War), geography (particularly the 833-mile border with Russia), conscription, and other social, cultural, and historical factors have contributed to a sui generis form of resilience. There is, of course, no cookie-cutter solution to strengthening resilience in Taiwan. Nevertheless, this report identifies several factors Taiwan should consider and apply in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outline-of-the-report&quot;&gt;Outline of the Report&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this paper has four chapters. Chapter 2 briefly discusses the different dimensions of resilience, noting how resilience matters before, during, and after a potential invasion. The report then identifies different components of resilience, ranging from initial strategic design to protecting infrastructure to developing the capacity to work with supporting countries. Examples from Finland and other countries illustrate these elements. Chapter 3 assesses the state of Taiwanese resilience today. Chapter 4 outlines recommendations, including what Taipei might do to improve resilience in the future and how the United States and regional partners might bolster Taiwanese resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chatper-2-building-resilience&quot;&gt;Chatper 2 Building Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience is vital at different stages of a conflict. It is meant to supplement, not replace, traditional military-focused deterrence and defensive measures. One of the most important roles of resilience occurs before a conflict begins. A country believed to be resilient is likely harder to conquer and subjugate. Attackers know that the defenders are prepared and likely to fight and that controlling the population will be difficult and resource intensive. One interviewee referred to this as “deterrence by frustration.” Most resilience activities are open; thus an adversary observes many of them in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should deterrence fail, resilience is also vital during gray zone conflict, or conflict short of all-out hostilities. Adversaries may try to undermine faith in government by disseminating disinformation, launching cyberattacks that disable critical infrastructure, or backing minority groups or political factions that are potentially hostile to the government. Russia sent “little green men” — armed soldiers without insignia who denied ties to Moscow — as part of its successful effort to seize Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Resiliency efforts that ensure robust infrastructure, educate the population to counter disinformation, enable the government to act decisively in response to covert provocations, and reduce social cleavages all make a country less susceptible to subversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the initiation of all-out war, resiliency takes on additional roles. Adversaries’ efforts to take down power and communications through physical and cyber means affect the warfighting capability of the defending state. A local population can provide intelligence to the adversary or the host nation, aiding the targeting of either side. Lack of resistance can free up adversary forces, helping them devote additional manpower to the front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, resilience is vital should an adversary defeat a host nation’s military forces and impose its government on the country. A resilient society can make it harder for the occupier to consolidate its political and economic position. In addition to helping basic services reach a needy population, resiliency can reduce the impact of adversary propaganda and preserve forms of legitimate government. Resilience may involve passive resistance, where workers slow their performance, miscount goods sought by the enemy, or otherwise hinder the adversary war effort without violence. Resilience through better communications and infrastructure can also ensure lifelines to friendly foreign governments, including the United States, which may represent the best hope of liberation. More broadly, resilience sets the stage for successful resistance, which, though not the focus of this study, makes guerrilla war and counterattacks easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;components-of-resilience&quot;&gt;Components of Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience has many components. NATO, for example, has stressed the necessity of continuity of government; energy, food, and water supplies; civil communications; and maintaining transportation systems, among other needs. NATO’s Resilience Committee has an array of specialized planning groups to this end. Finland, perhaps the world’s leader when it comes to resilience, has a different approach to resilience, highlighted in Appendix A. Its diamond model includes such categories as psychological resilience; leadership; international and EU activities; defense capability; internal security; functional capacity of the population and services; and economy, infrastructure, and security of supply. Finland also has developed 57 tasks for resilience, presented in Appendix B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in Table 1, this chapter details eight key components of resilience: (1) strategic design and command structures, (2) legal authorities, (3) strategic communications and educating the population, (4) civil defenses, (5) critical infrastructure, (6) will to fight, (7) nonviolent resistance and stay-behind networks, and (8) integration with partners and allies. The authors identified these components, which represent a framework for understanding resilience in a given country, based on an overview of historical cases, interviews of experts, and relevant literature. The rest of this chapter describes each of the components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Design and Command Structures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments require an overall plan that incorporates the many aspects of resilience, specifying the general goals, division of labor, conditions under which parts of the plan go into effect, the locations of caches of medical and communications equipment, and other essentials. It is vital to have a lead agency that develops and coordinates resilience efforts. Often the ministry of defense or its equivalent is the lead planning entity, though there are many possibilities. Other agencies take responsibility in their bureaucratic realms. A ministry of justice might prepare necessary legal authorities to monitor and arrest suspected subversives in advance of a crisis and increase surveillance when necessary. Agencies involved in disaster response or civil emergencies might prepare to ensure the robustness of the electricity grid and alleviate food and medicine shortages. The communications ministry might develop a narrative and distribute preparation materials, while the ministry of foreign affairs might focus on where a government in exile might go and how to ensure external backing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duties will vary depending on the relevant stage. Before a crisis, for example, a disaster response–focused agency might educate the public on resources available in a crisis. When the crisis begins, it might turn its focus to identifying shortfalls and implementing protocols. If the enemy occupies the territory, the agency might help the population prepare for power shortages during combat. The list is long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Components of Resilience.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience is an all-of-society effort. Government usually leads in planning, but civil society and especially the private sector are vital, especially as much of the critical infrastructure and other capabilities are in the hands of business — a shift from the Cold War era. In 2016, 90 percent of NATO military transport came from the private sector, as did much of NATO’s satellite communications. There must be a planning and command structure that integrates the private sector so the business community knows its roles before and during a crisis and the government knows businesses’ requirements, needs, and limits. Although all these actors are important, the most crucial is an empowered and motivated population that is psychologically prepared to deal with a threat. In a crisis, resilience largely involves bottom-up efforts or coordination without government assistance, so strong connections and extensive preparation of citizens are vital. Efforts must be updated regularly as threat conditions change and capabilities move from one entity to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important task is to identify and reduce vulnerabilities before a crisis. NATO has put forward some evaluation criteria to help with resilience assessment. The range is vast, from anticipating and countering adversary propaganda to securing borders, building cyber protection, and developing rapid-repair capabilities. Governments must determine who will oversee testing and then regularly test capabilities through exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland provides a useful model for strategic design and command structures. Its Security Strategy for Society outlines a comprehensive strategy jointly formulated by the government and representatives from the private sector, though the planning process includes opportunities for contributions from civic organizations. The concept of preparedness planning outlined in the strategy involves not only national preparedness but also independent preparedness of businesses, communities, and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland seeks to integrate different components of government, business, and society. The Ministry of Defence runs the 24-person Security Committee, which meets monthly with government representatives from various ministries, with representatives from the president’s office, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). By bringing together different parts of society outside the government, the goal is a broader “network of trust.” Numerous structures at the regional and municipal levels design local approaches that involve the government, businesses, civil society organizations, and communities. The government’s role is based on law, while the role of business is based, in part, on law but often on agreements and voluntary decisions. By contrast, civil society and community participation is often voluntary. The goal is a scalable concept where municipalities are in the lead at the local level while the national government is in charge of the whole country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the resilience strategy is not for resilience alone to allow Finland to triumph against a threat. Rather, part of the goal is to help Finland survive on its own for several weeks, or perhaps several months, until allies can come to its assistance. In addition, the purpose is to reduce the cost of conflict to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s Ministry of Defence plays a lead role, outlining vital functions that must be preserved. Under the ministry, which coordinates and advises (but does not direct) various other ministries, the Security Committee is a key coordinating body, with high officials from other ministries participating. The Security Committee produces a joint situation report and works across the government, while individual ministries are responsible for preparedness in their domain. For example, the Ministry of the Interior has prepared a National Risk Assessment that identifies a range of threat scenarios, including financial pressure, terrorism, and communications technology disruption. This assessment is published every three years, but authorities constantly assess the threat situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland regularly updates plans to ensure that changing technologies, business models, and other factors are properly integrated. For example, it updates its risk assessment every three to five years. It also makes changes in response to world events, such as increasing the required grain supply reserve after the invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Finland, government bodies conduct drills and emergency exercises to identify potential weak points. Some of these are tabletop exercises, while others are real-world ones. For example, Finland “cut” power cables in exercises to test repair and response capacity in certain parts of the country. Civil-military relations are at the core of successful resilience. In almost every aspect of resilience design and strategy, civil authorities and civil society participate in the process. As one Finnish official stated, “If that works, all is well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Authorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience functions must be legal, and the government’s legitimacy must be sustained. But crises and war can strain these essentials. NATO stresses “continuity of government” as a core part of resilience and civil preparedness. The law must recognize the risk of subversion and make provisions to prevent hostile foreign ownership of sites near military bases, defense production facilities, energy plants, and other critical infrastructure. Governance and legal legitimacy must adjust between peacetime, wartime, and occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation might empower certain local bodies under occupation conditions or, conversely, declare in advance that any government body within occupied territory does not have authority — a way of denying legitimacy to actions by puppet governments and local quislings. Governments will also need to prepare a body of laws that allow for operational security and resistance to the occupier, most of which are well outside typical democratic civil codes. For example, many countries in Europe have strict limits on the use of their militaries in domestic situations, but those would need to be amended to handle foreign paramilitary forces masquerading as civilians, as happened in Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland has numerous laws on the books for emergency circumstances, and these come into play if Parliament invokes an emergency. Charly Salonius-Pasternak of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs calls this the “boring, unsexy work” vital for preparedness. For example, Section 111 of the Emergency Powers Act states, “In order to increase or maintain military defense readiness . . . the defense forces can, by decision, oblige companies, communities, institutions, and professionals and entrepreneurs to provide the defense forces with renovation, accommodation, repair shops, maintenance, construction and other similar services.” In addition, the government can give orders to civilian industry regarding whom they sell to and what they sell. Other parts of the act offer guidance on forced recruitment, wages, requisitioning buildings, and other concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crisis, Finland has a series of laws that go into effect, such as automatically allowing reservists to be called up for more than the peacetime maximum number of days or allowing companies to cooperate in ways that, in peacetime, would be considered cartel behavior. The Ministry of Interior also has greater authority to conduct investigations during an emergency, though there is still strong respect for the rule of law. After Russia’s invasion of Crimea, Finland amended the law, allowing the military to use force in such circumstances. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Finland invoked the law for the first time since World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland also has laws that allow the government to deny property purchases close to military bases or critical infrastructure; it has done so to block Russian purchases of real estate near Finnish industry and military bases in the east. The government may also remove or block companies with subpar critical infrastructure, enabling it to remove companies like Huawei if necessary. In 2024, Finland’s government proposed a widespread ban against Russian citizens from buying property in the country, though it exempted dual Finnish-Russian citizens and Russians with permanent residence in Finland or other EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government must also plan for its own displacement, exile, or diminishment and ensure it retains legitimate legal authority. In such circumstances, some members will likely be absent, elections will not occur, and other basic components of a democratic system may be lacking. During a conflict, leaders may have to flee one part of the country for another or enter exile, which may require identifying an ally that will host the government-in-exile. In 1940, Latvia authorized its ambassadors in the United Kingdom and the United States to control state money deposited abroad. During the Cold War, Switzerland arranged to have a government-in-exile in Ireland should it be overrun. Norway put personnel records and other information relevant to running a resistance in its embassies in London and Washington. That government-in-exile must maintain contact with, and ideally some command over, any shadow government established in occupied areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Communications and Educating the Population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments must communicate with their publics in advance of a crisis and have means to do so in situations when communications are disrupted, disinformation is high, or some of the population is under occupation. In crisis situations, there is a strong risk of competing narratives, themes, and messages as the adversary sows disinformation and uses its communications to appeal to disaffected minorities and others who might embrace its message. Because of the importance of information operations and propaganda to warfare, helping the population identify and resist propaganda and misinformation is also vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the Lithuanian government disseminated Prepare to Survive Emergencies and War: A Cheerful Take on Serious Recommendations. The 75-page instruction manual offers information on how Russia might conduct information operations, provides images of Russian weaponry so citizens can provide intelligence more accurately, and repeatedly stresses the need to resist, among other important information. Latvia and Estonia have published similar manuals. Sweden’s version — If Crisis or War Comes — details how the population should survive without government assistance: “If Sweden is attacked by another country, we will never give up. All information to the effect that resistance is to cease is false.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland has similar efforts. It produced a 19-minute film, Battlefield 2020, to introduce its population to what modern war might look like. The film depicts cyberattacks on the financial infrastructure, sabotage of water supplies, and other aspects of conflict beyond war itself. Since the February 2022 full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Finnish media have widely distributed video footage and other imagery of Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian civilian and defense targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In normal times, each Finnish ministry is highly independent and plans its own communications related to comprehensive security for its area of focus. In a crisis, however, the Prime Minister’s Office has more authority and resources to increase its staff, and in a true emergency communications become far more centralized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Finnish Ministry of Defence also conducts regular courses for business leaders, politicians, media leaders, and religious figures, among others, with tens of thousands participating, often at a regional level. There are three courses: one at the national level that runs four times a year and lasts three-and-a-half weeks, specialized courses that run two or three times a year and last two-and-a-half days, and regional defense courses that run 20 or more times a year and last for a week. Around 10,000 people have gone through a course at the national level, 3,000 at the specialized level, and 65,000 at the regional level. Such courses, which are by invitation only, are, in part, intended to discover what problems individuals and businesses would face in a crisis, give people a shared threat and response structure, build bonds among participants, and educate people on likely difficulties. An invitation to such courses is prestigious: participants are “joining the anointed.” Further, trainers attempt to impress participants, such as by showing them military systems. This contributes to a will to fight by bringing a broad range of important people into the national defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Finland is well prepared for resisting disinformation: corruption is low, confidence in government is high, the population is highly educated and learns media literacy, and there are few social cleavages to exploit. NGOs patrol for disinformation, and the Strategic Communications Office in the Prime Minister’s Office analyzes the information environment for disinformation about Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finnish media also play an important role in combating disinformation. As free media, they often take the lead in determining what is accurate, with government officials simply advising them of possible disinformation and the media making decisions about whether and how to respond. In addition, the state national broadcasting company Yle provides a reliable media source and has a legal obligation to communicate with citizens during a crisis. This independence, however, diminishes in an emergency, and the Prime Minister’s Office can censor media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribution is often an important part of successful strategic communications and reducing the impact of disinformation. In particular, governments may need to identify who is behind disinformation to discredit it and properly educate the population. In addition, successful attribution makes a population angry at foreign subversion, not at their own government, should the electricity fail or another problem develop. At times, a “name-and-shame” approach may make an adversary less likely to act: for example, the legal process can highlight the hostility of a potential adversary even if its operatives do not show up in court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Defenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resilient population prepares for a conflict and must be involved in designated services that increase resilience in society as a whole. For example, individuals might store batteries and water at home to better manage disruptions. They also might be assigned emergency roles, such as medical and rescue services. Many might serve as auxiliaries to an underground resistance, assisting with procurement, recruitment, early warning, media distribution, intelligence collection, and other vital roles. Both the government and voluntary organizations can organize some of this in advance of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citizens need places to shelter in case of attack and must be able to receive important medical and other services. It is also vital for municipalities and civil society organizations to be prepared to evacuate the elderly, the sick, and other vulnerable populations. During the Cold War, the Swiss prepared fighting positions at key locations, such as near or at bridges, tunnels, or hillsides to increase the effectiveness of small units in case of an invasion. Swiss efforts were part of a concept of “total defense,” which involved a whole-of-society approach to defending the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland uses the Local Forces — or reservists who volunteer for additional exercises and duties and are called up in the case of natural disasters — to bolster preparedness. It also has plans to evacuate the civilian population from certain areas where fighting will likely be intense. The country is also prepared for bombing. By law, all large buildings must have bomb shelters. Car parks, swimming pools, and other facilities can also be converted into bomb shelters. Jarmo Lindberg, the former chief of defense, says underground Helsinki “is like Swiss cheese,” with tunnels throughout, and all military headquarters are under “30–40 meters of granite.” Many of the large shelters are important civic spaces in peacetime, hosting sports facilities, parking, and school sports games and activities, or otherwise serving dual purposes, ensuring they are regularly used. All of Helsinki can shelter in an attack, and Finland has 45,000 civil defense shelters, which can accommodate more than half its population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland has also prepared border areas for attack. These include creating limited defenses to slow attacking forces, thus giving the local population more time to evacuate. In addition, by working with local communities in peacetime, the Finnish government has developed extensive evacuation plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morale and well-being depend on continued electricity, communications, energy, healthcare, and other essential services. These types of critical infrastructure require general hardening to make disruption more difficult and improve redundancy and rapid repair capacity in case disruption occurs due to cyberattacks, physical damage, or occupation. Strengthening critical infrastructure also requires vetting foreign investment to ensure it is not subject to hostile foreign exploitation in a crisis. In many cases, partial failure of initial defenses is expected, and the focus is on repair and resilience in dealing with limited services. Examples of critical infrastructure include the following sectors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Critical manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defense industrial base&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emergency services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Energy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Financial services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food and agriculture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government facilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Healthcare and public health&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information technology&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transportation systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Water and wastewater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, much of the critical infrastructure of Western countries was in government hands, but now much of it is outside government control, with key industries such as transportation, internet services, and satellite communications mostly in private hands. Many companies, unsurprisingly, are focused on profits, not national security. In addition, many large companies are global in their workforce, have some degree of foreign ownership, depend on foreign parts or labor for some of their supply chains, or otherwise are not fully national.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some degree of national and personal stockpiling is important. The Baltic states have laws in place requiring reserves of vital goods. The European Union also requires member countries to have minimum crude oil stocks equal to 90 days of daily imports or 61 days of consumption, whichever is greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats are a constant concern. Countries at risk of attack are constantly probed by potential adversaries and near-constant threats from criminal networks or other malicious actors. Key personnel may also face risks to their physical security. Beginning in 2014, Russia conducted an aggressive cyber campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure, from the power grid to the banking system, in response to the departure of pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and deepening Ukrainian ties with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring diverse means of communication is also vital. The standard ways people communicate, such as email and cell phone, are highly vulnerable to disruption and monitoring. Resistance forces may use a wide range of radios, so having large numbers of cheap and expendable devices will be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, Switzerland prepared every major road, bridge, and other type of key infrastructure for rapid demolition. To do this, the Swiss rigged bridges and tunnels with explosives or kept stockpiles nearby in case of a Soviet invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Finland, ensuring the continued functioning of critical infrastructure is a top priority. The National Emergency Supply Agency (NESA), which operates under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, is responsible for the resilience of the economy, infrastructure, and supply and is a key body for engaging industry and the private sector and maintaining critical stockpiles and security of supply. NESA helps coordinate government action and works with around 1,500 companies involved in supply security, with corporate representatives often playing a leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NESA divides its tasks into seven sectors: health, transportation and logistics, finance and insurance, industry, food supply, energy, and a catch-all other category. Each sector, in turn, has numerous subsectors. These subsectors are coordinated by a pool committee with its own budget. Pools comprise representatives from the most important companies, an overall industry representative, a NESA representative, a representative from the relevant ministry (e.g., transportation for the rail network), and a representative of the armed forces. The pools are often the key bodies for critical infrastructure resilience. They provide a venue for the most important actors to meet, build trust, train and exercise, make proposals for improvement, and strengthen sharing of critical information and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private companies play an important role in the process (and at times assume leadership roles), with infrastructure operators assessing their own networks. Companies provide information on their limits and vulnerabilities, contributing to a common threat and risk picture and enabling more comprehensive action. For example, hundreds of companies might exchange threat information related to cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NESA has agreements with various Finnish companies responsible for the supply of grain, oil, pharmaceuticals, and other critical stocks. It also has arrangements with grocery stores to ensure sufficient supplies of food in case of a major cyberattack or disruption to the electricity grid. The most important requirements are set by law. Energy, for example, is necessary for defense production and thus requires high standards to ensure its supply in a crisis. Finland has stockpiles of at least several months of fuel, grain, critical spare parts, and imported pharmaceuticals, among other necessities, with the level of legal and state contracting roles and the size of the stockpile varying by its perceived importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some industries are expected to ramp up production if they produce goods such as weapons or medical supplies. Select companies may move to a more secure location, including within a Finnish Defense Forces (FDF) facility, while others may receive physical and cyber protection from the government. The government also has authority to allocate the power supply, which will affect production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most instances, pool participation is voluntary, though in some areas there are legal requirements and, in general, companies must provide the information NESA requires on issues such as production levels and supply chains. Shirking is possible, but there are limits and it is relatively rare. In Finland, companies must work with the government to create a list of critical employees who cannot be called for service during wartime. In addition, they have contracts with the military and government, which shirking would jeopardize. Perhaps most important in a small country are reputation and personal connections. Small companies that work for the prime contractors, however, are harder to influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finnish officials regularly test the system for speed and quality of response, as it is too late after a crisis starts. Some testing involves tabletop exercises. Officials working on cybersecurity test their defenses through quarterly exercises in a simulated environment, but they also use real-world situations (e.g., a natural disaster that leads electricity to fail) to evaluate various systems. At times, they will cut off electricity to one city or otherwise simulate a major crisis. The Covid-19 crisis and the supply disruptions that occurred after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine revealed supply chain vulnerabilities in the system; poor supervision of some medical stockpiles, such as face masks; and the limits of NESA when procuring personal protective equipment. Finland treated all of these as learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign companies that do business in Finland are also expected to participate in pools or otherwise protect critical infrastructure, either directly or through subsidiaries. All are subject to Finnish law, but voluntary participation is also encouraged. In some sensitive areas, such as the arms pool, Chinese and Russian companies are not allowed. Weapons system manufacturers must ensure that a Finnish company or Finnish subsidiary can perform the maintenance, repair, and overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland mandates that its military operate, maintain, and repair all critical defense systems, and industry take the lead on maintenance and repair for many systems. Similarly, U.S. companies such as Mandiant and FireEye are often critical for cyber defense, and they have partnerships in Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearances, or at least access to classified information, are often vital so private actors in business and NGOs can see the broader threat picture and access the full range of possible responses. Finland also has developed security clearance procedures so the individuals responsible for critical infrastructure can receive secret information. A digital platform allows them to share classified information, so to be in certain critical pools (e.g., weapons production), clearance is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security can be a challenge for companies. They may fear espionage or threats against key workers from a foreign power. To reduce this danger, Finnish companies publish less information on personnel than before and encourage personnel to reveal less on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will to Fight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of resilience is the will to fight: When a country is attacked, will the population participate in and support the armed forces and engage in resistance? The will to fight includes the willingness of a population — or key parts of the population — to resist an adversary and fight. It is perhaps best captured in British prime minister Winston Churchill’s speech before the House of Commons in June 1940, when Britain was facing a likely German invasion: “We shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will to fight is difficult to predict in advance, though several analysts have made progress on this knotty question. Russia disastrously assumed Ukrainians would not fight Russian invaders in 2022. Governments must inculcate a will to fight and, just as importantly, convey that determination to potential invaders to enhance deterrence. In the Baltics, defense and other officials speak to schools about resistance and otherwise incorporate security into the education system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors generally increase the will to fight among individuals, units, and even societies: high stakes, including national survival; ideology, particularly a deep commitment to a cause or belief system; financial incentives; social or group identity; strong allies; and the capability and cohesion of individuals and units, which can be affected by training, education, leadership, and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To undermine a will to fight, hostile governments will try to exploit fissures in a society through information operations or subversive activity in advance of a crisis and divide-and-rule methods when they occupy territory. A more atomized society is less likely to put up effective resistance. The withdrawal of outside assistance can also undermine the will to fight. In Afghanistan, for example, the will to fight of the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police collapsed following the decision by the United States and NATO to withdraw all military forces and the failed leadership of President Ashraf Ghani, contributing to the Taliban overthrow of the Afghan government in 2021. The same was true in South Vietnam under General Nguyen Van Thieu, including after the withdrawal of U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing civic support leagues, national services, or other means to bring people together can build patriotic sentiment, as can ensuring that all communities identify strongly with the homeland. Such efforts must avoid any hint of partisanship. Resilience emphasizes the country, not the government in power at a given moment, and it must transcend party politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Finland, there is a strong sense throughout society that independence cannot be taken for granted. Although the government takes the lead on many aspects of resilience, much of the emphasis is on the individual level. One senior government official remarked, “The people must know they are the key actors. They must feel they can count on themselves rather than rely on others to take action. If individuals will act, many of the other functions become easier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual citizens are also meant to have some degree of self-reliance. The government encourages citizens to retain sufficient stockpiles of food, water, and other essentials for 72 hours at least. These include duct tape, which in Finland is casually referred to as “Jesus tape” because it performs miracles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland enjoys some of the highest levels of social trust in the world. The country also has made a robust effort to counter Russian narratives and otherwise build its resistance to adversary propaganda and disinformation, with the hope of bolstering psychological resilience. Many of these efforts begin at an early age; even kindergarten students receive some training, while for 16- and 17-year-olds, schools organize a security day to introduce students to key concepts. Finland also regularly makes citizens aware of potential threats and tries to inculcate the idea that they have some degree of agency by participating in resilience activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland appears to have a high will to fight. Before the invasion of Ukraine, opinion polls showed that over three-quarters of the population said they were willing to fight to defend their country — even when the question stressed “even if the outcome is uncertain” — the highest percentage in Europe. Interviews suggest a high degree of confidence in the Finnish population’s willingness to fight, with many noting that the invasion of Ukraine produced a surge in support for activities related to resistance as well as joining NATO and even assisting NATO with missions outside of Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews suggest several reasons for this strong will to fight in Finland. First, Finland’s history as a victim of Russian aggression during World War II and subsequent Soviet threats created a strong culture of self-reliance and concern about a Russian enemy. Second, Finland has a strong sense of a Finnish way of life — including political and economic elements, such as democracy and the welfare state, and cultural ones, such as the sauna, social equality, and nature — all of which are seen as worth defending. Third, Finland has a strong sense of social trust and trust in government, which strengthens social bonds. In addition, the national defense courses bring a wide range of elites into the national security system, giving them a sense of common purpose and understanding of the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscription has also aided Finland’s will to fight, according to interviews, and polling suggests strong support for conscription. Finland maintains conscription to mobilize its population in a crisis and maintains a large network of reservists. As a result, much of Finnish society has been trained to fight, and they feel they have a stake in defense and some level of agency — or “active citizenship,” as one study phrases it. Conscription also creates bonds and understanding among citizens from different social classes, backgrounds, and parts of the country. Over 700,000 men and women are part of the FDG reserves (out of a total population of less than 6 million), and most families have one or more citizen-soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonviolent Resistance and Stay-Behind Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set the stage for the transition from resilience to resistance, some military and intelligence assets should be designated to stay behind in the event of an occupation to help resist the enemy and organize local intelligence networks. Stay-behind networks might include those focused on logistics, intelligence, messaging, education, transportation, sabotage, or medical support. In addition, the government may want to develop cache sites with weapons and ammunition, communication and medical equipment, and other essentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, leaders could be identified in advance to reduce the risk to those recruited to lead and participate in resistance and allow for a longer vetting and training period. For financial reasons, networks will not be fully staffed, so core groups should be identified and developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government will also want to give basic instructions to the population on how to collect intelligence that is useful to the resistance and external military forces. For example, instructing the population that an enemy might demolish bridges and telephone wires when they plan to leave is an example of how the local population might collect important indicators of enemy movements. It is also important to document adversary human rights abuses and other forms of repression to generate international sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the goal will be nonviolent resistance, at least some of which can be taught in advance. There are many activities that can confound an adversary, ranging from marches and protests to mock elections, leaflets, boycotts, refusing to rent to occupiers, displays of flags and other symbols, and many other means. If successful, this weakens the adversary’s control and decreases its legitimacy, both of which make an occupation more costly. In addition, it may attract external sympathy and thus greater support for eventual liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland incorporates the possibility of conflict into its infrastructure design. All major bridges have hooks on them for hanging explosives in order to destroy the bridge as enemy troops advance. Some highways are hardened and widened to serve as alternative runways for combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with Partners and Allies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most small countries trying to build resilience, long-term survival in the event of a conflict may depend on external supporters. Thus, the country must build diplomatic and military relationships with external protectors and supporters, using them to bolster resilience during a crisis. Short of a military campaign to reconquer lost territory, the support of outside powers is vital for continuity of government, supporting aspects of critical infrastructure, bolstering public morale, and other aspects of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diasporas are an important audience as well. Because of their family ties, shared language and heritage, and other connections, diasporas are often highly engaged and aware of conditions in their home countries. They can publicize abuses, lobby host governments, and otherwise aid the struggle for liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign help can be a mixed blessing. In some ways, the promise of foreign assistance can be an excuse for inaction, with governments relying on others, not their own people, in the event of a crisis. At the same time, support from the United States and its allies is often vital to encourage people not to surrender or otherwise collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltic countries have developed regional cooperation in the event of a foreign invasion, including policy coordination, exercises, training, and professional military education, including military exchanges. For Finland, NATO is an important source of advanced weapons and assistance in a crisis. But NATO membership is about more than warfighting or military assistance; it can also help with raw material gaps and supply chain dependency. There is also the possibility of joint stockpiling with neighbors such as Sweden. Entities like NESA work with neighboring states to coordinate energy supplies in case of a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Finland, of course, is not an island, it effectively becomes one if Baltic trade is cut off, as the amount of overland trade via other Scandinavian countries is limited. Around 80 percent of the country’s trade comes over the sea, and it relies heavily on imported energy. Thus, it is relatively easy for a powerful foe like Russia to cut off reliable imports in a crisis. In addition, the ports freeze in winter, making it even easier to isolate, while the land connections to Norway and Sweden are limited, with the railroad gauge being on the Russian system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-necessity-of-budgeting&quot;&gt;The Necessity of Budgeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Budgeting is an unglamorous but vital part of developing resilience. Indeed, it is essential for most, perhaps even all, of the above factors. Countries must invest in critical infrastructure, supplies, training, surge capacity for weapons, and other capacities of resilience, but this is difficult to justify because many of the capabilities will not be used on a day-to-day basis. Ideally, resilience should overlap with disaster preparedness. Some redundancy is necessary as power stations can be destroyed by either sabotage or massive storms, but often that linkage is limited. Because the private sector is so important, budgeting must help compensate private entities for losses but in a way that avoids playing favorites in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Finland, for example, NESA works with over 1,000 companies and has a multi-billion-dollar budget to maintain strategic supplies. NESA controls the National Emergency Supply Fund, which, in turn, is funded outside the budget by tax-like contributions on electricity, coal, natural gas, and other energy, generating about €38 million a year. NESA also has the authority to borrow around €200 million as state loans and receives funding from allocations derived from the national power grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland uses this money in several ways to ensure the functioning of critical infrastructure. It may provide companies with partial compensation for the cost of an extra production line or a larger stockpile. NESA also owns a mothballed coal-fired power plant as a backup power source and has contracted with Black Sea transport to ensure the flow of oil. Because NESA controls its own budget, it can also fund surge capacity, new stockpiles, or other needs rapidly, avoiding potentially disastrous delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Finland, the government also offers financial protections for those affected by emergencies that fall outside normal insurance situations, such as damage resulting from the action of a hostile foreign power. Chapter 19 of the Emergency Powers Act outlines the legal requirements for compensation and protections for persons who have suffered damages because of the rights and obligations authorized under exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter identifies eight key components of resilience: (1) strategic design and command structures, (2) legal authorities, (3) strategic communications and educating the population, (4) civil defenses, (5) critical infrastructure, (6) will to fight, (7) nonviolent resistance and stay-behind networks, and (8) integration with partners and allies. Each country, of course, is different, and there are no easy solutions to increase resilience. Nevertheless, this historical assessment of Finland and other cases suggests that strengthening a country in these categories — from legal authorities to critical infrastructure and will to fight — may have a compound effect by improving a country’s overall resilience and increasing deterrence. As a NATO study concludes, “Resilience is therefore an important aspect of deterrence by denial: persuading an adversary not to attack by convincing it that an attack will not achieve its intended objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-3-the-challenge-of-resilience-in-taiwan&quot;&gt;Chapter 3 The Challenge of Resilience in Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines the current and evolving threat to Taiwan, particularly from China. Building on the framework outlined in chapter 2, this chapter examines Taiwan’s activity in such areas as strategic design and command structure, legal authorities, strategic communications, civil defenses, critical infrastructure (including such areas as cyber defense, energy, communications infrastructure, food security, and government-private sector relations), will to fight, and integration with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to Taiwan’s Resilience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 1949, Taiwan has faced a range of direct threats from the PRC, including a possible full-scale invasion. After U.S. president Harry Truman ruled out the use of the U.S. military in the Taiwan Strait in early 1950, Chinese leader Mao Zedong positioned nearly half a million Chinese troops on the coastline directly across from Taiwan. The beginning of the Korean War that June, however, brought the U.S. Seventh Fleet into the waters off Taiwan to stop the war’s spread, and Mao had to shelve the idea of an invasion. Yet, in 1954 and again in 1958, Mao bombarded Taiwan’s outer islands with artillery attacks and mobilized the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) for an assault, only to be deterred by the prospect of U.S. intervention on behalf of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s, Beijing adjusted its formal guidance from “liberate Taiwan” to “unify Taiwan,” signaling a policy of increased flexibility on how the Chinese leadership sought annexation. But the threat of a direct assault returned in the mid-1990s after Beijing conducted a series of missile tests in the waters off Taiwan, and again in 2004 when the PRC National People’s Congress passed the Anti-Secession Law, which enshrined the use of “non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several decades, Taiwan has also faced a growing number of nonmilitary threats that pose significant risks to its security and stability. These range from economic pressure and cyberattacks to disinformation campaigns and diplomatic isolation. China’s use of coercive tactics, including formal and informal trade restrictions and the poaching of Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, has placed increasing stress on the island’s economy and international standing. Additionally, Beijing has developed an increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive tool kit of gray zone tactics that allows it to probe Taiwan’s defenses and the solidity of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship in ways that complicate a corresponding response by Taipei and Washington. This gray zone “sliding scale” allows Beijing to rachet up political and military pressure to place significant stress on the Taiwan leadership and its people without crossing a threshold of kinetic conflict with Taiwan or the United States. Indeed, perhaps fearing that a direct assault on Taiwan would lead to U.S. and allied condemnation and perhaps retaliation, Beijing has conducted military exercises that demonstrate the capability and possible intention to blockade or quarantine Taiwan but in a way that Beijing believes will not prompt a direct U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, China conducted military exercises in August 2022 in the wake of then U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and again in May 2024 after the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te to demonstrate that Beijing is growing more creative and confident in its design and execution of gray zone tactics aimed at pressuring Taiwan. In the case of the May 2024 PLA exercises in response to President Lai’s speech (dubbed Joint Sword–2024A), the operations blended conventional PLA forces with other nonmilitary actors, including the Chinese coast guard, highlighting the growing role of law enforcement actors and “lawfare” in conventional operations with the military. This strategy of “salami slicing” allows Beijing to exert continuous pressure without crossing the threshold of outright conflict, complicating Taiwan’s defense posture and the international community’s response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Beijing works to create an impression of isolation and impotence in the waters and airspace surrounding Taiwan, it also strives to probe and stress Taiwan’s defenses internally. One focal area for Beijing has been Taiwan’s cyber defenses, which face an escalating volume of cyber incursions and attacks frequently linked to Chinese state actors. By some accounts, the island faces around 30 million cyberattacks and probes each month, targeting both government institutions and private enterprises. These attacks aim to steal sensitive information, disrupt critical infrastructure, and undermine public trust in Taiwan’s government. Notable incidents include the 2020 cyberattack on Taiwan’s state-owned oil company, CPC Corporation, which disrupted its operations and highlighted vulnerabilities in the island’s critical infrastructure. In a more recent example directly linked to China, the hacking group APT41 infiltrated an unnamed Taiwanese research institute that potentially gave the group access to “proprietary and sensitive technologies,” according to a summary report by Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation campaigns pose yet another serious nonmilitary threat to Taiwan, with efforts designed to manipulate public sentiment, leverage partisan frictions, and influence election outcomes. In nearly all of Taiwan’s recent national elections, Chinese-linked actors have been present in the online and offline media and information ecosystem. These efforts include fabricated stories about political candidates, such as claims of corruption, as well as misinformation regarding government policies. Although such meddling has not compromised the integrity of Taiwan’s elections, these efforts certainly affected the information environment for voters. In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, for example, false narratives about candidates’ personal lives and distorted policy claims circulated heavily on social media platforms. Aggravating the impact of PRC-originated disinformation efforts is the rabidly partisan nature of Taiwan’s democracy, with the two major parties — the KMT and the DPP — often stoking their own disinformation campaigns or otherwise taking advantage of disinformation regardless of its source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct political meddling constitutes another layer of nonmilitary threats Taiwan faces. These activities often involve attempts to influence Taiwan’s domestic politics through financial support for pro-Beijing politicians, espionage activities, and exertion of economic pressure. In July, National Security Bureau director-general Tsai Ming-yen warned the lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan, “The Chinese Communist Party’s infiltration activities are increasingly rampant in Taiwan, posing a severe challenge to national security work. . . . They also recruit retired national security personnel and infiltrate political parties and government departments.” According to one tally by Reuters, the Taiwanese government has discovered 21 active or retired military officers at or above the rank of captain who have been actively spying for Beijing. This interference aims to sway Taiwan’s political direction in favor of unification with China, undermining the island’s democratic governance and political autonomy. The openness and pluralism of Taiwan’s political institutions, media environment, and wider society undoubtedly serve as the foundation of the island’s long-term strength but in the short term leave it vulnerable to Chinese-linked and Beijing-backed actors looking to shape internal political discussions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Beijing has sought to leverage its economic might to pressure Taiwan into capitulation, as well as to further isolate Taiwan diplomatically and economically. One tried and tested approach is to threaten the operations of Taiwan companies in the PRC. For example, in the lead-up to the January 2024 presidential elections, Chinese authorities launched a tax and land-use investigation into the electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn. Many saw this as an attempt to exert pressure on the company and Terry Gou, who was contemplating a presidential run in Taiwan. Similarly, Beijing uses the lure of market access, preferential access, and development finance to ensure only a handful of countries diplomatically recognize Taiwan. Finally, Beijing has begun innovative efforts to treat Taiwan residents and entrepreneurs as de facto PRC citizens through efforts like the Fuzhou Province’s “integrated development” plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These nonmilitary threats — cyberattacks, disinformation, direct political meddling, and economic pressure — form a comprehensive and evolving strategy aimed at weakening Taiwan’s political stability, economic resilience, and international standing. Based on these threats, the rest of this chapter turns to Taiwan’s actions in the major areas of resilience, beginning with strategic design and command structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-design-and-command-structure&quot;&gt;Strategic Design and Command Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the discussion of Finland and other countries indicates, a critical piece of national resilience is ensuring the requisite administrative structures are in place well before a crisis emerges. In the case of Taiwan, the picture today looks vastly better than several years ago, but significant gaps and areas of potential discoordination remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a high level, Taiwan now delineates functional oversight of civil defense between the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) during peacetime and the Ministry of National Defense (MND), through its All-Out Defense Mobilization Agency (ADMA), during times of war. This division of responsibilities was formalized with the passage of the Civil Defense Act (CDA) in 2021. Before the CDA, civil defense efforts were fragmented, involving a loosely coordinated network of administrative bodies and bureaucratic actors. These entities often worked in isolation, and while there were instances of cooperation, the overall structure lacked clarity and coordination. The CDA was a critical development as it established a clear chain of command for civil defense matters, creating a streamlined approach for peacetime and wartime situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant issue with the current framework is that the distinction between peacetime and wartime responsibilities is, in many ways, artificial. In reality, the planning, coordination, and preparedness required for civil defense in peacetime overlap with those needed in wartime, especially in the context of China’s ongoing gray zone activities targeting Taiwan. These activities, which blur the lines between peace and conflict, necessitate constant readiness and swift coordination between civilian and military agencies. The rigid separation of responsibilities could hinder the flexibility needed to respond effectively to such unconventional threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, both the MND and MOI are large bureaucratic entities with their own interests, priorities, and internal dynamics. This creates the risk of turf battles, with each ministry potentially guarding its domain rather than collaborating efficiently. In such a high-stakes environment, Taiwan cannot afford to let bureaucratic competition undermine its national security efforts. The challenges that China’s hybrid warfare tactics pose require seamless interagency cooperation, and any misalignment between the MOI and MND could lead to delays or inefficiencies that weaken Taiwan’s ability to respond to crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant challenge lies in better integration of planning and decisionmaking between Taiwan’s central government and subnational governments. As Taiwan moves toward centralizing civil defense planning under the MOI and MND, it will be crucial to actively engage with and incorporate local initiatives developed by mayors, city planners, and regional authorities across the island. The 2021 CDA makes an important first step by delineating authority between the central, municipal, and district governments, creating a clearer chain of command. However, a more fully integrated structure is needed to ensure that when a stress test of the system is conducted — whether in the event of a conflict or crisis — it will function as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key questions remain about how well Taiwan’s civil defense apparatus will operate under actual strain. For example, how will resources and personnel be mobilized across the island in an emergency? What contingency plans are in place if critical communication lines between central and local governments are severed? Moreover, how will decisionmaking be coordinated between localities if contact with the central government is disrupted? These vital concerns must be addressed through joint planning, scenario-based exercises, and development of robust communication and logistics frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns are not lost on the government. As one government official told the Financial Times, “We are discussing revising our disaster management mechanisms in order to build a clearer command chain and have one system that can work across peacetime and wartime.” One such effort was unveiled in June 2024. President Lai announced the creation of a National Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee to be led by Lai, with Vice President Bi-khim Hsiao, National Security Council secretary-general Joseph Wu, and secretary-general to the president Pan Men-an serving as committee deputies. This potentially serves as an umbrella organization across government, civil society, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience is a holistic effort, and as Lai said in a speech announcing the committee’s creation, “We need to conduct a comprehensive review and propose solutions to problems, strengthening our resilience in national defense, economic livelihoods, disaster prevention, and democracy.” Signs emerging from the committee’s inaugural meeting are positive, with a focus on running unscripted civilian defense exercises, involving all relevant actors in society, and finding better means of coordination across the government, especially with local governments. National Security Council deputy secretary-general Hsu Szu-chien, who briefed the committee, stressed,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The traditional way is for Taiwan’s government and military to take charge, issuing orders to civilians during natural disasters and emergencies. . . . Now we have to adjust this thinking to bolster civilian participation during contingencies, for people to know that “we can take the initiative to save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;legal-authorities&quot;&gt;Legal Authorities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last decade has seen significant progress in building the necessary legal authorities and legislative tool kit to deal with the proliferation of threats to Taiwan’s overall resilience. Notable examples include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Cybersecurity Management Act (2018) targets government agencies and specific NGOs considered providers of critical infrastructure. It mandates they create and implement comprehensive cybersecurity plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Anti-infiltration Act, enacted in early 2020, criminalizes foreign interference in Taiwan’s political processes, including disseminating false information intended to influence elections. This legislation imposes strict penalties on individuals and organizations found guilty of spreading false information to meddle in Taiwan’s democratic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CDA (2021), discussed above, clarifies the division of responsibilities for civil defense between the MOI during peacetime and the MND during wartime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The National Security Act, as amended in 2022, expands the scope of protections against espionage and infiltration, specifically the leakage of critical technologies and trade secrets to foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One glaring weak spot for Taiwan’s legal and administrative framework is the vital issue of leadership succession. As it stands, Article 49 of the Constitution of the Republic of China is the only public articulation of the presidential line of succession. It clarifies the transfer of power for two offices only: the vice president and the president of the Executive Yuan. Clarifying and codifying a more robust chain of command is an essential task for Taiwan, given the threat of a possible decapitation strike by the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-communications&quot;&gt;Strategic Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the pervasive threat of disinformation, the Taiwanese government has adopted a comprehensive approach that includes public education, regulatory measures, and collaboration with technology companies. Recognizing the importance of an informed public, Taiwan has launched numerous media literacy programs aimed at educating citizens about the dangers of fake news, misinformation, and disinformation, as well as building the capability to identify reliable sources of news and information. These programs cut across all demographics, including students, senior citizens, and rural communities, to ensure a broad reach. Additionally, the government has integrated media literacy into school curricula, teaching young students critical thinking skills and how to discern credible information sources from misleading ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bolster these educational efforts, Taiwan collaborates with NGOs and civil society groups that specialize in media literacy. These organizations play a crucial role in grassroots education, conducting community outreach and providing resources to help citizens navigate the information landscape. For example, the Taiwan FactCheck Center works with schools and community groups to teach fact-checking techniques and promote skepticism toward unverified or suspicious information online. Such efforts can inoculate against disinformation created by external powers as well as false or misleading information created by partisan political and commercial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the government works closely with social media platforms like Facebook and LINE to identify and remove false content. These companies have established fact-checking partnerships with local organizations to help monitor and curb the spread of disinformation. For instance, Facebook collaborates with the Taiwan FactCheck Center to verify the authenticity of viral content, flagging and taking down posts deemed false. This partnership also extends to sharing data on disinformation trends, allowing the government and civil society to stay ahead of evolving tactics used by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International cooperation is another key component of Taiwan’s strategy against disinformation. Taiwan participates in global forums and collaborates with other democracies to share best practices and develop joint responses to information threats. The country’s participation in initiatives like the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF) allows it to benefit from the expertise of international partners and contribute to the collective defense against disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-defenses&quot;&gt;Civil Defenses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable developments in Taiwan since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is the proliferation of NGOs focused on civil defense and whole-of-society resilience. Notable examples include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kuma Academy&lt;/strong&gt;, founded with a $32 million donation from entrepreneur Robert Tsao, runs all-day courses on combat skills, medical training, and general disaster response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camp 66&lt;/strong&gt;, an airsoft shooting range, seeks to improve the weapons capabilities of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taichung Self-Training Group&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on disaster response and medical training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward Alliance&lt;/strong&gt;, according to founder Enoch Wu, seeks to “teach citizens how to respond in an emergency. In peacetime, this means disaster response. In wartime, the same skills form the backbone of civil defense.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens more organizations blanket the island, most of which are not more than a few years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this good work, however, the government and military have, to a large extent, ignored or evinced skepticism about these efforts. Indeed, former defense minister Chiu Kuo-cheng once dismissed the Kuma Academy as little more than a paintball club. Yet this bottom-up surge of grassroots enthusiasm and organization is arguably one of the most promising channels the Taiwanese government has for bolstering functional capabilities in disaster preparedness and strengthening the population’s will to fight. The key question is how to channel and coordinate their efforts with those of the new Lai government and the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while the unofficial nature of these organizations is arguably their most important attribute, the government should take greater steps to work with and coordinate these resilience-focused civil society organizations, including regular convenings with organization leaders and the newly formed Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee. It should also include more formally integrating these groups into the MND’s Wan An and Han Kuang combat exercises, as well as the Wanan air defense drill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the government and military, there have been notable signs of progress, including the creation of the AODMA, established under the MND in 2021 as part of the All-Out Defense Mobilization Readiness Act. AODMA’s primary goal is to coordinate the mobilization of the island’s reserve force in the face of a conflict or disaster, which, prior to AODMA’s creation, had been managed by the All-Out Defense Mobilization Office and the Armed Forces Reserve Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2022, the MND issued its first-ever civil defense handbook, which included QR codes that could direct individuals to one of Taiwan’s 89,405 air raid shelters, information on how to locate medical clinics and “daily necessities allocation stations,” and images to help distinguish between Taiwan’s military and the PLA. Of course, the handbook’s distribution is a welcome but fairly minor step in the right direction. More important is the internationalization of the information contained in the pamphlet. As some critics have noted, relying on QR codes to find air raid shelters in a time of war is problematic as access to reliable cell phone service during a Chinese attack is far from guaranteed. Indeed, the known operations to sever Taiwan’s undersea cables, likely at Beijing’s direction, clearly indicate that telecommunications access might be the first casualty of a prospective Chinese attack. As discussed, countries like Finland mandate all large buildings have shelters. They have also turned many of the shelters into social spaces that community members incorporate into their daily lives during peacetime, ensuring citizens are not scrambling to determine the location of the nearest shelter in the event of a surprise attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2022, then president Tsai Ing-wen gave a speech at the Presidential Office in which she unveiled a plan for important changes to Taiwan’s national defense, including the lengthening of conscription from four months to a full year. She also called for upgrading Taiwan’s civil defense system, with better integration of central and local governments, the military, law enforcement, and the private sector across disaster relief, public health, and public security. Her speech was light on details, but it signaled at the highest level that Taiwan’s existing civil defense framework and capabilities were insufficient to meet the current and future challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress, roadblocks exist. Perhaps the most notable is the issue of a possible Chinese attack, which is deeply political, with the two main parties — the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) — engaging in intense disputes about the nature of the threat and the correct measures for responding. The KMT tends to advocate for closer ties to mainland China, arguing that maintaining peaceful cross-strait relations is the best way to avoid conflict. DPP leaders, including President Lai, have pushed for increased defense spending and stronger relations with the United States and other democratic nations to counter the military threat from China. This divide is evident in election campaigns, with the KMT accusing the DPP of unnecessarily provoking Beijing, while the DPP accuses the KMT of being too willing to appease China, risking Taiwan’s future security. Thus, instead of a core national political consensus on the nature of the threat and the road map to addressing it, including defense mobilization and civil defense preparedness, key partisan divisions remain, thwarting progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1mDKwku.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Cover of MND’s 2023 Civil Defense Handbook.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Taiwan Ministry of National Defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second clear roadblock is the lack of effective coordination across the growing ecosystem of government, private sector, and NGO stakeholders working directly on or adjacent to civil defense. Although absolute coordination is neither achievable nor desirable, Taiwan’s small population and limited resources, coupled with the existential risk of a possible Chinese attack, means there is little room for duplicative or ineffective efforts. This fragmentation hinders the pooling of resources and limits the strategic alignment needed for an integrated civil defense strategy. Relatedly, without more central coordination and national-level standards on civil defense and all its related domains, the Taiwanese government cannot ensure consistency and quality within the growing network of civil defense actors. The new Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, discussed above, is an important step in the right direction, but much depends on how the committee operates, how inclusive it is, and whether or not it is geared toward substance reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;critical-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Critical Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has made progress on protecting its critical infrastructure, but significant vulnerabilities remain. This section addresses four areas: cyber defense, energy, communications, and food security. It then examines the broader issue of relations with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Taiwan has been under constant cyber assault from the PRC. Indeed, these attacks date to the late 1990s, when a large-scale web defacement attack targeted government websites in the wake of comments by then president Lee Teng-hui asserting Taiwan’s distinct sovereignty from China. Since then, the scale and intensity of these efforts have increased in tandem with China’s strengthening assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan and its proliferating cyber capabilities, including through hybrid and proxy actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successive leaders in Taiwan have taken aggressive steps to address the threat. In 2013, the government established a cybersecurity office under the Executive Yuan, which was later upgraded to a department in 2016. The department seeks to coordinate national cybersecurity efforts, including the formulation and implementation of all national-level cybersecurity laws and regulations. It also works closely with other government agencies, such as the MND, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Communications Commission, in an attempt to create a unified front against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, MND established the Information, Communication, and Electronic Force Command (ICEF), which is tasked with defending military networks and conducting offensive cyber operations and thus is similar in function to the U.S. Cyber Command. ICEF was the first effort by the Taiwanese government and military to cohere electronic warfare, cyber warfare, and communication warfare into a single entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s approach to cybersecurity — and indeed its approach to digital governance — took a major step forward with the creation of the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) in August 2022. From the outset, MODA was tasked with improving Taiwan’s approach to cyber resilience, and the Department of Communications and Cyber Resilience was tasked with looking across the island’s telecommunications and digital infrastructure to ensure it is effective, advanced, protected, and coordinated. The ministry’s inaugural leader, Audrey Tang, had already built a reputation for creativity and an unconventional approach to technology while serving as the minister without portfolio of digital affairs. Tang has shown a distinct willingness to partner with civil society, including the island’s robust hacking community, to improve the government’s capabilities, transparency, and service offerings to the public. Tang’s successor at MODA, Huang Yen-nun, recently unveiled a new strategy to increase the resilience of Taiwan’s communications system, including the maintenance of internet access during natural disasters through investments to ensure internet access during natural disasters, cyberattacks, and other threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International cooperation is another cornerstone of Taiwan’s cybersecurity strategy. The Department of Cybersecurity collaborates with international partners to share threat intelligence, best practices, and technological advancements. Taiwan has also signed cybersecurity memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with several countries, including the United States, Japan, and Australia. For example, Taiwan and the United States conduct annual cybersecurity drills known as the Cyber Offensive and Defensive Exercises (CODE), which simulate real-world cyberattacks and defenses to test and improve their respective cybersecurity capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Taiwan participates in global cybersecurity forums and initiatives, such as the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) and the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). While these memberships allow Taiwan to collaborate with international cybersecurity experts, share insights on threat trends, and contribute to the development of global cybersecurity standards, Taiwan’s lack of diplomatic status with nearly all its partner nations continues to constrain the depth and breadth of these cooperative engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwanese government’s investment in cybersecurity technologies and workforce development, while noteworthy, still demands additional effort given the enormity of the challenges faced. In interviews with government officials and cybersecurity experts in Taiwan, a consistent concern was the limited talent development pipeline due to Taiwan’s relatively small population size and the challenges of attracting key talent away from commercial technology firms or tech start-ups. The government has attempted to address this through educational and training programs. However, questions remain about the adequacy of these programs in meeting the growing complexity of cyber threats. Universities and technical colleges offer specialized courses, but as of yet, there is no evidence that these programs can produce a sufficiently large or skilled workforce to address Taiwan’s urgent needs, especially in light of the enormous challenge from Beijing. Government-sponsored certifications and continuous learning opportunities, while beneficial, may lack the depth required for tackling increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, let alone for dealing with the types of attacks that prefigure an all-out invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s basic energy equation puts it in a strategic bind. For geographic and policy reasons, it overwhelmingly depends on the importation of energy resources, the vast majority of which are traditional hydrocarbons. In 2023, Taiwan imported 97 percent of its energy, most of which came from oil and petroleum (44 percent), coal (29 percent), and natural gas (20 percent). Indigenously derived power is split between nuclear (4 percent), biomass (1.3 percent), solar (1 percent), and wind and hydro (0.8 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet for political and policy reasons, many of which are sensible, the Taiwanese government has outlined ambitious goals to decarbonize, seeking net-zero emissions by 2050. While further expansion of the island’s nuclear power program could enable such an effort, the ruling DPP, for political and environmental reasons, has moved aggressively to eradicate nuclear power as a possible energy source by 2025, despite the fact that nuclear power remains the single largest domestically produced power source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today wind and solar alone have insufficient capacity to power Taiwan’s economy during noncrisis periods or during a possible crisis. Adding to the challenge is the problematic nature of Taiwan’s power grid. According to a report by the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan, the grid is “both isolated and relentlessly centralized, with heavy reliance on larger plants,” including the three vital voltage substations of Lunchi, Longtan, and Zhong Liao. A problem in any one plant would ripple out across the entire grid, causing “an electrical heart attack” for the island and its economy. The impacts of these deficiencies have been put front and center in the political conversation after a series of significant island-wide blackouts over the past several years. The 303 blackout — named for the date of the outage, March 3, 2022 — affected nearly 5.5 million residents, most notably in southern Taiwan, where the blackout lasted more than half a day. Because one firm, Taipower, structures and oversees Taiwan’s power grid, the issues that arise in one part of the grid are likely to spread nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing all the above challenges will be vital for Taiwan, not only in a major geopolitical crisis but also in nonmilitary scenarios that are more likely to affect the island, including typhoons, earthquakes, and — in the case of the 303 blackout — human error. Addressing Taiwan’s reliance on imported energy will not be easy or quick. While it is notable and laudable that the administrations of Presidents Tsai and Lai set out ambitious climate goals, these must be weighed against the growing geopolitical threats Taiwan currently faces. Taking steps to build a more resilient power supply need not mean completely abandoning the vital objective of greening Taiwan’s energy future, but tough political choices must be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communications Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, two undersea communication cables connecting Taiwan’s main island with the Matsu Islands were severed, temporarily disrupting internet communications for the 14,000 inhabitants of the outer islands Taiwan governs. Taipei did not formally accuse the PRC of sabotage, but credible rumors point toward Chinese ships causing the disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Beijing might have been sending a subtle warning to Taipei, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of Taiwan’s communications infrastructure. A mere 15 submarine cables link Taiwan to the rest of the world. According to the New York Times, these undersea fiber optic cables have experienced nearly 30 ruptures since 2017, in most cases because of dragged ship anchors. These incidents underscore the island’s precarious position, with its global connectivity largely hinging on undersea cables that could be easily targeted in a conflict scenario. It is also worth noting that rupturing Taiwan’s undersea cables would have knock-on effects for countries on its periphery, including South Korea and Japan. Furthermore, the infrastructure enabling domestic communications is also highly vulnerable to potential disruption, whether by physical attack or natural disaster. Indeed, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake that rocked Taiwan’s eastern coast early in 2024 damaged nearly 200 cellular base stations. Irrespective of the origin of disruption, incapacitation of the macro cell tower network that connects Taiwan’s residents to each other and the government through their cell phones would significantly hamper the ability to coordinate in a crisis. Even lower-tech communication media, such as wireless radio and television networks, depend on physical infrastructure that would be a tempting target for an invading force. As one researcher from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research told Reuters, “Strategic communications, internally and externally, is what keeps us up at night, particularly in the aftermath of Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is vulnerable not just to physical attacks on its infrastructure but also to cyberattacks that disrupt its communications and military command systems. In fact, Taiwan’s cybersecurity agencies have reported a significant increase in cyberattacks over the past few years, with Chinese state-sponsored groups being the primary perpetrators. According to a report from the cybersecurity firm Cloudflare, Taiwan saw a staggering 3,370 percent year-on-year increase in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks during the final three months of 2023. The major utility Chunghwa Telecom, discussed above, was hacked in early 2024, with vast troves of sensitive information and data exfiltrated onto the dark web. While the identity of the perpetrator has not yet been confirmed, the attack demonstrates the vulnerability of Taiwan’s critical infrastructure. As a recent report by Microsoft reveals, PRC-led hacking efforts across the Asia-Pacific region, including against Taiwan, frequently attack the telecommunications sector, “often leading to many downstream effects.” Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), arguably Taiwan’s most strategically important firm, reported a ransomware hack last summer that, while limited in its actual damage, again demonstrates just how vulnerable Taiwan’s vital actors are to such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another warning for Taiwan comes from the ongoing war in Ukraine, both because Russia’s assault on the country’s telecommunications infrastructure hints at a possible playbook for Beijing and because of the Ukrainian military’s reliance on the Starlink network to communicate and coordinate across the battlefield and with Kyiv. For Ukraine’s extraordinarily effective drone army, the reliance on Starlink’s network of 6,000 low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites has been especially stark. Starlink’s owner, Elon Musk, has been reluctant to support the Taiwan market, in part because of joint-venture requirements that Taipei would mandate. Even assuming Musk sees Taiwan as a potential partner, some have raised concerns that his other business interests, most notably Tesla’s deep integration into the Chinese marketplace, potentially add variables beyond Taipei’s control that are too uncertain to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the pioneering leadership of Tang, who led the MODA from 2022 through May 2024, Taipei has made important strides in recent years to address the island’s vulnerabilities. The umbrella effort aims to enhance Taiwan’s overall telecommunications resilience through a better mix of land-based, maritime, and communications systems that, taken together, ensure Taiwan’s “government command structure, disaster relief units, and the general populace can maintain essential and secure communication even in extreme circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, MODA established the National Institute of Cyber Security (NICS) with the goal of advancing “the application, competence and R&amp;amp;D of Taiwan’s cyber security technology.” Among other goals, NICS strives to create a talent pipeline that can assist the government and private sector to help Taiwan confront a range of current and future cyber threats. As mentioned, these efforts have not clearly yielded strategic dividends, but recognizing the deficiencies in the talent pipeline is an important first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MODA also selected the Telecom Technology Center to lead an effort focused on “response or wartime applications of new technology to strengthen digital communications resilience,” including the use of non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) in instances where traditional means of communication, including mobile and landline phones, become unavailable. Under its Program for the Digital Resilience Validation of Emerging Technologies for Contingency or Wartime Applications, the government seeks to enhance connectivity to Taiwan’s outer islands and remote areas through an expansion of satellite hot spots and cellular base stations. This summer, MODA announced it had launched a new medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite to bolster the connectivity of Taiping Island, which sits in the Nansha (Spratly) Islands and is contested by the PRC, Vietnam, and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Chunghwa Telecom, one of Taiwan’s largest telecommunications providers, signed a deal with London-based Eutelsat OneWeb to bring its satellite network coverage to Taiwan. Around the same time, MODA partnered with the Luxembourg-based satellite firm SES to implement an MEO satellite network covering all of Taiwan. According to industry reports, conversations are also ongoing with Amazon’s Project Kuiper and the Canadian firm Telesat. These concurrent efforts with multiple satellite firms are an effort to avoid any single point of failure in Taiwan’s telecommunications network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these efforts are to be applauded, Taiwan’s ability to insulate its telecommunications infrastructure from intentional attacks or disasters stemming from natural disasters, as discussed below, has limitations. If Beijing is intent on attacking the island, knocking out its communications network will be a top priority. Therefore, cooperation with international companies and governments is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and Water Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to importing the vast majority of its energy requirements, Taiwan relies heavily on global supply chains to source food. Statistics from 2021 show that nearly 70 percent of Taiwan’s annual caloric intake comes from overseas. According to an analysis by Taiwan’s Ministry of Agriculture, the island’s food self-sufficiency ratio stood at 31 percent in 2022, the lowest in a decade, well below the target of 40 percent by 2020 set by the Ma Ying-jeou administration in 2011. Analysis by the USDA concludes that the problem might be even worse than the official self-sufficiency ratio indicates, as “domestic poultry and hog production which are shown to have high self-sufficiency ratios rely on imported grains and feed to maintain production.” Further, Taiwan relies on fertilizer imports, which, in turn, sustain its domestically grown vegetable and fruit crops. In the event of a Chinese blockade or invasion that partially or completely disrupts global supply chains, access to imported grains and fertilizers would be significantly affected, to the great detriment of Taiwan’s domestic food production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one government official stated publicly in 2022 that Taiwan had sufficient food stockpiles to sustain for one year in the event of a direct attack by China, there is no full public accounting to verify these claims. In other venues, senior officials have been more cagey on the precise inventories and the planning scenarios used to formulate these supply targets. Former deputy economy minister Chen Chern-chyi would only clarify, “We want to ensure that we have a certain period’s worth stockpiled in Taiwan, including food, including critical supplies, minerals, chemicals and energy of course.” During the Covid-19 pandemic, U.S. government experts assessed that Taiwan had sufficient food stocks to last six months. While the assessment does not contravene Taiwanese government estimates, it highlights the need for more robust data reporting on the current stockpile levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While public reports indicate that Taiwan has sufficient reserves of rice to last one year (1.26 million metric tons), the stockpiles of other staples are less certain. Relatedly, a significant and prolonged power outage would call into question the electrical cooling systems needed to store food supplies, even the national reserves of rice, which require storage in low-temperature silos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a crisis, a key logistical challenge is the rationing and distribution of food and water. This is no easy task, especially in the instance of a military attack or, more probably, a severe earthquake. Relatedly, in the instance of a prolonged crisis, a key issue for the Taiwanese government and its military planners would be the issue of food resupply. As discussed below, this is an area of potentially enhanced U.S.-Taiwanese cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is also wrestling with growing challenges in water security and water resource management. Taiwan’s 2021 drought, the worst in 56 years, severely affected its semiconductor industry, which accounts for more than 60 percent of the global supply of microchips and 90 percent of the globe’s most advanced chips. TSMC, a vital player in this sector, faced significant production slowdowns during the drought, as it was forced to truck in water to meet its needs. This example highlights the stark nature of Taiwan’s vulnerability, as the high-tech industry is water intensive and crucial to both Taiwan’s economy and the global supply chain. Indeed, one estimate shows that a typical semiconductor firm on Taiwan uses roughly 20,000 tons of water per day and that TSMC’s demand for municipal water increased 71 percent between 2015 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government-Private Sector Relations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordination between the public and private sectors is challenging in almost all market democracies, owing to the de jure and de facto independence of private firms, as well as concerns about corruption stemming from overly cozy relations between policymakers and profit-making firms. Moreover, many bureaucrats have little incentive to deepen discussions and relations with the private sector, as such efforts are not, in themselves, rewarded. Yet a mature discussion on societal resilience and whole-of-society defense is impossible without deep planning and coordination interlinkages between the private sector and the government. As the case of Finland demonstrates, some governments that face a serious external threat have significantly deepened their relationship with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such efforts are underway in Taiwan, though they are largely piecemeal and event driven. While many workshops and conferences focus on how supply chains, telecommunications, and cybersecurity resilience affect Taiwan’s economy, there are few formal frameworks and channels for bolstering coordination between the private sector and the government or between private sector actors. During a recent trip to Taipei, representatives from several global technology companies with large footprints in Taiwan told one of the authors of this report they had no active ongoing conversations with the government on the issue of resilience and whole-of-society defense. Taipei must find ways to bolster communication and coordination with the private sector directly, as well as to support efforts for horizontal coordination among companies in key sectors like telecommunications, energy, transportation, and food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent positive sign was the inclusion of private sector executives in the inaugural convening of the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee on September 27, 2024. According to press reporting, external attendees included representatives from Google, the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro, and the supermarket chain Pxmart Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-to-fight&quot;&gt;Will to Fight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ongoing war in Ukraine decisively indicates, the will to resist is vital for the ability to repel and resist an invading force. A 2018 RAND study concludes, “Arguably, will to fight is the single most important factor in war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are vexing questions, however, about Taiwan’s will to fight. Some polls, such as a 2021 poll conducted by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, show that more than 70 percent of respondents would resist a Chinese invasion; this number drops by 10 percent if the attack comes after Taiwan declares independence. In a separate poll conducted by Global Views Monthly in 2022, just over 40 percent stated they would be willing to fight for Taiwan. Still another poll from the same year reports that 61 percent of survey respondents would fight for Taiwan if the PLA attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the threat of an attack on Taiwan currently feels distant to many on the island, and because Beijing’s gray zone actions have to some extent become normalized to many Taiwan inhabitants, both assessing and galvanizing public resolve are challenging. Polling data are an imperfect measure for the will to fight, as they necessarily omit variables that would be key to determining how many in society actually resist. For example, what expectations do the Taiwanese people have about their leadership’s competence and resolve? What expectations do they have of the United States and the dependability of its quasi-security commitment as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act? Recent polling by the think tank Academia Sinica shows that views of the United States are mixed, with just over 40 percent of respondents agreeing the United States is a “credible country.” The connection between the will to fight and U.S. credibility matters greatly, as there is understandably a blunted incentive to resist the PLA if the expectation is that the United States will sit on the sideline. For all Taiwan can and should do to provide for its own defenses, it probably could not defeat a Chinese invasion absent significant support from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, successive governments on Taiwan have faced the dilemma of how to sufficiently raise the threat awareness of a possible attack or blockade to facilitate the difficult investments or sacrifices Taiwan must make without unduly panicking the island’s small population, creating a brain drain, or redirecting much-needed foreign direct investments to safer locations. Several senior Taiwanese government officials have privately stated their deep frustration with Western media coverage that frames Taiwan as “the most dangerous place on earth,” as this narrative potentially drives away investment precisely at the time Taipei is seeking to build Taiwan into a global technology powerhouse in sectors extending beyond semiconductors. In addition, taking a more overt stance in publicizing Chinese aggression toward Taiwan could, in itself, provoke more such actions by Beijing as punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integration-with-allies&quot;&gt;Integration with Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s small population, combined with its geographic and diplomatic isolation, means resilience will demand active international collaboration. Despite these severe limitations, successive governments on Taiwan have built out substantive partnerships for a wide array of issues critical to its prosperity and security. These include areas from trade and trade diversification, such as the 2016 New Southbound Policy, to technology, where Taipei has been building unique partnerships leveraging the singular advantage it has in its cutting-edge semiconductor industry. Taiwan has also leveraged world-leading public health capabilities to expand cooperation on pandemic preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to overall societal resilience, Taiwan’s efforts have been more mixed. One notable success is the GCTF, formed in 2015 in partnership with Japan, the United States, and Australia to facilitate discussions and cooperation between Taiwan and a range of international stakeholders on issues ranging from digital crimes to media literacy. The GCTF has also provided a platform for deeper discussion and partnership on issues that directly affect Taiwan’s resilience, including supply chain security, trade diversification, telecommunication resilience, and combatting disinformation. Although the GCTF demonstrates that creative organization structures can help Taiwan participate more fully in critical global conversations, it is still unclear how many of the workshops and discussions it has facilitated have translated into concrete or meaningful action that is changing the facts on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has also done well in finding discrete areas for bilateral cooperation on issues including cybersecurity, food security, public health, and disaster preparedness. Highlights include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, the United States and Taiwan launched the U.S.-Taiwan Technology, Trade and Investment Collaboration (TTIC) to strengthen dialogue on supply chain security and resiliency. After convenings in 2021 and 2022, however, the TTIC went dark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Taipei has signed a range of MOUs focusing on public health with foreign partners including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic. Not all of these, however, focus on strengthening Taiwan’s capabilities and resilience. The agreement with the Czech Republic, for example, targets the rebuilding of Ukraine’s shattered primary healthcare system. Thus, many of Taiwan’s external partnerships have a dual nature: they attempt to thread a needle of being substantive but also normalizing and expanding Taiwan’s international space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NICS signed an MOU with Lithuania’s Innovation Agency to bolster digital resilience. Tang, then head of MODA, stated that Lithuania, “value-wise, is the closest to Taiwan in the world” and that the partnership gave Taiwan the ability to draw on the Lithuanian government’s experience combatting cyberattacks and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter argues, Taiwan has taken some laudatory steps to strengthen resilience, but its efforts thus far are inadequate. For example, there is limited evidence of a coordinated and effective civilian readiness program that addresses economic and social disruptions. This is a critical gap, especially in light of current and future Chinese activities to target Taiwan’s financial systems, electricity grid, telecommunications network, or other areas. In addition, the readiness and resolve of Taiwan’s civilian population to resist in the event of foreign aggression also remains concerning. To help resolve these and other issues, the next chapter turns to recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-4-strengthening-resilience-beyond-military-aid--steps-for-taiwan-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Chapter 4 Strengthening Resilience beyond Military Aid — Steps for Taiwan and the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical importance of Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific region has made it a focal point for U.S. strategic interests, particularly in the context of countering Chinese influence and aggression. However, while the United States has invested significantly in bolstering Taiwan’s military capabilities, there has been a notable lack of attention to enhancing the resilience of Taiwanese society. A robust societal resilience strategy is essential not just for immediate military deterrence but also for the long-term survival and thriving of Taiwan in the face of potential Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite also highlighting the importance of developing asymmetric capabilities, U.S. strategy toward Taiwan has nonetheless heavily emphasized providing advanced military hardware, such as F-16 fighter jets, M1 Abrams tanks, HIMARS rocket launchers, Harpoon coastal defense systems, and Javelin antitank missiles. These systems are indeed crucial for Taiwan to maintain a credible defense posture against a conventional invasion by China. Moreover, the training provided to Taiwan’s military, including joint exercises and instruction on the use of advanced systems, is designed to enhance Taiwan’s ability to respond effectively in a high-intensity conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the focus on military assistance overlooks several critical factors. First, while advanced weaponry can serve as a deterrent, it does not address the broad spectrum of challenges Taiwan would face in a protracted conflict with China or increased gray zone activities. These challenges include not just military confrontations but also economic warfare, cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and attempts at political subversion. In these areas, Taiwan’s societal resilience — its ability to withstand and recover from various forms of coercion — is as important as its military strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, historical examples highlight the limitations of relying solely on military aid without concurrent efforts to build societal resilience. In numerous conflicts, from Vietnam to Afghanistan, the failure to develop a society’s internal strength and cohesion has led to the collapse of resistance, even in the presence of superior military technology. Taiwan’s situation, while unique, shares some parallels with these cases, particularly in terms of the asymmetric nature of the threat it faces from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this chapter is divided into three sections. The first discusses steps the Taiwanese government could take to improve its resilience. The second section provides an overview of steps the United States and other international actors can take to aid Taiwan. The third section offers a summary of the main conclusions and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;steps-for-the-taiwanese-government-to-take-on-its-own&quot;&gt;Steps for the Taiwanese Government to Take on Its Own&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on recommendations in four areas: raising threat awareness, improving ties to the private sector, bolstering energy infrastructure, and stockpiling food and energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raising Threat Awareness among the People of Taiwan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwanese government understandably fears stoking panic among its population by highlighting the extent of the PRC threat. Yet at the same time, hesitancy creates an artificial barrier to galvanizing public support for the necessary and potentially costly reforms Taiwan must undertake to ensure its free and democratic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A robust societal resilience strategy is essential not just for immediate military deterrence but also for the long-term survival and thriving of Taiwan in the face of potential Chinese aggression.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tension is important for several reasons. First, perceptions of resolve are important for shaping Beijing’s calculus. If PLA planners assume a passive population, this increases the likelihood of a possible attack or miscalculation. Second, there is an inextricable link between U.S. perceptions of Taiwan’s will to fight and the willingness of Americans to expend significant financial resources and lives in defense of Taiwan. No political leader in the United States will advocate for sacrificing Americans’ blood and treasure to protect Taiwan if there is a widespread perception that the Taiwanese people themselves are not willing to fight for their freedom. Of course, many Taiwanese leaders understand this; as Joseph Wu, the secretary-general of the Taiwan National Security Commission, stated bluntly, “We have no right to ask others to help us if we are not prepared to defend ourselves.” Finally, many of the reforms outlined in this report require significant political and financial sacrifice, which becomes more difficult if the population does not have sufficient grasp of the enormity of the challenge China presents today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One starting point is greater transparency throughout the spectrum of Chinese gray zone and military actions. In private, Taiwanese government officials have reported being vexed that the Japanese military first disclosed on Twitter that the Chinese had fired missiles over Taiwan in the wake of Speaker Pelosi’s trip to the island in August 2022. Understandably, Taipei did not want to panic the population. Yet through a higher tempo of controlled disclosures, Taipei could better educate its population about the threat and galvanize public support for preparing for a range of crisis scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan should establish a dedicated public communication platform that regularly updates citizens and the global public on Chinese intimidation tactics, including disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks, and military maneuvers. An objective data-driven platform would not only help foster a public dialogue but also give citizens tools to discern between actual threats and misinformation. In parallel, Taiwan needs to force better coordination and public messaging strategies across the Office of President, MND, MOFA, MODA, and MOI to ensure that consistent messages about the growing threat level are being communicated to the Taiwanese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Ties to the Private Sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critical for Taipei to strengthen links with the private sector. In addition to the efforts that are beginning to take shape, Taiwan might consider two ideas. First, Taipei should create a private sector “Resilience Advisory Board” comprising senior leaders from key private sector firms and industries that can convene under the auspices of the Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, thereby engaging directly with President Lai and his senior leadership team. The board would not only coordinate between the private sector and the Taiwanese government but also serve as a critical node for driving more substantive and strategic discussions among private sector firms about how they are building internal resilience, sector-specific resilience, and resilience across the entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Taiwanese government should consider establishing an annual Taiwan economic security forum to drive conversations between the government and private sector and allow third countries and their respective private sector firms to deepen their relationships with Taiwan. In the comparative cases discussed in chapter 2, governments developed strong relations with foreign companies, including large multinational companies, to strengthen resilience. The reality is that there is a global conversation about Taiwan’s importance for global innovation, yet Taiwan companies and actors often are not at the table, given the sensitivity of discussing Taiwan in many foreign capitals. Having this conversation would be both prudent and likely effective for Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, borrowing from the Finnish model, the Taiwan Ministry of Defense, in conjunction with the newly established Whole-of-Society Defense Resilience Committee, should run invitation-only, regional training courses for media organizations, religious leaders, and private sector representatives in order to better understand the challenges these actors would face in the event of a crisis, but also to help build bridges between the government and external actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolstering the Energy Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan must take several steps to boost its energy infrastructure and strengthen resilience. First, and most politically challenging, the importance of nuclear power to Taiwan’s overall resiliency cannot be avoided. As Taiwan seeks to secure its energy future amid growing threats, nuclear energy offers a reliable carbon-neutral source of electricity that does not rely on volatile fuel imports. Currently, Taiwan’s three nuclear power plants contribute approximately 10–15 percent of the island’s total electricity generation. However, with plans to phase out nuclear energy by 2025, Taiwan faces the difficult decision of balancing energy security with public concerns over nuclear safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance its resilience, Taiwan could reconsider extending the lifespan of its existing nuclear plants or even constructing new, safer reactors. For example, maintaining the current nuclear capacity would require an extension of the operating licenses for these plants, potentially adding another 5–10 years of service. Alternatively, constructing new advanced reactors, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), could provide a safer and more flexible nuclear option, potentially contributing up to 20 percent of Taiwan’s energy mix by 2035. While politically challenging, ensuring a stable nuclear energy supply could significantly reduce Taiwan’s vulnerability to external energy pressures and contribute to a more resilient and self-sufficient energy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, recent efforts to decentralize and upgrade the island’s power grid must be accelerated. Taiwan’s power grid is the backbone of its economic and societal functions, yet it remains vulnerable to both natural disasters and potential military strikes. Decentralizing the grid by increasing the number of microgrids and local power generation units would reduce the risk of widespread blackouts and enhance the system’s resilience to targeted attacks or natural calamities. Currently, Taiwan relies heavily on centralized power generation facilities, with nearly 80 percent of electricity produced by just a few large plants. To mitigate risks, Taiwan should aim to decentralize at least 30–40 percent of its power generation within the next decade, with a focus on renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which are more adaptable to decentralized systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, upgrading the grid with advanced technologies such as smart grids, which allow for real-time monitoring and rapid response to disruptions, is crucial. In September 2022, Taiwan’s utility monopoly, Taiwan Power Company (known as Taipower), announced the Grid Resilience Strengthening Construction Plan, which pledged $17.7 billion over 10 years to “comprehensively upgrade the national electrical grid system” to make it more resilient in the face of growing power outages. However, experts recommend doubling this investment to accelerate progress and ensure the grid can withstand both environmental and geopolitical threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food, Energy, and Water Stockpiling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taipei can take several steps to address these issues, many of which are beyond the scope of this report. These include investments in agricultural yield-enhancing technologies, efforts to boost urban micro farming and smart farming, and steps to enhance resiliency along the food supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these are all long-term investments and Taiwan is a small island with limited arable land (and many competing uses for it), there is a ceiling to how much it can do to alleviate its basic reliance on imports. Thus, increased stockpiling is the necessary foundation of its food security efforts insofar as they relate to a possible national disaster or, more extreme, a direct attack by the PLA or prolonged blockade of the island. Significantly increasing strategic reserves of staples (rice, grains, and essential nonperishables) and strengthening cold storage capacity for vegetables, fruits, dairy, and meat products will be essential. Additionally, Taipei must make investments in the resiliency of the electricity infrastructure that can maintain these food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the current stockpiles of hydrocarbons must be dramatically increased. Taiwan’s strategic energy reserves are crucial not only for sustaining its economy during peacetime but also for ensuring resilience in times of crisis. The island’s vulnerability to natural disasters, such as typhoons and earthquakes, can severely disrupt supply chains, making it imperative to have substantial reserves to mitigate these risks. Furthermore, in the context of growing Chinese aggression, Taiwan’s energy security is intertwined with its national security. Currently, Taiwan’s government mandates a 90-day reserve of crude oil, yet experts suggest expanding this to at least 180 days to ensure sufficient coverage in the event of a prolonged crisis. Doing so would require increasing reserves from approximately 36 million barrels to 72 million barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Taiwan’s natural gas reserves, which currently stand at around 10–15 days of supply, need to be bolstered to at least 60 days, necessitating the construction of additional storage facilities capable of holding an estimated 7.2 million cubic meters of liquefied natural gas (LNG). These increases would provide Taiwan with the necessary buffer to withstand potential blockades or disruptions to its energy imports, ensuring its military and civilian infrastructure remain operational. Therefore, building up these reserves is not merely a precaution but a strategic necessity that enhances Taiwan’s ability to navigate an increasingly precarious geopolitical landscape, reinforcing its sovereignty and resilience against external pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of water security, Taipei has attempted to mitigate these challenges by investing in water recycling, desalination, and reservoir management, but rapid industrial growth and urbanization continue to outpace these efforts. Without more aggressive conservation policies and infrastructure upgrades, Taiwan’s ability to adapt to climate-induced water stress will be limited, threatening its overall resilience in maintaining economic growth, food security, and environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crisis, such as a natural disaster or a potential Chinese invasion, Taiwan’s potable water distribution plan would undergo profound stress. During the aforementioned 2021 drought and Typhoon Haikui in 2023, Taiwan relied on emergency measures such as water rationing and trucking in water to areas in critical need. Building on these experiences, Taiwan must establish decentralized water distribution networks to ensure access during infrastructure failures. For example, mobile desalination devices and plants could be deployed to coastal regions to convert seawater into potable water in emergency situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan should also bolster its reserve of potable water. The government has started to build emergency reservoirs and underground water storage systems accessible in times of crisis. Prepositioning bottled water reserves and distributing portable filtration systems to households can further enhance readiness. Additionally, Taiwan could enhance its digital infrastructure for crisis management, using real-time data and artificial intelligence (AI) to prioritize water distribution to vulnerable areas and critical industries and ensure equitable access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;build-on-existing-cooperation-mechanisms&quot;&gt;Build on Existing Cooperation Mechanisms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section highlights the need to reinforce several ongoing cooperation mechanisms that could be further developed to strengthen resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roles for the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research reveals a lack of established U.S. and international attention and effort to systematically assess Taiwan’s resilience and develop a comprehensive assistance plan to improve resilience in Taiwan. The conversation is much more advanced than where it was just several years ago, but still, this must be an area of greater urgency across the U.S. government. Much of the U.S. military’s focus has been on providing military assistance and training to help Taiwan resist a conventional invasion and gray zone activities. The United States has also engaged with Taiwan through initiatives like the EPPD, which includes some focus on technology and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, U.S. efforts have not been sufficient to help Taipei meet the full spectrum of threats it faces or to prepare society to withstand external threats and coercion. As this report’s review of historical cases suggests, a population that lacks resilience is in danger of external and internal aggression. A robust societal resilience strategy is essential not just for immediate deterrence but also for the long-term survival and thriving of Taiwan in the face of external threats. In addition, many of the efforts to enhance Taiwan’s resilience could be applied to other allies and partners after being suitably modified for their situation. Thankfully, the United States and its partners can positively contribute to Taiwan’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its societal resilience in several areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPPD, launched in 2020, aims to strengthen economic ties and enhance cooperation between the United States and Taiwan. This dialogue addresses a broad spectrum of economic issues, including supply chain security, technology, energy, healthcare, and infrastructure. The EPPD functions as a forum for both nations to tackle common economic challenges and identify opportunities for collaboration, especially in key sectors like semiconductors and 5G technology, which are vital to the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, U.S. efforts have not been sufficient to help Taipei meet the full spectrum of threats it faces or to prepare society to withstand external threats and coercion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the effectiveness of the EPPD in improving Taiwan’s resilience, the United States should consider the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broaden participation&lt;/strong&gt;. Include representatives from the private sector, civil society, and academia to provide diverse perspectives and expertise. This multistakeholder approach would ensure that the dialogue addresses the needs and concerns of all relevant parties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regional integration&lt;/strong&gt;. Encourage the inclusion of other Indo-Pacific nations — either directly or through representatives from the private sector — in specific discussions, fostering regional economic integration and cooperation. This would help Taiwan diversify its economic partnerships and strengthen its role in regional supply chains. However, these discussions must be held carefully and not in public since many governments may be concerned about Beijing’s response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation and research and development collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;. Establish joint research and development (R&amp;amp;D) initiatives focused on emerging technologies, such as AI and green energy. This collaboration would not only drive economic growth but also ensure that both the United States and Taiwan remain competitive in global innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity cooperation&lt;/strong&gt;. Deepen cooperation on cybersecurity within the EPPD framework, particularly in protecting critical infrastructure and securing digital economies, ensuring both economies withstand and respond to cyber threats effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Cooperation and Training Framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCTF is an initiative Taiwan and the United States cofounded in 2015, with Japan later joining as a full partner and other countries, such as Australia, joining as partners or participants. The GCTF aims to enhance Taiwan’s participation in global issues and share Taiwan’s expertise with the international community. The framework facilitates training workshops and cooperative activities on a variety of topics, including public health, disaster relief, environmental protection, cybersecurity, and women’s empowerment. These events, often held in Taiwan, serve as platforms for government officials, experts, and NGOs from across the Asia-Pacific region and beyond to exchange knowledge, build capacity, and strengthen regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it relates to resilience, the GCTF can expand along the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broaden the scope of topics&lt;/strong&gt;. While the GCTF already covers a wide range of important areas, it could expand to include additional critical topics such as civil defense, legal reform, supply chain security, and economic resilience. Training sessions and workshops on these topics would help Taiwan and its partners better prepare for crises and strengthen their ability to respond to various challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase participation from regional partners&lt;/strong&gt;. Expanding participation to more countries in the Indo-Pacific region would not only bolster regional collaboration but also increase Taiwan’s integration into international networks. This broader participation could help Taiwan develop stronger ties with neighboring countries, thereby enhancing its regional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on technology and cybersecurity&lt;/strong&gt;. Given the increasing importance of cybersecurity and emerging technologies, the GCTF could introduce more specialized programs focused on protecting critical infrastructure and promoting technological innovation. This would help Taiwan and its partners stay ahead of cyber threats and technological challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote public-private partnerships&lt;/strong&gt;. Engaging the private sector more deeply in GCTF activities could provide new resources and perspectives. Public-private partnerships could be fostered in areas such as disaster response, cybersecurity, and innovation, bringing in expertise and investment from leading industries; they could also be messaged to show the integration of Taiwan beyond the narrowing diplomatic domain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a permanent secretariat&lt;/strong&gt;. To enhance coordination and continuity, establishing a permanent GCTF secretariat could be beneficial, although admittedly difficult to achieve for bu- reaucratic reasons. This body could oversee the planning and implementation of activities, ensure consistent communication between partners, and help secure funding for future initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation between USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service and Taiwan’s Ministry of Agriculture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 3, 2024, the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan, and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office signed an agreement to establish formal cooperation between the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service and the Taiwanese Ministry of Agriculture to expand “food security related cooperation and exchanges.” While not explicitly designed to deal with a possible invasion or blockade, the MOU nonetheless provides a solid foundation for expanding cooperation and coordination between the two sides on a range of issues related to both crisis and precrisis scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded U.S.-Taiwan Military Coordination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of areas under the current One China Policy framework that govern the unofficial U.S. relationship with Taiwan can be expanded to increase Taiwan’s resilience and civil defense capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party outlines in its May 2023 Ten for Taiwan report, congruent with section 5503 of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the U.S. military should build an aggressive “regional contingency stockpile,” as well as war reserve stocks for allies located on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also in congruence with the NDAA and the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. military, including and especially U.S. special operations forces, should increase collaboration with the ADMA to ensure more cohesion and coherence in scenarios where vast sections of Taiwanese society need to be mobilized for a crisis contingency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should expand International Military Education and Training (IMET) for Taiwan, particularly to improve civil defense and will to fight. IMET is a U.S. government-funded initiative aimed at enhancing the military capabilities of foreign nations by offering training to their military personnel in the United States. The program is administered by the U.S. Department of State and executed by the U.S. Department of Defense. Given the strategic importance of Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific region and the increasing tension across the Taiwan Strait, expanding IMET in relation to Taiwan could be a crucial element in enhancing Taiwan’s defense capabilities and reinforcing U.S.-Taiwan relations. Possible areas for expanding the IMET program include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase the number of IMET slots available to Taiwanese military personnel, allowing more Taiwanese officers to receive training in the United States, thereby expanding their skill sets and enhancing interoperability with U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailor IMET training to address Taiwan’s unique security challenges, such as cyber defense, anti-submarine warfare, and coastal defense.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Offer more advanced and longer-term educational programs to deepen the expertise of Taiwan’s military personnel. Programs at institutions like the U.S. Army War College and the Naval War College could provide strategic-level education to senior Taiwanese officers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrate more joint exercises as part of IMET or incorporate simulation-based training that mirrors potential conflict scenarios in the Taiwan Strait. This could involve wargaming and strategic decisionmaking exercises that prepare Taiwanese officers for real-world contingencies, including analyzing the implications of strengthened resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide training in civil-military relations, governance, and respect for international law, which could help further professionalize Taiwan’s military, ensuring it aligns with democratic values and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The United States and other allies should consider a rapid reaction team focused on detecting and stopping cyberattacks. Allies have varying capabilities, and a devastating cyberattack could be a game changer. If classification is a hurdle, then a public-private consortium might be a work-around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need to strengthen resilience in Taiwan. This chapter concludes with some final thoughts about strengthening resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, resilience is only one part of deterrence. Countries and societies, including Taiwan, still need a strong military capable of resisting invasion and other coercive activity. In addition, a strong military requires developing the capabilities to conduct offensive actions, including offensive cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the steps highlighted in this chapter generally need to be set up well in advance of a crisis — ideally years in advance. It takes time and money to bolster strategic design and command structure, establish additional legal measures, enhance strategic communications and psychological resilience, strengthen civil defenses, improve the population’s will to fight, reinforce nonviolent resistance networks, and increase integration with allies and partners. In Ukraine, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and proceeded to conduct a range of military and offensive cyber actions over the next several years — well before Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion. This gave the Ukrainian government and the private sector — including such companies as Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS) — years to increase resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, strengthening resilience requires a careful balancing act. Too many high-profile actions can incite a potential adversary, worsen the security situation, and create a security dilemma — a situation in which actions taken by one side to increase its security can make others less secure and lead them to respond in kind. The result is a spiral of hostility that leaves neither side better off than before. Finland has built resilience over decades, even as its leadership has professed neutrality toward Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the steps outlined in this chapter are useful first steps to strengthen Taiwan’s will and ability to resist external pressure, influence, and potential invasion. They would strengthen deterrence by raising the costs and risks for an aggressor weighing whether to employ conventional military or gray zone actions against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

China’s centrality to the supply of some of these critical minerals and materials has prompted Western governments to put in place countermeasures to ease their dependence on China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors in this issue unpack China’s dominance throughout the value chain, looking at some of the policies and corporate strategies that have enabled this. While much of the focus is on government responses to China, especially in minerals and materials, the analyses in this issue touch on the entire supply chain. While they do not cover all aspects of the value chains for solar cells, wind turbines, and lithium-ion batteries, nor all the commodities and the geographies where they are mined; but the complexity and linkages within these supply chains warrant a broader look, beyond the minerals alone. Miners have grappled traditionally with long lead times from mine to market, uneven regulatory frameworks, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns, all of which still plague investments. But financing and investment decisions are complicated by de-risking policies that seek to encourage non-Chinese supplies. This is because the vast majority of minerals, metals, and ores are sent to China for refining and processing. Moreover, China’s position as a monopoly supplier for some minerals and a near-monopsony buyer for several others gives it extraordinary market power. It has used this power to influence prices, which in turn has complicated investment decisions in both mining and refining. Finally, investment decisions around new mines also rely on the outlook for demand, which is in turn informed by technological innovation and advances in chemistries. But here too, China is also a front runner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-china-playbook&quot;&gt;The China playbook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forum begins with an article by Philip Andrews-Speed, arguing that diversifying supplies away from China will be extremely challenging in the coming decade, for the reasons discussed above: the challenges inherent in mining and China’s pricing power. Investments in midstream facilities face similar challenges, although lead times tend to be shorter. Emissions and waste from these plants are often toxic, and their consumption of energy and water is usually large. In light of this, Andrews-Speed argues that innovation could be a more effective way to reduce or obviate the need for critical minerals in key technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anders Hove also suggests that a focus on supplies overshadows innovation as a solution to reducing dependency on China. But, as Hove notes, China is also a leading player on innovation, with efforts in the country running the gamut from process-oriented improvements to lab-stage technologies, from end-user design to upstream minerals processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Hove and Andrews-Speed stress supply chain integration. From a policy perspective, the Chinese government has supported firms’ efforts to invest in minerals and ores overseas. Hove discusses Chinese firms’ hybrid approach of vertical integration and intense innovation. These present a contrast with the strategies of many firms in advanced economies, which have tended to focus on disaggregating production to reduce costs. While Western mining companies focus on their most profitable, high-volume mining activities, carmakers and battery manufacturers seek to obtain inputs from the cheapest source globally. As a result, miners struggle to compete with Chinese investments in relatively low-volume critical minerals. Downstream players find themselves competing with Chinese firms for the offtake of critical minerals or investing in risky technology that may or may not pay off. An additional observation is that innovation goes hand-in-hand with deployment; and whereas Chinese players are confident domestic demand will continue to boom, Western players are waiting for the customer to catch up or supplier input prices to fall. This not only slows investment in the upstream but hinders innovation across the supply chain, putting Chinese players further in the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These practices are captured neatly in Ahmed Mehdi’s analysis of graphite, the largest component by weight in a battery pack for anodes and a key feedstock in the production of anode active material. Graphite is a useful case study because of China’s vice-like grip on graphite markets and the evolving corporate playbook: Chinese firms have used their market dominance to squeeze out rivals, both domestic and international. A combination of vertical integration and feedstock switching in 2021–2022 helped consolidate Chinese anode players’ global position. This was further aided by the Chinese government’s tightening of export controls in late 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies are accelerating their push to exploit overseas mineral deposits, and Indonesia is one example. Nickel is a key ingredient of nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide battery cathodes, and the production of these cathodes is highly energy intensive. Indonesia has become the world’s dominant supplier of nickel ore (52 per cent in 2023) and refined nickel (37 per cent in 2023) over the last few years. This resulted from government policies to promote the extraction of nickel ore and to restrict the export of unprocessed ore in order to boost the nation’s added value from this supply chain. The country now hosts 54 nickel smelters, five times that in 2020. Of these, seven produce materials for lithium-ion batteries, namely nickel matte and mixed hydroxide precipitate. As Diwangkara Bagus Nugraha, Stein Kristiansen, and Indra Overland document, Chinese companies have a significant shareholding in all but one of these seven smelters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst these policies have benefitted Indonesia, they have come at three costs. First, the deep involvement of Chinese companies in both mining and smelting further extends China’s control of battery supply chains. Second, the use of coal-fired generators to power the smelters adds to Indonesia’s already rising level of carbon emissions. Finally, the combination of these two factors results in very low production costs, causing many nickel operations in other countries to struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the construction of grid-connected coal-fired power plants has been banned, nickel smelters are allowed to build captive coal-fired plants because these smelters are considered to be “national strategic projects”. No steps have been taken yet to decarbonise these captive plants, and only 12 of the 54 smelters disclose their carbon emissions. The European Union’s recent battery regulation establishes a carbon footprint threshold by 2028. This should affect Indonesia’s nickel industry. However, most of Indonesia’s nickel exports go to China, and China does not regulate the emissions of overseas investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consumer-governments-efforts-to-de-risk&quot;&gt;Consumer governments’ efforts to de-risk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s increased use of export controls (on gallium, germanium, antimony, and graphite) as well as growing financial pressure on Western clean-tech firms and concerns about China’s ability to use its dominance to pressure Western governments have led to a myriad of government responses. The US government has been amongst the most active through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which supports investment and guides procurement along the full length of the supply chain, including mining and mineral processing. Resource-rich Australia and Canada are supporting investment in mining and processing for export. The European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act of 2024 includes 2030 targets for mineral extraction, processing, and recycling, as well as limiting over-dependence on a single third country. Realising that international cooperation was needed, the United States led the establishment of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) in June 2022 to “bolster critical mineral supply chains essential for the clean energy transition”. The meeting in September 2024 saw the establishment of the MSP Finance Network, which includes development finance institutions and export credit agencies to support investment in critical mineral projects across the world. But are these efforts effective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s supply chain vulnerabilities came to the forefront during the 2010 diplomatic tensions with China, following a maritime incident near the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Parul Bakshi reviews the incident that became the poster child of China’s economic coercion, given that Beijing imposed an informal ban on the export of rare earth minerals to Japan. The embargo caused significant disruptions especially in the Japanese automotive sector, which relied heavily on these materials for essential components like magnets. While trade normalized after the resolution of the incident, the prices of rare earths surged tenfold within a year, highlighting the precarious nature of Japan’s supply chain dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government developed a comprehensive strategy aimed at mitigating future risks associated with single-source dependency. This included development of alternative technologies that reduce the use of rare earths; promotion of recycling initiatives to recover rare earths from used products; strengthening capacities to invest in and develop rare earth mines globally, particularly in Australia, which emerged as a key partner; and establishing stockpiles of critical minerals to buffer against supply disruptions. Japan has effectively reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earth imports from 90 per cent to 60 per cent since the incident, and halved domestic consumption of these materials by 2023 compared to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Japan and the United States signed an agreement focused on securing and diversifying supply chains for minerals for clean vehicle batteries. The Japanese government has also initiated collaboration with a number of countries in Asia and Europe, investing in mineral supply chains, research centres as well as joint investments in Africa. Bakshi argues that despite the risk that Japan’s friend-shoring efforts could exacerbate economic disparities and inflate prices, its policy efforts have sought to balance economic, environmental, and security goals. But Bakshi also stresses that Japan must recognise the importance of integrating labour rights and environmental considerations into its development strategies, ensuring sustainable and equitable practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Inflation Reduction Act has been the largest national initiative to combat China’s dominance of clean energy supply chains. A key policy instrument is the tax credit. However, the scope of this credit was expanded from manufacturing to include domestic ore extraction only in October 2024. Whilst this marks a major step forward, Brad Simmons explains that US ore reserves will be insufficient to match demand in the short term. Therefore, it will be necessary for the government to take additional steps to secure mineral supplies from other parts of the world such as Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lobito Corridor project, backed by the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment, is intended to transport minerals from Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Atlantic coast. Simmons proposes two additional initiatives directed at Africa. The first is to work with Morocco, which hosts vast reserves of phosphate that can be used to manufacture lithium iron phosphate batteries. Not only would this approach meet the requirements posed by the Inflation Reduction Act for sourcing nickel, but Morocco is the only African nation with a free trade agreement with the United States. The second proposal is to build a strategic partnership between the United States, the European Union, and the African Union focused on innovation in battery materials and components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;producer-countries-efforts-to-diversify&quot;&gt;Producer countries’ efforts to diversify&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view from producer countries is equally complex. On one hand, they are looking to capitalise on their resources as competition between China and the West deepens. China is for many a large offtaker and investor in mining. Meanwhile, the US is a key commercial and strategic partner, and the Inflation Reduction Act offers new opportunities. But Western policy and corporate overtures are sometimes caught between different policy priorities and struggle to compete with the Chinese playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mineral-rich country, Australia has the opportunity to take advantage of the growing demand for critical mineral ores and metals by developing new mines and refineries. In addition, its mining companies are active overseas. Together, these provide the opportunity for mineral and metal importers to reduce their dependence on Chinese suppliers. However, as Ian Satchwell and John Coyne explain, Australian companies are finding it tough to compete with their Chinese counterparts. The country hosts several rare earth deposits, only one of which has been developed and is in operation, at Mount Weld. Development of the others is being constrained by China’s ability to keep rare earth prices low. A proposed rare earth refinery faces similar challenges. Likewise, Chinese nickel projects in Indonesia have driven down prices for this metal, forcing Australian projects to suspend operations. In Africa, two Australian-operated lithium mines have been expropriated and passed to Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China is not just a competitor to Australian mining interests, it is also a collaborator as a customer for Australian ores and an investor in Australian mines and processing plants. Australia therefore has to take care to balance a variety of interests. Policies have been introduced to promote domestic investment in mining and processing, and 27 bilateral and multilateral agreements have been signed with offtakers for Australian minerals and metals. Despite growing agreement between key actors on the need for cooperative action to address China’s dominance, policy inconsistencies between them undermine effective implementation. For instance, the US financially supports Australian companies in developing critical minerals supply chains outside of China, with the aim of further processing in the US. In the meantime, the Australian government currently restricts its financial support to critical minerals mining and processing operations within Australia. A further challenge is to define and then ensure high standards of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin America has long been known as an important source of mineral supplies. Tom Moerenhout and Victoria Barreto Vieira do Prado argue that the region has new opportunities and challenges as it looks to capitalise on its mineral wealth. Fundamentally, though, Latin America must find partners, not just offtakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among critical minerals, the continent only achieves its potential for copper, tin, and zinc but it has substantial untapped reserves for nickel, graphite, lithium, and rare earths. While the African continent has proved historically more attractive for investors, the generally low standards of environmental and social governance are likely to dissuade many Western investors. In contrast, many Latin American countries are actively raising these standards. In addition, low-carbon energy is more plentiful than in Africa. Set against these advantages, the regulatory and fiscal regimes in Latin American countries have tended to be unattractive to foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been the exception. It is not only the major destination for Latin America’s mineral exports but also the single largest investor in the continent’s mineral resources. Chinese companies are also moving downstream into battery and electric vehicle manufacturing, building local supply chains and creating value added in the region. The United States and the European Union have started to build partnerships with Latin American countries directed at cooperation in the sustainable exploitation of critical minerals and in an effort to gain influence in the region. But mining companies from the United States, Europe, and Australia have been slow to move in. Not only are investments in mining challenging, as discussed above, but these countries would need to invest in processing capacity in order to fully benefit from Latin American minerals. Further, the multilateral Minerals Security Partnership includes no countries from Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, great power competition ultimately serves Latin America as geopolitical stress could become an opportunity to raise investment for their respective clean energy industries. This is true as long as they can remain nonaligned and not get dragged too much into the deteriorating relations between the US and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-the-risks&quot;&gt;Assessing the risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for consumers in the OECD countries, geopolitical stress and China’s dominance of clean energy supply chains raises numerous security concerns. Henrik Wachtmeister presents a summary of a systematic assessment of six of these risks relating to wind power in Sweden. The analytical framework distinguishes threat, vulnerability, and risk. The risks Wachtmeister identifies relating to Chinese ownership are electricity supply cuts and market manipulation, information transfer, and indirect influence. Those arising from dependence on Chinese supply chains are export restrictions, IT sabotage, and again indirect influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wachtmeister then applies this framework to assess the risk of electricity supply cuts in Sweden arising from Chinese ownership of wind farms and the risks of export restrictions. His analysis reveals that the current risk of power cuts is low, even though Chinese state-owned companies own 10.4 percent of Sweden’s installed wind power capacity. This is because these plants contribute only 3.4 percent of national electricity supply. Also, the companies are tied to Power Purchase Agreements under which they would suffer penalties if they cut off supplies. However, the risks to supply would be greater if new investments by Chinese companies lack these agreements. The highest risk therefore relates to the wind supply chain rather than to wind farm ownership because of potential export restrictions that stem from China’s dominance of supply chains for components and for rare earths. This is due to the high consequence and medium-to-high probability of such restrictions being imposed. This, in turn, will depend on the state of political and economic relations between the EU and China. Managing this and other risks will require careful balancing of measures to support domestic industries whilst still taking advantage of Chinese prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, Dan Marks assesses the risks for the UK that stem from China’s dominance in solar PV. China accounted for 71 per cent of global solar cell exports in 2023. Although China supplied more than 90 per cent of the UK’s imports of solar PV equipment in 2023, the absolute value of these imports was much lower than the peak in 2014 as deployment of solar equipment in the UK has slowed. Although solar PV may supply no more than 15 percent of the nation’s electricity at any point between now and 2050, significant capacity additions will still be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any constraint on or interruption to the supply of solar PV equipment from China, whether or not directed specifically at the UK, would raise the cost of electricity to consumers but should have no significant effect on security of supply. In contrast, cyber attacks on inverters and control devices pose a direct threat to supply security. Whilst supply interruptions pose a risk for the UK’s solar industry, that industry only employs about 7,000 people, though this could rise to 60,000 by 2035 if there is a boom in deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the specific risks facing the UK, other concerns relate to the environmental and social governance of China’s solar PV supply chains and the potential for China to use its dominance of this and other clean energy supply chains for geostrategic aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-grip-on-critical-mineral-and-material-supply-is-it-being-weakened&quot;&gt;CHINA’S GRIP ON CRITICAL MINERAL AND MATERIAL SUPPLY: IS IT BEING WEAKENED?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;philip-andrews-speed&quot;&gt;Philip Andrews-Speed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tensions between the West and China have risen, critical minerals and materials for strategic technologies have become one of the battlegrounds for the two parties. The technologies include military, information, and low-carbon-energy applications. China’s dominance of the supply of some of these critical minerals and materials has persuaded Western governments to put in place countermeasures to ease their dependence on China. This paper assesses the likely effectiveness of these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticality of a specific material or technology is generally assessed on the basis of the risk of interruption to supply and on the economic or security importance to an importing nation of such a disruption. In this context, market concentration is a key component of the risk of supply disruption, along with perceptions of the dominant market actors, the projected balance between supply and demand for the material or product, and the degree of transparency of the respective market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the low-carbon energy transition, risks appear along the full supply chain from mineral ores and refined metals to intermediate products and components to final products. Criticality is most often applied to mineral ores and their refined products. Most mineral ores have a relatively widespread geographic occurrence, but the economic viability of deposits is highly variable. For some minerals, only a limited number of mines may be operating at a given time and these may be geographically concentrated. Whilst the locations of ore deposits are defined by geology and immovable, ore processing plants to produce refined metals can be set up wherever economic, logistical, and political factors are favourable. Economies of scale are particularly important. As a result, the sources of supply of a refined metal are commonly much more concentrated than those of its primary ore. Today, China holds a strong and sometimes dominant position in the supply of a few mineral ores and several refined metals that are key inputs to clean energy appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments of many countries have drawn up lists of minerals or materials that they consider to be critical or strategic. These lists vary between countries depending on their domestic natural resources and the demand of their industries. Box 1 lists metals relevant to the low-carbon energy transition that appear on several of these lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-grip-on-critical-mineral-and-material-supplies&quot;&gt;China’s grip on critical mineral and material supplies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s share of global production of mineral ores is small or modest in most cases (Table 1). The most notable exceptions are natural graphite, rare earths, and silicon, where the share is around 70 per cent or more. The situation for refined and processed metals is quite different, for China imports large quantities of ore from around the world to refine or process within its borders. As a result, it accounts for around 90 per cent or more of global production of gallium (a byproduct of bauxite processing), spherical graphite, manganese sulphate, magnetic rare earths, and polysilicon. The country also produces around 60 per cent or more the world’s refined aluminium, cobalt, germanium, and indium (both byproducts of zinc ore processing), lithium carbonate, and tellurium (a byproduct of copper ore processing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y7AYWqJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: China’s share of global ore and metal production for selected critical materials (mainly for 2023, but some data for 2022).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Principal sources: International Renewable Energy Agency (2024), Geopolitics of the Energy Transition, Geopolitics of the energy transition: Energy security (irena.org); &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf&quot;&gt;United States Geological Survey (2024), Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains&quot;&gt;International Energy Agency (2022), Solar PV Global Supply Chains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s precise share of global mineral and metal production can vary from year to year either as part of a long-term trend or due to changes within or outside China. For example, the share of aluminium smelter production increased steadily from 48 per cent in 2014 to 59 per cent in 2022. Conversely, the nation’s share of production of rare earth ores declined from 95 per cent in 2011 to 81 per cent in 2016 as the government tightened controls over mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s 2016 National Plan for Mineral Resources classifies the country’s mineral resources as “strategic”, “advantageous”, “protected”, or “strategic emerging industry” minerals. For the different categories, the plan identifies where China needs to encourage exploration of minerals in short supply, regulate the amount of minerals that China can leverage to pursue strategic objectives, cut production of minerals with excess capacity, and ensure supply of minerals in strategic emerging industries. Two categories are relevant to this paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;metallic minerals - iron, chromium, copper, aluminium, gold, nickel, tungsten, tin, molybdenum, antimony, cobalt, lithium, rare earths, and zirconium;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;nonmetallic minerals - phosphorus, potash, crystalline graphite, and fluorite.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-growing-grip-abroad&quot;&gt;China’s growing grip abroad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compensate for the paucity of ore reserves at home, Chinese companies have moved overseas. They have had long-standing involvement in a small number of countries such Guinea for bauxite, the Democratic Republic of Congo for cobalt, and South Africa for platinum group metals. More recently, they have expanded their overseas activities to mine bauxite and nickel in Indonesia and lithium in a trio of Latin American countries as well as Zimbabwe, among other mining projects (Table 2). In addition, these and other Chinese companies are increasing their involvement in the processing of mineral ores, both in those countries where they are mining and those where they are not. Most notable is Chinese involvement in nickel processing in Indonesia, where the sudden surge of output combined with slowing demand for electric vehicles has undermined nickel prices and threatens the viability of multinational firms involved in nickel mining and refining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Examples of countries where China is deeply involved in the extraction and processing of critical minerals or has bilateral offtake agreements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is important to note that China’s overseas activities have evolved and continue to change based on host country preferences and changes in domestic and international market dynamics. While much of China’s outbound investments in minerals and mining in the early 2000s was supported by the Chinese government or state-owned policy banks, there has also been considerable activity driven by corporate interests and initiated by both state-owned and private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sources-of-risk-posed-by-chinas-dominant-position&quot;&gt;Sources of risk posed by China’s dominant position&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruptions to supplies of ores or materials for which China holds a strong position may be unintentional or intentional. Unintentional disruptions arising within China include natural events and disasters such as floods and droughts, as well as industrial accidents and epidemics. Any of these could significantly reduce the supply of ores and materials from domestic sources for a period. In such circumstances, the government is likely to prioritise supplies to domestic industries at the cost of exports. In an overseas example, China diverted graphite exports away from Sweden and towards Hungary to support a Chinese battery factory there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is likely to apply to any country that has a significant hold on a critical mineral or material supply chain. If such a country supplies mineral ores to China for refining there, then a disruption of ore supply in that country will result in a disruption of processed materials supply in China. In addition to natural events, accidents, and epidemics, this type of disruption may be caused by regulatory action by the host government, independent from any actions by China’s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intentional disruptions are of two main types: export controls and economic statecraft. Over the last year or so, the government has deployed export controls on rare earths, graphite, gallium, germanium, and antimony. These controls do not automatically lead to a reduction of export volumes. Rather, they give the government levers to impose restrictions at short notice. In contrast, the government has banned the export of equipment for extracting and separating rare earths. Economic statecraft involves targeting a specific country. An early prominent example was the reduction of exports of rare earths to Japan in 2010 following a fishing dispute. While exports to Japan fell, flows to other countries, including Australia and the UK, declined too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-countermeasures-of-the-west&quot;&gt;The countermeasures of the West&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan was the only country that took some effective action after China reduced rare earth exports in 2010. However, since 2020, most high-income nations have started to take steps to reduce their dependence on Chinese supplies of critical minerals and materials. These actions have taken place at the national, regional, and global levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US government has been amongst the most active through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which supports investment and guides procurement along the full length of the supply chain, including mining and mineral processing. Resource-rich Australia and Canada are supporting investment in mining and processing for export. The EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act of 2024 includes 2030 targets for mineral extraction, processing, and recycling, as well as limiting overdependence on a single third country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realising that international cooperation was needed, the United States led the establishment of Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) in June 2022 to “bolster critical mineral supply chains essential for the clean energy transition”. A meeting in September 2024 saw the establishment of the MSP Finance Network, which includes development finance institutions and export credit agencies to support investment in critical mineral projects across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-likely-effectiveness-of-these-measures&quot;&gt;The likely effectiveness of these measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors will act to constrain the effectiveness of these measures, despite the financial and political capital being deployed in their support. The first set of constraints relates to the realities of the mineral industry. The development of a new mine anywhere faces several interrelated constraints. First is the need for investors who have access to capital and are prepared to risk fluctuations in commodity prices and host government regulations. Second is the time needed to move from discovery through feasibility study to first production. Even under favourable conditions, this can vary from five years or so for lithium mines to more than 10 years for copper or nickel mines. Third are the negative environmental impacts of mining. These include the use and degradation of land, pollution of air and water, damage to biodiversity, and emission of greenhouse gases. The final constraint relates to the effects on local communities, including their livelihoods and health. The consequences of these and other factors vary between countries and projects. But together they result in high costs, risks, and lead times for most projects. Similar challenges face mineral processing facilities. Though construction times will generally be less than for mines, emissions and waste from these plants are often toxic and their consumption of energy and water is usually large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, obtaining societal and governmental approval for mining and processing projects in most high-income and many middle-income countries is likely to be costly and time consuming and may ultimately be unsuccessful. The ongoing example in Europe is Rio Tinto’s plan to open a lithium mine in Serbia, where strong public opposition is delaying the start of construction despite strong government support and the potential for the mine to transform the economy. A plan to develop a rare earth mine in Arctic Sweden is also facing strong objections. In the United States, tougher environmental regulations are delaying project approvals. The country reportedly has the second longest average time for a mine to progress from discovery to first production, at 29 years. Whilst approval periods may be shorter, the challenge in many mineral-rich countries is to ensure that environmental, social, and governance systems meet international standards. Indonesia is a case where rapid Chinese investment in nickel mining and processing has led to extensive environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second set of constraints originate in China. The country’s strong position in the supply of a few critical mineral ores and several refined metals and materials gives it great influence over international prices. A small change in the share of its production that is exported can have a disproportionate impact on prices. The causes of such fluctuations in export volumes can be unintentional or intentional, as discussed above. The combination of these fluctuations with short-term variations in global demand results in highly unpredictable prices for mineral ores and metals. This is especially the case for critical minerals which are traded in small volumes on illiquid and non-transparent markets. The Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California is an example of a mine that has periodically closed due to such price fluctuations along with environmental regulation. Only with Department of Defense financial support was it able to build its own processing plant. Before that, the ores had been sent to China for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the likelihood is small that these measures to promote mining and ore processing outside China will have a substantial impact on the country’s currently strong or dominant positions in the supply chains for certain critical minerals and mineral products, at least over the next 10 years or even longer. However, they may make a modest contribution to local supplies. More effective may be innovation to reduce or obviate the need for critical minerals in key technologies. These include the development of sodium-ion batteries and permanent magnets free of rare earths. The problem here is that China itself is one of the leaders is developing and bringing to market these technologies. As a result, these innovations may just reinforce China’s dominance of clean energy equipment supply chains, despite a diminution in its dominance of critical mineral supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-critical-minerals-dominance-can-innovation-help&quot;&gt;CHINA CRITICAL MINERALS DOMINANCE: CAN INNOVATION HELP?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;anders-hove&quot;&gt;Anders Hove&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China dominates the market for many of the essential minerals and materials needed to power the global transition to clean energy. This notably includes mining and processing of rare earths used in permanent magnets for wind and electric vehicle (EV) motors, processing of lithium and other minerals used in batteries, and production of silicon for solar panels. As world leaders seek to reduce dependence on China for these critical minerals, analysts have focused narrowly on forecasting the likely supply and demand for these minerals, and on measures to enhance non-Chinese supply. However, as Philip Andrews-Speed argues in this issue, supply-focused measures adopted by Western countries to date are unlikely to have a large impact on Chinese dominance of critical minerals over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While alternatives to critical minerals are part of the supply-demand analysis - for example, lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries or sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries as alternatives with fewer mineral supply constraints - the broader question of innovation as a solution is often omitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is China dominant in critical minerals for the energy transition, it has also become a leading innovation player in clean energy, largely as a result of its robust domestic demand fed by a dynamic and hypercompetitive manufacturing sector. Innovations that reduce critical minerals dependence have already arrived - in China. The question then becomes, how did China achieve dominance of both critical minerals supplies and clean energy innovation? And if innovation in alternatives to critical mineral inputs is likely to help reduce minerals-related vulnerabilities, will this just be replaced by more dependence on China for those very alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;achieving-dominance-scale-and-vertical-integration&quot;&gt;Achieving dominance: scale and vertical integration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three primary reasons why China dominates the critical minerals used in clean energy technologies today. First, China’s rapid scale-up of manufacturing in these technologies, including for domestic Chinese markets, made upstream integration essential. Second, China’s long-term, policy-led focus on mastering and localising strategic industries supported this effort, helping companies weather boom-and-bust cycles, easing financing for risky upstream investments, and facilitating technology transfer in key minerals processing fields. Third, policymakers, policy banks such as the China Development Bank, and state-owned industry actively organised “going-out” policies to facilitate large resource deals in the developing world - often in ways that couldn’t be matched by other countries, not even by the largest private companies in the global mining and resource industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has led the world in clean energy manufacturing for so long that it has come to seem almost inevitable - even though this was hardly foreseeable two decades ago. In 2023, the country sold 8.9 million passenger plug-in EVs, including plug-in hybrids, and in one month sales exceeded 1 million for the first time. In other words, plug-in vehicles in China in a single month exceeded the entire US EV market for the full year of 2023, and accounted for an astonishing two-thirds of the global market for such vehicles. As of mid-2024, EVs have surpassed a 50 per cent market share in new passenger vehicle sales on a monthly basis - not a small feat, given that China is the world’s largest car market. Similarly, for solar energy, China not only dominates manufacturing of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules, but its domestic installation of solar in 2023 amounted to around 200 gigawatts, more than the entire US solar PV installed nationwide and equivalent to half the world market for solar. Installations are on track to top this record figure in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both EVs and solar, China not only leads by a wide margin, but has experienced exponential growth sustained over several years, fuelled by fierce domestic competition among manufacturers keen to achieve scale and market share. In this situation - rapidly growing domestic demand, high returns to scale, and low margins - upstream integration would be almost essential to individual businesses and the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geographical concentration of upstream suppliers within China was essential to the rapid expansion of China’s wind and solar industries. Often, regional or local clusters played a role, such as the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta for solar PV and northern China for wind. Policy and technology characteristics each helped create this concentration: in wind, Chinese domestic content requirements for local projects encouraged foreign manufacturers to set up production in China and to transfer technology, whereas in solar PV, Chinese startups leveraged turnkey production lines imported from abroad. Upstream integration has also been important to the development and scale-up of the battery and EV sectors, where Chinese companies that began as start-ups just over a decade ago now dominate the market for making batteries and pose an imminent threat to leading global carmakers. As just one example, BYD famously sources 90 per cent of parts for its EVs from in-house. Other firms rely on a well-developed local supplier network, such as CATL, which has helped develop a battery industry cluster in and around Fujian province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors contributed to China’s vertical integration in wind, solar, batteries, and EVs, and a full discussion of these is beyond the scope of this paper. As regards critical minerals, however, the important point is that vertical integration in China has not been limited to the immediate fields of manufacturing. Over the past decade, not only has China accelerated the approval of lithium mining operations and rapidly expanded lithium output and processing, but EV and battery companies have invested in upstream production. Over 400 Chinese companies are now involved in battery materials processing. While the Chinese government has promoted the mining sector for years, a major motivation for companies entering the upstream was the need to keep ahead of the domestic competition and secure reliable access to raw material supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;demand-and-domestic-competition-as-catalysts-for-innovation&quot;&gt;Demand and domestic competition as catalysts for innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapidly scaling manufacturing capacity for wind, solar, and batteries has led Chinese firms to compete both to secure upstream minerals supplies and to innovate to reduce costs. Innovation in China runs the gamut, from process-oriented improvements to lab-stage technologies and from end-user design to upstream minerals processing. All are relevant to critical minerals, because every such innovation has the potential to reduce global critical minerals demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the area where China’s innovation has taken a clear lead is in manufacturing - in short, in process-oriented innovation. This type of innovation has helped Chinese firms compete in clean energy sectors where the initial technology was developed elsewhere. In solar and battery manufacturing, Chinese players entered the field after a standardised and modular product design had already become dominant; therefore, reducing costs and beating out competition was largely a matter of scaling up manufacturing and reducing inefficiency and materials losses during production. To take solar PV as an example, production know-how is critical to reducing losses of solar-grade silicon during each stage of the process, from sawing ingots into wafers, to making wafers thinner, to avoiding broken or faulty cells and modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond mastery of process-oriented know-how, China’s scale and heavy investment in R&amp;amp;D means that Chinese players are increasingly able to lead in technologies that reduce materials consumption. This includes both technology-driven improvements in efficiency and investments in new materials that dramatically reduce or avoid critical materials altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On efficiency, Chinese solar and battery manufacturers are now technology leaders. Chinese firms dominate the production of the most advanced solar technologies, with new record solar conversion efficiencies being announced regularly by Chinese manufacturers, including for materials still in the lab stage such as perovskite tandem cells, as well as for fully commercialised technologies such as bifacial, PERC (passivated emitter and rear contact), and n-type monocrystalline PV. In batteries, Chinese players are holding their own in the patent and R&amp;amp;D race versus Japanese, Korean, and US competitors. CATL and BYD, the leading battery players, regularly announce cutting-edge new battery technologies with market-beating efficiencies - for example, CATL’s condensed battery that offers energy density of 500 Wh/kg, or BYD’s Blade battery, which offers greater energy density and reduced cost due to its cell-to-pack design. Again, steadily improved efficiency helps reduce materials consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more important still, Chinese players are leading the race to find alternative technologies that reduce or displace demand for critical minerals. This process is already in evidence with the case of LFP battery technology, which went from being an also-ran in the industry - surpassed in energy density by the more advanced nickel-manganese-cobalt battery chemistry - to taking the majority of battery sales in the huge Chinese EV market. Chinese players didn’t invent LFP: that milestone goes to the Nobel Prize-winning John Goodenough and researchers at University of Texas-Austin and Oxford University. Instead, Chinese companies licensed the technology and scaled it up, in some cases benefitting from state help, such as the invalidation of key patents or the acquisition of US battery startup A123 by Wanxiang. Whereas Western carmakers and Asian battery makers focused on the high end, seeing EVs as a premium product, Chinese players saw an opportunity to compete with lower-priced offerings. Through ongoing innovation, Chinese manufacturers were able to bring LFP-equipped EVs to a level where the price-to-performance ratio was compelling in many mid-range offerings, including notably the made-in-China Tesla Model 3 as well as many US-made standard-range Tesla vehicles. While competing technologies such as nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries have also managed to reduce consumption of critical minerals like cobalt, the impact of China’s success with LFP on materials demand for batteries is undoubtedly far larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same process is now being repeated with Na-ion batteries, another technology long discounted by leading players for its relatively low efficiency, despite its potential for reducing global demand for lithium. While Na-ion batteries have some potential for vehicles, their near-term market is in the field of stationary energy storage. Once again, Chinese players are taking the lead, with CATL and BYD both actively developing and marketing Na-ion products - geared first and foremost for the huge domestic market for grid-scale batteries to back up the country’s surging wind and solar capacity, but also for EVs, where the lower-energy density Na-ion cells can be paired with lithium-ion cells to offer cost-effective performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, Chinese innovation has also played a role in reducing upstream costs for mineral extraction and processing. In China’s hyper-competitive domestic market for clean energy technology, companies seek not only to lock in supply of key inputs, but also to improve upstream efficiencies to beat out the competition. The result has been improvements in age-old but still essential technology processes for extracting and refining ores into pure minerals. Technology transfer and state policy have also played a role - and continue to do so, as shown by the recent state-owned company acquisition of the one remaining foreign-owned rare earths processing facility for making ultra-pure dysprosium. The mineral is essential for permanent magnets used in EV batteries and wind turbines, as well as in high-performance chip-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-and-conclusions&quot;&gt;Implications and conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s dominance of the clean energy industry, and its hybrid approach combining vertical integration with intense innovation, present a contrast with the strategies of many firms in advanced economies, which have tended to focus on disaggregating production to reduce costs. Mining companies focus on their most profitable, high-volume mining activities, carmakers and battery manufacturers seek to source inputs from the cheapest source globally. For miners, surging Chinese investment in relatively low-volume critical minerals results in low prices and low or negative returns, making competition with Chinese players seem futile. For downstream players that need critical mineral inputs, the lack of alternatives puts them in the position of either getting at the back of the line for critical minerals behind competing Chinese original equipment manufacturers, or investing in risky technology bets (such as solid-state batteries at Stellantis and Toyota) that may or may not pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Chinese corporate strategy of vertical integration has succeeded, its core driver is policy. Although subsidies and planning targets are often cited as the main policies at play, there is more to the story. China’s development approach is based on designating strategic emerging industries for long-term support, ultimately leading private players and local officials to channel resources to such technologies. This results in intense domestic competition and efforts such as vertical integration aimed at driving down prices to beat out competitors. This not only causes manufacturing overcapacity, but also spurs rapid learning-by-doing, innovation, and price declines that ultimately help stimulate demand more than subsidies or five-year-plan targets ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation has already proven effective in reducing the world’s demand for critical minerals like cobalt and nickel while scaling up clean energy technologies. The problem is, innovation goes hand-in-hand with deployment; and whereas Chinese players are confident domestic demand will continue to boom, Western players often take a losing approach, waiting for the customer to “catch up” or for supplier input prices to fall. This not only slows investment in the upstream but hinders innovation across the supply chain, putting Chinese players further in the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-need-to-talk-about-graphite-the-geopolitics-and-economics-of-the-battery-anode-value-chain&quot;&gt;WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT GRAPHITE: THE GEOPOLITICS AND ECONOMICS OF THE BATTERY ANODE VALUE CHAIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;ahmed-mehdi&quot;&gt;Ahmed Mehdi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any discussion on the economics and geopolitics of the energy transition cannot ignore the role of graphite. Used as a feedstock to produce electrodes for the steel industry and anode active material (AAM) for the battery industry, graphite’s strategic importance is only set to grow, reinforced by two structural trends: rising global lithium-ion battery demand and growing use of electric arc furnace (EAF) technology in the global steel industry. In the battery market, cathode active materials - such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt - have dominated supply-side concerns among governments and automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising. While graphite is the largest component by weight in a battery pack for anodes, AAM only accounts for 7–10 per cent of the cell cost. Lithium, on the other hand, can make or break cell cost competitiveness. At the same time, anode technology developments have lagged the cathode, with graphite’s incumbent status remaining largely unchanged. And for good reasons, too: graphite provides high thermal and electrical conductivity, reasonable energy density, and strong cycling ability, and is low cost - the latter an important consideration for such a margin-sensitive industry as the global EV market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why is it time to talk about graphite? First, geopolitics: in no other part of the global battery supply chain does China have such a vice-like grip. The reality today is that without Chinese anode material, there is no Western EV industry. Second, market structure and pricing: developments in the Chinese battery and steel market over the past two years have rippled across ex-China markets, creating calls for industry protection via tariffs and subsidies. With the West seeking to play catch-up, what is the reality governing this market and where next for the ex-China market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;graphite-is-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;Graphite is here to stay&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, global graphite demand reached around 3.6 million metric tonnes, with most of the demand split across two major industries - graphite for high-purity electrodes used in steel production, and graphite for AAM used in the battery industry. Graphite electrode demand is expected to continue growing over the next decade as EAF penetration rates rise, particularly in China (where current EAF penetration rates are around 10 per cent but are expected to reach 25 per cent by 2040). Despite some wobbles to EV sales this year (particularly in Europe), battery AAM demand from the EV sector will still see growth of 20–25 per cent this year. By 2026, it is expected that graphite demand from the battery sector will comfortably take over demand from the steel sector, reinforcing graphite’s strategic importance to the global automotive and energy storage market&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite’s role as a primary feedstock for battery AAM comes from its chemical structure. The large interstices between the carbon atoms prevent structural change during charge and discharge cycles. As a result, graphite provides not only long cycle life to the battery but also reasonable energy density for modern battery cell chemistries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, questions have been raised around the threats to long-term graphite demand, primarily from three major areas: (1) pure silicon anodes, which do not use graphite, (2) sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries, which do not use graphite but rather hard carbons as the primary anode feedstock, and (3) solid-state batteries - seen as the holy grail for next-generation batteries - which would replace graphite-based anodes with lithium metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all three technologies are set to play a role in the future evolution of the battery supply chain, graphite’s incumbent position is likely to remain. This is for three main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, small amounts of silicon (7–8 per cent) are already being used in today’s market to improve the energy density of a battery cell. Where graphite can store one lithium atom per six carbon atoms, silicon alloys can store up to four lithium atoms per silicon atom. The specific capacity of silicon - the amount of electric charge (measured in milliampere hours, mAh) that can be delivered per gram of material - is 3,590 mAh/g, ~10 times greater than that of graphite, reinforcing the energy density gains that can be made. The technical hurdle for silicon, however, remains the expansion of silicon during charge/discharge. While graphite anodes may expand by around 7 per cent during charge/discharge, silicon anodes can expand anywhere between 250 and 300 per cent during charge, leading to fractures and premature cell failure. In short, silicon doping remains the name of the game for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, interest in Na-ion batteries has grown since the lithium price hike of 2022 - a technology actively promoted by Chinese cellmakers as a hedge to lithium price volatility. The strong cycle life and safety of Na-ion has made the technology a widely coveted one, particularly by storage developers. The economics of Na-ion are highly compelling when lithium prices are above US$40kg/t, but less so in a US$10–20kg/t environment. This reinforces the point that Na-ion will certainly play a future role in the battery market but will be sensitive to the lithium price. At the same time, while Na-ion anodes cannot use graphite (due to the larger ionic size of sodium ions, which do not fit between the graphite anode layers) the replacement material, hard carbons, remains a small market which requires scaling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the solid-state battery market - which would replace graphite anodes with lithium metal - remains in its infancy. Not only has the supply chain not yet fully scaled, but ongoing challenges with the use of a solid electrolyte remain, particularly dendrite formation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-synthetic-and-natural-split&quot;&gt;The synthetic and natural split&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battery anode market has two main types of supply: natural graphite AAM and synthetic graphite AAM. The natural anode supply chain starts with mined material known as natural flake graphite, which comes in various flake sizes and purity levels. The flake graphite undergoes mechanical treatment such as spheronisation and purification to become natural AAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, to produce synthetic graphite AAM, either needle coke (produced in a delayed coker from aromatic slurry oil) or petroleum coke undergoes graphitisation, the process of heating the carbon materials to ~2,500–3,000°C in an electric furnace to transform the material into an ordered graphitic structure. Further steps include coating and baking. Unlike cathode active materials, where the largest cost component is raw materials, AAM costs are largely driven by processing, particularly electricity costs for graphitisation. This partly explains why most Chinese graphitisation operations take place in Inner Mongolia - a source of low-cost electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While natural graphite AAM has slightly higher specific capacity, lower costs, and marginally better environmental standards than synthetic material, around 70–80 per cent of today’s global battery anode market is made up of synthetic AAM. This is largely due to the better product quality of synthetic material and its homogeneity. Inconsistencies in natural anode quality have been a bugbear for auto OEMs, who undertake strict qualification cycles to avoid recall risks and cell failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-dominance&quot;&gt;Chinese dominance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no other part of the global battery value chain does China have such dominance as it does in the anode segment. In the natural market, while Africa (Madagascar/Mozambique) accounts for ~15–20 per cent of flake supply, more than 94 per cent of this supply is exported to China for processing/spheronisation. In the synthetic market, while China relies on premium needle coke imports from producers such as Phillips 66 to produce synthetic graphite for high-quality electrodes, it currently hosts around 98 per cent of the world’s graphitisation capacity. For both synthetic and natural anodes, China holds around 90 per cent anode market share (see Figure 1), with the biggest ex-China natural anode producer being Posco Chemicals, a key anchor client for ex-China flake producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oE7CHqs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Global battery AAM demand by chemistry and % of ex-China AAM supply.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Benchmark Minerals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not the end of the story, however. Within China itself, anode market competition is one of the toughest. While there are around 75–100 anode companies operating in today’s market (80–90 per cent of which are based in China), three Chinese majors - BTR, Shanshan, and Putailai - account for almost 50 per cent of global market share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside these tier-1 players, the industry is highly fragmented among tier-2 and tier-3 players all competing for cell and OEM customers in what has become one of the most dog-eat-dog markets in the Chinese battery value chain. In this sense, Chinese market behaviour is just as much about domestic competition as it is about preventing new market entrants from outside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cost-control-and-the-synthetic-pivot&quot;&gt;Cost control and the synthetic pivot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only the consolidated market structure of the anode market that matters for the West. Another key trend over the past few years has been the ability of Chinese anode producers to lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graphite market has historically been driven by developments in the steel industry. Synthetic graphite - the feedstock used for electrodes in steel - gained major attention in 2017-18 when a global shortage in needle coke sent prices skyrocketing to nearly US$5,000/t because of China’s booming EAF demand (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the market corrected shortly after, the next major cycle took place after Covid, for entirely different reasons - namely, the surge in post-Covid battery cell utilisation rates, which boosted demand for battery AAM. Given that graphitisation makes up the bulk of anode production costs (40–50 per cent), non-integrated anode players faced significant margin pressure from the dramatic increase in graphitisation tolling fees (see Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OxPfoeT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode was a major lesson for Chinese anode players. In response, the key cost-cutting exercise executed since 2021–2022 has been greater vertical integration and graphitisation in-housing, reducing the need to use third-party tollers. The second major cost-cutting strategy has been feedstock switching. Chinese anode players have been able to take advantage of the slowdown in China’s steel and aluminium industry since 2022 by directing cheaper coke feedstocks into the battery pool. The slump in Chinese aluminium demand in 2022 blew out coke spreads, making it more economic to produce synthetic anode material from pre-calcined cokes, typically earmarked for the aluminium sector. At the same time, the slowdown in Chinese steel demand from the property crisis provided graphite electrode players an opportunity to pivot into the battery market - an easy move given the sunk costs in graphitisation technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of these dynamics, alongside government subsidies, have helped China significantly increase its synthetic anode capacity, driving a major oversupply into the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CPRQErf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic implications of these developments have been two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, China’s synthetic pivot has narrowed the price differential between natural and synthetic anode material, effectively reducing natural graphite fines demand and keeping up pressure on spot fines pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, in today’s ex-China battery anode market, around 65–70 per cent is made up of natural anode players (led by Posco in South Korea), with the rest made up of synthetic anode players. China’s synthetic oversupply has effectively compressed the margins of natural players. As shown in Figure 5, Chinese anode prices are now below cash costs of production for ex-China players, effectively putting Western players out of the money.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;graphite-geopolitics&quot;&gt;Graphite geopolitics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond market structure, graphite geopolitics have also dominated attention in Western OEM boardrooms. In late 2023, China’s government tightened export controls on graphite products. While synthetic graphite had already been subject to controls since the mid-2000s, the new policy in 2023 targeted high-purity anode materials, including natural products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, ex-China anode equities rallied on the news. Panic buying ensued. Korea’s graphite industry, seeing the licensing restriction as part of China’s retaliation for Western industrial policy, found itself caught between both superpowers, with one Korean trade executive stating: “we are like a shrimp getting caught in a fight between whales.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s move was relevant in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prior to the move, exports were a way for tier-2 and tier-3 Chinese producers to boost their profitability and offset margin weakness at home. Against this backdrop, tier-1 producers lobbied for a tightening of the regime to cut off this mechanism, helping accelerate rationalisation in the oversupplied Chinese anode market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While some western players used the news to bolster their business cases in front of government funding agencies, the reality is that by targeting natural products, China has used the new licensing regime to slowly cut its purchases of western flake supply. In 2024, for example, Syrah Resources, a darling of the Western anode market, reported zero flake material sales to China, amplifying the company’s financial pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-can-the-west-do&quot;&gt;What can the West do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this all leave the West? For Western anode players, 2024 has been a mixed year. Despite ongoing price pressures, Western industrial policy - primarily in the US - is helping even the playing field for struggling producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North America, demand-side credits such as the Clean Vehicle Credit (CVC) offer a subsidy of US$7,500 for EV buyers, with the credits linked to OEMs needing to satisfy certain thresholds on critical mineral and component sourcing. Importantly, access to the CVC credits require that no material originates from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) countries, key among them China. While graphite holds a lower value than lithium, for example, the immaturity of the ex-China anode value chain triggered a wave of OEM lobbying to push for delays to restrictions on graphite sourcing. As a result, FEOC guidelines were amended this year to allow Chinese supply to continue uninterrupted until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this delay was a blow to ex-China anode players, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) CVC credits are a game-changer and a key source of support as Western players launch fresh financing rounds this year and next. Assuming an average pack size in the US EV market of 75 Kwh, US$7,500 would translate to a government subsidy of US$100/Kwh, almost the entire cost of a high-energy-density cell (2024 prices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this light, even if US anode producers sign offtakes with cellmakers or OEMs using a floor price well above Chinese spot prices, IRA credit provisions more than offset the price differential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore no surprise that 2024 has seen a pickup in offtakes between US OEMs/cellmakers and anode producers, the most notable this year being Panasonic/Novonix, Westwater/SK On, and Nouveau Monde/GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is possible that the two-year graphite exemption could be extended even further (or that EV credits are removed altogether by President-elect Donald Trump), anode players have also lobbied successfully for protectionist support in the form of tariffs. Historically, tariffs on natural and synthetic AAM were waived in 2020 to 0 per cent, largely a result of Tesla lobbying. However, in May 2024 the US Department of Energy reinstated tariffs at 25 per cent, and these are due to kick in from the mid-2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these are positive developments for US anode players, the challenge is now execution. China has mastered the anode value chain, and financing teams comfortable with offtake pricing terms will double down on technology due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the reality is that China is still not out. China will continue to act as a source of baseload supply to US OEMs. On top of that, China has not been standing still in response to Western industrial policy. Tier-1 anode players have expanded aggressively overseas, particularly in IRA-compliant trade destinations, a strategy to gain back-door access to the US market. Key destinations for Chinese anode players include Indonesia, Morocco and Europe - the latter now an open sink for Chinese battery players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, two other developments will be interesting to watch and could prove a game-changer for the ex-China market. First, oil companies with downstream refining assets could enter the needle coke market and further push into downstream graphitisation. Oil companies are already transforming lithium supply-side economics. Second, an easy source of additional synthetic anode supply for the battery market could emerge from Western graphite electrode players seeking to pivot into the battery AAM market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nickel is a key component of nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide batteries, which dominate global EV battery markets. Despite the growing importance of nickel-free battery chemistries such as lithium-iron-phosphate and sodium-ion, the International Energy Agency estimates nickel demand will double from 3.1 million metric tons per year in 2023 to 6 million metric tons in 2040, mainly driven by demand for nickel-rich batteries for EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article examines the decarbonisation of the Indonesian nickel supply chain from a political economy perspective, highlighting the tensions between economic interests and environmental concerns. These tensions give rise to an Indonesian energy transition paradox: the ostensible purpose of the nickel-based battery industry is to decarbonise the transportation sector, but the battery industry itself relies on newly constructed coal power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indonesias-nickel-industry---booming-and-carbon-intensive&quot;&gt;Indonesia’s nickel industry - booming and carbon-intensive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of nickel ore and refined nickel and has come to dominate the upstream segment of global nickel supply chains for EVs. This is the consequence of conscious Indonesian policy choices aimed at capitalising on the country’s abundant nickel resources. Indonesia supplied 34 per cent of global nickel ore in 2020, growing to 52 per cent in 2023, while its share of global refined nickel production jumped from 23 per cent in 2020 to 37 per cent in 2023. Although most of the nickel is used to make stainless steel, Indonesia plans to gradually shift its production to the battery-grade nickel products nickel matte and mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP), in the hope of deriving greater economic value from its resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Indonesia takes the lead on the upstream segment of global EV production, its battery and EV manufacturing industries remain at the infant stage. Indonesia inaugurated its first EV battery manufacturer only in July 2024, located in West Java. China’s dominance of the global EV supply chain appears even more difficult for Indonesia to challenge than for the EU or the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s nickel boom is in the spotlight because of its emissions. Battery cathode production, which includes nickel mining and processing, is responsible for more than 40 per cent of carbon emissions from EV production. This is due to the energy-intensive processes involved in cathode production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation and industrial heat results in highly carbon-intensive nickel production. Most nickel processing facilities in Indonesia get their power from captive, off-grid coal power plants with generation capacities of hundreds of megawatts each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;indonesias-prioritisation-of-investment-over-decarbonisation&quot;&gt;Indonesia’s prioritisation of investment over decarbonisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ambition of the Indonesian state under Presidents Joko Widodo and Prabowo has been to capitalise on the country’s abundant nickel resources to attract more investment, create jobs and business opportunities, and ultimately establish a vertically integrated domestic EV industry. To achieve this, government policy incentivises and provides special treatment for investment in smelters and captive coal power plants while marginalising the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian nickel boom was launched in 2020 by restricting the export of unprocessed nickel ore in order to stimulate domestic nickel smelting and investment in EV manufacturing. Although this policy was challenged by the EU in the World Trade Organization, Indonesia insisted on continuing to ban exports of unprocessed nickel ore. Following the ban, Indonesia’s nickel export value grew by 34 per cent between 2019 and 2023, with a growing share of nickel matte and MHP in exports following the opening of several hydrometallurgical smelters after 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To incentivise investment in nickel smelters, the government added them to the National Strategic Projects list, rendering them eligible for accelerated permits, eased access to land, and conversion of forests to industrial land. As a result, 54 nickel smelters were operating in Indonesia in 2024, five times the 2020 figure. Most smelters produce class 2 nickel products, such as nickel pig iron and ferronickel for the stainless-steel industry. However, the government plans to halt new class-2 nickel smelter construction and build more battery-grade nickel smelters. In 2024, Indonesia has two high-energy-intensive pyrometallurgical smelters producing nickel matte and five hydrometallurgical smelters, a less energy-intensive smelter type, converting nickel laterite ore to MHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s presence in Indonesia’s nickel sector is ubiquitous. As shown in Table 1, most nickel smelters that produce nickel for batteries are backed at least partly by Chinese capital. China is also the main export destination for refined nickel products, as Indonesia has no domestic cathode manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MzVlUY4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Battery-oriented nickel smelters in Indonesia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s president actively persuaded major foreign EV and battery manufacturers to invest in the midstream segment. The state has also taken a direct stake in the battery industry by establishing the Indonesia Battery Corporation, an EV battery manufacturer owned by four state-owned enterprises: Mining Industry Indonesia (a national mining holding company), Aneka Tambang (a national mining corporation), Perusahaan Listrik Negara (the national utility), and Pertamina (the national oil company). To boost domestic demand for EVs and thus for batteries, Indonesia has adopted incentives for domestic EV production. However, so far, EV penetration in Indonesia remains low, with only 2 per cent of new cars sold in 2023 being electric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Indonesia has strong and clear ambitions for its battery-oriented nickel industry, it has shown less interest in the emissions from this industry. The government gives preferential treatment to new captive coal power plants for the nickel industry. Nickel smelters are classified as national strategic projects and thereby excluded from the country’s coal power plant moratorium, which was enacted in 2022. As a result, there has been a construction boom for captive coal power plants. In 2023, their capacity to supply the nickel industry reached 7 GW (two-thirds of the country’s total captive coal power plant capacity), with an additional 9 GW in the pipeline. As shown in Table 1, six out of seven battery-grade nickel smelters depend on coal power for their electricity supply. Two smelters plan to add solar power in 2025; whether they succeed remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Indonesia encourages financing for captive coal power plants for the nickel industry by labelling them amber in the country’s Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. As a result, they are eligible for energy transition financing on the condition that they are built by 2031, shut down by 2050, and commit to reducing their carbon emissions by 35 per cent during the first 10 years of operation. Decarbonisation is anticipated to be achieved through electrostatic precipitators, biomass cofiring, or carbon capture and storage, for which Indonesia has high hopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete plans for decarbonisation of captive generation were omitted from the 2023 comprehensive investment and policy plan document of the Just Energy Transition Partnership, a G7-led initiative for decarbonising Indonesia’s power sector. Apparently, this was due to lack of information about captive generation and the challenge of balancing the government’s industrialisation and decarbonisation efforts. The exclusion was expected to be temporary, as the Just Energy Transition Partnership secretariat kicked off a study of captive power for the 2024 plan update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesian policymakers and the state-owned monopoly electricity company Perusahaan Listrik Negara are unwilling to phase out coal-dependent electricity generation swiftly; they argue that it needs to keep running to ensure affordable and stable electricity for the public and industry, and that Indonesia is too poor to fund the transition. The low coal price cap at US$70 per tonne, and vested coal industry elite interests, result in unattractive conditions for renewable energy investment in Indonesia’s major electricity grid on Java, the country’s economic and industrial centre. If anyone wants to establish renewables-based battery or EV manufacturing on Java, they will thus have to build their own on-site renewable power plant. In principle, renewable energy certificates can be purchased; but in practice it is difficult to source off-site renewable energy, as power wheeling and direct power purchase agreements with renewable developers are unavailable. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Investment, the unavailability of clean energy was one reason why Tesla abandoned its plan to invest in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s lax carbon regulations perpetuate carbon-intensive industrial activities. A carbon cap and trade scheme was introduced in the Indonesian power sector in 2022, starting with smaller coal power plants. As of 2024, its implementation is limited to grid-connected coal power plants, leaving captive coal power plants and carbon-intensive industries untouched by the regulation. There is no carbon tax for the manufacturing industry either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the pressure to disclose carbon footprints is low. Sustainability reporting is only required for companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. While international financial institutions are increasingly concerned about environmental, social, and governance disclosure for their investments, only 12 of the 54 nickel smelters currently operating in Indonesia disclose their carbon emissions in their annual sustainability reports. And few of those 12 comply with international standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative in terms of the quality and detail of reporting. Nickel companies with shareholders listed on foreign bourses - such as the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Australian Stock Exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, or Tokyo Stock Exchange - are subject to additional pressure to disclose their carbon footprint to fulfil the mandatory sustainability disclosure rules of those stock exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-influence-of-trade-partners&quot;&gt;The influence of trade partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the global supply chains, trade partners can exercise decarbonisation pressure on each other. In 2023, the EU established a battery regulation to tighten the carbon footprint requirements for batteries produced, sold, or used in the European common market. The regulation requires battery producers, distributors, and importers to declare their carbon footprint for their supply chain starting in 2025, with a carbon footprint threshold to be established in 2028. The regulation will create a new carbon standard for battery manufacturers, which may impact Indonesia and other China-linked battery supply chains, as China provides 34 per cent of the EU’s battery supply. Meanwhile, China, the primary destination market for Indonesian nickel, limits its emissions regulation to domestic industry and does not cover Chinese overseas investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s nickel industry needs to start decarbonising if it wants to gain access to more capital and wider markets for its products. In that case, the country should enhance its carbon regulations for captive coal power plants and energy-intensive industries such as nickel smelting, improve carbon emission transparency, and consolidate efforts to assist energy-intensive companies in calculating and reporting their emission levels. To decarbonise EV and battery manufacturing, Indonesia would also need to reduce its support for coal to improve the relative attractiveness of investment in renewable energy, incentivise companies to install on-site renewables, and provide manufacturers with access to off-site clean energy through power wheeling or direct power purchasing agreements with renewable energy developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-the-future-japans-quest-for-critical-minerals-in-the-shadow-of-china&quot;&gt;SECURING THE FUTURE: JAPAN’S QUEST FOR CRITICAL MINERALS IN THE SHADOW OF CHINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;parul-bakshi&quot;&gt;Parul Bakshi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the devastating aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster to the ambitious commitments of the Paris Agreement and the stark realities posed by the recent Russia–Ukraine and Middle Eastern conflicts, Japan’s energy landscape has undergone profound transformations, catalysing a national reassessment and underscoring the need for a resilient and diversified energy system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s policies underline the commitment to both domestic resource development and diversified international supply chains. This dual approach aims to mitigate supply disruption risks amidst escalating global energy rivalries and conflicts over low-carbon technology value chains, which are key to competitiveness, economic development, energy sovereignty, and security. With lithium demand projected to triple by 2025 compared to 2020, alongside significant increases in cobalt and copper requirements, immense pressure is placed on global mineral supply chains critical for the energy transition. These challenges are compounded by the dynamic nature of material criticality, driven by economic, geopolitical, and technological shifts, prompting Japan to continually adapt its strategies to meet evolving technological advancements and shifting market demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of energy security through critical minerals involves navigating vulnerabilities that can slow the pace of the energy transition. Localised disruptions in mineral supply can have ripple effects throughout the global energy system, underscoring the interconnected nature of these resources. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions and market manipulations in mineral-rich regions can inflate costs and prolong reliance on fossil fuels, contrary to the objectives of the clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s acute awareness of its mineral dependencies, given its limited natural resources and high import reliance, has propelled it to take a proactive stance in securing these vital materials. This is evidenced by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry recognising 35 minerals as critical, illustrating Japan’s strategic measures to safeguard its technological and energy advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is navigating complex geopolitical and environmental challenges, and its strategy highlights the deep interconnection between national security and climate goals, positioning Japan’s international partnerships and innovative policies as a comprehensive blueprint for the global transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-leverage-in-global-critical-minerals&quot;&gt;China’s strategic leverage in global critical minerals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China stands at the forefront of the global supply chain for critical minerals. It dominates this value chain through strategic policies and export controls that significantly affect global market dynamics, influencing both their availability and pricing. Additionally, China’s role as a low-cost supplier of clean energy equipment, such as batteries, helps mitigate some economic challenges associated with the global clean energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents a complex dilemma: on one hand, the global dependency on China arises from both demand dynamics and economic advantages; on the other hand, there is a growing impetus for decoupling and diversification from China to ensure stability and security in supply chains. This tension underscores the strategic challenges nations face as they navigate the intricacies of energy transition, balancing economic efficiencies with the imperative for secure, sustainable supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite possessing only 34 per cent of the world’s identified rare earth reserves, China’s command over the annual mine output and processing stages is significant, with about 70 per cent of global mine output and 90 per cent of refining capabilities under its control. This extensive influence across all stages of the supply chain not only provides China with substantial leverage over global markets but also intensifies concerns about supply security amid geopolitical tensions. For instance, in August 2023, China imposed export controls on gallium and germanium, crucial for semiconductor manufacturing, with additional restrictions introduced on rare earth elements for motor magnets in October and graphite for batteries in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s mining interests are not confined within its borders but span continents, with significant investments in mining operations for copper and cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, lithium in Australia and Latin America, and nickel in Indonesia. These ventures facilitate the return of a significant portion of these minerals to China for processing and refinement, further centralising control within its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China currently holds a quasi-monopolistic stance in the critical minerals market, it has been suggested that factors such as reserve depletion, the emergence of new mining sites, and enhanced recycling methods could reduce its market share. However, China’s existing capacity in mining and processing continues to play a pivotal role, posing significant geopolitical risks that need to be managed through international cooperation and strategic policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reassessing-security-japans-response-to-the-2010-rare-earth-crisis&quot;&gt;Reassessing security: Japan’s response to the 2010 rare earth crisis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s supply chain vulnerabilities came to the forefront during its 2010 diplomatic tensions with China, following a maritime incident near the Senkaku Islands. This conflict, involving a Chinese fishing trawler and Japanese coast guard vessels, escalated to China imposing an informal ban on the export of rare earth minerals to Japan. The embargo caused significant disruptions, especially in the Japanese automotive sector, which relied heavily on these materials for essential components like magnets. While trade normalised after the resolution of incident, the prices of rare earths surged tenfold within a year, highlighting the precarious nature of Japan’s supply chain dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Japan developed a comprehensive strategy aimed at mitigating future risks associated with single-source dependency. A supplemental budget of JPY 100 billion was allocated in October 2010, to reduce its dependency on Chinese rare earths from 90 per cent to more manageable levels. The strategic pillars of this initiative included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;development of alternative technologies that reduce the use of rare earths;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;promotion of recycling initiatives to recover rare earths from used products;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;strengthening of capacities to invest in and develop rare earth mines globally, particularly in Australia, which emerged as a key partner;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;establishment of stockpiles of critical minerals to buffer against supply disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to prompt policy actions, Japan has effectively reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earth imports from 90 per cent to 60 per cent since the incident, and halved domestic consumption of these materials by 2023 compared to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, reports emerged suggesting that China’s decline in rare earth exports to Japan was not targeted but rather stemmed from a broader decision, made two months before the trawler collision, to reduce global rare earth exports by 40 per cent. Additionally, a Japanese Ministry of Finance analysis of Japanese port data showed no uniform drop in imports of Chinese rare earths following the incident. Furthermore, a 2023 assessment based on the import share of critical minerals from China found little evidence of selective targeting of its trade partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the broader implications of China’s export restrictions came under international scrutiny in 2012 when the United States, the European Union, and Japan challenged China’s practices at the World Trade Organization. The complaint centred on China’s restrictive export quotas on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum, which were viewed as attempts to manipulate the market and maintain a competitive edge. The World Trade Organization ruled against China, highlighting the global implications of national policies for the supply of critical raw materials and underscoring the need for fair trade practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unfavourable ruling, China defended its policies as necessary to protect its environmental and economic interests, indicating a complex interplay between global trade rules and national policy objectives. Regardless of intent, Chinese actions fostered global mistrust and are viewed as a significant example of its assertiveness, leveraging its geopolitical advantage. It served as a watershed moment for Japan, fundamentally reshaping its approach to securing critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-geopolitical-manoeuvring-in-the-critical-minerals-arena&quot;&gt;Japan’s geopolitical manoeuvring in the critical minerals arena&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s influence in the global critical minerals market grows, Japan is strategically diversifying its supply sources and enhancing both domestic and international production capabilities, thereby reshaping the dynamics of energy geopolitics. This strategic shift not only aims to reduce dependency but also fortifies Japan’s energy security and economic stability against geopolitical upheavals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese government’s proactive approach can be termed the “3D strategy”: derisk (energy security), decarbonise (environment), and develop (economy), aligned with its 3E+S strategy, which highlights the pillars of Japanese energy policy - energy security, economic efficiency, and environmental protection, plus safety (added post-Fukushima). Since the mid-2000s, Japan has prioritised the identification of critical minerals and risk mitigation through substantial investments in domestic initiatives and international partnerships. This comprehensive strategy emphasises overseas projects, advancements in recycling and substitution methods, and strategic stockpiling, all designed to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;domestic-efforts&quot;&gt;Domestic efforts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New International Resource Strategy (2020) marked a significant step in augmenting these efforts, setting ambitious goals for emergency stockpiling, supporting domestic private-sector mining and smelting initiatives, and increasing stockpile targets to 60 days and up to 180 days for minerals with higher geopolitical risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has also intensified its exploration of submarine deposits of critical minerals, discovering six significant sites off Okinawa between 2013 and 2017. Plans are underway to commence commercial exploitation of seabed minerals within its exclusive economic zone starting in 2028, supported by a budget of JPY 215.8 billion. This includes major projects like the exploration of manganese nodules near Minamitorishima, discovered in 2016, estimated to contain 234 million tons and poised to meet long-term mineral requirements - nickel for 75 years, cobalt for 11 years, dysprosium for 730 years, and yttrium for 780 years. However, the environmental impact of large-scale mining on the ocean floor necessitates careful management and licensing from the International Seabed Authority to mitigate damage and align with global environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to losing 80 per cent of critical minerals through the export of used EVs, the Japanese government has implemented measures to certify the performance of used batteries and promoting local recycling, thereby ensuring these vital minerals are retained within Japan. The Japan Research Institute estimates that a circular economy model for used electric vehicle batteries could significantly increase market value, reaching JPY 600 billion by 2030 and JPY 8 trillion by 2050. Innovation, a key component of these efforts, is seen particularly in the development of perovskite solar cells that utilise iodine - where Japan holds the second-largest share - positioning it as a viable alternative to China-led silicon-based cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning these strategies, the 2022 Economic Security Promotion Act and the National Security Strategy have prioritised reducing excessive dependence on specific countries and establishing a secure, stable supply of critical goods, including rare earths. These policies aim to strengthen Japan’s economic security by ensuring a steady supply of essential materials and supporting sustainable practices in the energy and technology sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;role-of-japan-organization-for-metals-and-energy-security&quot;&gt;Role of Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to Japan’s strategy is the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC), which spearheads initiatives in exploration, recycling, alternative material development, and strategic stockpiling. With branches in 13 countries, JOGMEC enhances Japan’s mineral acquisition by offering financial support through liability and debt guarantees, equity participation, and loans to mitigate risks for Japanese enterprises. It aims to achieve 80 per cent self-sufficiency in base metals like copper and nickel by 2030 through collaborations with foreign firms. Following the end of China’s rare earth embargo, JOGMEC orchestrated a pivotal $250 million deal with the Australian rare earth company Lynas, securing a continuous supply of rare earths and reinforcing Lynas’s role in the global market, where it now provides 12 per cent of the world’s rare earth oxides. As of 2023, Lynas supplied about 90 per cent of Japan’s neodymium and praseodymium. Between 2004 and 2020, JOGMEC engaged in over 100 projects with investments exceeding $600 million; it currently manages more than 30 projects across 15 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOGMEC illustrates how effective institutional development and policy implementation can enhance resilience in a complex global environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-collaborations&quot;&gt;International collaborations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Japanese government estimates, installing just 10 GW of offshore wind by 2030 would require about 10 per cent of Japan’s 2018 copper consumption and 20 per cent of its niobium rare earth consumption - resources that cannot be fully supplied by recycling and substitution. As a result, Japan is increasingly turning to international collaborations to secure the necessary minerals to meet its energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts include partnerships with resource-rich countries, such as Australia for rare earths and lithium and Canada for cobalt. Such alliances, often underpinned by bilateral agreements, provide Japan with direct access to critical minerals, reducing its dependency on volatile suppliers like China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Japan and the United States signed an agreement focused on securing minerals for clean vehicle batteries, extending collaborations to South Korea to strengthen semiconductor and mineral supply chains. It invested in a research centre to develop production in Vietnam. Japan is also developing semiconductor facilities and nickel supply chains with the Philippines and bolstering supply chains and mining projects with France and the United Kingdom, with plans for joint investments in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Japan is active in multilateral initiatives such as the Minerals Security Partnership and the Quad Working Group on Critical Minerals, which focus on securing stable mineral supplies for regional security and economic prosperity. Also, during the G7 meeting in 2023, which it hosted, Japan committed over JPY 200 billion to enhance its mineral resources and spearheaded the adoption of the Five-Point Plan for Critical Minerals Security, emphasising the need for diversified supply chains to mitigate strategic dependencies, notably against China’s dominance. By continuing to enhance its domestic capabilities and strengthen international partnerships, Japan not only aims to secure its energy transition but also to influence global standards and practices in mineral supply chain management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s strategic management of critical minerals showcases a comprehensive blueprint, highlighting the importance of a multifaceted strategy that addresses policy, innovation, institutional, and diplomatic fronts. By diversifying its sources and reducing reliance on Chinese rare earths, Japan not only enhances its energy security but also contributes to global market stability, by reducing the world’s dependency on a single supplier and mitigating the risk of the kind of supply shocks and price volatility that led to the 2010 crises. These measures help prevent similar disruptions from impacting international economic and technological progress by promoting a more distributed and resilient global supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite robust strategies, Japan faces challenges like intense global competition for resources and potential geopolitical tensions in supply regions. Critics of friend-shoring also argue that Japan’s strategy may exacerbate economic disparities and increase geopolitical risks by fuelling competition and inflating prices, potentially leading to heightened areas of conflict and economic inequality. Japan must also recognise the importance of integrating labour rights and environmental considerations into its development strategies, ensuring sustainable and equitable practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan’s approach to securing critical minerals is not without its flaws, the ongoing mistrust of China’s role in the global market underscores the need for diversification of sources, presenting opportunities for other nations to play significant roles in the wider global energy transition and, consequently, in the geopolitics of energy. Japan’s approach provides valuable insights into balancing economic, environmental, and security goals. It emphasises the need for ongoing innovation, strong international partnerships, and supportive policies that foster sustainable and fair practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst decarbonisation imperatives, burgeoning demand for critical minerals for the energy transition has solidified its role as a front line in the increasingly fierce US–China industrial competition. The era of industrial rejuvenation envisioned as an outcome of the Biden administration’s climate and energy legislative achievements will mean little for supply chain diversification if the United States cannot wrest market dominance from Chinese actors and achieve the diversification needed to preserve its energy security. Though President-elect Trump’s campaign rhetoric would indicate radical departures from the Biden administration’s energy and climate policy, resilience in critical material supply chains has been a rare area of bipartisan consensus and continuity between alternating party control of the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data on investments stimulated by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) indicate progress toward the Biden administration’s industrial vision, but investment in critical minerals has been substantially lower than other manufacturing investments in clean energy technologies since the start of the administration. Critical mineral industrial investments have made up a mere 6 per cent of the $113 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments in the US between 2020 and the second quarter of 2024, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint database provided by the Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Meanwhile, battery gigafactory and associated component manufacturing investments have reached nearly $69 billion over that same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emerging industrial capacity gap poses challenges to both US energy security and industrial competitiveness if China is able to retain its dominant market share in mineral supply chains essential to decarbonisation technologies. The Treasury Department only finalised the rulemaking process for the most consequential IRA tax credit for critical materials production, 45X, on 24 October 2024. The 45X tax credit provides an incentive for the expansion of advanced manufacturing facilities in the United States. It covers a wide range of clean energy technologies, including batteries, their components, and the production of underlying input materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original proposed rule excluded the extraction of minerals from the costs of production as part of the deductible value of critical mineral processing or component manufacturing. The Treasury Department ultimately reversed this position and included the value of input materials in the deductible, significantly expanding the projected value of the credit. The credit also applies to domestic mining if the miner converts the mined material into a qualifying product, which rewards the type of vertical integration that has contributed to China’s dominance of critical material supply chains. Given that the costs of input raw materials represent the vast majority of overall costs in critical material processing, and that these inputs have been subjected to significant price volatility in the recent past, capturing them in the final rule vastly improves the incentive’s attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 45X revision - which should now more effectively capture the cost structure of critical material processing and extraction - increases the prospects for domestic greenfield processing and refining capacity for minerals such as copper, lithium, nickel, platinum group metals, and rare earth elements where there is existing domestic production or where project pipelines suggest near-term prospects for initiating or scaling production. Even with new reserve estimates indicating extensive lithium deposits in the United States, domestic demand for critical materials will substantially outpace production in all mineral categories in the near term. That supply–demand imbalance will thus limit the competitiveness benefits that 45X can provide via vertical integration and the efficiency gains of colocation of mining and processing operations. Though the IRA will likely undergo some modicum of reform under a Republican-led Congress and White House, 45x’s technology agnostic design and, with its implementing guidance evolution, prospect for enhancing domestic mining, should be a candidate for preservation in alignment with Trump administration objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively prosecute a strategy on critical material supply chain diversification and resiliency, therefore, the United States will require complementary international initiatives targeting energy transition minerals and materials as well as deepening ties with governments that oversee their development. But such initiatives should be crafted carefully, as the risk of overemphasising domestic processing compared to general diversification of supply chains could prove counterproductive if it stimulates excessive protectionism in foreign mineral-rich jurisdictions. There are already indications that this sentiment is hardening: Indonesia’s explosive nickel production and smelting growth in the wake of its institution of a raw material export ban is leading other governments in developing countries with substantial resources to consider similarly draconian policy measures. Numerous African governments have referenced Indonesia as a potential model worthy of examination or have quickly followed suit with their own export bans. Zimbabwe and Namibia each enacted bans on the export of raw lithium ore in the past two years, while Ghana, Gabon, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have each imposed export restrictions of varying severity and structure in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that export bans can, in certain instances, add value to the mining industry and domestic economy, but even Indonesia’s own volatile history of such bans across various commodity classes indicates a decidedly mixed track record. A more nuanced approach by the United States in the wake of the decision to expand 45X’s reach to input material costs should therefore be leveraged to drive deeper collaboration with existing and potential critical material producers across the African continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concerted approach to diversifying processing capacity and expanding raw material supply would benefit from existing international platforms that the United States has launched in the past four years, specifically the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment and the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). The former has made commendable progress in devising a collaborative approach with donor countries and development finance institutions to enhancing the enabling environment for the mining industry in central Africa through the formation of the Lobito Corridor. The Corridor’s establishment will diversify export routes for Central Africa’s copper belt and is pulling in significant private sector investments to the underlying transport logistics infrastructure to do so. The MSP’s origins trace back to the first Trump administration and should be a candidate initiative for continuation. For a region that is frequently undervalued and de-prioritized to the US’ detriment, seizing momentum in politically desensitized areas will enable a Trump administration to engender trust and confidence in its African counterparts rather than perpetuating a tired cycle of fresh approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should expand on growing goodwill to help marshal the necessary resources to improve the mapping of Africa’s critical mineral resources and create incentives for establishing processing capacity that meets the IRA’s unique battery material sourcing requirements, diversify supply chains in segments of severe concentration, and drive further clean technology innovation. A recent International Monetary Fund report found that sub-Saharan Africa possesses 30 per cent of the world’s proven critical mineral reserves but attracted only “13 per cent of announced global greenfield foreign direct investment projects in metals and minerals annually”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should focus on two specific policy initiatives to maximise the impact of 45X on energy transition critical material supply chain diversification. The first would be to partner with Morrocco to institute African sourcing incentives for critical material inputs for its burgeoning lithium-ion battery manufacturing sector. The IRA’s EV tax incentive requires that battery critical materials be either mined or processed domestically or in free trade jurisdictions for the vehicle to qualify for the credit. Morocco is the sole African nation that possesses a free trade agreement with the United States, which has precipitated a growing volume of announcements by battery original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and material producers to establish capacity in Morocco to take advantage of its trade status. Furthermore, Morocco possesses vast phosphate reserves - it was the second largest global producer in 2023 and has an estimated two-thirds of remaining global reserves - that can be utilised in lithium iron phosphate cathode chemistries in batteries. Lithium iron phosphate cathodes have steadily improved their performance characteristics and, given cost competitiveness, have rapidly gained market share from nickel-manganese-cobalt heavy cathode chemistries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focused initiative around Morocco has the added benefit of relieving the eligibility bottlenecks created by the IRA’s EV tax credit given the lack of nickel and cobalt producing and processing jurisdictions that are also free-trade-agreement partners of the United States. With substantial natural graphite reserves in eastern Africa, the United States and Morocco could also work to address severe concentration in the battery anode and underlying active material input segment of battery supply chains by partnering with producers to develop processing capacity with corporate structuring or equity arrangements that benefit the raw material producing country and its domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcements of project participants in Moroccan battery precursor material plants indicate a dedicated effort to comply with the IRA EV tax credit’s “foreign entity of concern” sourcing restrictions. Joint ventures between Chinese and Western battery material OEMs, such as LG Chem and Huayou Group and Falcon Energy Materials and Hensen Graphite &amp;amp; Carbon Corporation in Jorf Lasfar, all appear to be geared toward potential IRA-compliant supply to the United States. This catalytic reaction to the IRA is demonstrating the efficacy of its tools in driving geographic supply chain diversification and could improve the capabilities of non-Chinese firms for corporate diversification purposes via these partnerships. As Northvolt’s recent struggles indicate, technical and operational challenges surrounding product yield have been a significant constraint in the emergence of home-grown Western competition to Chinese incumbent producers. Leveraging China’s learnings and process efficiencies through these partnerships that accord with the IRA’s sourcing requirements will be an important evolution in establishment of a more competitive landscape. Before committing to a potential repeal of the IRA’s EV tax credit, the Trump administration should consider this collateral damage and the ensuing empowering impact such a decision would have on Chinese EV and battery producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second initiative should focus on the formation of a battery materials and components innovation strategic partnership between the United States, EU, and African Union. As the referenced struggles of Northvolt indicate, a Western battery supply chain diversification strategy will face steep, potentially insurmountable challenges if it focuses purely on existing battery technology. With historic investments in innovation within the battery industrial ecosystem taking place in the transatlantic community, a crowding in of African critical mineral producers to have a stake in that innovation’s potential success would help enhance the security of supply of key battery materials. Just as end-of-supply-chain automakers are taking stakes in raw material extraction, so should African financial institutions pursue equity stakes in the next generation of battery producers to diversify their countries’ offtake prospects. Such an approach would provide the MSP a more tailored and compelling value proposition for African producers that avoids the stigmas of colonialist tendencies in the continent’s extractive industries’ past. The incentive to participate in the battery industry’s innovation continuum would also address the challenge of shallow African capital markets in the critical materials sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a shared risk for the uptake of 45X for battery component and material producers and immature African mining jurisdictions is the established practice by Chinese incumbents of surging supplies of critical materials to put downward pressure on prices that drive foreign competition out of business. With billions of US taxpayer dollars at stake and the potential of African critical mineral deposits to provide transformative economic development and stability, there will need to be an effective toolkit in place to mitigate this risk. The MSP’s recent directive to its development finance and export credit agencies to support critical mineral projects should include a package of tools to combat Chinese market manipulation, including low-interest or concessional bridge loans geared toward injecting liquidity to otherwise financially solvent producers requiring support during periods of artificial market stress. Syndication of such financial tools to include African and US private financial institutions could further stimulate private capital instruments to ensure the durability of the West’s response to China’s coercive use of its market power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reformed approach to the 45X implementation guidelines is a welcomed development for the prospects of critical material onshoring in the United States, but its ability to have a more global impact will require the establishment of complementary, targeted international initiatives. Given African resource-rich countries’ significant vested interest in enhancing the value of their reserves, the United States has an opportunity to shape a collaborative approach on further supply chain diversification and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-geopolitics-and-challenges-of-mining-in-australia&quot;&gt;THE GEOPOLITICS AND CHALLENGES OF MINING IN AUSTRALIA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last five years, the significance of concentrated supply chains for critical minerals has surged into the spotlight, primarily driven by geopolitical tensions rather than previously recognised risks. For decades, the world underestimated the implications of China’s growing dominance of the global critical minerals market. It did not heed Beijing’s use of economic coercion to distort market dynamics and undermine emerging competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As nations scramble to diversify their mineral sources, Australia finds itself at the epicentre of this competition, navigating the dual challenges of being a premier mineral supplier and a target of market manipulation. The unfolding landscape calls for a strategic reassessment of how Australia can leverage its resources and its investment footprint while safeguarding its interests in an increasingly complex geopolitical environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-sharpened-focus-on-critical-minerals&quot;&gt;A sharpened focus on critical minerals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “critical minerals” originated in the context of resource management and national security, particularly as governments and industries began to recognise the strategic importance of certain minerals for economic stability and technological advancement. In the US, the concept gained prominence in the 1970s during discussions about energy security and supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly in response to geopolitical events like the oil crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, as global demand for advanced technologies and renewable energy sources increased, the term was formalised in various policy discussions. Governments and organisations, including the US Geological Survey, US Department of Commerce, Japan, and the European Union, began identifying specific minerals as critical based on economic importance, supply risk, and lack of viable substitutes. This recognition has continued to evolve, especially in light of shifting geopolitical dynamics and technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past two decades, China has built dominant supply chains for several minerals that are key to decarbonising energy systems and high-technology applications, including defence equipment. This dominance resulted from Beijing’s strategic foresight and ability to align its public and private sectors, and Western liberal democracies’ faith in economic neoliberalism. Today, China’s position as a monopoly supplier for some minerals and a near-monopsony buyer for several others gives it extraordinary market power, which it has demonstrated through multichannel economic coercion to control markets and keep out new suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the largest processor of several critical minerals, including copper, lithium, and rare earth elements. In the case of the latter, it has several times withheld supply to customer nations, disrupting the manufacturing processes that use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;supply-chain-security---a-strategic-imperative&quot;&gt;Supply chain security - a strategic imperative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, the rest of the world did not pay attention to China’s growing mineral market power, but it is now seized by the realisation of how dependent both producer and consumer nations have become on Chinese-controlled supply chains for key minerals and the heightened risks that result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the dominance of Chinese control over supply chains is a clear concern, other threats emerge, such as natural disasters disrupting mineral shipments, terrorist attacks on transportation, and community unrest leading to mine closures. Furthermore, inadequate environmental, social, and governance practices within certain supply chains can pose long-term risks. Minerals supply chains encompass all activities involved in exploration, mine development, mineral production and processing, and recycling of end products. Typically crossing multiple borders, these supply chains are more resilient and secure when diverse. In contrast, concentrated chains face higher risks of disruption from single points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is both a world-leading mineral producer and one of the world’s largest investors in mining globally. This inevitably brings it into the orbit of China, Australia’s and the world’s largest minerals customer and a growing investor in minerals supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As major manufacturing nations seek to reduce supply risk by diversifying mineral supply chains away from China and some other dominant suppliers, Australia now finds itself at the centre of global investment and supply chain competition. This goes beyond simply where its mineral investment comes from and where its mineral products are sold. Mineral supply chains are now intertwined with strategic alignments and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, how Australia responds will be key to its export-driven economy, the ongoing success of its minerals companies operating around the world, and its security and that of its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;disruption-of-efforts-to-diversify-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Disruption of efforts to diversify supply chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Australia’s competitive advantages in minerals include its reliability as a supplier, it is not immune to interruptions in its mining and shipping, which consequently affect global supply. The market price of manganese, a key ingredient in steel alloys, spiked in 2024 in response to lengthy interruptions of shipments from a large mine in northern Australia due to cyclone damage to a loading jetty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite concerted action by Japan, South Korea, the US, Canada, and Australia, only one Australian-based rare earths project, the Lynas Rare Earths Mount Weld mine and processing facilities, have been established and expanded. Several other rare earths projects are struggling to be commercially sanctioned in the face of depressed market prices, likely influenced by China’s economic coercion, despite financing support from Australia and partner nations. Even though China is highly dependent on Australia for its iron ore and, latterly, lithium supplies, that has not stopped it from using economic coercion to control new rare earths production from Australia and keep out would-be new Australian market entrants. The long-established mineral sands company Iluka Resources, which is seeking to build a heavy rare earths refinery in Western Australia, has been very vocal about how China’s market manipulation of these strategically crucial products has affected project economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempts by China-linked shareholders to gain control of a proposed rare earths project, Browns Range, in northern Australia triggered orders by the Australian government in 2024 for a China-linked shareholding sell-down on the recommendation of the government’s Foreign Investment Review Board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s massive investments in low-cost but high-impact nickel mining and processing in Indonesia have created a new supply stream for battery manufacture and stainless steel. Consequently, depressed global nickel prices have forced Australian production out of the market, reducing global supply diversity and shutting down environmentally responsible mining and processing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Africa, China’s economic and geopolitical coercion has led to the sale of two Australian-operated lithium mines, in Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Chinese hands. In both cases, apparently trumped-up disputes between the mining companies and host governments led to effective expropriation of the assets, with Chinese companies then assuming control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;australias-challenge-to-balance-relationships&quot;&gt;Australia’s challenge to balance relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Australia often lies in balancing its relationships with China, its largest trading partner, and the United States, its key security ally. While China dominates trade volumes, the US plays a crucial role in Australia’s economy, particularly when considering two-way investment and the technology and knowledge exchanged. Additionally, the US is Australia’s most important strategic partner, with their collaboration deepening through initiatives like the AUKUS (Australia, UK, and US) alliance and the Quadrilateral Security Alliance (the Quad). This dynamic makes Australia’s position increasingly complex and multifaceted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mining, however, China remains not only the largest customer for Australian minerals but also an important investor in Australia through equity, joint ventures, and offtake and financing agreements. Direct investment in minerals and energy by China-resident companies between 2006 and 2023 totalled US$47 billion. While year-on-year investment flows have fallen as China diversifies its minerals and energy investments to other destinations, many Australian mines and processing plants owe their existence to the involvement of Chinese companies. Therefore, the Australian government must walk a careful line between China’s importance as a customer and investor, and Australia’s participation in developing new minerals supply chains with like-minded nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, these nations, led by the US, have implemented a flurry of agreements and strategies designed to diversify and secure their critical minerals supply chains. But it is sobering to realise that it was only in 2020 that Washington waved through the sale of the US-owned Kisanfu copper-cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to a partially state-owned Chinese company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s centrality to critical minerals supply chains is evidenced by it becoming a party to 27 bilateral and multilateral agreements and processes with like-minded nations and the European Union. Typically, these agreements entail parties’ commitments to strengthen bilateral supply chains with Australia. The Australian government and its subnational governments, which control mining in their jurisdictions, have rolled out new policies and incentives to increase domestic investment in mining and processing and lift critical minerals output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half of the agreements signed by Australia also involve parties working with developing nations to help them enter new, sustainable supply chains and garner lasting benefits. This is implicit endorsement of leadership in responsible mining by Australia and its companies around the world. However, how Australia delivers on its commitments to work with other producer nations under these agreements remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s policies on inbound China-linked investment contrast with the much more hard-line stance of the US, which, through its Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) rule, severely restricts China-linked minerals investment and imports of minerals and products made from them, such as electric vehicles. Canada has placed strong restrictions on China-linked investment in mining there, largely to protect Canadian minerals exports and manufacturers from falling foul of US import restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European nations’ investment and mineral sourcing policies take a pragmatic approach to China-influenced supply chains. Representatives of Germany, France, and the Netherlands indicated to a mining conference in Australia in October 2024 that their new national investment funds for critical minerals were relaxed about investment in projects alongside Chinese companies in well-governed nations like Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;working-with-developing-nations-to-build-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Working with developing nations to build supply chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, EU, and UK have all implemented actions to fund new projects in developing nations and work with host nations to build capacity in infrastructure and minerals governance. The sustainability of minerals supply chains is a primary objective, in addition to enhanced diversity and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea is joining them, signing agreements in June 2024 with 23 African nations to cooperate in minerals, energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure. Ensuring a stable supply of critical minerals, collaborating on minerals production technology, increased investment by Korean companies in Africa, and deriving value from mineral production are four explicit objectives. Korean and Australian minerals interests inevitably will closely interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US-auspiced Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) recently added closer international cooperation in project financing to its suite of tools to establish new, more secure, sustainable supply chains. The MSP Finance Network, involving project financing and export credit agencies from multiple countries, seeks to strengthen cooperation in information exchange and co-financing of critical minerals supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Canada, through minerals companies headquartered in the two nations, are Africa’s two largest minerals investors. Despite recent efforts of like-minded nations to build more diverse critical minerals supply chains from African nations, 2024 data from S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence show that the number of mines owned by China-based companies has increased by 21 per cent since 2019. The number of mines owned by Australian and Canadian interests has fallen by more than 8 per cent. Partly balancing that decline, the number of mines owned by UK companies increased by 11 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risks-of-policy-divergence&quot;&gt;Risks of policy divergence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing risk that market interventions by like-minded nations will diverge and even work at cross purposes. For example, the US financially supports Australian companies in developing critical minerals supply chains from mines in Australia, Africa, and Latin America, with further processing in the US. In the meantime, the Australian government currently restricts its financial support to critical minerals mining and processing operations within Australia, which in some cases must get raw materials such as graphite from mines overseas. This seemingly ignores Australia’s commitment to a global supply chain approach involving other producer nations. Australia’s policy may change due to its commitment to co-financing within the new MSP Finance Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mining and processing projects in Australia are also affected by US IRA and FEOC provisions. A large US-owned lithium hydroxide refinery in Western Australia has suspended an already-underway expansion and reduced its output in the face of depressed lithium prices and because it has fallen foul of the FEOC rules due to the source of its lithium raw material being part-owned by a China-linked company. In the meantime, it remains eligible for Australia’s 10 per cent production tax incentive for processed critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is that the production of sorely needed alternative lithium hydroxide has been curtailed. At the same time, Australia, a key critical minerals partner to the US, loses major investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;achieving-a-green-premium-to-recognise-high-standards&quot;&gt;Achieving a green premium to recognise high standards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major hurdle to building new, secure, and sustainable minerals supply chains is that the standards applied often bring higher costs than minerals produced less responsibly. Minerals markets have so far been unwilling to pay “green premiums” despite the increasing focus on sustainability. The London Metal Exchange recently reported that there was little interest from mineral buyers in paying premiums for sustainably produced minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hurdle - defining sustainability standards and implementing governance and assurance processes - is on its way to being cleared. A consortium of mineral industry bodies recently commenced consultation on the first draft of the new Consolidated Mining Standard, bringing together four voluntary mining standards into one global standard accessible to any company with a commitment to mine responsibly. While a standard for mining and processing may fall short of an end-to-end supply chain standard, it will cover the highest-risk parts of supply chains across all the dimensions of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s leadership, along with Canada’s, in global minerals investment and mining places these countries at the centre of strategic efforts by major manufacturing nations to develop more diverse, secure, and sustainable supply chains for critical minerals, and to decouple from dependency on China. How effectively like-minded nations with differentiated interests work together globally to achieve this will largely determine their success in achieving mineral security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;meeting-challenges-supporting-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Meeting challenges; supporting supply chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia faces significant challenges in developing its critical mineral supply chains amidst shifting geopolitical conditions, economic coercion, and market distortions. Balancing its need to engage with China, its largest trading partner, against its commitment to the strategic imperatives of the US requires careful navigation of complex interests. To ensure resilience, Australia must broaden its contribution to supply chains, enhance collaboration with like-minded nations, and establish robust sustainability standards that can withstand external pressures. At the same time, in the face of increased minerals competition, Australia must address its inherently high-cost environment through attention to approval timelines, land access, construction and operating costs, and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it moves forward, Australia will need both to fortify its mining and processing capabilities and to play a pivotal role in fostering international cooperation, thereby positioning itself as a leader in the responsible production and supply of critical minerals globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin America’s critical minerals are essential to the global energy transition. How the region decides to manage this wealth can be decisive: it could position itself as an active geopolitical player, or echo the extractivist-export model of the past and fail to capture economic development opportunities linked to its mineral wealth. This challenge drives the Latin American geopolitical quest for a partner, not just an offtaker. Understanding this, and acting on it, will help the US, EU, or China to develop a comparative advantage in their competition with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;latin-americas-potential-to-support-critical-minerals-supply-chain-diversification&quot;&gt;Latin America’s potential to support critical minerals supply chain diversification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin America’s potential in critical minerals is well known, especially for copper and lithium, of which the region produces about 40 per cent and 35 per cent of world supply, respectively. However, the potential for growth is much larger than its current production. The region produces an amount equivalent to its share of global reserves only for copper, tin, and zinc. For nickel, graphite, lithium, and rare earths, it produces much less than its share of global reserves. That means there are attractive deposits with high ore grades that are still untouched. Brazil, for example, holds 20 per cent of commercially viable rare earths reserves, but only produces 0.02 per cent. Similarly, it holds 12 per cent of global nickel reserves, but only produces about 2.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That growth potential comes with a set of challenges and opportunities. One of the challenges is strong competition from sub-Saharan African countries. In this region, countries’ share of global production is often larger than their share of global reserves, but social, environmental, and governance regulations are often less strict. This has at times given the region an edge in terms of investment in extractives, despite its greater political and regulatory risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global markets, however, are changing, and are increasingly requiring better mining standards. This is very much in line with local dynamics in mining regions in Latin America, where conflicts with local communities over mining standards are ever more pronounced. Several experts believe that market bifurcation between China and the West will be accelerated by relying on the identification and marketisation of higher standards. This is definitely where Latin America, while not perfect, has a comparative advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The region’s electricity grid is already very low carbon, with a 60 per cent share of renewables and abundant additional low-carbon resources. This will help with decarbonising mining operations, which is a key strategic goal of mining majors. Environmental regulations are also becoming stricter, given waste-related tragedies in the past and water conflict in the present. This incentivises the development of more environmentally friendly mining and waste management practices. Significant unexplored reserves are also welcoming exploration and pre-feasibility studies, which can help uncover new high-grade ore deposits that can be developed with higher environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the bigger challenges for Latin American countries has been their long permitting times, complex fiscal environments, and regulatory and political instability. That said, several countries are actively updating their regulatory frameworks to capture more investment in responsible mining practices. In particular, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru score relatively well on indicators such as mining sector confidence, specialised labour, infrastructure risk, and expropriation risk. This matters a great deal for the industry given the risky, capital-intensive nature of new greenfield projects coupled with a fairly depressed critical minerals market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the region is a well-established diversified exporter. Historically it has close trade connections with the West. This includes the EU–Mercosur agreements, as well as bilateral trade agreements between the EU and Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico, and framework agreements with Argentina and Brazil. The US has the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and trade agreements with Chile, Peru, and Colombia. That said, the region is tilting ever more towards China, especially for critical minerals, given China’s role as the world’s minerals processing hub. Chile signed the region’s first free trade agreement (FTA) with China in 2005; Peru followed in 2009 and Costa Rica in 2010. China is now actively pursuing trade deals in the region. In 2023 alone, the country signed five major deals including an FTA with Ecuador, 15 trade-related agreements with Brazil, and key agreements with Argentina and Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative importance of trading partners for critical minerals is clearly seen in trade data. In 2022, Chile exported US$25 billion of copper to China, but only US$3 billion to the US. Similarly, Peru exported US$12 billion of copper to China but less than US$1 billion to the US. Of course, China is a copper guzzler, given its stage in economic development. But the situation is very similar for lithium, with Chile exporting US$6 billion to China, and US$0.2 billion to the US. A lot of these exports were raw materials, which shows that for the US to benefit from Latin America’s potential for diversification, there will need to be a solution (read: investment) in ex-China processing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;great-power-competition-and-latin-americas-quest-for-a-partner-not-an-offtaker&quot;&gt;Great-power competition and Latin America’s quest for a partner, not an offtaker&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The establishment of partnerships can enable the region to capture value from investments to support the development of local industry, job creation, and technological advancement. Such investments can also address infrastructure issues and mitigate operational risks which currently delay industrial development in the region, thus positioning Latin America as a more attractive partner as global competition for critical minerals intensifies between the US, the EU, and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US–China rivalry has become a crucial context for Latin America’s engagement with these two powers. The region holds strategic influence for key strategic sectors such as batteries and automobiles in the world’s two biggest economies. While China’s deepening presence in the region is viewed as an opportunity for local economies, the US is also trying to leverage policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act to encourage US supply chain partners to diversify and reduce dependence on Beijing. The competition between these two powers presents Latin American countries with the opportunity to negotiate stronger, more balanced partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign investors have taken note of Latin America’s potential. In 2023, the region raised over $19 billion amongst 19 megaprojects across different sectors, 17 of which are funded by foreign partners. Commodities and critical minerals represented 23 per cent of the region’s greenfield project investments in the last two years, twice as much as in other developing regions. Currently, China is the largest buyer of these minerals in the region. Its firms have been beating offtake options from American and Russian companies across the region. For example, Chinese firms have most recently won a bid to develop two lithium projects in Bolivia, bought lithium rights in Argentina, and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into renewable energy projects in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese influence has expanded beyond mining and into EV manufacturing and refining. These projects serve not only to increase Chinese influence over supply chains, but also to tap into other markets, locally and regionally. This is also an active strategy to prove its intention to strengthen its economic ties with the region. Its investments usually have less stringent economic and political conditions than those of Western lenders, making them more attractive for some Latin American countries. However, they also often involve looser environmental standards and higher debt burdens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognisant of growing Chinese influence, the EU and the US have been moving to gain influence in the region. For instance, both the US and EU are forming partnerships with Latin American countries to ensure the security of supply chains, while also encouraging sustainable extraction and local processing. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently travelled to Argentina and Chile in search of lithium deals, and President Biden’s Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity promises multi-sector cooperation with the western hemisphere and the region in the realm of critical minerals. Still, it seems the US has not yet fully woken up to the Latin American potential for de-risking its critical mineral industry. US investments, compared to China’s, are fairly small, and institutionally a lot can be improved. For example, the Mineral Security Partnership, an alliance led by the US and the EU to secure and diversify supply chains away from China, has 15 partner countries, none of which are in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This absence underscores a broader challenge: while the US Free Trade Agreements with Chile, Colombia, and Peru offer a pathway for these countries to access benefits under the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax incentives for green energy supply chains, a significant share of Latin America’s minerals still flows to China for processing. For instance, China consumed over 65 per cent of Chilean mineral exports in 2021, valued at $22.5 billion (roughly 6 per cent of Chilean GDP). Leveraging these FTAs more effectively could help the US pivot to support processing not only in the US but also in Latin America, so that the potential to diversify from China and support Latin America’s offtaker diversification is maximised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s strategy, on the other hand, has shifted from large infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road Initiative to a focus on foreign direct investment in Latin America’s critical mineral and EV sectors. It is now focused more on securing long-term supply contracts and investing in the entire value chain of critical minerals, from extraction to refining, and usually does so through the full acquisition of local mines, partnering with local governments, or purchasing significant shares of Western mining companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, China is increasingly aware that to further gain access to Latin America’s array of critical minerals, it might need to further support the development of local supply chains and create value added in the region. It seems Chinese companies are willing to do this. In 2024, for example, BYD announced plans to comprehensively integrate its supply chain in Brazil, signalling increasing Chinese awareness that securing long-term partnerships may require investment in local industries beyond just mineral extraction. BYD is just one of three Chinese automotive companies with plans to make EVs in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this approach can help some countries diversify their economies, it may also result in further concentration of critical resources under Chinese-controlled firms. This indicates the need for Latin American governments to carefully balance their development goals and Chinese foreign direct investment with maintaining productive relationships with other potential partners, such as the US and the EU. Importers may need to diversify sources, but exporters equally need to diversify offtakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great power competition ultimately serves Latin America: if it has multiple bidding options, it might just be able to get better pricing and outcomes. This causes some Latin American countries to welcome the geopolitical stress and regard it as an opportunity to raise investment for their respective clean energy industries. This is true as long as they can remain nonaligned and not get dragged too much into the deteriorating relations between the US and China. To further attract investments, most countries in the region may consider policies that match their economic targets with those of their desired investors, such as technology sharing through joint ventures and targeted seed funding to universities and companies to move up the value chain in key industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;social-and-environmental-demands&quot;&gt;Social and environmental demands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the opportunities are large from an economic standpoint, there is a threat of social discontent around increased mining. While Latin America’s mining sector is integral to the global supply chain of critical minerals, it also faces a long history of environmental degradation and social conflict. The 2019 Brumadinho disaster in Brazil, where the collapse of a dam killed 270 people and caused widespread environmental damage, is a stark reminder of the risks associated with irresponsible mining practices. Similarly, 73 per cent of planned and existing critical mineral mines in Latin America are located on or near indigenous or small-farmer land, which has led to rising tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As global demand for critical minerals such as lithium and copper grows, Latin American countries are increasingly seeking responsible investors and miners that adhere to higher environmental, social, and governance criteria. Whether or not Latin American mining partners, Chinese or otherwise, can deliver on more responsible mining will matter a great deal to their ability to benefit from the region’s mineral wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major mining companies like BHP and Rio Tinto have already begun incorporating sustainable practices into their operations, and 21 of the 30 largest metals and mining companies by market capitalization have pledged to reduce emissions. Emerging players, such as Sigma Lithium in Brazil, are pioneering zero-waste, low-emission mining techniques, indicating that responsible mining can both be profitable and have a lower environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pressure for sustainability is coming not only from local communities and governments, but also from the international market. Socially inclined investors and funds have been seeking lower-emission operations in industry and mining and they are willing to pay a premium for it, creating an opportunity for Latin America to attract investment from corporations seeking to meet global sustainability standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onus is not only on Latin American partners, but also on its governments. To attract more responsible investors, further regulatory and permitting reforms are undoubtedly necessary. Governments must ensure that investment in the region benefits local communities, protects the environment, and helps transition the region into a hub for value-added processing, including the development of recycling industries for batteries and other technologies. Latin America’s importance in the global energy transition will hinge on the region’s ability to attract responsible and sustainable investments, ensuring that mineral extraction is not only profitable but also environmentally sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-vulnerabilities-and-risks-of-chinas-role-in-wind-power-a-report-from-sweden&quot;&gt;ASSESSING THE VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS OF CHINA’S ROLE IN WIND POWER: A REPORT FROM SWEDEN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;henrik-wachtmeister&quot;&gt;Henrik Wachtmeister&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s role in green technology is attracting growing attention in Europe, driven in large part by concerns ranging from unequal competition to potential security risks. Several policy initiatives to address such issues have already been implemented at both EU and national levels, with more likely on the way. So far, discussions and actions have primarily focused on China’s dominant role in solar power, batteries, and electric vehicles, but attention is now also shifting to wind power, where China’s role is steadily increasing. With a strong domestic wind industry, European policymakers are worried that it might suffer the same fate as its solar industry, where China now almost completely dominates production throughout the value chain. Chinese ownership of large wind farms in Europe has also raised public concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article summarises and expands on the findings of a recent report examining these issues. The report is a case study of the vulnerabilities and risks associated with China’s role in the Swedish wind energy sector. The study covers both Chinese ownership of wind farms and the use of Chinese-made turbines, as well as the reliance of non-Chinese-made turbines on Chinese supply chains, and an assessment of associated risks. It argues that in Sweden, the risks of Chinese ownership of wind farms, which has attracted considerable attention, are likely overblown. Instead, dependence on Chinese supply chains is the most significant short- and long-term vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before discussing results for the case of Sweden in greater depth, this article briefly discusses the framework used for the assessment, in an attempt to make it more useful for application for other cases, and to draw broader policy implications relevant for decision-makers across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-framework-for-risk-assessment&quot;&gt;A framework for risk assessment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report uses a simple risk assessment framework where a distinction is made between threat, vulnerability, and risk, where risk is further operationalised as specific risk, consequence, likelihood, and risk level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A threat is defined as an entity that can exploit a vulnerability, and a vulnerability is defined as a circumstance or weakness that can be exploited. A vulnerability can be exploited in various ways that pose different kinds of specific risk. To assess the magnitude of each specific risk - or the risk level - the framework relies on the definition risk = consequence × likelihood, where consequence is the (negative) impact of the risk materialising and likelihood is the probability of the risk materialising. The final assessed risk level is thus dependent on these two underlying components and can be illustrated in a risk matrix. We use a simple three-step scale of Low, Medium, and High to rate consequence and likelihood and the resulting risk level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Swedish case the threat under consideration is the Chinese state, either directly as an actor with antagonistic intent against Sweden or the EU, or indirectly because of, for example, potential logistical bottlenecks, a potential trade war between the US and China, or an actual war over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two vulnerabilities assessed are Chinese ownership of wind farms and dependence on Chinese wind energy supply chains. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in different ways and pose several types of specific risks. For Chinese ownership, assessed specific risks include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;electricity supply cuts and market manipulation - the use of ownership of electricity generation to reduce or withhold supply to increase electricity prices in the target market, or to attempt to cause system instability or a blackout;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;information transfer - potentially damaging transfers of commercial, technological, and security-related information and know-how through both legal and illegal means;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;indirect influence - various types of adaptations by economic and political decision-makers due to relationships with China, such as self-censorship or concessions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dependence on Chinese supply chains, assessed specific risks include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;export restrictions - limitations or even complete stops of exports of materials, components, or final products from China or from Chinese companies;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IT sabotage - antagonistic cyber-attacks, which for wind power include malicious code or hacking that can shut down production or even cause physical damage, for example by altering steering mechanisms;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;indirect influence - similar to that described above for ownership, but with a different source of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-and-future-risks&quot;&gt;Current and future risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likelihood and consequence of a risk materialising depends on several factors. First is the extent of the vulnerability. In the case of ownership, this refers to the share of Chinese ownership, and in the case of supply chains, the level of dependence on Chinese supply chains. A low ownership share or supply chain dependence yields lower consequences, and a high share or dependence yields higher consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second factor altering the likelihood and resulting risk level is the degree of political trust and conflict between China and the analysed entity. For example, if Sweden and China were to develop a trustful relationship comparable to that between Sweden and Norway, the Chinese state would not be perceived as a threat, and subsequent risks would be assessed as low due to the low likelihood of their materialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third factor, altering the likelihood, is the cost to the threat itself if a specific risk materialises - for example, the economic and reputational cost to China in the case of an export ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth factor, altering the consequence, is the mitigation or resilience capacity of the targeted entity - for example, in the case of an export ban, the availability of spare parts or substitution options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the factors above are not completely independent, and one factor can influence the others. For example, high mitigation capacity likely reduces not only the consequence of a risk materialising, but also the likelihood, since it alters the threat’s cost–benefit calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current setting and relationship with China are complicated. Officially, the EU sees China as a partner for cooperation, an economic competitor, and a systemic rival. The relationship has deteriorated in recent years and some risks have already materialised. Concerns about “unfair” competition from Chinese firms because of state subsidies and unequal market access have indeed materialised and are seen as a key driver of China’s current dominance of supply chains. There is also the longer-term risk of complete dependence on Chinese supply chains. This could open up further specific risks, such as monopolistic practices, and would increase the consequences of (for example) export restrictions significantly. Several of the current specific risks, like information transfer and the (limited) use of export restrictions, can also contribute to the long-term risk of complete market dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnitudes of the risks covered in the report were assessed through qualitative analysis and interviews with sector experts. The assessments from low to high should be seen as indicative; they contain a significant degree of uncertainty and primarily reflect the current setting. Figure 1 shows the framework as applied to the Swedish case. The grounds for the rating of some of the key risks are briefly described in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-swedish-case-ownership-and-supply-chains---survey-and-risks&quot;&gt;The Swedish case: ownership and supply chains - survey and risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section briefly summarises the quantitative survey of the report and the basis for some of the risk assessments, specifically regarding electricity supply cuts and export restrictions. For the rationale for other specific risk assessments, please refer to the full report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies (all state-owned) control 10.4 per cent of Sweden’s installed wind power capacity, which corresponds to 3.4 per cent of total electricity production in 2023 (see Table 1). The majority of these assets are owned by China General Nuclear Power Corporation. The other Chinese ultimate owners are the Silk Road Fund and the State Development and Investment Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese-made turbines contribute less than 1 per cent of the installed wind capacity, with four mostly small wind farms that came online in 2012, 2014, and 2016, using turbines from Dongfang and Sinovel. According to interviewed experts as well as public reports, these turbines have had some reliability problems in the relatively harsh Swedish climate. This, in contrast to security or other concerns, is likely the reason for the limited use of Chinese turbines. Although no new projects with Chinese turbines are currently under development, newer models have likely improved and are now being offered to European developers at significantly lower prices than those of Western manufacturers. This makes it more likely that the use of Chinese turbines will increase going forward, absent any policy interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dependence of non-Chinese turbine manufacturers on Chinese supply chains is found to be high, even if is difficult to estimate the precise level from open sources. Globally, China provides 70–80 per cent of many key components, with 80 per cent of the production capacity for gearboxes, 73 per cent for generators, 82 per cent for converters, and 82 per cent for castings. Furthermore, China undertakes around 70 per cent of mining and nearly 100 per cent of the refining of key rare earth elements such as neodymium, used in permanent magnets. According to the Global Wind Energy Council, China generated 64 per cent of the total value across global wind supply chains, from mining to installation, in 2023. However, China is also expected to install 58 per cent of all new turbines. Most of its capacity is thus serving the domestic market (the world’s largest) even as it is a net exporter across the value chain. Europe has a strong wind industry, and is self-sufficient in some areas, but is a net importer over the whole value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pU12CVU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Chinese ownership of Swedish wind farms (names of Chinese-owned companies in bold).&lt;/strong&gt; Sources: Svensk Vindenergi, Energimyndigheten, FOI and other sources listed in Wachtmeister (2024).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sweden, even though Chinese ownership of wind farms has attracted considerable attention, the associated risks are likely overblown. This is because the risk of ownership being used for antagonistic supply cuts of electricity under current circumstances is considered low. Since wind power occasionally produces nothing, the system is designed to handle this from a stability perspective. Naturally, reduced production leads to higher prices, all else being equal, but with Chinese entities owning about 10 per cent of the wind capacity, the price effect would be limited. Large production reductions would also be limited to windy days, when other wind production is high and prices often low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all surveyed Chinese producers are bound by Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). If they do not deliver electricity according to the agreements, incurred debts could lead to bankruptcy and redistribution of assets. The largest Chinese investment in Sweden, China General Nuclear Power Corporation’s Markbygden Ett AB, is currently facing economic difficulties with legal proceedings and restructuring following its losses and inability to meet agreed production levels to its PPA counterpart Norsk Hydro. Finally, should stability problems or serious shortages still arise, Svenska Kraftnät, the Swedish TSO (transmission system operator), has the authority to mandate production. In summary, Chinese interests would have much to lose from such actions in terms of reputational and economic costs, while the effect would be limited. The risk is therefor considered low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are still reasons to consider how much foreign-owned wind power from certain countries Sweden should allow. Additional investment without PPAs removes much of the direct economic costs of withholding supply. Furthermore, if a large enough share were taken offline simultaneously and without warning, it could cause system instability. Naturally, a larger share would also induce a greater price effect. More detailed studies on these risks, ideally conducted together with the TSO, are warranted. A law on the screening of foreign direct investments came into force in December 2023. No Chinese wind acquisitions or new investments have been made since then, and a future potential review will be interesting to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than Chinese ownership, dependence on Chinese supply chains is the most significant short- and long-term vulnerability. Chinese dominance throughout the supply chain could be used to limit the availability of spare parts to existing turbines or components for new turbines and could be employed across a continuum, ranging from subtly skewing competition to complete export bans of components or final products targeted at individual countries or Europe as a whole. The specific risk of export restrictions is therefore rated as high, as a combination of high consequence and medium-to-high likelihood, strongly dependent on future political and economic relations and conflict levels. Export restrictions and supply chain dependence are closely associated with the possibility of the European wind industry being outcompeted on unequal terms. This risks the loss of qualified jobs and industry, and in the long run could put Europe, and Sweden, in a technology dependence that could be used for political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;risk-management-and-policy-trilemma&quot;&gt;Risk management and policy trilemma&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework provides some general measures and developments that could reduce risk levels. First, as already discussed, improved relations with the threat country could reduce the likelihood of many risks materialising, as could increased interdependence or deterrence through other means which raise the costs for the threat. However, according to current trajectories, a further deterioration of relations seems more likely than an improvement. What European countries can control, however, is the extent of their vulnerabilities and their capacity to reduce consequences through other means, although this comes with difficult policy trade-offs and associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting a threshold on ownership from “foreign entities of concern” or banning such investments altogether can reduce risks connected to this vulnerability. Likewise, reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains reduces the risks connected to these. Policies to reduce dependence could range from measures aimed at levelling the playing field to more aggressive trade protectionism and industry-supporting policies. Alternatively, or in addition, countries could attempt to minimise the potential negative impact of risk materialisations. In the case of ownership, this can include clear legal rights for TSOs to intervene in the case of antagonist supply cuts and increase information and IT security. Reducing the impact of export restrictions could involve inventories of spare parts, preparedness to scale up alternative supply chains, or energy technology diversification and substitution options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is important to assess the wind power sector risks in relation to overall risks related to China, across all sectors. High dependence, or even complete Chinese dominance, in wind power could perhaps be manageable. However, if wind is only one of several sectors dominated by China, the risks compounds. Particularly if China dominates all green technologies, the risk to Europe’s overall energy transition and energy security increases, likely exponentially rather than linearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies and measures to counter risks inevitably come with costs. The classic energy policy problem is often summarised as the trilemma of affordability, environmental sustainability, and security. There are usually trade-offs between these desirable dimensions. Relying on cheap, large-scale Chinese production can increase both the affordability and speed of the climate transition, but at the cost of security. European policies to support a more secure domestic wind industry are likely to come with a higher economic cost, and perhaps with a slower transition. However, many of the perceived trade-offs are in fact, to a high degree, variable distributions of costs and benefits over time. In many cases, short-term benefits are exchanged for long-term costs. With a long-term perspective, the trilemma could perhaps more easily be squared. A secure, more environmentally sustainable domestic industry could indeed be competitive in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the complicated logistics required to transport large wind power parts provide a physical competitive advantage for local manufacturers of these parts. Additionally, costly subsidies will be more difficult for China to uphold over the long term. Furthermore, while reliance on Chinese technology could be cost-effective and environmentally beneficial in the short term, it could expose Europe to monopolistic practices in the long term and to dependence on production processes with a dirtier environmental and social footprint, with impacts that accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the current and potential future risks in mind, and with a long-term view on associated policy trade-offs, measures to ensure fair competition and the survival of the domestic European wind industry could likely be justified. This does not require ceasing trade with China altogether and forgoing the benefits of Chinese companies’ technical progress and lower-cost technology. It is likely possible to find a suitable balance for targets and measures to support the domestic wind industry while still allowing and benefiting from Chinese manufacturing and development ability. Further specific discussion on the right balance, including the role of Chinese manufacturing located within Europe, is encouraged going forward. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is one policy soon to be implemented. Recent industry estimates project significantly increased costs for turbines made in Europe. Concerns also include the mechanism leading to lower imports of raw materials covered in the initial phase and instead increased imports of uncovered processed products in order to circumvent the tax. Consequently, it is necessary to look at the full picture of different industrial policies and their interactions, and to be nimble in addressing distortions and unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the new UK government reviews its relationship with China and related security concerns, it has inherited questions about China’s dominance of the solar supply chain from the previous government. Solar supply chain security has prompted a policy response from many of the UK’s allies, in particular the United States, but with many of those countries likely to depend much more heavily on solar power than the UK, the extent to which the UK should share this concern has been debated by policymakers in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unquestionable that the global supply of solar PV equipment is dependent on Chinese industry. In 2023, China’s exports of solar PV cells, whether assembled into panels or not, was worth $44 billion according to Comtrade, or 71 per cent of all global solar cell exports. That is more than the UK’s exports of all passenger vehicles ($37 billion) and significantly more than China’s exports of electric vehicles ($34 billion). Chinese exports of solar cells have increased dramatically since 2020 (Figure 1), and solar cells alone accounted for 1 per cent of the value of all China’s exports. But what are the risks associated with dependence on China?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-solar-in-the-uks-energy-transition&quot;&gt;The role of solar in the UK’s energy transition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022 and 2023, China became a near monopoly supplier of solar cells, panels, and modules to the UK, accounting for 84 per cent and 93 per cent of UK imports respectively in a sector where the UK is entirely dependent on imports. Figure 2 shows that while China suddenly became the dominant exporter to the UK in 2022, this has coincided with a period of middling investment in solar in the UK, compared to the 2011–2015 peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MfN6238.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK is not buying massive quantities of solar PV equipment - solar PV imports in 2023 came to just under $1 billion - risks to UK energy security are mostly premised on reliance on the technology in the UK in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in none of the UK National Energy System Operator’s (NESO’s) 2024 Future Energy Scenarios does solar PV account for more than 15 per cent of UK electricity generation at any point up to 2050. Solar PV is likely to be one of the easier generation technologies to substitute in the UK: wind will account for the bulk of electricity generation, while gas and storage technologies will remain central to system balancing and ancillary services. Meanwhile, solar will play a role as a non-dispatchable source of electrons for the grid and improving resilience to businesses and better-off households in small-scale applications, but it will play a secondary role in the resilience and security of the national grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, even this relatively modest role requires capacity additions of between 19 and 79 GW by 2040 compared to 2023 in the NESO scenarios, and while solar PV may not be critical for energy security, it will play an important role in decarbonisation. Indeed, in scenarios where the UK achieves its 2050 net zero target, solar PV produces 16–74 per cent more electricity in 2050 than was produced using gas-fired combined-cycle power plants in 2023, driven by overall increases in electricity demand. Should energy market volatility persist or worsen during the energy transition, solar PV, particularly in combination with batteries, is likely to be an important tool in allowing households and businesses to mitigate risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uk-energy-security&quot;&gt;UK energy security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, an interruption to the supply of solar PV equipment or major price volatility could impact the UK in two ways. It could impact UK energy security and efforts to decarbonise, increasing costs and putting pressure on other supply chains. An interruption would also very directly impact the workers and businesses in the UK’s network of solar PV installers, wholesalers, and distributors, and household battery system and software integration providers. A third risk from dependence on imported panels from China is that UK demand contributes to environmental degradation, harm to communities, and negative political drivers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the extent of UK energy system technical vulnerability to disruption to solar PV supply chains in China is unclear, the large solar PV capacity required for an optimal energy system in the NESO scenarios suggests that solar price rises or prolonged supply interruptions would have a meaningful economic cost for UK consumers. But the impact on energy security is mitigated by several factors, not least the relatively small share of overall electricity generation expected from solar PV. The UK could deploy wind power, extend the life of gas power plants, or increase imports through planned new interconnectors to compensate for solar supply chain challenges. Solar PV would likely also play only a small role tackling the winter peak, even in scenarios where heating is largely electrified, which is the main energy security challenge in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been attempts to calculate the potential cost to UK electricity consumers of disruptions to solar PV imports from China. These exercises face several challenges. The China Strategic Risks Institute in 2023 attempted to model the cost to the UK of a three- and five-year ban on solar PV exports from China to the UK, finding a significant cost to electricity consumers of £1.5–4.3 billion in total, depending on the timing, duration, and extent of the ban. Whether such a ban would be enforceable in a market where wholesalers play a major role and where global inventories in 2023 rose to 150 GW is doubtful. Furthermore, these models do not typically account for the cost of mitigating the risk, which the US experience shows is significant in terms of both policy support and cost to the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While risks to operating solar plants from Chinese supply chains appear limited, cyber attacks are possible. Inverters and control devices are potentially vulnerable, which introduces an important element of supply chain risk management to solar PV projects where both the equipment and the operating software are sourced from China. This is particularly the case where the operation of the system is dependent on updates from the software provider for the lifetime of the project. Household systems which are more likely to be internet connected and where supply chain management is weaker may be particularly vulnerable. Military and security sensitive solar applications have an additional range of risks to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most direct risk to the UK may be to jobs and businesses in the domestic solar industry, which entirely depends on a supply of cost-competitive Chinese panels. As has become clear from the automotive industry, the impact of supply interruptions - or the threats thereof - to industry can be an effective political lever for China. In Europe, the solar industry employed 826,000 people at the end of 2023, suggesting that the industry is a strategic vulnerability for the UK’s closest neighbours and allies. The UK industry is much smaller, however, with only around 7,000 people employed in 2020 (less than were employed at the Port Talbot integrated steelworks until recently, and negligible compared with the 758,600 people employed in the automotive sector in 2022), although this could rise to around 60,000 by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;do-no-harm&quot;&gt;Do no harm&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimising the harm caused by solar PV and related industries and maximising societal benefits is perhaps the most immediate challenge of depending on China for the supply of panels. This is in part because of the challenge of tracing mineral supply chains which converge in Chinese processing facilities. There are also concerns within China. Significant parts of China’s solar PV industry are based in Xinjiang and there have been accusations of forced labour in the supply chain. This particularly affects the production of polysilicon, meaning that the supply of panels well beyond China is affected. Indeed, the countries most affected by US legislation banning the use of materials from Xinjiang have been countries in South East Asia, not China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The carbon intensity of Chinese industry is a challenge, with industry historically attracted to the cheap energy offered by the country’s coal regions. Producing solar-grade silicon (silicon with 99.9999999 per cent purity) is a highly energy-intensive process, and more than 75 per cent of global production takes place in China. Around 60 per cent of electricity used in the production of solar panels comes from coal. While the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in the EU may drive Chinese industry towards the country’s other low-cost energy source, hydropower, this could exacerbate climate risks to the supply chain from drought, where China is particularly globally vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has the tools to address many of these problems, and some progress has been made. The EU has already begun to leverage the scale of the single market to exert pressure on Chinese companies to improve standards. There is anecdotal evidence that this is having an impact: the fact that Chinese-owned Volvo was the first company in Europe to introduce a battery passport for consumers emphasises both the impact of EU regulation and China’s capacity to adapt quickly to it. There are more levers the UK, in concert with Europe, could pull to both pressure Chinese institutions and work with Chinese companies to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental, social, and governance challenges associated with the expansion of mining and industry in countries without robust governance frameworks is a potentially stickier challenge. The emergence of a solar PV manufacturing industry in Indonesia, alongside a massive expansion of nickel production, is a case in point. Conventional solar PV uses so-called critical minerals less intensively than other clean energy technologies, but there is likely to be pressure on silver supply chains, where by 2030 demand from solar PV industries could be equivalent to 30 per cent of 2020 global production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geopolitics&quot;&gt;Geopolitics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The small share of projected UK electricity generation and relatively small number of jobs in the industry mean that direct UK risk exposure resulting from dependence on imported Chinese solar panels is limited, at least in the absence of major cyber vulnerabilities to operational plants. But China’s overwhelming dominance of the global supply chain should remain a concern for the UK. The International Energy Agency expects that solar could become the world’s largest source of electricity by 2035, accounting for 25–35 per cent of total electricity generation, with capacity quadrupling by 2030. China will be at the heart of this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has many implications for geopolitics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global decarbonisation depends on China and Chinese companies - nobody else will be able to replicate the country’s scale and price competitiveness in this time period.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries with rapidly expanding electricity demand, particularly where this is driven by current supply shortages in developing countries such as in sub-Saharan Africa, will be vulnerable to disruption from China. Where Chinese supply is complemented by financing, solar could more visibly replace or augment coal and hydropower investment in the country’s already formidable array of Belt and Road Initiative tools. Indeed, the need to utilise excess capacity could push moves in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countries involved in the solar PV supply chain such as Thailand and Malaysia will become increasingly dependent on China as an investor, technology provider, and customer. Furthermore, investments in politically aligned countries by major Chinese companies can act as a reward, granting employment and economic benefits as well as improving security of supply. Some commentators have viewed recent Chinese investments in battery plants in Hungary - batteries accounted for 4.7 per cent of the country’s total exports in 2022, according to Comtrade - as, in part, a reward for political support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a straightforward replication of the power of oil and gas producers for a transition age. Solar PV is fundamentally different as infrastructure rather than fuel. But the anticipated importance of solar to global energy supply means that China is positioned as a critical supplier for the first major phase of infrastructure build-out for the energy transition. Beyond notions of dependency, this helps erode some of the basis of Western influence in the world as a supplier of critical technologies and finance and, perhaps, associated systems of regulation, standards, and ultimately wider market governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, the UK does not have a solar manufacturing industry to protect or aspirations to build one. The country is expecting to undertake a massive expansion of solar capacity, but at no point is solar PV expected to be a mainstay of electricity generation or a backstop for energy security. The potential impact of solar PV supply interruptions or price volatility on UK jobs is currently limited, although this is likely to increase over time, and there could be marginal impacts on the ability of households and businesses to weather future energy crises. The main domestic risks appear to be to the cost of electricity and to the ability of UK consumers and policymakers to mitigate the environmental and social impact of their solar demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, solar PV is the critical technology for decarbonisation globally. This has four central implications for the UK. Firstly, the UK has an interest in the supply chain being secure and cost-effective to combat climate change. Secondly, while the exposure of the UK to risks from China’s dominance of the market may be limited, that is not true for many other countries around the world which are heavily dependent on access to Chinese supply chains for their energy security. Thirdly, countries active in the solar PV supply chain could become increasingly dependent on China. Fourthly, the world’s largest energy markets in the US and Europe, as well as emerging countries such as India, have a greater incentive than the UK to invest in dealing with the issue and are already putting in place policy programmes to diversify supply chains and support domestic manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this starting point, it is fair to assume that the UK will not become a manufacturing hub for solar PV anytime soon and will continue to be almost entirely dependent on imports. China’s overwhelming share of global production and exports, combined with current overcapacity, means that “de-coupling” is not realistic if the UK is to achieve its solar objectives. Diversification of the import supply chain both geographically and in terms of corporate suppliers, then, is likely to be the optimum strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK will benefit wherever programmes to support solar manufacturing outside of China are able to help competitors produce at scale. UK government support for innovation and participation by small and medium-sized enterprises, strategies adopted to support diversification in sectors such as telecoms and healthcare, are very unlikely to impact market concentration for solar PV, where manufacturing scale and expertise are decisive. Instead, the starting point for policy should be supporting demand and price levels capable of stimulating further investment in non-Chinese suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This requires managing the impact of overcapacity in China, in particular the damaging effects of price volatility on manufacturing by non-Chinese companies. The cycle of over-capacity and market flooding, whether intentional or otherwise, typical of many Chinese industries responding to the complex interplay of national and local government policies and domestic and global markets, has played a major role in undermining production elsewhere. The steel industry is one obvious example. Addressing market volatility, dumping, and anti-competitive practices may therefore be foundational in supporting demand for more marginal emerging producers and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This starting point could be supplemented by policies which help “level the playing field” in terms of trading practices and standards, and regulations which incentivise or require diversification and more rigorous supply chain risk management. The UK has a range of existing strategies from other sectors it might draw on to support solar PV import diversification. For example, the UK Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 requires that telecom operators improve third-party risk management processes and that they are able to operate within the UK without relying on any company, equipment, or data from outside of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved data collection would help guide policies; transparency is currently notoriously bad in clean energy supply chains. The 2020 Agriculture Act granted the Secretary of State powers to collect data, albeit only relating to activities in the UK, in order to manage risks and market volatility and to improve transparency and fairness in the supply chain. Similar data collection powers for the seven key clean energy technologies, potentially alongside the equivalent of Defra’s food security review, would help the industry move towards the formalisation of data collection and supply chain monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its near complete lack of domestic solar PV manufacturing - or perhaps because of it, not needing to protect UK businesses - and because of the more limited role solar is expected to play in UK energy security compared to that of other countries, the UK should be less vulnerable to any disruption that might result from the concentration of solar PV industries in China. The country can take advantage of some of the cost and scale benefits from China, but should also play its part to support diversification. The UK’s main tool to do this is its domestic market and the way it addresses volatility from China’s cycles of over-capacity, supply chain data and transparency, responsible sourcing standards, and regulation of third-party and supply-chain risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（10日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第106日審訊，黎智英第14日作供。辯方圍繞《國安法》生效之後黎的意圖提問，集中在2020年7月7日至11日。訊息紀錄顯示，前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚開設群組，成員包括黎、李柱銘和 Mark Simon，郭明瀚一度提出組織一個以國際為本的示威運動，政府連同群眾，向香港政府施壓及約束中國使用《國安法》。李柱銘隨即提出：「這個群組在任何情況下，必定不能夠做任何在《國安法》下構成罪行的事情。」其後李退出群組。黎供稱，李曾建議他也退出群組，但是因為留意到相關話題不會再討論，「可能我不像李柱銘那麼謹慎」，加上不想無禮對待郭明瀚，因此未有跟隨李退出。至於留在群組的目的，黎稱純粹因為看重郭明瀚的意見，而該群組是為了討論香港現況，尋求解決問題的辦法，「只是集思廣益。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德傳送twitter帖文連結提及制裁林鄭-黎堅稱沒看過帖文&quot;&gt;裴倫德傳送Twitter帖文連結提及制裁林鄭 黎堅稱沒看過帖文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月7日，「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」創辦人兼執行總監裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）向黎傳送其 Twitter 帖文連結，並說：「Organised for this to happen today. Actually not impossible now. Hope you’re OK, Jimmy」。辯方指，該 Twitter 帖文指：「BREAKING @MPIainDS calls for Carrie Lam to be sanctioned under the UK’s new Magnitsky sanctions regime. @DominicRaab doesn’t rule it out.」黎回覆：「Yes, I’m ok for now. Thanks, Jimmy」、「Yes, not impossible now. Cheers, Jimmy」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱，他從未按入連結閱讀裴倫德的帖文。他認為裴倫德純粹問他在《國安法》之下是否安好；至於自己回覆「Yes, I’m ok for now.」和「Yes, not impossible now.」，意思是沒有可能不繼續自己的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，裴倫德的帖文提到英國議員呼籲制裁前特首林鄭，問黎訊息中的「not impossible now」有否可能是指帖文內容。黎則稱自己沒有按入連結閱讀帖文，沒有任何理由是指帖文內容。法官李運騰又問，黎是否知道裴倫德訊息「Organised for this to happen today.」是什麼意思。黎重申自己沒有按入 Twitter 帖文的連結，所以不知道。法官李素蘭指，從 Twitter 帖文可見，裴倫德會否意指「林鄭被制裁不是沒可能」？黎堅稱沒有看過帖文，所以不會明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指裴倫德為香港做好事-不能封鎖對方&quot;&gt;黎指裴倫德為香港做好事 不能封鎖對方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎重申，裴倫德經常傳送網站連結給他，希望《蘋果》能夠刊登，除此之外，訊息紀錄中不會找到他們談論其他事項。而「Hope you’re OK, Jimmy」是對方唯一傳送過給他的私人訊息。辯方追問，裴倫德曾經向黎傳送「Hope you are OK. Thinking of you.」，黎則稱不明白對方是什麼意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎聲稱從未聽聞 IPAC，可是訊息紀錄卻顯示，裴倫德曾向黎說：「Thanks for twitting about IPAC」，而黎回覆：「You’re welcome.」黎則解釋，發布 Twitter 帖文的不是自己，而是李兆富負責，又稱：「我從沒認真對待他的 WhatsApp」，所以回覆對方，使對方不要再煩擾他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭則追問，為何黎未有直接封鎖（block）裴倫德？黎則稱，因為裴倫德為了香港做好事，他不能夠封鎖對方，惟同時形容對方是一個「滋擾」，經常叫黎刊登他的文章。李素蘭聞言問：「你是說他（裴倫德）為香港做好事？」黎說是，又指裴倫德經常為香港說好說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，黎何不安排裴倫德直接與李兆富聯絡？黎則指不可以，因為李兆富只是負責 Twitter，然而裴倫德傳送文章是因為想《蘋果》刊登。黎提到，時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏起初曾經直接與裴倫德聯絡，但是裴倫德之所以經常向黎傳送文章，是因為如果文章透過黎傳送給員工，裴倫德的文章會有較大機會獲刊登。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何要開設 Live Chat 節目。黎稱純粹想讓人們知道香港發生了什麼事，他又指對象並非香港人，而是海外的人，所以使用英語進行節目。黎指，希望節目使外國人繼續留意香港，使香港不會消失於他們的視線範圍和腦海中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有沒有意圖利用節目作為平台，來提倡向中國實施制裁、封鎖和敵對行動。黎指，在節目對話之中從沒使用相關字眼。辯方重申問題是他有否意圖。黎笑說：「我沒有意圖去用它作為平台去犯罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指國安法取代本地法律-法官指出基本法非本地法&quot;&gt;黎指國安法取代本地法律 法官指出《基本法》非本地法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年7月9日進行網上直播節目，由職員 Lucia 發問，而黎回答問題。辯方並向黎出示相關謄本，黎被問到《國安法》於香港而言是什麼，黎回答《國安法》必然代表是香港的「喪鐘」，因《國安法》凌駕（supersedes）了《基本法》，使香港沒有自由和法治；若然沒有法治，在港做生意的人便會很危險。黎續稱，商人唯一得到保護的方法便是依靠有權力的官員，意味香港將會好像中國內地般出現貪污問題，「因為有權力保護你的官員不會免費地替你這樣做，他們需要保護費，而保護費是貪污。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何說「《國安法》凌駕了《基本法》」，黎強調這是事實，因大律師公會聲明有提及。法官李運騰一度指出，《基本法》並非本地法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，他的想法是否來自《國安法》有條文規定，若果《國安法》與本地法有任何牴觸的部份，則《國安法》凌駕。黎指這正是凌駕。惟辯方向黎澄清，《基本法》並非區域法律，而是全國性法律。黎則表示不知道。辯方則表示理解，因黎未曾接受法律訓練。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目稱商人做生意要向官員交保護費-法官質疑屬臆測&quot;&gt;黎節目稱商人做生意要向官員交「保護費」 法官質疑屬臆測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，黎在訪談中稱「有權力保護你的官員不會免費地替你這樣做，他們需要保護費」，問黎從哪裡得到這說法，質疑是黎的臆測（conjecture）。黎指如果香港失去法治，便會與中國一樣，出現貪污情況，即是官員需要收取「保護費」才會保護商人，強調以上不是臆測而是中國的現實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官質疑，所以這不是建基於事實的說法，而是將黎在中國內地見到的情況套用到香港。黎則強調這是從事實推論而來（deduction from facts）。杜官則反駁，這不是事實而純粹是推論。二人在庭上爭論時多次疊聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎說這番話的時候，可曾預見相關言論會引起憎恨？黎說沒有，強調自己當時在說出事實，並無意引起憎恨。辯方問黎，有否期望讀者或聽者看到相關言論之後，會憎恨政府？黎不認為會引起憎恨，相信別人看到他的言論會更加小心，但不代表他們會憎恨政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有沒有意讓官員聆聽節目？惟法官質疑節目在全世界廣播，辯方的問題與案情無關。辯方引用《刑事罪行條例》第9(2)條，指黎的言論意在指出政府的錯處和不足，構成開脫辯解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前領事郭明瀚開設群組討論如何施壓-李柱銘明言不能犯國安法後退組&quot;&gt;前領事郭明瀚開設群組討論如何施壓 李柱銘明言不能犯國安法後退組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）開設一個 WhatsApp 群組，其後把黎智英、其私人助手 Mark Simon 和民主黨創黨主席李柱銘加入群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭明瀚於2020年7月初表示，當他思考「你們的下一步」時，讀到美國國父 Benjamin Franklin 的文章〈The Morals of Chess〉，並表示知道香港經歷「艱難的時候」。李柱銘表示：「只要我仍在這裡奮鬥，這裡就有希望！當我放棄的時候，我便輸了。（“So long as I’m still there fighting, there’s hope! The moment I give up, I lose.”）」黎則回覆：「這是艱難的時候，對，但是這是我們最需要成為支柱的時候，我們要找到前行的方法。（“Hard time, yes, but this is the time we’re needed most to be the backbone of our cause. We must find ways to go on.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭明瀚於7月9日表示：「對，讓我們找其他方法前行，怎樣約束中國使用法律，似乎還有林鄭及其同黨。（“Yes, let’s work on other ways to go on. How to Limit PRC, and it looks like Lam and company as well, use of the law.”）」黎附和：「對的，你看法是如何？（“That’s right. What’s your view? Cheers, Jimmy”）」郭明瀚回覆：「很好的問題，我正在思考。似乎需要找到方法去創造一個以國際為本的示威運動，政府加上群眾，去限制香港政府及保安工具。群眾向中國看重的資產例如匯豐施壓，連同多國政府合作施壓。以往美國可以組織這些，但是現在不行。（“Good question. I’m thinking about it. Somehow a way needs to be found to create an internationally based protest movement, government and popular, to constrain the HK Govt and the security apparatus. Popular pressure on say HSBC, assets that China values coupled with coordinated pressure from govts. In the past US could organize that. Not now.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎回覆：「這個外國運動危險之處在於，勾結外國勢力在《國安法》之下是嚴重的罪行，我們不能在這裡連繫上相關罪行，不論如何也要與我們獨立分開。（“The danger of this outside movement is collusion with foreign influence a serious crime under national security law. We can’t be connected with it here. Whatever it’s has to be independent with us.”）」李柱銘同意：「絕對是！（“Absolutely!”）」郭明瀚回覆：「對，那便會很困難，一個實在的問題。（“Yes. That will be difficult, a real problem.”）」李解釋：「直至這法律廢除為止，它仍然有效力，而所有香港人都受它約束，所以我們必定不能夠做任何墮入法網的事情。就這樣。而且這也適用於任何 WhatsApp 或其他群組。（“This Law is effective until set aside, and all the people of Hong Kong are subject to it. So we must not do anything that is caught by it. Period. And this applies to any WhatsApp or other group that we belong to.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭明瀚則表示看不到《國安法》會被廢除。李柱銘重申：「所以這個群組在任何情況下，必定不能夠做任何在《國安法》下構成罪行的事情。（“So this very group must not, under any circumstances, do anything which constitutes an offence under this Law.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 李柱銘&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，郭明瀚不再任職駐港領事並離開香港之後，曾替美國政府工作約10至12年，而傳送上述訊息的時候，他已經退休好幾年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李柱銘其後退出群組，問黎是否知道原因。黎認為基於上述他們的對話，在國安法之下很危險，因為郭明瀚的說話亮起「紅燈」。辯方問黎當時知道這是屬於「勾結外國勢力」？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問為何黎不跟著李柱銘做法，退出群組？黎解釋，因為他留意到相關話題不會再討論，「可能我不像李柱銘那麼謹慎。」黎又表示，郭明瀚是他的好友，不能無禮地對待他，所以未有退出群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認群組屬勾結外國勢力的群組-目的僅集思廣益&quot;&gt;黎否認群組屬「勾結外國勢力的群組」 目的僅「集思廣益」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在差不多時間，黎向 Mark Simon 私下傳送訊息：「李柱銘是超級謹慎，還有他剛退出群組。我認為我們可以繼續留在群組中，沒有李，雖然李建議我退出。（“Mark, Martin is super cautious and has just exited the group. I think we can keep the WhatsApp group with Jim without him though he advise me to quit. Thanks, Jimmy”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，從訊息可見，李柱銘曾建議黎退出群組？黎確認。辯方問，黎、Mark Simon 和郭明瀚3人留在群組中的目的是什麼？黎表示，他純粹看重郭明瀚的意見，所以保留群組會有利。黎指該群組是為了討論香港現況，尋求解決問題的辦法，「只是集思廣益。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到，為何郭明瀚會選擇把黎和李柱銘加入他的群組？黎指因為郭明瀚認識自己和李柱銘，而郭明瀚只是嘗試提供意見、幫助他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，上述群組正值反修例運動期間成立。黎同意。辯方繼而問：「它是否一個勾結外國勢力的群組？」黎否認並失笑：「為什麼？我說過勾結外國勢力是非常危險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示另一個 Signal 群組「Jim/Jimmy/Mark Group」，成員只有黎、郭明瀚和 Mark Simon。Mark Simon 並將訊息消失的時間設定為1小時。黎稱不記得群組在7月9日之後討論過什麼。辯方問黎，7月9日之後，上述群組有沒有討論過制裁、封鎖或敵對行為？黎稱肯定沒有，「這是我會完全避免的話題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認曾經呼籲制裁-惟新法律之下沒有再提及&quot;&gt;黎認曾經呼籲制裁 惟新法律之下沒有再提及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李柱銘退出群組逾半小時之後，向黎發送訊息，轉發《多維》的報導，當中指：「比如香港《蘋果日報》，其發表的文章經常有『引發民眾對中央人民政府憎恨』的嫌疑，但香港律政司不敢拿《刑事罪行條例》中的叛逆罪起訴他，因為害怕香港法院會用人權法案進行審查然後推翻這一條款而形成判例，所以《蘋果日報》創辦人黎智英一直逍遙法外。現在香港國安法把《刑事罪行條例》中原樣的東西搬過來，香港律政司就沒有這樣的顧慮了。」黎回覆：「我剛看過全文，好得人驚！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎認為李柱銘為何傳送這新聞給他。黎相信李傳送給他參考，作為一種提醒他謹慎的方式。黎理解報導內容是關於香港基於人權而未曾使用《刑事罪行條例》中的叛逆罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李柱銘其後回應：「對，似乎這個新法律賦予中央政府權力去懲罰不同香港人和團體，而他們過去12個月曾經做過一些中央不喜歡的事。（“Yes. This new law appears to give effect to the Central Government intention to penalise the different individuals and groups of HK people who did certain things during the last 12 months that it does not like.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎閱讀相關訊息之後，表示明白何謂「曾經做過一些中央不喜歡的事」的人，但是不明白為何是「過去12個月」。辯方問黎，在當時起計的過去12個月，黎有否做過任何可能在《國安法》下構成罪行的事情。此時法官打斷，問辯方肯定要問這條問題嗎？辯方則解釋，他們替黎辯護的核心是，因為法律的改變，使黎的想法和面對的後果均有所不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時黎主動提出他可以回答辯方的問題，「以我所知，我的確曾經呼籲制裁，而這在新法律下可構成罪行。」辯方追問黎有否因而改變他的行為？黎表示：「當然⋯⋯我沒有再說了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有員工在群組表示擔心被竊聽-黎回覆我們不能做犯法事不用太擔心&quot;&gt;有員工在群組表示擔心被竊聽 黎回覆：我們不能做犯法事，不用太擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示軟件 Slack 的員工群組聊天紀錄，有《蘋果》員工表示，《國安法》授權警方隨意竊聽，前線同事擔心會成為被竊聽目標，所以現時開會討論題目，有些小組不會帶手機，「以防討論到一些敏感的故仔時洩漏了資訊」，所以現時只能在能力範圍內，盡量採取可行的保密措施。黎回覆該同事：「我們不能做犯法事，不用太擔心，但做好保密措施是有必要的。到時討論。」黎庭上解釋，因為他們不能做任何犯法的事情，故此叫同事不用擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月10日，羅偉光向群組傳出會議紀錄，其中一個副標題為「國安法影響」，提到轉用另一軟件 Signal；「設24小時支援熱線」，一旦同事被捕可作支援；採訪時若提到「港獨」、「光復香港」相片，但只是報道可以出，只要不涉鼓吹宣傳。辯方問黎，「飯盒會」期間有否討論過設立被捕支援熱線？黎則表示不記得，但是如果會議紀錄有提及，代表有討論過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章稱國安法使香港變成專政無形集中營-黎比喻&quot;&gt;文章稱國安法使香港變成「專政無形集中營」 黎：比喻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」於2020年7月11日發布了文章〈從荒蕪到繁榮 再墮封建懸崖〉，為控方指控的161篇煽動文章之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章開首提到「祖國終於讓我們嘗到活在具共產主義制度下的滋味。國安法攬炒式讓我們真正回歸祖國的懷抱，在我們頭上高懸利劍，做成震懾效果，我們永無寧日戰戰兢兢，就是為了要改變我們生活的行為和習慣。」辯方問黎從哪裡得悉「攬炒」的概念，「攬炒巴」劉祖廸有否向他解釋過？黎說沒有。辯方另外提到黎曾向楊清奇傳送區家麟的文章〈摧毀即貫徹 攬炒即繁榮〉，問黎是否從該文章得知「攬炒」概念。黎則指區使用「攬炒」一字的方式，與他使用「攬炒」一字的方式不同。他指自己文章中的「攬炒」意思是「破壞所有東西」，因為他認為「《國安法》破壞了所有我們自由的慣例」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎接著在文章說：「以後講電話要戰戰兢兢，不知誰在竊聽，在社交媒體與朋友溝通也要戰戰兢兢，不知誰在查閱，跟朋友說話也得戰戰兢兢，不知誰會篤灰報寸，基本法委員會副主任譚惠珠說，行差踏錯者非必然在港審，即係會在大陸審判，讓你真正嘗到祖國牢獄地獄式的恐怖，問你怕未？鄭若驊說，警方有合理懷疑就可以拉人，即是說警察不用證據，只要全憑想像便可以拉人封艇，法律越模糊空泛越令你無所適從，就是要你終日戰戰兢兢。這就是我們以後生活的現實，習慣吧！習慣不到？食安眠藥吧！」辯方笑問黎：「有否吃安眠藥？」黎說沒有，因文章只是比喻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到：「是的，你們的上一代（我們這一代）因為中共『解放』避秦而逃來香港，今日你們這一代也被迫避秦而往，移民似乎是我們香港人無法逃避的宿命，嗚呼，時也命也！」辯方問黎當年為何來香港？黎回答因為中國在共產黨的統治下很恐怖，而香港則非常吸引，於他而言是一個天堂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認上述文章反映他當時的真誠想法。被問到有否意圖藉文章引起憎恨，黎強調自己心裡從沒有仇恨，他也沒有意圖去煽動其他人憎恨政府。他稱不知道別人看文章後感覺如何，他也無意促使別人要怎樣思考。辯方追問，那麼黎撰寫文章的意圖是什麼？黎表示為了表達自己，以及表達自己所想的真相。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章形容「今日國安法將香港變成亳無法治的專政無形集中營」。黎指文章已寫明是「無形集中營」，是一種比喻，因新疆有很多人被關押在集中營，而他認為香港與新疆的情況非常相近。法官李素蘭追問，可是文章又說「無形集中營」？黎重申他乃運用比喻，又指如果市民活在監控之中，會感到總是被別人監視著，構成一個「無形集中營」，因此他在文章中說是無形。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章亦稱：「難怪任志剛聽聞國安法立法嘆『感謝主』，也難怪雷鼎鳴說，嚇走了一些人對香港是好事，若然你對香港人有足夠仇恨，這會是自然不過的宣泄。可能他們不是真的對香港人有仇恨，只是榮華富貴太吸引，不惜自我作賤效忠主謝皇恩。」黎解釋，上文意思是有的人認為《國安法》立法對香港是壞事，有的人卻認為《國安法》對香港是好事，例如任志剛和雷鼎鳴。黎認為他們並非仇恨香港人，他們可能只是討好權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper starts by discussing the nature of Wagner Group’s cooperation with the Russian state. The long debate on whether Wagner Group was just a front of Russia’s military intelligence was settled by the 2023 mutiny, which showed conclusively that it was not. The nature of the relationship with the Russian state could be described as a sort of an informal public-private part nership, in which the main value of Wagner Group was its flexibility and its ability to get things done quickly, in contrast to the rigidity and slowness of the rusty Russian bureaucracy. Wagner Group thus pioneered the renaissance of Russian “information operations”, after many years of complete Western dominance, and turned Russia into an active player in a number of African internal conflicts for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Whether this is good or bad for Russia is a different matter, but Moscow was seeking to become relevant again and Wagner Group delivered that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the successful cooperation between Wagner Group and the Russian state lasted about 10 years, starting from Prigozhin’s first steps in the “information operations” field. The 2023 mutiny of course was a very important event in changing Moscow’s assessment of Wagner Group, but even disregarding that a number of important issues emerged, affecting both the sustainability of the Wagner model and its ability to serve Russia’s foreign policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian officials still praise the ability of Wagner Group to handle proxies, such as militias fighting local wars. Wagner’s disinformation campaigns have to a large extent been taken away from it after the mutiny, due to obvious distrust of its ultimate aims. However, the fact that the campaigns have not changed much since bears witness to the fact that Wagner’s contribution per se is still seen as at least adequate. Assessing the impact of such campaigns is not straightforward, but it is not unreasonable to say that at least some of Russia’s growing popularity in Africa was due to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s intervention in internal conflicts in Africa and Middle East is a more controversial legacy. Its failure in Mozambique was a significant embarrassment for Moscow, while Wagner’s contract to re-capture and then exploit Syrian oil and gas fields may have contributed significantly to the decline in Syrian-Russian relations. Wagner’s ruthlessly exploitative (in fact, neo-colonial) approach to Central Africa and Syria had the potential of undermining Russia’s image and to some extent it has already started doing so, not only in Syria as mentioned already but also in Africa. This is confirmed by signs that Moscow might be heading in a different direction in countries whose leaderships have resisted such approach, such as Mali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very involvement in complex internal conflicts abroad carries risks: Wagner and with it Russia might get trapped in unmanageable and worsening crises, imposing costs that Russia cannot afford to bear and eventually undermining any advantages that “being relevant again”, as argued above, might have brought. Tension with an old ally of Russia such as Algeria over Wagner’s role in Libya and Mali is another aspect of the geopolitical risk implicit in relying on an actor such as Wagner Group in the pursuit of foreign policy aims. Moscow seems increasingly aware of these risks, but it has not been able to identify other reliable actors that could really replace Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner Group’s international activities have featured regularly in the media in recent years. The coverage has sometimes been sensationalist, causing occasional panic in Washington and European capitals over Russian expansion, especially in Africa. After several years of Wagner operations in Africa and the Middle East, it is time to take stock of how useful the mercenary group has been to Russian foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different interpretations of its relationship with the Russian state and Russian po litical and military elites, but the dominant one is this: It has been seen by Moscow as a key tool of foreign policy in Africa – although it is far from Russia’s only lever of influence there. There are also differing views about its impact, but again the dominant one is that thanks to Wagner’s operations, Russia has dramatically raised its profile and influence in parts of Africa and would not have been able to do so without relying on Wagner’s unorthodox approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death of Yevgeny Prigozhin precipitated an unravelling of many of Wagner’s international activities. As a result, at the time of writing (September 2024), Wagner Group no longer repre sented a key component of Russian foreign policy. Nonetheless, we submit that its modus operandi and the reasons for its success remain important to understand, among other things because the Russians are trying to develop new approaches based on Wagner Group’s experience, and because other actors (such as Turkey, China, UAE) have been keenly observing its experience and are likely to be drawing their own lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks primarily to answer the question of whether, from the perspective of mid 2024, Wagner Group overall contributed positively to Russian foreign policy. It is based on a series of 15 interviews with: current and former Wagner Group staff; Russian diplomats and military officers; and Syrian, Malian and Central African government officials, military officers, business men and local community elders. Some interviewees spoke in their official capacity or as external observers, but most of our sources spoke off the record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to this methodology, with the research necessarly limited to oral sources, albeit with considerable support from news reports and analytical reports produced by other re searchers. Primary written sources, such as Wagner’s and Russian government records, are scant, aside from the few internal Wagner documents that have been leaked to journalists. There is also a range of social media channels, primarily on Telegram, that have served as public platforms for Wagner’s public relations campaigns. In addition to the interviews, this paper relies on the avail able literature, which now includes several books on Wagner and Prigozhin, many reports, a few journal articles and countless media stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is split into two sections. The first is dedicated to how Wagner Group and the Russian state cooperated and the nature of their relationship, while the second deals with the implications, both positive and negative, of contracting out state operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-how-wagner-group-cooperated-with-the-russian-state&quot;&gt;2. How Wagner Group Cooperated with the Russian State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-russian-foreign-policymaking&quot;&gt;2.1 Russian foreign policymaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of Wagner Group took place during a particular phase of Russian foreign policy. The state – led by its political leadership – was just setting broad parameters for foreign policy strategy. After Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in 2012, this strategy aimed to restore Russian global influence in ways that increasingly challenged the international status quo. Yet the implementation of this broad strategic vision was conducted through a disaggregated and decentralized system, in which there was significant room for policy entrepreneurs to pursue their own objectives. In this system, the division between public and private interests, and state and non-state actors, was blurred, and private financial interests and the goals of the state often overlapped. Competing institutions and agencies could pursue tactical goals in their own interests by aligning them with the declared strategic interests of the state. At times, different Russian interests worked on different sides of a conflict. The Kremlin sometimes allowed these competing initiatives to proceed, with the idea that if a private initiative failed, it was the private sponsor’s failure. If it succeeded, it could become a government project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, the fact that Wagner Group formed in the shadow of Russian military intelligence, the GRU, and with its support, is not necessarily particularly important. Inevitably, somebody within the Russian apparatus had to liaise and support Wagner Group, which would never have had the logistics and equipment to operate on its own. In post-Soviet Russia, the GRU emerged as the handler of most special operations abroad, so Wagner was an obvious partner. The assets provided to Wagner Group came from Russian Army and Russian Air Force stock, with the Russian Transport Aviation ferrying Wagner equipment and human resources around the world. The relationship with the GRU, however, does not per se imply, as has been argued, that Wagner Group was simply a GRU front, although the ties were often very close. Events in 2023 showed that Wagner Group had its own motivations, leadership and ethos distinct from the Russian state and military. Other so-called private military companies (PMCs) that emerged in 2022-23 were indeed little more than auxiliary forces for the GRU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-a-public-private-partnership&quot;&gt;2.2 A public-private partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Prigozhin almost certainly pursued his own leads and initiatives in Africa, it is clear that until the 2023 mutiny, there was a significant role for the Russian government in negotiating contracts for Wagner. According to Mark Galeotti, Prigozhin appears to have always sought clearance from the Kremlin first, even when the Russian government was not tasking Wagner with an assignment or funding it. The control of the Ministry of Defense (MoD) over military equipment also gave the Russian authoritiesit ways to control Wagner, or at least exert leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There do not appear to have been many cases of Wagner operating autonomously from the Russian MoD. In Syria, for example, according to Syrian sources, Prigozhin was introduced to Bashar Assad by Russian generals in March 2015, to discuss the prospects of mercenaries sup porting the regime with frontline operations against various armed opposition groups. The idea appears to have originally come from the Russian authorities, who did not want to risk their own men on the front line. When the MoD decided it did not need Wagner’s services on the battlefield anymore, according to a Syrian source and Prigozhin reached an agreement with the Syrian gov ernment over recapturing oil fields, the Russian government was privy to the deal. Even when Damascus later sought to end this contract with Wagner and asked the Russian authorities to agree to this, “The Syrian government was not able to kick them out,” due to Wagner being protected by the Russian MoD. This may appear surprising given the notoriously poor relationship between former Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu and Prigozhin, but the Russians might have wanted to shelter the Wagner-controlled contracts in the oil and gas sector. Only the 2023 mutiny changed their attitude, at which point Syrian hostility to Wagner’s business role broke overcame the Russian resistance and succeeded in pushing Wagner out of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mozambique, the Russian defense minister, a deputy defense minister and close advisors of President Putin played a core role in getting contracts involving Wagner Group, according to Wagner staff. Here, the bad blood between Prigozhin and Shoigu was evident again; a Wagner source reported that Prigozhin accused Shoigu of being “useless” in a conversation. To this day, however, Wagner Group remains on the contract with Maputo, the implementation of which has almost completely been frozen. According to Wagner sources, the group continues to operate as a provider of advisory services, although it keeps a low profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian authorities were also deeply involved in the negotiations that took Wagner to Mali and remained involved thereafter. Russian diplomacy even endorsed the controversial operation that led to the recapture of Kidal in November 2023, stating Russia’s support for Mali regaining full control of its national territory. In the Central African Republic (CAR), the role of the Russian government in getting the contract for Wagner’s activities is also clear. Russian diplomacy laid the groundwork for Wagner’s future role in the CAR by supporting the regime of President Faustin Archange Touadéra in the UN Security Council to obtain a partial lifting of the arms embargo that had been imposed on the country. Of course, these efforts by the Russian state do not mean that Prigozhin may not have taken the initiative in some cases and persuaded Russian officials to back him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pervasive role of the MoD does not mean that all these operations and contracts were of equal importance to the military. From the perspective of the Russian authorities, the Sahel region was always more interesting than the CAR, the world’s poorest and least developed coun try. Wagner’s intervention in Mali, for example, was accompanied by the deployment of many more Wagner mercenaries and representatives of the Russian MoD compared to Wagner’s inter vention in the CAR. Even in the CAR, however, the Russian government was heavily involved. A Wagner source confirms that in the early phases of Wagner’s arrival in the country, the key role in securing the contract with Bangui was played by Andrei Averyanov, a deputy head of the GRU, and Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, a deputy defense minister. The original 2017 agreement entailed a 30% share of the revenue going to the MoD, which would in turn provide the equipment needed by Wagner for free. Moreover, Russia’s interest in the CAR could increase in the event of any major agreement being signed with Cameroon or Chad, or both, or if the conflict in Sudan (where Russia has important strategic interests and Wagner had a mining contract) ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD-Wagner partnership was not without friction, however. Besides the Wagner mutiny in Ukraine and rather well publicized disagreements in Syria (see the next section), there were other cases. For example, a resentful Wagner leadership responded to any mishap or failure by scapegoating the MoD. On the failure to deliver on the contract in Mozambique, where Wagner Group proved inept at jungle warfare, a Wagner source faulted the MoD assessors and advisers whose views had shaped the deal signed with the Mozambican government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-wagners-flexibility&quot;&gt;2.3 Wagner’s flexibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rusty, bureaucratized and overstretched Russian armed forces of the Putin era, up to the early stages of the current war in Ukraine, Wagner Group offered adaptability and quick solutions – in other words, flexibility. It was this flexibility that enabled Russia to project force rapidly into geopolitical hotspots, beginning with the early deployment of Wagner into Syria in 2015. This flexibility remained a key advantage for the Russian authorities, even in Syria, where operations were marred by the poor relations between Wagner and Prigozhin, on one side, and Shoigu and the MoD in general, on the other. Prigozhin’s claims of MoD “betrayal” after the Battle of Khasham in Syria, where Wagner forces were hammered by the Americans, are usually interpreted as the main point of friction with the MoD. In any case, even as the MoD tried to distance itself from Wagner in different armed conflicts, it repeatedly went back to Prigozhin when it found itself in need of Wagner’s competencies. For example, after the recapture of Palmyra from the Islamic State in March 2016, Shoigu reportedly decided to end Wagner’s contract. Months later, in December 2016, the Islamic State retook Palmyra, and the MoD once again issued weapons to Wagner to take back the city. As John Lechner and Marat Gabidullin note, however, it took some persuading to return Wagner to the battlefield:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When Russian Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov denigrated Wagner’s role in the fighting in Syria, an infuriated Prigozhin sent his men back to camp. It was only under great pressure that Wagner rejoined the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar situation appears to have played out in the invasion of Ukraine, where the MoD initially relied on mercenaries from the PMC Redut and other MoD-controlled contractors, before requesting help from Prigozhin and Wagner after the Russian army suffered a critical shortage of personnel in the wake of the failure of the initial strike in February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s flexibility also included its diplomatic impact. The group offered a low-cost vessel for Moscow to respond rapidly when opportunities arose to compete with the West. This was not a carefully planned strategy, and at times both the Russian state and Wagner have been highly opportunistic. Perhaps the best characterization of the relationship is that the sides shared the belief that profit-seeking business and foreign policymaking are not merely compatible but also naturally synergistic. In fact, both sides were, at least for a time, operating like venture capitalists: taking and exploiting chances to make gains, diplomatic and financial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case after case, Wagner was able to respond quickly to fill a security vacuum left by others. In the CAR, a Wagner force arrived in mid-2018 to bolster the Touadéra regime against rebels after France withdrew its troops in October 2016. In Libya, Wagner forces deployed to support the rebel Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar against the Tripoli government, also in the context of a lack of international engagement in the Libyan civil war. In Sudan, the pariah status of President Omar al-Bashir allowed a Prigozhin-backed company, Meroe Gold, to set up operations in the country in 2017 on very privileged terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Mali, it was arguably Bamako’s own miscalculation that led to the sudden de cision of President Emmanuel Macron to pull French forces out of the country, followed by the withdrawal of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MI NUSMA). According to a Malian official, the Malian junta’s intent does not appear to have been to replace the French with Wagner. Indeed, if they had wanted the French to leave, they had not shown it and later complained loudly about the French abandoning them. Rather, they sought to renegotiate terms and get more options. When the French contingent was deployed, Malian elites never seriously considered measures either to strategically defeat the jihadist insurgency or to reach any compromise; their concern was protecting the capital and the regime. They appear to have assumed that a military solution would eventually be possible, once they expanded their arsenal. The Russians and Wagner were quick to exploit this unexpected opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This profit-seeking and business-oriented approach soon showed its drawbacks, however. Wag ner was not always prepared to tough it out when the costs were deemed too high. Take the above mentioned Wagner deployment to Mozambique in 2019 to carry out counterinsurgency operations in the north of the country: When Prigozhin decided to bail out after Wagner took unexpectedly high casualties in the jungles of Cabo Delgado, Shoigu was “not happy,” according to a Wagner source, suggesting that the premature withdrawal was incongruous with broader Russian plans for deeper ties with Mozambique. Note that while Wagner Group has a track record of not being casualty averse, this situation required additional risk that the reward from the relatively small Mozambican contract did not justify in pure business terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-the-pros-and-cons-of-contracting-out-state-operations&quot;&gt;3. The Pros and Cons of Contracting out State Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31-wagner-group-as-a-handler-of-proxies&quot;&gt;3.1 Wagner Group as a handler of proxies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the 2023 mutiny, the Russian authorities assessed Wagner Group’s impact positively when it came to roles that the Russian army and the GRU found difficult to handle. Even in Syria, where Wagner Group came under heavy pressure from both the Russian MoD and Syrian government, Wagner was viewed as an asset because of its ability to manage militias and other proxy forces. Initially, the Russians were divided as to whether to push for a reform of the Syrian army or invest in militias, with the Russian security services and Wagner Group promoting the latter option. The Russian military had a very low opinion of the Syrian army, not least because “The Syrian government promoted a lot of useless people,” against Russian advice, according to one Russian military advisor. A Russian diplomat expressed resentment at Assad’s efforts to remove Syrian officers whose loyalty to the regime was uncertain, including those close to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russian attitude toward relying on militias in place of the Syrian regular army fluctuated over time, after 2017 even the Russian MoD increasingly became convinced that there might be no alternative to militias. Wagner Group built a reputation for managing them relatively effectively, training and fighting alongside them. It is credited with having turned one Syrian militia, the ISIS Hunters, into a relatively effective fighting force. In January 2024, a Russian diplomat noted that “the private military companies […] changed the Russian plan for training the militias…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not new. The use of loyal proxies and militias had been central to Russia’s inter vention in eastern Ukraine in 2014, where Russian-backed Donbas militias, along with Wagner and various other PMCs, provided Russia with the opportunity to secure physical control of parts of the Donbas while the political status of these territories remained disputed. Wagner gained additional experience in training proxy forces and leading them on the battlefield in Syria, be fore extending this model of proxy warfare to other conflict zones, first to Libya, where the PMC trained and supported Haftar’s LNA, and then to the CAR and Mali, where local forces trained by Wagner played a central role in counterinsurgency warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;32-wagners-warriors-for-hire&quot;&gt;3.2 Wagner’s warriors for hire&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of proxies and PMCs gave Russian diplomats a useful layer of “plausible deniability.” The phrase “they are not there” (“ikh tam net”) became a popular slogan for Wagner, part of a wider myth of the group as a deniable, covert force that dated back to the deployment in Ukraine in 2014. This also reduced any domestic pressure on the Russian government because of casualties in overseas military operations. According to investigative journalism sources, 73-101 private contractors had died in Syria as of December 2017, versus 41 Russian servicemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it worked with proxy forces, Wagner was also a fighting force in its own right – in contrast to some other PMCs, which acted more in training or advisory roles. Privately, many Russian officials have admitted that Wagner played a key role in Syria, even if publicly the MoD has downplayed its contribution. A Russian diplomat said that the Wagner Group had done “a lot since they arrived in Syria; they did what was impossible for Syrian security forces; they helped the Russian army take a lot of territory from terrorists in Syria.” Perhaps surprisingly, such views persisted in 2024. In April, a Russian military adviser in Syria said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The private military companies, such as Wagner in the past, did a lot to support Russia; they joined the front lines of the war and retook a lot of territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the CAR, Wagner played a proportionally much bigger role than in Syria, crushing the opposition forces. That said, the challenges faced by the PMC in the CAR were modest in com parison to Mali and even more so to Syria. As one veteran commented, “… in 2021 […] we were fighting Séléka. And they were a lot weaker than the Syrians. The rebels only had a few beaten-up RPGs maybe some ‘Kalashes,’ or AK-47s.” Nevertheless, it was a military success, even though, from the Russian government’s perspective, the CAR was of limited geopolitical interest. Moscow even appears to have been ready to shut down all Wagner operations there, and only intervention by CAR President Touadera prevented that from happening. Owing to Wagner’s and Russia’s presence in Libya and the much greater geopolitical relevance of the Sahel, the Russian authorities were much more interested in Mali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s performance in the CAR served as an advertisement of its potential for armed – and very brutal – counterinsurgency operations, something that contributed to their expansion into the Sahel. Initially, Russian officials supported Wagner’s deployment and its November 2023 Kidal offensive, which kickstarted the effort to reclaim the north of Mali. This suggests that Moscow had no objections to Wagner’s operations per se and that efforts to replace Wagner were entirely due to Prigozhin’s mutiny. How the Russian government assesses nowadays the role of Wagner Group in Mali remains unclear, after a disastrous foray into the north (that ended in an ambush in July in which numerous Wagner fighters were killed) highlighted the risk of the Malian government getting trapped in a conflict on three fronts, with no real prospect of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s uniqueness was that it offered something that nobody else could offer. Other Rus sian PMCs, such as Redut and Convoy, had only experimented with combat operations: Redut originally worked as the security outfit of Gennady Timchenko’s Stroytransgaz in Syria, while in Ukraine Redut, working with General Vladimir Alekseev of the GRU, delivered fighters to the front line. Convoy did the same, contributing a volunteer battalion in Ukraine, allegedly spon sored by Arkady Rotenberg and Crimean separatist leader Sergey Aksenov. Redut reportedly performed poorly in Ukraine, suffering huge losses of personnel in the first weeks of the war. Overall, there is too little information to assess fully the performance of Redut and Convoy as sur rogates of Wagner in Syria and Ukraine, yet it is a fact that neither Redut nor Convoy had appeared in Africa as of mid-2024, and there is likely a good reason for that. The military services con tracts taken from Wagner after the mutiny were transferred directly to the Russian MoD’s PMC department, to forces operating under the “Africa Corps” label. As of mid-2024, the latter were reportedly operating in Libya, Niger and Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just Russian PMCs that are unwilling or unable to provide combat capabilities for cash. As noted by Francisco José Matías Bueno, “After the bad experience of Blackwater Security Company, in this sector those jobs more linked to mercenary or high risk have been avoided. While Western companies have evolved into lower-risk services.” Here, Wagner found a niche for itself. “Many fragile states find themselves in a situation that is not too far from what Assad experienced a few years ago,” Bueno adds. Whereas Wagner Group was out of its depth in jungle fighting (where South African PMCs might well have had an advantage), in more open environments, even where highly capable enemies were present and, significant casualties were to be expected, Wagner – with its Spetsnaz heritage – had few, if any, rivals. The closest match is Turkey’s SADAT PMC, whose Syrian mercenaries were involved in intense fighting in Libya and took significant casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;33-wagners-disinformation-campaigns&quot;&gt;3.3 Wagner’s disinformation campaigns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner’s other major contribution to Russian foreign policy came in the media realm. The Russian state has been keen to promote its narratives through outlets such as Sputnik and RT, which, in turn, have expanded their coverage in the Middle East and Africa rapidly over the past decade. Wagner added a new, more assertive and often creative strand to this media campaign, using social media, feature films, video clips and memes to both promote Wagner and transmit the broader Russian message. Prigozhin’s media teams were particularly adept at using local media outlets and African influencers to package this as part of wider Pan-Africanist and anti-colonial narratives. In Africa and parts of the Arab world, local social media influencers have promoted the Russian narrative on the Ukraine war. Prigozhin once described Wagner troops as “heroes defending destitute Africans and Latin Americans,” and this anti-colonial message is widely used to reach foreign audiences. After Prigozhin’s death, there was some reorganization of these media projects, with a new platform, African Initiative, seeming to have taken over some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afrique Media TV (AM TV) is an example of this engagement with local media outlets. A media entity based in Cameroon, it commands a substantial audience across the continent. It was funded by Prigozhin at least until 2022, when that ended for unknown reasons. It also had an agreement with RT, which probably included funding that was continued after 2022. Many of the influencers supported by Wagner’s information operations team appear regularly on AM TV. Leveraging its extensive digital infrastructure, it has successfully amassed a following of over a million people. As of March 2024, this includes approximately 1,000,000 followers on Facebook and 955,000 subscribers on YouTube, giving it considerable reach. Kémi Séba, a popular Pan-Africanist who in 2018-19 appears to have had close ties to Prigozhin, has over 302,000 followers on Instagram, 255,000 on X (formerly Twitter), 1,300,000 on Face book, 280,000 on TikTok and 220,000 on YouTube. Although he later cut ties with Prigozhin, Seba has retained ties to figures such as nationalist polemicist Alexander Dugin in Moscow, judging by Dugin’s effusive X commentary about him. Another popular figure with ties to Prigozhin, Nathalie Yamb, has over 84,500 followers on Instagram, 410,000 on X, 84,000 on Facebook, 176,000 on TikTok, and 379,000 subscribers on YouTube. Drissa Meminta, a legal advisor and one of Mali’s best-known Pan-African activists, has 189,000 subscribers on Facebook. While these numbers do not necessarily mean impact, they at least show that many Africans receive their typically pro-Russian and anti-Western messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian information campaigns appear to be effective in parts of Africa, especially but not only in Mali and the CAR, where they have been focused. In Mali, Sputnik France ranks between RFI and France 24, on the one hand, and French BBC, on the other. Surveys of public opinion in Mali have shown high levels of support for Russia and for Mali-Russia cooperation (98% ac cording to the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Mali-Metre). In 2024, Gallup found that across Africa, 42% approved of Russia’s leadership, up from 34% in 2022. It is hard to prove a causal link be tween the growing popularity of the Russian government and the information operations set up by Wagner, but it appears likely that the latter played a role in promoting Russia’s “brand” in Africa. While the information operations may have indeed been deemed successful, it remains unclear whether Moscow thinks that Wagner Group’s media role is as essential as its “warrior for hire” function: Prigozhin was often an innovator in media operations, yet Russian officials might now believe that they have become adept at manipulating the media, partly thanks to Prigozhin’s work. However, the Russian authorities seemed to be warming up to resuming cooperation with Wag ner’s information operations team in 2024, which suggests that they might have found its work, to some extent, irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;34-wagners-geopolitical-impact&quot;&gt;3.4 Wagner’s geopolitical impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2012, Russia had begun to view Africa as a key area for restoring Russian influence (which had collapsed along with the Soviet Union). Soviet influence-building in Africa had been expen sive, and the Soviet Union collapsed before it could reap any benefits, although Moscow continued to leverage the memory of its support for anti-colonial movements such as South Africa’s African National Congress (ANC) to bolster support among some African states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s revived Africa policy was strong on rhetoric about sovereignty, anti-colonialism and multipolarity, but short on specific proposals that would attract support in Africa. President Putin criticized Western countries, which he claimed were “… resorting to pressure, intimidation and blackmail of sovereign African governments” but had little to offer in terms of economic aid or trade. Wagner’s mix of customized security provision and illicit dealings in minerals appeared as an ideal instrument for an economically weak Russia that wanted to compete with the West in Africa and the Middle East. Moscow viewed these regions as sites for proxy conflicts with Western powers – especially France in West Africa – and temporary alignments with Gulf powers, such as the UAE in Libya and Sudan. This represented both a geopolitical challenge to the West and an attempt to gain support among African states as new trading partners and potential votes at the UN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Moscow’s initial intentions in sponsoring Wagner interventions in Africa was to show that Russia was hardly “isolated” after 2014. Prigozhin was present at the inaugural Russia-Africa Summit – held in Sochi on October 23-24, 2019, and attended by 43 African leaders – and his security and commercial projects gave substance to Russian diplomacy. Even before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when abstentions in the UN became an important diplomatic goal for Russia, Africa and the Middle East offered potential partnerships for Russia at a time when its relations with the West were already in sharp decline. Meanwhile, as mentioned, Russia’s influence in Africa has long roots. A major part of Russian diplomacy aimed to leverage the history of Moscow’s support for Cold-War-era anti-colonial movements, such as the ANC, to bolster current ties. However, one of the fixtures of Russian foreign policy has been the refusal to “waste” much needed resources on ideological causes abroad, which is how Soviet support for movements and states in Africa has been described. Although the debate has now reopened, for years, it was deemed financially irrational for Russia to resume a Soviet-style influence policy in Africa, when Moscow funneled billions of dollars to local proxies with little lasting effect. Modern Russia no longer had the economic resources for any economic largesse, it was argued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic ties were thus limited by Russia’s own limited resources: Major Russian energy and mining corporations had limited success in Africa, where they faced competition from both Chinese and Western investors. For a Russia without plush resources but with few scruples and big global ambitions, the Wagner model proved to be an important innovation. It offered close military and commercial engagement with elites in a small number of countries, from which Russia derived some geopolitical benefits. It was geopolitical influence on the cheap, with troop deployments covered directly by host governments or indirectly through mining and other business concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious successes of the partnership between the Russian government and Wagner came in Africa. Yet even there the Wagner model did not work everywhere. It was best suited to smaller, poorer, conflict-affected countries where Wagner’s military resources and commercial deals could be attractive for a local political elite and where Western states had few core interests; however, it was not attractive in larger, richer states, such as Nigeria. Moreover, Wagner Group and its less than polished delivery also caused major friction with some larger African countries. For example, Nigeria was concerned by Russia’s role in promoting divisions in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and supporting the formation of the Alliance of Sahel States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Wagner’s operations succeeded where they aligned with the anti-French positions of some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries like Mali and the CAR sought Russia’s aid in counterbalancing or replacing neocolonial powers, eventually resulting in complete French with drawal, a major Russian success. Moscow’s growing influence in the Sahel, together with waning Western influence, would have been unlikely had it not been for the Wagner model. For example, nationalist feelings in the Malian army were exacerbated after 2021, when it felt humiliated by the way the French had seemingly turned from rescuers into occupiers. The Russians, through Wagner, positioned themselves to take advantage of this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner and Russia are not immune from the risk of a souring of moods, however. Wagner’s advisers, whom some described as “foreigners who know nothing of the country” and who “are trying to take control of operations,” soon started making some Malian officers nervous again. This raises the question of how sustainable Russia’s gains through Wagner Group are. Regime change in Mali or the CAR could have disastrous consequences for Russia, but so could any major Wagner failure there. Geopolitical realignment by these regimes cannot be ruled out either. After all, as noted above, the Malian junta brought Wagner in exactly for the purpose of counterbalancing the French – tomorrow it might invite another actor to counterbalance the Russians. The same is applicable elsewhere. As a Russian adviser noted, CAR President Touadéra, recognizing both Russia and the West’s decreasing interest in the country, appeared to be playing up the geopolitical rivalry to shore up his regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the Russian government has already had to intervene to patch up problems created by Wagner Group. From Moscow’s perspective, the fact that the Wagner model was op portunistic and flexible was simultaneously its main selling point and its weak spot. In Sudan, it was widely assumed that Wagner Group smuggled weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which are fighting the Sudanese army in the ongoing civil war, again on behalf of the UAE. Despite media reports that assume Wagner is doing Moscow’s bidding by trying to hedge its bets and keep a foot in each camp, there is no evidence of that. It looks rather dubious that the Rus sian government would trust such a delicate operation to Wagner Group, at least after Prigozhin’s mutiny and all the bad blood between the PMC and the Kremlin. In any case, in June 2024 the Russian government reportedly agreed to clamp down on any Wagner Group support for the RSF, in exchange for the agreement for a Russian naval base in Port Sudan to go ahead and Sudan’s links to Ukraine to be severed. If Wagner Group smuggled weapons to the RSF independently of Moscow, contributing to the Sudanese government teaming up with Ukraine to fight Wagner and the RSF, this would be a prime example of the negative side of Wagner’s “opportunism and flexibility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Libya, funding from the UAE and possibly other Gulf states allowed Wagner to establish a major operation in support of Haftar’s forces, simultaneously furthering Russia’s geopolitical interests. Wagner’s willingness to do Haftar’s bidding without restraint, however, ended up irri tating the most Russia-friendly government in the region, Algeria. The same applies to Wagner’s intervention in Mali, especially after it agreed to Bamako’s demands to retake Kidal in the north, definitively derailing the Algiers Peace Agreement. Despite allegations to the contrary, Algeria denies having helped Russia to deploy Wagner to Mali and claims that it even opposed Wagner’s deployment to Libya. One Algerian source nonetheless acknowledged that Algiers had concerns about the links to France of some Azawad groups. Whatever Algiers’ role in Russia’s interven tion in Mali, its attitude rapidly soured. Indeed, Russia’s alliance with the Malian junta and Haftar in Libya, both quite hostile to Algeria, was not appreciated in Algiers, which had invested diplo matic capital in sponsoring the peace accords of 2015 in the north of Mali and was not pleased to see them collapse. This resulted in considerable irritation in Algiers about Wagner’s deployment and Moscow’s role in that. The Algerians are worried, a Malian official said, “that Wagner would push armed groups across the border to cross into Algeria.” Algerian interviewees argued that involving Wagner and seeking a military solution would worsen the situation and that the Tuaregs needed to be integrated economically and politically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You cannot defeat terrorism with guns and drones and whatever you have. In the long term, if you really want to unroot it, then you have to do something else, which is social, political and economic investments. And this is what is lacking in Mali and Niger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to engage in a serious diplomatic effort to calm the situation, especially after Haftar threatened war with Algeria and Algiers seriously considered intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Algeria absolutely rejects the role of Wagner group and asks Russia to control the group so it does not deteriorate the situation in Mali and cross red lines for Algeria, and asked for its removal from Libya completely. It appears that this is an ongoing matter between Algeria and Russia, and they are certainly talking about it. […] The Russians say that their presence would reduce French domination, and this serves Algerian foreign policy interests. But Algeria says: French domination is one thing, Wagner is a different matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Algerians are said to have never really believed that Moscow was behind Wagner’s most provocative actions, such as the attempt to retake northern Mali, since it did not have much to gain from them. Nevertheless, Algiers strongly insisted that the Russians should fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35-wagner-in-syria-the-right-model-that-could-be-improved&quot;&gt;3.5 Wagner in Syria: The “right model” that “could be improved”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, even after Prigozhin’s mutiny and subsequent death, Russian diplomatic and military sources rather highly rated Russia’s experience with the mercenaries in Syria. Despite the bitter end, as late as April 2024, a Russian military adviser in Syria claimed that “The private military companies, such as Wagner in the past, did a lot to support Russia.” A Russian diplomat argued that while the model was the right one, it could be improved. He acknowledged that Wagner Group was upsetting the Syrians because it was “operating without any warning,” “never shared anything about its next operation with the Syrian government and army” and “was careless about civilian casualties, and it committed crimes in most of their operations.” He was positive on replacing Wagner with Redut, claiming that Redut and the former Wagnerites under direct MoD contract were operating without any of the drug trafficking and fuel smuggling that had characterized the Wagner period. Hence PMCs and PSCs remain part of Russia’s plans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the future, we are going to invest in private military and security companies. Most of these private companies would be under the control of the Syrian security forces, as we know that they are helpful and would be better in Syria as well. Private companies would offer Russia a lot, securing soldiers, securing all our benefits in Syria, working for and saving the lives of Russian fighters as they have got fighters from different countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian diplomatic, military, and oil and gas industry sources confirmed that the Russian au thorities always defended Wagner against Syrian criticism and blocked Syrian attempts to take existing contracts, especially in the oil and gas sector, away from the group. It was only after the mutiny that the Russian authorities stopped protecting Wagner, working with the Syrians to get the group out of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;36-wagner-in-africa-dependency-carries-benefits-and-risks&quot;&gt;3.6 Wagner in Africa: Dependency carries benefits and risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russians have positioned themselves as a trusted partner of troubled countries in Africa, but they had little role, if any, in bringing these regimes to power. This yields considerable benefits for Moscow at a low cost. African elites increasingly seek to expand their agency and autonomy, mainly vis-à-vis the West and particularly former colonial powers. They seek to manipulate Wagner to their ends, making it deliver they want. This is true not just in Mali, but also in Burkina Faso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not that we’re pro-Russian or pro-junta,” the Burkinabe official told me. “For me, Wagner symbolizes a cry of frustration and desire for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with this strengthened agency, however, some of these governments risk getting trapped in military adventures. In fact, Russia is increasingly becoming more than “trusted”: When the Malian government renewed its contract with Russia in early 2024, this was certainly less of a free choice than in early 2021, given Mali’s subsequent international isolation. The departure of other foreign military forces has made Bamako dependent on Wagner, without which the Malian armed forces lack the punch to challenge insurgent control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such dependency is a risk for Wagner’s clients. By 2023, there were signs that at least in the CAR, this was giving rise to second thoughts among government officials. Wagner started to be seen as a difficult partner, which, having sold the CAR elite “a win-win partnership,” was no longer giving the CAR government “so much.” “The group’s harsh tactics, including rape, torture and other human rights abuses, as well as economic exploitation, have soured the relationship.” By 2023, “Touadéra was like a disabled man, walking with a cane, and that cane is Wagner,” noted Sergey Eledinov. Echoing this sentiment, other government officials were clear that “Without Wagner we’ll have issues within 48 hours”; “whether we want it or not, they are the ones who keep the hinterland safe.” In the words of the archbishop of Bangui, Wagner is “a lesser evil” than the rebel groups that controlled large areas of the CAR for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dependency is also a risk for Russia, which cannot afford to run away as Wagner can. The Mozambique example is illustrative: When Prigozhin opted to bail out, the Russian MoD was aghast – bailing out was not something they could afford, if only for the huge reputational damage that it would cause. To avoid that, Russia could get sucked into conflicts, to which it can ill afford to commit resources. In Mozambique, the Russians kept hanging around and are still in talks with Maputo about how to defeat the insurgency in the north. Maputo could wait because this is not a strategic threat, but the picture would look very different in Mali or the CAR if Wagner imploded or bailed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-conclusion&quot;&gt;4. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, Wagner Group’s venture capitalist approach produced successes and failures, but there is no question that overall it helped expand Russian influence in Africa considerably. The sustainability of this expansion, its geopolitical side effects and the potential risks involved are a different matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The faith in the ability of “venture capitalism” to serve Russian foreign policy interests was shaken not just by Wagner’s mutiny in 2023 but also by the failure in Mozambique, growing Syrian resentment against Wagner and Algerian complaints about Wagner operations in Libya and Mali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russian policymakers seem to think that the balance sheet is still positive for Russia, there are also long-term risks to consider. Clearly, Wagner Group is rather embattled in Mali; even in Libya, the complex political and geopolitical situation has already forced Moscow to deal with a series of crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African governments seem to like having a force for hire that they can mobilize at short notice to deal with geopolitical and security issues. It is not just a regime survival package: This descrip tion of Wagner’s services only really fits the CAR. A nationalist military regime like Mali’s, by contrast, wanted Wagner to reassert its sovereignty without compromises. This creates lasting opportunities for Wagner and Wagner-type entities, but these African clients can be demanding and, at least in Mali and Libya, have been able to dictate the agenda. Divergence from Russia’s interests is thus inevitable and inseparable from the expansion of Russia’s influence. Russia is taking serious risks by expanding influence through these means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian policymakers seem to accept that Wagner’s operations were a mixed bag; at the same time, they seem convinced that PMCs and mercenaries are here to stay, but also that improvements are needed. But will it be possible to separate what was good (for Russia) from what was bad in Wagner Group? Asserting more control appears to be the priority, but replacing Wagner with more pliable actors for its most important tasks appears to have already been deemed to be infeasible. Closer control over PMCs like Redut and over the Africa Corps – which are effectively auxiliary forces of the Russian military – means losing the flexibility that made Wagner effective, not to mention the business model that made it cost-effective. Moreover, closer Russian government association with such military deployments is not what most African clients want – they want mercenaries that respond to their needs, not Moscow’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the compromise solution has entailed replacing Wagner where feasible while keeping it on a tighter leash where infeasible. This new model was rolled out starting in early 2024, after 6-7 months’ worth of exploring various options. So far, tangible Russian achievements include a small contract to provide an air defense system to Burkina Faso, along with a revamp of the contract with Haftar in Libya, which had lapsed after the UAE withdrew funding in 2020-21. It is, however, too early to say how this post-Prigozhin approach is working out for Russia . While a correction away from Wagner Group’s excesses and exploitative approach could benefit Russia, is Wagner a beast that lets itself be tamed? More importantly, would Russia have an edge over the competition if all it had to offer were rather standard PMCs?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;國安法後黎智英曾考慮是否繼續受訪 何俊仁提醒發言「留在相對安全的範圍」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WlLh14D.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（9日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第105日審訊，黎智英第13日作供。辯方圍繞國安法生效之後黎的意圖提問。黎供稱，其私人助手 Mark Simon 可能有一刻猶豫，黎應否繼續接受訪問，但黎回覆稱「我們應該要接受訪問」。訊息紀錄亦顯示，黎曾向民主黨何俊仁表示暫時不接受訪問，「但同老婆商量過後決定再接受訪問，老婆不怕我就不用太謹慎。」何接著提醒黎，重點是發言內容的界線，相信黎會掌握「怎樣可留在相對安全的範圍。」黎庭上稱，何與他的想法一致，認為需「避免自己犯法」。黎曾與劉細良對談期間，說國安法之下人們要某程度上隱藏自己正在做的事，不讓別人知道，或假裝在做其他事情，惟黎否認在國安法生效之後，以間接的形式提倡制裁，反問：「你如何將制裁隱藏為其他事情呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎mark-simon-可能對繼續接受訪問有猶豫&quot;&gt;黎：Mark Simon 可能對繼續接受訪問有猶豫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，2020年7月2日，即國安法生效第三日，黎的助手 Mark Simon 向黎轉發了一則長文章，看似是香港大律師公會的聲明，其中一段落提及「勾結」。辯方問黎當時閱讀訊息之後，有否考慮自己的過往行為。黎則表示，閱讀訊息之後肯定沒有聯想起自己的過往行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎回覆 Mark Simon：「我們應該要接受訪問（we should continue to accept interview）」，問黎為何當時這樣說。黎稱，因為所有訪問均是經 Mark Simon 接洽，可能 Mark 有一刻猶豫，黎應否繼續接受訪問，所以Mark 詢問黎的意見，而黎便告知其決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，黎有否類似的猶豫？黎表示，他當然知道言行要更加小心，惟對於接受訪問有否猶豫，黎則稱不記得。辯方追問為何要「小心」，黎稱因為要避免在新的法律之下觸犯罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎twitter轉發報導警攞正牌濫暴屢傷無辜&quot;&gt;黎Twitter轉發報導〈警「攞正牌」濫暴屢傷無辜〉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年7月2日傳送《蘋果》報紙〈警「攞正牌」濫暴屢傷無辜〉照片，給負責管理其Twitter的「徒弟」李兆富（筆名利世民）。同日，黎的 Twitter 帳戶發布帖文，上傳上述報紙照片及寫道：「A “law” has to use #PoliceBrutality to show its effect is for us to have a taste of life living in the grip of communism.」黎庭上指，帖文中的hashtag 是由李添加。被問到有否閱讀相關報紙，黎則稱未有閱讀整篇報導，只是知道當中大概意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周證供顯示，李於7月1日凌晨3時透過訊息向黎提出請辭，惟同日8小時後，黎向 Mark Simon 指李會繼續替黎管理Twitter。黎指最後一直未找到任何人頂替李的職務，所以李做繼續做下去，直至找到人頂替為止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎如何替 Twitter 選材，是否由黎決定。黎稱很困難，但選材考量是想簡略地反映香港情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月2日黎向陳沛敏表示，知道陳有用 Signal，提議她以後用 Signal 溝通（“So you’re on Signal. We can Signal if you like from now on. Cheers, Jimmy”）。辯方引述陳沛敏早前的證供，她跟黎曾有一段時間使用 Signal，但之後改用 WhatsApp。黎確認，但不記得陳何時沒有再用 Signal。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上播對談片段-黎指國安法下市民面對利劍高懸-猶如活在無形監獄&quot;&gt;庭上播對談片段 黎指國安法下市民面對「利劍高懸」 猶如活在「無形監獄」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎出席《壹週刊》ChannelNEXT 特別節目「人民學堂」，與時事評論員劉細良對談，辯方並播放其中一集片段，該集於2020年7月6日上載。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉細良在對談中提到東德時代有秘密警察、秘密檔案，香港社會在國安法下也有可能變成「篤灰時代」。黎稱，雖然香港暫時未變成東德的情況，但是國安法底下，香港社會慢慢地會有「秘密警察自我繁殖」，市民將面對利劍高懸，人們生活在如此社會下會覺得任何人都不可信。黎續指，在國安法下，他害怕在電話中說錯話會被人錄音和篤灰，每做一件事都要很小心，擔心會否犯法，當人們不能依照自己的直覺行事，便會為生活帶來不方便，會使人感到「好窒息」、生活質素降低，猶如活在「無形監獄」。但因為人們有內在的價值、文明和質素，在國安法底下，未能與外在的社會接軌，所以漸漸覺得世界與自己無關，好像身處在監獄裡，感到有人時刻監視自己。有些人無法忍受，便會離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎提到：「你叫我去美國見啊美國副總統呢⋯⋯見唔見 Pompeo（蓬佩奧）呢？我都要諗餐死呀！大佬！」他又說：「即係香港坐監嘅監獄嚟嘅，大陸坐監係地獄嚟㗎大佬！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，上述發言是否反映他在國安法前後真誠相信的想法。黎同意。被問到為何在對談中提到要「很小心」，黎解釋他可能說了一些在國安法下構成罪行的說話，而有人可能向警察舉報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認國安法後間接方式提倡制裁&quot;&gt;黎否認國安法後間接方式提倡制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述楊清奇的證供提到「擦邊球」，問黎有否聽過任何《蘋果》管理層在國安法前後使用這個字詞。黎稱沒有，直至在庭上聽到楊清奇作供時使用這一詞，雖然劉細良在對談中曾使用「擦邊球」，但是他當時未為意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於劉提到「鳥籠」一字，黎亦指劉經常使用「鳥籠」一字作為比喻，惟他未曾向《蘋果》管理層使用這一字，只在撰文的時候會使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎亦在對談中說過：「我唔可以好直接咁，我唔可以好直接去做一樣嘢，而係我要諗另外個方法兜圈去做一樣嘢，或者喺枱底下而做一樣嘢，或者，我要用一個假裝嘅做法，而係真實喺另外一個做法去做個真實嘅嘢。你每一樣嘢你唔可以直接去做而簡單去做嘅時候呢，個成本就會高咗㗎喇嘛⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，他的意思是要某程度上隱藏自己正在做的事，不讓別人知道，或假裝在做其他事情。辯方提到2020年6月10日，黎接受史丹福大學胡佛研究所（Hoover Institution）訪問時，稱：「現在是制裁中國的最佳時機，去迫使中國更好地管束自己的行為，與普世價值接軌，使世界和平。」辯方問黎有否在國安法生效之後，以間接的形式提倡制裁？黎否認，反問：「你如何將制裁隱藏為其他事情呢？」他接著解釋，國安法改變了人們的態度，人們不能自然地行動，反而變成不自然地行動，所以他們要隱藏自己所做的事，意味他們要改變生活習慣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎強調：「這個法律改變了我的態度，但是我沒有意圖去隱藏任何事情。」辯方追問黎實質上有否隱藏任何事情？黎稱沒有，又指不看到自己怎樣去隱藏。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾告知何俊仁不接受訪問-黎稱與妻子商量後決定再接受訪問&quot;&gt;曾告知何俊仁不接受訪問 黎稱與妻子商量後決定再接受訪問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年7月3日，黎向民主黨何俊仁傳送的訊息：「仁哥，我告訴你我暫時不要受訪問，但同老婆商量過後決定再接受訪問，老婆不怕我就不用太謹慎。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否徵詢了妻子意見？黎同意。辯方問黎是否聽從妻子？黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，何俊仁接著向黎說：「Jimmy，我認為訪問不是大問題，而是發言內容的界線，我相信你會掌握怎樣可留在相對安全的範圍。」黎庭上表示，理解何的訊息為「溫馨提示」，當時與他自己的想法一致，認為需「避免自己犯法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著問黎口中的「避免自己犯法」意思是什麼，黎指是小心說話。被問到有否如此做，黎表示直至坐監之前一直都如此做。辯方繼而問，黎還柙之後有否如此做？黎則表示：「坐監之後，我沒有機會去說任何話。」辯方指黎有機會跟探訪人士說話？黎同意。被問到《蘋果》停運之後有否如此，黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指國安法下難找人替他管理twitter-故李兆富繼續管理&quot;&gt;黎指國安法下難找人替他管理Twitter 故李兆富繼續管理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎向李兆富傳送訊息:「Simon，昨天與細良對話無機會講，我決定在李八方交待以下，請看是否要更改。看到李兆富封筆，我不好意思要他再處理我推特的事，雖然稿文是我給他的，不想連累他受（無）妄之災。好（如）何？謝謝，黎」。黎指「李八方」是《蘋果》一個八卦專欄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到早前訊息紀錄顯示，李對於自己管理黎 Twitter 一事曝光感到不高興，問黎為何要在這個階段作出公布，並提及李的全名，以暗示李一直管理黎的 Twitter？黎指正因為李對曝光一事不高興，所以李要求他公開封筆消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，羅偉光向黎傳送擬於「李八方」刊登的草稿。黎指羅之後修訂文字，使它更易閱讀。辯方遂展示羅向黎傳送的修訂版本：「惡法臨城，喺《蘋果》寫專欄15年嘅利世民（李兆富）決定封筆，肥佬黎話，睇到 Simon 封筆，唔好意思要 Simon 再處理佢個 Twitter 嘅事，雖然 po 文係肥佬黎畀 Simon 嘅，但都唔想連累 Simon 受無妄之災。國安震懾之下找個人處理 Twitter 都難，肥佬黎都幾大鑊。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》總編輯 羅偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上確認李兆富停止替《蘋果》撰寫專欄，但是李繼續替他管理 Twitter，直至找到人頂替李為止，相信李和 Mark Simon 均有嘗試尋找人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問為何黎在草稿中指「肥佬黎都幾大鑊」。黎指因為很難找到人替他管理 Twitter，在國安法之下，沒有人會協助他，如果他找不到人替他做事，他便會無助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認知道羅傑斯在ipac角色-稱大部份twitter帖文均只瞥一眼&quot;&gt;黎否認知道羅傑斯在IPAC角色 稱大部份Twitter帖文均只瞥一眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年7月3日，「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）向黎傳送一篇祈禱文，當中呼籲亞洲和全世界的信徒為香港、中國及其人民祈禱。黎回覆：「This is wonderful indeed. No issue CCP imposed in HK has unified the international community in censuring China like the National Security Law. I hope I’ll eventually have effect on its actual exercise here. Thanks for everything.Cheers, Jimmy」。黎否認有意圖請求制裁，強調只是提及「譴責（censuring）」。他稱只是希望國安法能夠減低嚴厲程度，並強調是一廂情願，因為看到羅傑斯傳來的祈禱文。辯方問黎知不知道羅傑斯在國際線上的角色，黎則稱不知道，又指羅從沒向他談及 IPAC。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;辯方指大約8月14日，黎的 Twitter 重推 IPAC 的帖文（retweet），而 IPAC 原本的帖文是分享羅傑斯文章的連結：「IPAC: Police couldn’t take into custody Apple Daily’s inspirational courage, commitment and conscience&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;writes #IPAC advisor @benedictrogers」，當中提及羅傑斯是 IPAC 的顧問。辯方問這帖文會否提醒黎有關羅傑斯在 IPAC 的角色？黎則稱當時未有留意。&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問黎有否閱讀該則 IPAC 帖文。黎則稱，即使他曾閱讀帖文，也沒有留意 IPAC。辯方提到，從2020年5月22日黎開設 Twitter 帳號，直至 Twitter 帳號關閉期間，黎合共發布了超過900則帖文，問他曾經閱讀當中多少帖文、能否說出百分比。黎則稱，大部份帖文他只是瞥一眼、未有引起他的關注，因此說不出曾閱讀過的帖文的百份比。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認twitter帖文提制裁-稱僅談及國安法下改變-不相信國安法保障言論自由&quot;&gt;黎否認Twitter帖文提制裁 稱僅談及國安法下改變 不相信國安法保障言論自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年7月4日向李兆富傳送新聞及 Twitter 帖文草稿，同日黎的 Twitter 發布帖文：「#NationalSecurityLaw let head of liaison office Lou Huining takes over HK’s governance and judiciary system, and headliner Zhang Yanxiong takes over our police as head of security agency. HK is completely #mainlandize」另一則帖文為：「Wearing T-shirt with slogan “Free HK” will be charged with the crime of subversion. #CCP still tries to fool the world freedom of speech is protected. Maybe that is CCP’s version of “freedom” they want us to love and protect.」黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示三則於2020年7月5日的 Twitter 帖文：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（上傳《蘋果》報紙的相片，標題為「日媒：300武警將駐港 公安部長引習：全力指導支持港警止暴制亂」）「Japanese media reports that 300 mainland military police will station in HK, why such a redundancy? Aren’t all 300k HK police military police already according to their brutality!」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（上傳《蘋果》報紙的相片，標題為「鄭若驊：定罪終身禁參選」）「SJ says anyone convicted of crime under #NSL, shall forever be banned from running for public offices. What a simple way to eliminate opposition candidates! Why doesn’t #CCP just simply takes over our legeco and save all the pretensions?」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;（上傳時任警務處副處長（國家安全）劉賜蕙的照片）「These are the police officers in charge of National Security Office with unlimited power, above the law, suppressing our freedom. They don’t look evil, do they? But we are only seeing their faces not their hearts.」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，閱讀國安法之後，有否留意到國安法說它保障基本人權？黎表示：「我只記得他們說國安法會保障言論自由。」辯方指：「但是看來你並不相信？」黎回答：「當然，我不相信，當時也不相信。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，從上述數個帖文可見，內容均是關注國安法所帶來的改變。黎同意。辯方又問，帖文有否提及向中國實施制裁、封鎖和敵對行為？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示黎傳送給楊清奇的照片，為資深傳媒人區家麟的文章「摧毀即貫徹 攬炒即繁榮」，刊於2020年7月4日副刊名采，黎並向楊說：「歐（區）家麟文章好，請考慮邀寫評論版。謝謝。」辯方提及楊早前供稱，黎向楊推薦區家麟作為論壇版寫手，因區的文筆流暢，而且對國安法持批判的態度。黎今則指推薦區是因為文筆流暢，而非基於區對國安法的態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎專欄文章稱勾結外國勢力可被槍斃-惟庭上確認知道國安法並無死刑&quot;&gt;黎專欄文章稱勾結外國勢力可被「槍斃」 惟庭上確認知道國安法並無死刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年7月5日黎的專欄「成敗樂一笑」刊登的文章〈飛翔吧 良知的脊樑在撐著〉。文章提到：「有心人說，快點走，勾結外國勢力是叛國罪，可以是槍斃的啊！」辯方問黎，是否有人跟他說勾結外國勢力是叛國罪？黎確認。辯方指文章接著提到「槍斃」，是否有人跟他這樣說？黎僅稱從 YouTube 頻道「神燈」得知，有人公開這樣說，並提及他本人。辯方追問，可是黎當時已看過國安法內容，知道勾結外國勢力罪行，也知道國安法之下沒有死刑？黎同意。辯方指，他在文章所述的內容豈非與他的理解不同？黎僅說不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在文章指：「我說，我不走，煮到來就食，走了我還怎能做人。很久前已決定不讓恐懼震懾我，否則每說一句話，每做一件事都忌諱後果，我還可以說什麼，還可以做啥事，還可以抬起頭做人嗎！」辯方問黎是否有意干犯國安法？黎則稱他不離開是因為要面對後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章接著指：「王丹兩個多禮拜前透過我好朋友 Perry Link 通知我，他聽到外媒記者告密說，國安法一旦通過，中共便會立即拘捕我和黃之鋒押上大陸受審。」辯方問黎是否相信王丹的說法。黎則稱他未有在文章稱相信王丹的說法，而只是說透過王丹得知 Perry Link 的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱岑建勳恐嚇劉細良夫婦-並指控岑當上了中共打手&quot;&gt;黎稱岑建勳恐嚇劉細良夫婦 並指控岑「當上了中共打手」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在文章稱：「受威嚇的當然不只是我，太多同路人最近在行動上，例如被跟蹤，以及言語上受到威嚇了。例如我有一網紅好友兩夫婦，最近被陳冠中介紹去見一位仁兄。」黎解釋，該「兩夫婦」即是劉細良及其妻，陳冠中則是著名香港作家，現居於北京。黎又稱，劉是他的朋友，也曾經在《蘋果》工作過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章接著指：「這位仁兄獅子頭曾經扮成民主義士，其實一直在為中共做事，今次國安法推出當上了中共打手，關埋門恐嚇了我友人夫婦七小時，最後看到我友人無動於衷，於是只好恐嚇他老婆，以為她是弱者，說他會用黑社會爛仔對付他們，問她想給車撞死還是胸口給插三刀殺死。這些爛仔恐嚇方式簡直匪夷所思，在極權指使下手段有多骯髒，專制濡染下心態是多流氓。其他人遇到的恐嚇遭遇可想而知，又怎怪得有些人驚到馬上搵路走呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，「這位仁兄獅子頭」即是民運人士岑建勳，至於為何說他「為中共做事」、「當上了中共打手」，黎稱只是他自己的指控和猜測。法官李運騰追問黎基於什麼而作出如此指控和猜測？黎回答基於岑的行為，即是恐嚇劉細良夫婦的行為，並僅從中猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎如何得知岑建勳「說他會用黑社會爛仔對付他們，問她想給車撞死還是胸口給插三刀殺死」？黎指是從劉細良口中得知，而他相信劉。法官李運騰問黎，為何岑要恐嚇劉細良夫婦？黎僅回答，為了要他們離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到上述恐嚇內容並非關於中共，黎則堅稱，劉所作所為是為了中共而做，為了威脅劉細良夫婦使他們離開香港。法官杜麗冰追問黎，誰人告訴他岑的行為是為中共而做。黎僅指這是唯一的可能性。法官李運騰問這是否推論？黎同意，並認為劉也有同樣想法。李官又問，劉有否告訴黎，岑的恐嚇是出自中共？黎回答，他與劉均有如此懷疑，二人想法一致，而這個可能性也是合乎邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官另提到，黎在文章稱：「受威嚇的當然不只是我」，問誰人威嚇他？黎則指有朋友告訴他，中共對他而言是一種威脅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳冠中質疑黎信口開河-黎庭上堅稱恐嚇一事真確&quot;&gt;陳冠中質疑黎「信口開河」 黎庭上堅稱恐嚇一事真確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎傳送給何俊仁的訊息：「我寫給所有詢問的朋友：網紅夫婦和獅子頭早就認識，根本不是我介紹拉線的。飯局也是男網紅主動約獅子頭的，然後才通知我。網紅兩夫婦自行上了獅子頭家𥚃吃飯，那天晚上我錄電台節目晚到大概兩個小時，在他們飯後才加入。另有我和網紅都認識的一位媒體朋友更晩才到，他和獅子頭是第一次見面。同場還有獅子頭的一對溫哥華夫婦朋友，完全是局外人。何來恐嚇一舉？這麼多人在場，能恐嚇嗎？誰傳話了？黎智英怎麼會有這麼荒謬的理解？黎智英又為何這般指控獅子頭——這些指控非常嚴重，不容信口開河。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上指，上述文字是由陳冠中撰寫，但他不記得為何轉發了給何。黎被問到「恐嚇了我友人夫婦七小時」一事是否真確，黎則堅稱是真確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章指：「國安惡法條文比我們最壞的預期還要壞，離去的人將會更多，就是留下，有些人也會迴避參與抗爭行列，抗爭群組將會縮小，但無論留下來抗爭的人數多少，我們會頂天立地站起來，成為撐住抗爭堅硬不屈的支柱，也是社會良知的脊樑。」黎庭上解釋，「抗爭」即是參與爭取自由的運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認藉文章意圖煽動&quot;&gt;黎否認藉文章意圖煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在文章寫道：「國安法壓境，很多朋友見面都關心地對我說，Jimmy，小心呀！我說，面對無法無天的中共，你不知幾時『砸界』，你是否犯法，全都按照他們當時需要的權宜而定，是沒法子小心而只好勇敢面對。」，是否與他小心行事的說法有衝突。黎指沒有衝突，因他在文章中的「小心」是指被拘捕一事，也有朋友叫他小心，故此是一個概括的說法，他說既然沒有紅線，「又如何小心？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述下一句：「小心是理性主導，勇氣是信念支持。再小心你都避不過暴力的恐嚇，但有信念支持的勇氣令你頂天立地。」，問這是否黎口中「小心」的意思。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認有意圖藉著文章激使其他人憎恨政府、使用非法手段改變香港現有制度、使用暴力和慫使市民不守法，並強調文章只是談及自己的個人狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is a UK-led, 10-member defence framework focused on northern Europe. In September 2014, at the NATO Wales Summit, the JEF signed its founding Letter of Intent to develop a rapidly deployable force to operate across the full spectrum of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During its first decade, the JEF has made an important contribution to European security. Owing to its design and development, the JEF exhibits several comparative advantages over other European defence and security frameworks: it has political and military leadership, it is flexible and better able to respond to crises, and it has regional expertise and a combined military heft which is increasingly valuable to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and incursion into the Donbas, the JEF participants responded by collectively increasing their defence expenditure so that all members now meet the NATO 2% of GDP target (up from just one member – the UK), and established a command-and-control structure, annual military and ministerial exercises, and interoperability programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF’s established programme of work allowed it to be quick to respond to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It immediately developed a political dimension, through national Leaders’ Summits, which provided a unifying framework to advocate for the defence of Ukraine, pushed for a stronger unified position against Russia, and pressured other NATO members to step up. As such, it has collectively committed more diplomatic, military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine than the rest of non-US NATO members combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these successes, in 2023 the JEF agreed a 10-year vision and with it an ambition to be a key framework within the future European security architecture. Through this vision, and via increased political engagement, the JEF has created expectations for itself, and for UK leadership of the JEF as a European leader within NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its second decade will be far more challenging that the first. European security has dramatically deteriorated since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. While NATO is stronger, with two new members – Finland and Sweden – and ambitious new defence plans, it is operating in a more dangerous and volatile world. Of greatest concern for Europeans is the reliability of the US security commitment to Europe under the second presidency of Donald Trump. The US faces four converging adversaries (China, Russia, Iran and North Korea) across three theatres (the Euro-Atlantic, the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East), with the capacity to prosecute only one major war. At the NATO Washington Summit in July 2024, the Alliance labelled China a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war on Ukraine, while Iran and North Korea have been actively supplying weapons and ammunition to Russia, with North Korea in fact going further and sending an estimated 10,000 troops to counterattack Ukrainian forces in Kursk, Russia. As US priorities shift to the rise of China and its impact on Indo-Pacific security, in the coming years more will be demanded of the UK (as a leading NATO member) and the JEF to contribute to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this geopolitical context, the JEF is at an inflection point. While it can celebrate successes over its first decade – improved interoperability, capability and capacity development, and support to Ukraine – it is yet to be seriously tested politically or operationally. There is a risk that without increased attention and resources the JEF will be unable to deliver on its self-imposed mandate, causing it to atrophy, which would amount to a serious loss of credibility for UK defence and security leadership in Europe. To avoid this outcome, it must be immediately invested in, both politically and militarily. As the new UK government undertakes its Strategic Defence Review, this paper provides recommendations for the UK to strengthen the JEF to increase its value to NATO and best contribute to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF is a political and military power maximiser, and the UK benefits both politically and diplomatically from it – for a modest investment. The JEF provides a defence and security leadership opportunity for the UK alongside like-minded European allies and can draw on valuable military support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JEF members have gained increased UK defence attention and capabilities in northern Europe – which are best able to mitigate shortfalls in the event of US disengagement from Europe – and a seat at the table alongside a geopolitical heavyweight such as the UK, which assigns its nuclear forces to the defence of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since 2014, JEF members have delivered an average real-terms defence expenditure increase of 150%, compared to 108% for the rest of NATO’s European members. However, the UK has delivered the lowest increase. When assistance to Ukraine is measured as a percentage of GDP, while the JEF members come out on top, the UK is ranked ninth of the 10 JEF members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF is a vanguard military grouping within NATO that provides a model for the Europeanisation of the Alliance to increase transatlantic burden-sharing. All JEF members meet or have exceeded both the NATO defence investment pledge of 2% of GDP and the guideline of 20% on equipment expenditure as a share of defence expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support for Ukraine has become a major political output of the JEF. The 10 JEF members have committed $11.1 billion more aid to Ukraine than the 18 remaining European NATO members. When Ukraine assistance is measured as a percentage of GDP (2021 figures), the top 10 countries include eight JEF members.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF is ideally placed to accept the increased burden-sharing that Europe is set to encounter in the coming years, especially following the war in Ukraine and Trump’s re-election.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is a 10-member defence framework that operates within its principal geographic area of interest of the High North, North Atlantic and Baltic Sea regions. It was born out of NATO initiatives and maintains its complementarity with the Alliance – in the sense that JEF activity and policy do not compete with or duplicate those of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the JEF celebrated its 10-year anniversary, and it has agreed on a vision to 2033. It is a prominent, but contested, framework within the European security architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF has its champions (within and outside its membership and across the European security expert community) as a responsive and flexible framework that supports NATO defence and deterrence activities in northern Europe. In its first decade, it has improved interoperability, coordination and coherence across its membership and responded effectively to increased Russian aggression following the invasion of Ukraine. However, the invasion is a catalyst for a severe and potentially long deterioration in European security, and the JEF’s second decade will be much more challenging than its first. It must urgently acknowledge this and strengthen itself accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF also has its detractors within NATO and within the JEF itself. The most dismissive have labelled it a post-Brexit vehicle for UK influence in Europe, despite the JEF being introduced in 2012 – three years before the Brexit referendum was first referenced (in a national security context) in the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review. The JEF has also been described as a regionally focused “NATO lite”, with limited value now that Finland and Sweden have joined the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter this critical narrative and avoid misconceptions it is important that the JEF, led by the UK, reaffirms its value, purpose and potential to bolster European security in the future security environment. Moreover, its communications should be rebalanced towards non-member NATO allies, rather than its internal audience, to increase understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the JEF becomes more political, it is likely to fall victim to growing misperceptions. Despite its ambition and longevity, surprisingly little has been written to date on the JEF, and as such it has almost no public profile. This paper aims to clarify these misunderstandings through an analysis of the core JEF founding documents, alongside interviews with the senior UK military officers who created it and multinational officers who have developed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that the JEF has several comparative advantages over other European defence and security frameworks – its political and military leadership, its flexibility, combined military heft and regional expertise – and that these are likely to become more valuable to European security as it deteriorates in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, the paper argues that European security will demand more of the UK and the JEF in the future as the war in Ukraine continues and the reliability of the US security commitment to Europe is questioned under the second Trump presidency. The JEF is already under-resourced for its ambitions to be, alongside NATO, one of the “enablers of regional security”, and to operate across the whole spectrum of conflict, including “full-spectrum interventions” in its core regions and beyond. The increased level of demand will also raise the risk of the JEF underperforming, leading to a serious loss of credibility for the UK. This risk must be mitigated by an increase in attention and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new UK government has made “reconnecting” and “resetting” relations with European allies and partners central to its foreign policy. The governing Labour Party’s 2024 election manifesto states that it will “rebuild relationships with key European allies, including France and Germany, through increased defence and security co-operation … and seek new bilateral agreements and closer working with Joint Expeditionary Force partners. This will strengthen NATO and keep Britain safe”. As the JEF moves into its second decade, and as the new UK government undertakes its Strategic Defence Review (SDR), it is an opportune moment to re-evaluate and strengthen the JEF. With the risk of war in Europe increasing, the members of the JEF will have to rely on each other more heavily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides recommendations on how to best develop the JEF to increase its value to European security. Its research is based on three questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To what extent does the JEF have comparative advantages over other European defence and security frameworks?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How has the JEF responded to a deteriorating European security situation since Russia’s war on Ukraine, and what might this mean for its future potential?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How should the JEF further adapt to deliver the most value to the UK, its membership, NATO and European security?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper is based on primary and secondary research. First, in June and July 2024 the author conducted a comprehensive review of the JEF policy documentation, principally its founding Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and policy direction, alongside joint statements following JEF meetings. This was complemented by a review of academic literature and European media reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, between June and November 2024 the author conducted 24 semi-structured interviews and consultations (in person and online) with former senior military officers who were heavily involved with the establishment and early development of the JEF, as well as serving UK military officers and civil servants. Interviews with representatives from national ministries of defence and foreign affairs of JEF members and non-JEF NATO allies provided a multinational perspective, to avoid a UK-centric analysis. All interview data has been anonymised to protect the identity of those interviewed, and where interviewees have been named, it is with their full informed consent and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the research was informed by the findings from eight expert-led data-gathering roundtable discussions focused on transatlantic security, held between April 2022 and June 2024 in London, Oslo and Washington, DC. The data gathered from these roundtables has also been anonymised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has three chapters. Chapter I identifies and assesses the advantages of the JEF and makes a comparison with other European defence and security frameworks. Chapter II examines how the JEF has responded to Russia’s war against Ukraine and the subsequent dramatic changes it has driven in European security. Chapter III considers the challenges to the UK, the JEF and European security following the war in Ukraine and the 2024 US presidential election. It provides recommendations for the new UK government for the further development of the JEF to best contribute to European security. The Conclusion argues that the UK must take the opportunity to strengthen the JEF to respond to a deteriorating security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-jefs-value-to-european-security&quot;&gt;I. The JEF’s Value to European Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter assesses the value of the JEF to European security. It identifies and analyses its comparative advantages against those of other European defence and security frameworks through an examination of its design principles, origins and development from 2012 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;origins&quot;&gt;Origins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF was born from overlapping NATO initiatives in the early 2010s. The Alliance’s International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan (2003–14) and Operation Unified Protector – enforcing UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 with regard to Libya (2011) – exposed poor European interoperability, coordination and strike, and capability and resource gaps, partly attributed to austerity effects following the 2008 financial crisis. To address these deficiencies, in 2012 NATO launched its Connected Forces Initiative (CFI) and “Smart Defence” to strengthen the Alliance and collectively drive better value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the then Chief of the Defence Staff, General David Richards, unveiled the JEF in a speech at RUSI, in which he described it as “the core of the UK’s contribution to any military action, whether NATO, coalition or independent” and as being designed to always meet NATO obligations. Russia’s annexation of Crimea and incursions into the Donbas in February 2014 provided the external drivers for the development of the JEF. The NATO Wales Summit later that year launched the Framework Nations Concept (FNC), which was an effort to formalise and enhance the CFI and Smart Defence by establishing a lead country to act as a “hub” that a group of countries could to plug into, and to set standards and drive momentum. The JEF became the UK contribution to the FNC as “a rapidly deployable force capable of conducting the full spectrum of operations, including high intensity operations. It will facilitate the efficient deployment of existing and emerging military capabilities and units”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF is, and always has been, complementary to NATO, which is a core advantage. The early adoption of NATO standards and doctrine as a baseline created a shared commonality on which to build. Following the adoption of the first NATO regional defence plans since the end of the Cold War – which incorporate and amalgamate national defence plans under Article 3 of the Washington Treaty (“individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack”) – there is a much stronger synergy between tactical, operational and strategic defence plans. Under this revised construct, therefore, stronger UK or individual JEF member defence capabilities concurrently strengthen both the JEF and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following comparative advantages stem from the creation and early development of the JEF which, unlike most other European defence and security frameworks, has prioritised flexibility, adaptability and specialisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;like-minded-european-defence-heavyweights&quot;&gt;Like-Minded European Defence Heavyweights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic like-mindedness of JEF members – especially regarding the Russian threat – provides the driver across several metrics for the force’s collective development as a vanguard defence force within NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the JEF is led by the UK, which, unlike France, assigns its nuclear forces to the defence of NATO, thereby extending its nuclear deterrent to JEF member countries. This capability will become more crucial to Europe in the more “unsettled circumstances” for NATO where the US commitment to Europe is assessed as “less reliable”, particularly under the second Trump presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TzTpHe2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Timeline of the JEF’s Development, 2014–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The author, based on a systematic review of the core JEF policy documentation, augmented by author interviews and media sources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the existence of a further decision-making centre contributes to NATO nuclear deterrence by making it harder “for Russia to use nuclear threats to deter the UK … from coming to the aid of an exposed NATO state in a crisis if Moscow knew that they had nuclear forces of their own”. This is especially valuable to JEF members, five of which border Russia, who could become increasingly exposed due to changes in US policy under Trump and Kremlin attempts to use sub-threshold means to isolate vulnerable NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the JEF members collectively outspend their European allies on defence. As of 12 June 2024, all JEF members met or exceeded both the NATO defence investment pledge of 2% of GDP and the guideline of 20% on equipment expenditure as a share of defence expenditure (Iceland is not included in NATO figures, as it has no military). In addition, JEF members have delivered an average real-terms increase of 150% since 2014, compared to 108% for the rest of European NATO members, with Lithuania topping the Alliance chart with an extraordinary 327% increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, readiness is about not only percentages of defence expenditure, but also capabilities that are optimised for war. JEF members operate some of the most sophisticated military capabilities in Europe; for example, five JEF members (the UK, Norway, Finland, Netherlands and Denmark) operate F-35s, out of a total of 11 European air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, they are the biggest supporters of Ukraine in the war against Russia, committing more support by value than the rest of the non-US NATO members combined (see Table 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While JEF members have demonstrated collective leadership on increasing defence expenditure, the UK, as the framework nation lead, has seen the lowest increase of all members since 2014. In 2014, the UK was one of only three allies to meet NATO’s 2% of GDP target and one of eight to meet the 20% guideline on equipment (only four JEF members met this in 2014). Spending analysis thus validates the original FNC construct of having only one central lead to bring allies up to the standard and “shame them” into spending more and spending better. In addition, when support to Ukraine is measured as a percentage of GDP, the UK comes ninth of the 10 JEF members. These figures suggest the UK gets a great deal out of the JEF, politically and diplomatically, as a power maximiser with minimal investment. While this approach might have been sufficient for the JEF’s first decade, the evolving – and more challenging – security environment during its second decade will not be as accommodating. If the UK wants to lead in a world that is more dangerous overall, defence spending must stretch ahead of the other JEF members, and increased investments in the JEF must be made so that it can cope with the additional demands before they arise, enabling it to operate as more than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KkP7U9c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: JEF Defence Expenditure 2014–24 (2015 Prices and Exchange Rates.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf&quot;&gt;NATO, “Defence Expenditure of NATO Countries (2014–2024)”, 17 June 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founding intent for the JEF was to become a formidable military force within Europe – which it now unarguably is. Moreover, the original FNC objective was to “improve the balance of the provision of capabilities between the United States and European Allies” or to improve transatlantic burden-sharing, where the JEF is collectively making a significant contribution. Transatlantic burden-sharing is expected to become a focal point of US policy towards Europe under the next Trump presidency, and the JEF is well placed to demonstrate what has already been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK leadership (through the JEF and bilaterally), combined with Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO, now makes northern Europe a political and military fortress for the Alliance that “would outrank any other European force structure and would help secure both the Eastern and Northern Flank of NATO”. Indeed, northern Europe should now be considered NATO’s “front”, rather than “flank”, as it is likely that increased NATO and Russian exercise and operational activity will be the fulcrum point for conflict between the two, through either deliberate policy or – more likely – miscalculation. Moreover, the US identifies a more accessible Arctic as a focus for strategic competition and that the US must “stand ready to meet the challenge alongside Allies and partners”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the author, Lord Richards said that the concept of the JEF showed prescience on the part of those within the UK system who identified the need to “think beyond Afghanistan” and recognised the growing influences of great power competition and the strategic importance of the Arctic and High North to the UK and NATO. Furthermore, Lord Houghton (Vice Chief of the Defence Staff when thinking around the JEF was initially developed, and latterly Chief of the Defence Staff when the JEF was created) confirmed that the JEF was “undoubtedly prescient”, during an interview with the author, adding that the UK saw more potential for enhancing partnerships with the Nordic and Baltic states and that the JEF “sort of worked” from the outset. Russia’s prioritisation of the Arctic and increased aggression towards Europe have validated this vision, and it was certainly prescient to invest in a flexible framework with like-minded allies who can adapt to the changing security requirements in northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flexibility&quot;&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF framework’s “flexibility by design” consists of three features: it does not require unanimity for operational deployments; it is not backed by a treaty; and it is not a standing force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4 September 2014, the defence ministers of the seven founding members – Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK – signed the JEF Letter of Intent. The founding principle was that the “operational composition of the JEF will be determined by the nature of the tasks and missions it is required to undertake … and that the assignment of forces to the JEF will remain a national decision”. Unlike most other European defence frameworks, the JEF does not require unanimity to operate. Instead, an “opt-in” (also referred to as a “1+1”) mechanism preserves the primacy of sovereign national decisions and legal frameworks, with no obligation for members to contribute forces. The JEF has described the opt-in principle as a “unique advantage”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “come with what you can contribute” mantra was demonstrated in its first operational “test”. In 2014, when an Ebola virus epidemic spread through West Africa, European countries sent teams to assist. The UK led the European response in Sierra Leone (a former UK colony where the UK had intervened in the latter stages of a civil war in 2000 through Operation Palliser) under the JEF banner. The operation received contributions from Denmark (airlift and medical staff), the Netherlands (His Netherlands Majesty’s Ship Karel Doorman) and Norway (airlift and medical staff). The Baltic states, in order to focus on the increased Russian threat following the annexation of Crimea, chose not to contribute capabilities. This operation emphasised the deployability of the JEF, which happened in its first year and before it reached Interim Operating Capability (IOC). This contrasts with other frameworks, such as the EU Battlegroups Concept or the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), which have never deployed, either due to a lack of political will, an inability to make a timely decision, or a lack of military capability (see Table 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flexibility makes the JEF an ideal “first responder”, able to operate with fewer constraints than NATO in sub-threshold activity below Article 4, and to “act while NATO is thinking” during Article 5 consultations at the North Atlantic Council (NAC). The 2018 MoU confirmed the JEF’s ability to deploy 10,000 troops, with supporting logistics and enablers. As a demonstration of the JEF’s ambition, a deployment of that size would be double what the EU plans to do by 2025 under the Rapid Deployment Capacity, and approximately half the size of NATO’s Allied Reaction Force (ARF – formerly the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, which has replaced the NATO Response Force (NRF)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complementarity of the JEF to NATO means it should not be directly compared with NATO operational forces, but rather viewed as a valuable addition. The ARF is a rotational standing force, assigned to NATO and under the direct command and control (C2) of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). Traditionally, NATO reaction forces would require a unanimous decision by the NAC to deploy. However, in 2023, the NAC delegated authority to SACEUR to deploy the ARF, significantly increasing the speed of response, and therefore becoming much more flexible and deployable in a crisis, diluting some of the JEF’s advantage in this area. This should also act as a warning to the JEF that if its comparative advantages are not maximised, they can be diminished as other frameworks adapt to the security environment. The JEF’s activity could also be viewed as being potentially less escalatory than NATO and therefore as having a wider utility. However, it is likely that such an analysis only mirrors Western views of escalation and deterrence, as there are few signs that Russia makes the distinction between the JEF and NATO, or between NATO and the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions similarly require the unanimity of 27 members to deploy. As a result, the EU has a poor track record of acting quickly, and it is for this reason that “Act” is the first of four pillars of the 2022 EU Strategic Compass – to remedy previous failings. Since 2007, the EU has had 18 multinational battlegroups, three of which are held at high readiness on rotation, but they have never deployed, despite the demand. However, measures to improve the ability to act, such as the introduction of qualified majority voting within the CSDP, or using Article 44.4 of the Treaty of the European Union to create EU coalitions of the willing, do not have broad political support within the EU. Either option would also require a unanimous vote for reform, and it is therefore unlikely that they would pass. Moreover, the increasing political fractiousness of the EU on foreign policy and defence could also paralyse CSDP operations in the future, as “spoilers”, such as Hungary, have a greater ability to block consensus within the EU than they do in NATO. The like-mindedness and size of the JEF mitigates this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other minilateral and bilateral European defence and security frameworks exhibit some, but not all, of the JEF’s advantages. It is unfair to directly compare some of these frameworks – such as Nordic Defence Cooperation (NORDEFCO) – to the JEF, as they are designed for a different purpose, and mutually supportive to the JEF. However, it is important to acknowledge that the JEF was the most ambitious of the three FNCs from the outset and has a higher level of ambition than other frameworks. Its collaboration within the crucial functional areas of intelligence, operations, plans and capacity development give it greater value and utility than other frameworks. This is demonstrated by the fact that it had its first operational deployment in the year it was created, before it had achieved IOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flexibility of the JEF offers more benefits than just operations. The JEF is a smaller and more agile framework than NATO or the EU, and these characteristics are advantageous for innovation and capability development. As a more recent addition to the European security architecture, the JEF is unconstrained by bulky legacy processes or large and unwieldy staffs. It can thus be a “a test bed for operational, doctrinal, and technical innovation”. Across the JEF members there is a wealth of experience, including in “sub-threshold competition, whole-of-government integration, and whole-society resilience”. It can create its own bespoke rules and regulations, based on the needs of its smaller membership, and “overcome long-established peacetime procurement processes which are optimised for platform-focused equipment programmes, rather than delivering agile software and technology enhancements”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is demonstrating the strategic importance of battlefield innovation, which NATO countries must maximise. JEF members are among the most technologically mature countries within NATO that can maximise innovation, as in the requirement resulting from the war in Ukraine. Moreover, the product of the innovation can be realised at the JEF level or, once the concept is proven, scaled to NATO level or even the EU, in a quicker timeframe through a “JEF Digital” initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-single-framework-lead&quot;&gt;A Single Framework Lead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central innovation of the FNC was to have a strong single framework lead around which the rest of the membership can coalesce. This innovation presented the UK with an opportunity to strengthen its NATO commitments, to demonstrate defence and security leadership, and to build on significant operational experience alongside European forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, across operations in Afghanistan (2001–14) and Iraq (2003–11), the UK had commanded Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Lithuanian and Norwegian troops – troops from five of the seven founding members of the JEF. This hard-fought shared operational experience under UK command was too valuable to be allowed to atrophy, and the like-mindedness and cultural synergies were strong foundations to build on. Second, the UK, alongside France, led the European NATO contingent as “framework nations” in Bosnia, Kosovo and Libya, due to their expeditionary capabilities and mindset. Third, the UK had contributed to the EU Battlegroups concept since 2007, including a sovereign UK task force and a separate joint Anglo-Dutch unit. Last, the UK had strong bilateral military relationships with JEF members, such as extensive UK 3 Commando Brigade cooperation with the Norwegian military and the UK–Netherlands Amphibious Force, which has operated since 1973.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK C2 experience and maturity is valuable to Europe. By 2015, the JEF had reached IOC with the signing of the Foundation MoU, which advanced the structure and operation of the JEF, including staffing, funding, administration and support. It also established the JEF C2 structure, with the UK’s Standing Joint Force Headquarters (SJFHQ) becoming the permanent 2* operational headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SJFHQ was created to bring the JEF together as an entity, give it an operational identity and align it more closely to NATO. In an interview with the author, Stuart Skeates, SJFHQ’s first commander, described its ambition to be a fully deployable headquarters focusing on a specific problem set and a geographically bounded area of operations. At the time, NATO had not completed the process of building its defence and deterrence strategy and so there was a gap in the sub-threshold and deterrence space that the JEF was designed to fill. Moreover, the JEF gave the option to “swing in behind the US in support of NATO” within an established C2 structure. This is particularly valuable for JEF members – which each have strong bilateral relations with the US through separate defence cooperation agreements and are committed transatlanticists – as it provides a complete and trusted mechanism to support the US independently of NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasts directly with the UK–France CJEF, which has developed alongside the JEF, and which is also commanded from SJFHQ. A product of the Lancaster House Treaty of 2010, it is mission specific and not a standing force. However, the CJEF has been described as “a military solution to a political problem rather than a response to military need”. The political (rather than military) logic has made the CJEF a very limited framework, and one that has also had to operate in the context of a deterioration in bilateral relations following Brexit. Moreover, its C2 structure – one UK and one French unit (battlegroup or brigade) operating alongside each other – creates military and political frictions, with no overall commander, which goes against military command logic. This is demonstrated by the fact that after 14 years, and four years since it reached FOC, the CJEF still has not deployed, despite the demand and opportunity in the Sahel (2013–22), Kabul (2021) and Khartoum (2023) evacuations, or in supporting NATO deterrence and defence activities in the Euro-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regional-strength-and-expertise&quot;&gt;Regional Strength and Expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian threat to northern Europe is severe across all domains, but is especially so in the maritime and nuclear spheres, given that the region is home to Russia’s strategic nuclear forces and its prestige Northern Fleet. The July 2022 Maritime Doctrine of the Russian Federation declared the ambition to become a “great maritime power” and identified NATO and the US as central existential threats. The Arctic is explicitly a focus for strategic competition, and the combat capabilities of the Northern Fleet have grown to meet this. With its conventional forces severely weakened in Ukraine, Russia is highly likely to use hybrid and nuclear signalling to achieve its objectives in northern Europe. Combined with growing Russia–China cooperation, and a focus on strategic competition, the Arctic is likely to be a flashpoint for a wider conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF’s maritime focus matches the primary Russian threat, and its regional expertise and specialisms enable it to act as a bridge between national defence plans – under Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty (“maintain and develop … individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack”) – and the new NATO regional plans adopted at the 2023 Vilnius Summit. Moreover, UK and JEF interests and engagement straddle the NATO regional plans for the “Atlantic and European Arctic” and “the Baltic and Central Europe”, creating greater synergies, addressing seams and handoffs between the plans, and improving mutually reinforcing responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying defence principle of regional specialisation is as “old as NATO itself”. Regionalisation featured in the first 1949 Strategic Concept and was developed through the Cold War into five geographic regional planning groups (RPGs), which included northern Europe, so that “each nation should undertake the task, or tasks, for which it is best suited”. The 2014 FNC restated the principle of regionalisation to “work multinationally for the joint development of forces and capabilities required by the Alliance, facilitated by a framework nation … based on regional ties”. However, regionalisation is a contested concept within NATO and the “360-degree security approach” – geographically and by domain challenges – agreed at the 2016 Warsaw Summit serves a political rather than military logic, where blocs within NATO are discouraged. Here, the possibility of discord within the Alliance arises, where the JEF can be dismissed as a regional bloc or “NATO lite” within northern Europe, especially now that all members are also NATO members. However, this paper argues that the JEF has a growing value to northern Europe, and by extension NATO, and is more than the sum of its parts. However, it is ultimately the JEF’s responsibility to successfully make this argument within the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-utility&quot;&gt;Political Utility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF has political utility for both the UK and its European members. The JEF is not just a defence framework; it has developed a significant political dimension (see Chapter II). In 2021, the JEF Policy Direction substantially advanced the JEF by establishing the strategic policy and political context. To deal with the assessed increase in strategic competition, it invited “greater political and policy input into JEF governance mechanisms”. At the time, the principal governance structures were all military – chiefs of defence, MoD permanent secretaries, and JEF defence policy and military directors’ (2*) meetings. As such, the input from member countries’ ministries of foreign affairs was minimal, as was political engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the JEF is a power maximiser and, since Brexit, it has allowed the UK to demonstrate leadership and engage with Europe on defence and security, independently of NATO in a flexible way that serves its strategic culture. For its membership, the JEF has helped successfully bind the UK closer to the continent, and northern Europe in particular, where its military and diplomatic strengths are of most value, especially given the risk of US disengagement from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The establishment and development of the JEF made it a prominent and effective responder to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The next chapter assesses how the JEF has responded to the war in Ukraine and the significant changes it has driven in European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-jefs-response-to-russias-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;II. The JEF’s Response to Russia’s War in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has accelerated the JEF’s opportunity to realise its ambitions and increase its value to European security. This chapter considers how the JEF has responded to the war, within the context of NATO and UK leadership. It covers two areas of major development – the JEF’s growing political dimension and the focus on countering sub-threshold aggression in its core regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;european-security-following-russias-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;European Security Following Russia’s War in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s 2022 large-scale invasion of Ukraine has shattered the European security architecture. It has driven the largest transformation of the NATO Alliance since the Cold War, including a new Strategic Concept, a new “family of defensive plans” and a significantly hardened defensive posture. Defence spending has increased to meet this ambition, with 23 allies projected to meet or exceed the NATO 2% of GDP target in 2024, up from just three in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside Ukraine and Russia, northern Europe has arguably experienced the most fundamental change as a result of the war. The addition of Finland and Sweden as NATO members has transformed the region as a strategic space. The Alliance’s land border with Russia has doubled and its land area of operations has expanded by 866,000 square kilometres, while its maritime presence and control in the Baltic Sea has also increased. The UK and the JEF have played a significant role. First, the UK signed political declarations with both Finland and Sweden to protect them during the NATO accession process. Mutual security guarantees of this nature are not agreed lightly, and the speed with which these were completed is testament to the JEF and the ever-closer bilateral relationships between the UK and other JEF members. Second, the JEF adopted NATO interoperability standards at its inception, giving Finland and Sweden the opportunity to come closer to NATO, and as such the JEF acted as a stepping stone into the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the war in Ukraine prompted a “refresh” of its defence, security and foreign policy. March 2023’s Integrated Review Refresh (IR2023) concluded that “the most pressing national security and foreign policy priority in the short-to-medium term is to address the threat posed by Russia to European security … and denying Russia any strategic benefit from its invasion”. Underpinning this ambition, the IR2023 committed the UK to “lead and galvanise where we have most value to add, giving particular priority … to the contribution we can make in northern Europe as a security actor”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, as a nuclear-armed geopolitical heavyweight with a geostrategic position in the North Atlantic, and with specialist capabilities – such as sub-sea, ISR and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) – can effectively counter Russian malign activity and act as a significant backstop to the US presence in the region. It can galvanise allies through NATO, through the JEF and bilaterally. Interviewees suggested that the format for UK engagement matters less than the substance of the agreements and how they are resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s strategic prioritisation of northern Europe has naturally evolved since the early 2010s, and it is so central to UK interests that it is highly likely that this focus will be reaffirmed in the next SDR. As climate change gradually starts to link the UK’s primary and secondary “strategic areas” of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, this interest will only increase. However, without a commensurate increase in resources to deal with these growing challenges, there is a risk that the gap will widen between the UK’s policy commitments and military resources, which will also have an impact on the JEF’s ability to deliver on its stated missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-jef-response-to-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The JEF Response to the War in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF’s activity in the 18 months following the Russian invasion increased eightfold compared with the preceding eight years. This included deploying its headquarters to Iceland and the Baltic states, dispersing multinational liaison officers throughout Europe, increasing exercises, and deploying military forces to strengthen critical underwater infrastructure (CUI) protection after JEF defence ministers activated Joint Response Option (JRO) 3.2 for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, volume of activity, rather than the effect, is a poor metric for success. The JEF’s brand and identity allow bilateral or modest cooperative activity to easily be “badged” as JEF activity, which inflates the data, making the JEF appear more active and effective than it is. What matters most is also the most difficult thing to measure: Russia’s response and reaction. Russia did react to the JRO 3.2 activation (which contributed to NATO deterrence in the region), rather than to a sole JEF activity. However, a scan of prominent Russian Telegram channels and media sources returns only very brief mentions of the JEF. Moreover, no Russian politician has referenced the JEF, and no opinion pieces have been written on it, leading to the conclusion that Russia barely notices it, or does not distinguish between the JEF and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Distinct Political Dimension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shock of the scale and brutality of Russia’s war against Ukraine was a catalyst to accelerate the greater political and policy input that was requested in the 2021 Policy Direction. The JEF held its first-ever leaders’ call the day after the invasion, and its first “Leaders’ Summit” within three weeks, in London, attended virtually by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the flexibility, decisiveness and value of the JEF, and, given that UK officials had thought a leaders’ meeting through the JEF as a framework was “unthinkable” before the war, this demonstrated its ability to rapidly adapt to an unprecedented security situation. Leaders’ meetings are now an annual feature of JEF governance, alongside regular meetings of national security advisers, further expanding the format outside national ministries of defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increase in scope and attention creates a tension of governance. The 2018 MoU began to expand the JEF away from a defence-centric framework with the commitment to be “combined, joint and interagency by design”, with the acknowledgement that “other levers of government” and the private sector are required to address the challenge of sub-threshold competition and to “maximise JEF integrated effect”. The focus on CUI demands increased private sector input and integration, as most of the infrastructure and surveillance coverage are commercially owned. Interviewees suggested that although the JEF was set up to be interagency by design and wanted more private sector involvement, these are areas that need improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase its effectiveness, therefore, the JEF needs to expand outside defence and become more prominent across member governments. However, if it becomes too expansive, some of its flexibility and decisiveness could be lost in the quest for cross-departmental consensus. In interviews for this paper, it was clear that there were differing views between military and diplomatic officials, with some of the latter only really engaging with the JEF from 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition, concern was raised that increased political attentiveness could directly and indirectly increase ambitions, but not necessarily resources. Official defence interviewees were already concerned about overstretched resources before the JEF tempo increased to respond to increased Russian aggression. However, it could also be argued that the JEF has already achieved a great deal with only modest and organic resourcing – proving the validity of the original logic behind its creation. This would also suggest that the power maximiser effect of the JEF is significant and that any increase in resource directed towards the JEF will also be maximised and provide a greater collective effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Support for Ukraine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for Ukraine has become a major political output of the JEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VBMZWO0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: Comparison of JEF and European NATO Support to Ukraine by Volume of Economic, Military and Humanitarian Assistance, as of October 2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author calculations based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/ukraine-support-tracker-data-20758/&quot;&gt;A Antezza et al., “Ukraine Support Tracker Data”, Kiel Institute for the World Economy, August 2024 (excluding Albania and North Macedonia, which are not included in the dataset)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Ukraine assistance is measured as a percentage of GDP (2021 figures), the top 10 countries include eight JEF members. By the time of the 2024 NATO Washington Summit, 17 of the 34 G7 bilateral security agreements with Ukraine (committed to following the 2023 NATO Vilnius Summit) had been signed, eight of which are with JEF members – all ahead of the US. The final two JEF members’ agreements were both in advanced negotiation stages at the Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support for Ukraine is also qualitatively impressive. Many JEF countries have provided more critical capabilities, more quickly, and through close engagement between members. For example, Denmark and the Netherlands have led on the F-16 fighter coalition, while Sweden has donated two Saab Airborne Surveillance and Control aircraft, which will greatly enhance the F-16s’ combat ability and compound their advantages. Elsewhere, the UK has partnered with Norway on the Maritime Capability coalition and with Latvia on the Drone Capability coalition, making best use of country specialisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, the JEF seems to operate in a similar way to its military 1+1 mechanism. The UK was the main signatory of the 2023 Tallinn Pledge – the first joint statement to fully commit to “expelling Russian forces from Ukrainian soil” – alongside nine other European countries, of which six are JEF members. Therefore the JEF can collectively apply pressure and keep each member honest on the delivery of commitments, in addition to pushing other European states to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for Ukraine has also helped to drive intra-JEF cooperation through the previously mentioned capability coalitions and through training programmes. Operation Interflex, the UK-led military training mission for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), also supports external cooperation and political partnerships. It includes 14 countries (half of which are JEF members), including Indo-Pacific powers such as Australia and New Zealand, which share security interests in Ukraine and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF is limited by what it can offer Ukraine militarily, outside of supplying arms and training AFU troops. The 2023 JEF Visby declaration invited Ukraine to observe JEF exercises in 2024 and 2025 so as to increase interoperability and capability development. While politically supportive, the declaration has little military utility for either side – Ukraine does not operate in the JEF core regions, has very limited maritime capabilities, and cannot share the troops. Nonetheless, Ukraine has become the crucible of wartime innovation, where the potential of the JEF as a “test bed” is significant, and this factor must be exploited as soon as possible to best prepare JEF members for a potential war against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees unanimously expressed the view that JEF support to Ukraine should remain as advocacy and as a guiding principle to galvanise commitments and increase pressure on JEF members and non-member allies to do more. They were concerned that the JEF should not adopt a more formal role, due to an already complex support architecture, through the Ramstein format, NATO and the EU – to avoid duplication and maximise effort. None of the 24 interviewees advocated for JEF membership to be extended to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optimising for Sub-Threshold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine and the resulting war of attrition have severely weakened its conventional fighting power, increasing its reliance on sub-threshold aggression. Attacks and incidents on CUI (not all attributed to Russia) have already become more overt and disruptive to the functioning of NATO societies, including underwater cables between Svalbard and Norway, two Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea, and the Baltic Connector data and energy links between Finland and Estonia, where the JEF deployed a maritime task group in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To respond to this challenge, the JEF is reorienting towards protecting critical national infrastructure, and particularly CUI, through increased cooperation, surveillance and exercising, as an added layer of protection for its members. In December 2023, the JEF activated JRO 3.2 for the first time, which was immediately built on through the June 2024 Exercise Nordic Warden, consisting of 30 ships from the full 10 members, to intensify cooperation, increase surveillance and monitor vessels of interest in order to deter any sabotage attempts. It supported the annual NATO Baltic Operations (BALTOPS) exercise in the region, demonstrating the seamless interoperability with NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While valuable, the JEF is operating in an increasingly congested space, with challenges regarding ownership, governance, legislation and duplication of effort. CUI protection is first and foremost a national prerogative under NATO’s Article 3. It is also a multinational responsibility for NATO, which has created two new organisations – the Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, at its headquarters in Brussels, and the Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell (to coordinate allied activity by bringing together military and civilian stakeholders) at its Maritime Command (MARCOM) at Northwood, UK. In addition, the EU’s resilience agenda under its Strategic Compass provides another layer, along with the EU Hybrid Toolbox (including the Hybrid Fusion Cell and new Hybrid Rapid Response Teams) and new maritime strategy and expanded directive on CUI. There is also an EU–NATO Task Force on Resilience of Critical Infrastructure. These enhancements have all occurred since the Nord Stream sabotage, despite UK officials warning of the threat five years earlier. Indeed, the 2021 Policy Direction highlights the increased demands of countering sub-threshold activity in all domains, and Exercise Joint Protector in 2021 had already started to focus more on sub-threshold interoperability. With NATO’s new military strategy and the Defence and Deterrence of the Euro-Atlantic Area, it was gradually hardening its conventional defence posture, so the JEF, to be complementary, focused on sub-threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick Zandee and Adája Stoetman have suggested that in this contested space, the JEF should become a “gap filler” or “security bridge” between national and multinational frameworks, and between NATO and EU efforts. As the JEF is not tied to the rules and regulations of either NATO or the EU, it has more options to respond. It is also an ideal framework to civilianise the response, but it could slow the response capability of the JEF if it becomes too cross-departmental and bureaucracy increases. Zandee and Stoetman conclude that a lack of consensus makes it more important to define more clearly the roles and functions in the hybrid domain, and therefore a mission statement on the exact contribution it will make to hybrid is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Jim Morris, former commander of SJFHQ, explained during an interview that the JEF’s persistent Joint Integration Options (JIO) and proactive JROs were specifically developed to operationalise and cohere national options and responses together as “integrated military activities”. He dismissed the idea that this was merely “badging” extant or bilateral activity and argued that they have developed a genuinely cohered response and provide options for the future based on multiple scenarios. Moreover, he argued that NATO responses were linear and could only gradually move up the escalation ladder as each response was agreed and activated, but the flexibility and speed of the JEF allowed it to use JROs to provide additional deterrence effect in the right place and at the right time. This is consistent with the intent in the 2023 Defence Command Paper “to provide an additional tier of defence, security and stability” to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also limitations to this approach. The JEF chose not to directly respond following the Nord Stream attacks, as any response operation would have needed to include Germany because of its pipeline ownership and position as a major Baltic Sea power with 1,000 kilometres of Baltic coastline. Germany is increasing its maritime role in the Baltic Sea through hosting NATO’s Baltic Maritime Component Command (BMCC), which would make closer German and JEF maritime cooperation more important to support the JROs and JIOs. The JEF could also benefit from the growing bilateral UK and Germany defence cooperation under the Trinity House Agreement, which could enhance coordination between the UK-commanded MARCOM and SJFHQ, and Germany’s command of the BMCC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a major challenge for the JEF is how to operate within the Baltic Sea with Germany, and Poland, on the outside. Moreover, in April 2024, a new agreement was signed between Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK (four of which are JEF members) to protect CUI across the North Sea countries. The fact that the signatories thought that an additional agreement was required, covering a JEF area of focus and a region in which it operates, suggests that its role is ill defined and not fully accepted in Europe. Most recently, on 17 November 2024 – while the JEF was on Exercise Joint Protector 24 in Latvia – two undersea internet cables (one between Finland and Germany and one between Sweden and Lithuania) were damaged. The Yi Peng 3, a Chinese-flagged vessel, is suspected of dragging its anchor to damage the cable, which echoes the New new Polar Bear’s actions during the 2023 Baltic Connector incident. At the time of writing, the Yi Peng 3 was anchored in international waters between Denmark and Sweden, refusing requests by the latter to move into Swedish waters to support investigators. Thus far, there has been no public statement on the JEF and no JRO activated, with individual members responding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shaping-strategy&quot;&gt;Shaping Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central weakness of the JEF’s role of becoming a gap filler or strategic bridge is that it is outsourcing strategy to external organisations. Moreover, those gaps are likely to change over time, providing less control over JEF development for its members. The JEF aspires to operate across the spectrum of conflict, but it is becoming squeezed at both ends as NATO returns to defence and deterrence as a priority at the higher end, while, at the other end, sub-threshold (particularly CUI protection) becomes an increasingly congested area where the JEF’s role is unclear, despite increased effort. Since the JEF’s reorientation to CUI protection, it has not dropped its objective of operating for high-intensity intervention or warfighting with a force of up to 10,000. The JEF has developed iteratively, initially with the Letter of Intent, then various MoUs, the 2021 Policy Direction and latterly the JEF vision. This has led to the JEF adding tasks, rather than making an honest appraisal of how new responsibilities have an impact on existing ones. A JEF strategy would help define its purpose, value and role better, especially to non-member allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, the JEF now has a fully functioning political level, and operational and tactical level cooperation is delivered through the JIOs, JROs and exercising. The JEF strategic level, therefore, appears to be missing. Greater political interest in the JEF is an opportunity to better define a strategic level, especially in anticipation of demand increasing over the course of the next decade as European security deteriorates and the US leaves gaps in European capabilities in northern Europe. The next chapter explores how the JEF can further develop to meet this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-jef-and-the-future-of-european-security&quot;&gt;III. The JEF and the Future of European Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines the imminent challenges to the UK and the JEF within the context of a deteriorating European security environment and uncertainty about US commitment and posture. It provides recommendations to the new UK government – as it undertakes its SDR – on how best to strengthen the JEF and increase its value to European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-context&quot;&gt;The Strategic Context&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is becoming more dangerous and volatile, with a convergence of threats emanating from an “axis of authoritarian states” – Russia, China, Iran and North Korea – which are actively challenging the rules-based international order. These threats are becoming more interlinked, with China now designated a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war against Ukraine, and Iran and North Korea actively supplying significant lethal aid. Russia’s war against Ukraine has shattered the European security architecture, which is experiencing its most serious crisis since the end of the Cold War, and longstanding pillars of European security are being undermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the European security architecture has gradually, and then suddenly, deteriorated, alongside a near total erosion of the arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation architecture that has contributed to strategic stability on the European continent since the Second World War. The extent of the degradation of this architecture means that a redesign, rather than reform, might be required, leading to bolder changes to tackle greater challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is growing concern over the reliability of the US security commitment to Europe. President-elect Donald Trump’s public statements of ambivalence towards NATO and intention to pressure Ukraine towards negotiations with Russia are already causing concern in European capitals. Amid the convergence of threats and growing strategic power competition, the US faces four adversaries across three theatres (the Euro-Atlantic, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific), but has the capacity to fight only one major war. US strategic interests will continue to shift towards Asia and the “pacing threat” of China, with US attention and assets in Europe following. Consequently European NATO (and Canada) will need to do far more for defence and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic and to maintain support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, war with Russia is a realistic possibility. NATO’s 2010 Strategic Concept stated that “the Euro-Atlantic area is at peace and the threat of a conventional attack against NATO territory is low”, whereas its 2022 version assesses that the “the Euro-Atlantic area is not at peace … and we cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity”. NATO and member state assessments of when they will be ready for war range between three and seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this global context, the JEF is at an inflection point. It has made a growing contribution to northern European security over the past decade, but it is yet to be tested politically or militarily in a strategic crisis-management scenario. Its growing political dimension has also made the framework too big to fail, as such a failure would mean a serious loss of credibility and trust in UK leadership in Europe. To navigate the remainder of the decade, European security will demand much more from the UK and the JEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strategic imperative, and one that the UK cannot afford to miss. And, as the new Labour government completes its SDR, it also constitutes an opportunity. UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey has directed a “NATO first” defence policy and will apply a “NATO test” to all UK defence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new NATO defence plans and Article 3, and given the complementarity of the JEF to NATO, a “NATO test” is also a “JEF test”, and the latter should feature prominently in the SDR. The war in Ukraine has exposed the UK’s “hollowed out” forces and military deficiencies, especially in terms of readiness for high-intensity warfighting at scale. As the JEF is a power maximiser for the UK, in the short term it can provide the UK with additional diplomatic and military support to get the UK ready earlier. Indeed, the UK is already relying on NATO and JEF allies to cover critical capabilities. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary Victoria – the UK’s sole solid support ship – is to be placed on long-term layup due to a lack of trained crew, making the Royal Navy wholly reliant on allied and partner navies for logistics support to operations, with the Royal Norwegian Navy providing support to sea trials, and possibly having to provide support on the next UK carrier strike group deployment to the Indo-Pacific in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establishing a Distinct Role in the Northern European Security Architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within such a reconfiguration of European security, there is an opportunity for the JEF to establish itself fully and to more clearly define a distinct role within the security architecture of Northern Europe. To achieve this, several interviewees suggested that the JEF should ask NATO precisely what this role should be – as it derives its legitimacy from the Alliance – even if it did not necessarily like the answer. This would also have the added advantage of engaging non-member allies directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step, the core JEF documentation should be revised, as it does not reflect the significant changes in European security brought about by Russia’s 2022 large-scale invasion of Ukraine, nor the likely future demands on the JEF. A refreshed JEF Policy Direction, MoUs and JEF vision should therefore be consolidated into an all-domain and cross-department “JEF strategy”, to include the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 2021 Policy Direction states that: “The JEF is not directed towards any particular country or actor” when, just four months earlier, the UK’s Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy had labelled Russia as the “most acute threat” to Euro-Atlantic security. Russia should be called out as the primary threat, in all domains, so as to support NATO defence and deterrence activities, align with the UK government, and mitigate the tendency in Europe towards self-deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The principal geographic areas of interests of the JEF are the High North, and the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea regions. The Arctic is not explicitly included, despite growing Russian military activity, growing Russia–China cooperation, and six of the JEF’s 10 members also being members of the Arctic Council (alongside the US and Russia). Including the Arctic would create greater synergy with US, NATO and UK policy, and also provide the UK with greater permission and opportunities to engage. Although US strategic interests are increasingly dominated by the “pacing threat” of China, they do not solely manifest themselves within the Indo-Pacific. The 2024 US Department of Defense Arctic Strategy relies heavily on working with allies and partners “to preserve the Arctic as a secure and stable region in which the U.S. Homeland is defended and our vital national interests are safeguarded”. Therefore, more UK and JEF engagement in the Arctic would benefit the US, and it is also an area where Europe can best keep the US engaged in European security – given the region’s centrality to US national security – and is a focal point for greater Russia–China cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A mission statement should be agreed, alongside NATO and the EU, that clearly defines the role of the JEF in protecting CUI and countering hybrid operations in northern Europe, alongside collaborative mechanisms to ensure all of the organisations develop in a complementary way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While the JEF has more recently chosen to concentrate on sub-threshold and CUI protection, the extant policies and MoU still commit the JEF to a range of operations, including warfighting, collective defence and deterrence, and full-spectrum conflict interventions. With NATO’s hardening of its defence posture since 2022, the role of the JEF in supporting conventional deterrence and defence also needs clarification, with reference to NATO’s Article 4 (territorial integrity, political independence or security threats), Article 5 and DDA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF vision should be revised to become forward looking rather than reaffirming past activities and commitments, and describe what the JEF should look like in 2035, with reference to a vision statement, mission statements, a unifying purpose and significant delivery milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The accession of Finland and Sweden to the Alliance has created a C2 headache for NATO’s command structure and a challenge in how to balance the requirements of the Nordic and Baltic states under the “Atlantic and European Arctic” (North) and the “Baltic and Central Europe” (East) NATO regional plans, with the need to be mutually reinforcing and supporting. Despite progress in this area, NATO C2 requirements are constantly evolving in response to the situation and several obstacles remain in operationalising the enlargement of the Alliance and in supporting the Nordic states to rebuild their warfighting capabilities. The UK and the US can help reduce these obstacles and maximise the opportunities of a united Nordic region within NATO. The July 2023 UK Defence Command Paper refresh stated that “as the Alliance looks to welcome in two new members, the UK will also lead the collaboration amongst Allies to shape a revised Control and Command structure, with a specific focus on Northern Europe – the regional area of greatest importance to our homeland defence”. As the NATO command structure continues to evolve, the UK’s C2 structures and maturity – both through SJFHQ and MARCOM – make it an ideal lead for any command reform across northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Duplication of JEF activity should be deconflicted and removed from that of the Northern Group of Defence Ministers. A process for both frameworks to work better together, alongside Nordic Defence Cooperation, should be designed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JEF and the Europeanisation of NATO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans stepping up on Euro-Atlantic security is often referred to as the “Europeanisation” or “European pillar” of NATO. However, this concept is ill-defined among allies, with little consensus in Europe on the scale, pace and methods required, despite the obvious need.129 While Europe as a whole is deciding what to do and what approach to take, the JEF can lead by example, as a vanguard force within the Alliance, in further augmenting European defence. As articulated in Chapter I, the JEF’s distinct advantages and military strengths provide a model for the Europeanisation of NATO and can guide the process in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a strong politico-military regional bloc within NATO which provides a serious offer to defence and deterrence, alongside transatlantic burden-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a united “pressure group” within NATO to push itself and other allies to increase defence spending, increase readiness, invest in critical capabilities, and be stronger and more united in dealing with Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As a model for other groups of states to replicate regionally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeanisation involves more than just military capabilities. NATO currently operates a “360-degree” security approach – the belief that all allies should be able to operate in all regions and all domains – but this is only possible when backed by strong US leadership. If the US disengages, no single European power, or groups, can fill the vacuum. Therefore, an update to the RPG model and increased regionalisation might be the only way to keep NATO together in a configuration that is close to its current form. This would work best in northern Europe, due to the challenging operating environment, and, rather than undermine the 360-degree approach, increased regionalisation could be a strength. The JEF is an ideal model and there are options to replicate it geographically and thematically within Europe, provided countries step up to lead new groupings. This process would further inform the tasks to which the JEF should commit in northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JEF Military Tasks in Northern Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF can provide more value to the UK, the US and NATO in northern Europe by seeking inspiration from NATO’s 1949 Strategic Concept and the direction that “each nation should undertake the task, or tasks, for which it is best suited … while certain nations, because of geographic location or because of their capabilities, will appropriate specific missions”. The JEF should offer itself up to NATO and the US as a strategic enabler in four areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept states: “In the High North, Russia’s capability to disrupt Allied reinforcements and freedom of navigation across the North Atlantic is a strategic challenge to the Alliance”. As a warming climate opens the Northern Sea Route and links the Euro-Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific, there will be significant economic potential for Europe. The US and Canada, which already have Asia-facing ports and routes via the Northwest Passage and the Pacific Ocean, have little incentive to provide sea lines of communication (SLOCs) protection and freedom of navigation operations for the economic benefit of Europe. The JEF should accept this mission on behalf of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JEF members are the primary beneficiaries of US transatlantic reinforcements. All Nordic and Baltic national defence plans can be summarised as fighting the “first battle” and holding Russian forces until US reinforcements arrive. It is also highly likely that any UK strategic reserve will fight on JEF territory. The UK’s strategic position within the North Atlantic and its theatre ASW capabilities make it a key enabler of transatlantic reinforcement. Therefore, the assurance of NATO’s transatlantic reinforcement plan could be a specific offer the JEF could make to the Alliance and the US, making a significant contribution to burden sharing and NATO defence planning, and ensuring that the US is further tied to northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The JEF should commit to persistent operations in its core regions and move from exercises to mission rehearsals, using live intelligence, situational awareness and greater connectivity that can scale to the immediate threat, instead of annual “set piece” exercises, such as the Joint Protector series. Russia is persistently operating in all domains against northern Europe. As any of these incidents could quickly escalate into an Article 4 or 5 situation, and as this is precisely where the JEF’s flexibility is a main advantage, it needs to be able to scale at a moment’s notice. While the JEF focus might be on CUI protection, it still aspires to operate across the spectrum of conflict and therefore it should rehearse conventional deployments, in credible strength, to have a real deterrence effect. This should include an increased ability to conduct information operations to create coherence across JEF members to counter Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A changing climate may necessitate future humanitarian assistance, disaster response and search-and-rescue operations. Delivering coordinated activity as a first responder under a JEF banner could be beneficial and follow the model of the 2014 Sierra Leone intervention. The House of Commons Defence Committee in 2023 described the requirement as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The increasing exploitation of the Arctic for international trade and exploration for critical minerals gives greater importance to the role of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) as a security alliance in the “High North”. The Ministry of Defence should assess how the JEF might need to be adapted in the face of climate-change induced developments in the Arctic and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, the US President-elect is assembling his top team. While his nominees still require Senate confirmation, some immediate reactions in Europe have characterised the process as “terrifying”, and the reliability of the US commitment to European security is openly being questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the importance of the JEF increases for several reasons. First, the JEF as a vanguard military force within NATO can mitigate the loss of some US military capabilities and enablers that underpin deterrence in northern Europe. Second, as leading military spenders in NATO and the biggest supporters of Ukraine, JEF members can collectively pressure allies to increase defence spending and support to Ukraine. Third, the JEF collectively, with the UK in the lead, is well placed to try to convince Trump of the value of European security to the US. The JEF – using the standing of the UK–US bilateral relationship and a new NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte (a previous prime minister of a JEF member since its inception, and a widely reported “Trump whisperer”) – can help counter the narrative of European free riding, prevalent in the modern US Republican Party, through demonstrating its commitment to collective defence spending and support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Governance and Resourcing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the JEF becomes more political, it will become more unwieldy and could lose some of its flexibility and quick response benefits. To mitigate a “turf war” between Downing Street, the MoD, the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office and the Cabinet Office, the JEF should proactively establish an agreed governance structure across Whitehall. The purpose of this would be to ensure that political and policy aims do not stretch the JEF military resources too far and widen the gap between expectations and reality. Greater involvement from the UK intelligence community should be sought to create a “10 EYES” intelligence partnership. Now that Finland and Sweden have unrestricted access to NATO Secret classified intelligence and above, this opens the door to greater collaboration, putting the UK at the heart of a global “JEFEYES” intelligence network. This would also create a significant redundancy in the event that Trump follows through with this threat to cut back intelligence sharing with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its first decade, the JEF has increased interoperability, coordination and coherence between its members, despite its modest resources. In each of the JEF members, there are only a handful of full-time military and official staff, split between policy and operational (HQ) roles. This includes in the UK (as the framework lead), where posts are split between security policy and SJFHQ, with liaison officers supplied by JEF members to the latter, making the JEF operational side better resourced than the security policy side, leading to an imbalance and an underdeveloped policy dimension. In terms of costs, the UK funds JEF operational activity, governance and administration, as outlined in the 2018 Comprehensive Memoradum of Understanding (CMOU), with JEF members meeting their own costs. Schedule 13.4 of the 2018 CMOU grants JEF members the ability to “share the costs of particular activities” defined by “the activity, national contributions and cost-sharing arrangements”. While this might have been sufficient until now, it is likely that it will not be sustainable in the future as greater demands are made of the JEF and as its ambitions increase. However, as a power maximiser, even modest increases in resources are likely to have a disproportionately large effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased funding should prioritise reinforcing the JEF Secretariat, with additional staff drawn from JEF members. This would also be an opportunity to gain greater industry, private sector and academia involvement to make the most of the JEF innovation potential and gain quick momentum on initiatives. Furthermore, the UK MoD should look to JEF member countries to lead on any commissioned initiatives, such as a “JEF bank” or “JEF Digital”, if there is limited capacity within its own system; this could become a powerful development tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increase Partnerships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were unanimous that the JEF had an “optimal membership” and thought that enlarging the membership, especially to a larger European state such as Germany or Poland, would dilute the JEF’s advantages too much. Instead, it was suggested that the JEF should increase partnerships and external engagement to prevent the “inside–outside” dynamic that exists within NATO. These partnerships should prioritise agreeing “plug-in options” whereby other countries can benefit from the flexibility of the JEF and contribute to certain missions, exercises and activities based on the situation and threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The priorities for enhanced partnerships are Germany and Poland, due to their prominence within NATO and the EU and their key roles within Baltic Sea security and forward land forces on NATO’s eastern front, which, at a minimum, would benefit from increased deconfliction from JEF activity. Next, partnerships with the US and Canada should focus on providing High North security and SLOCs protection, and on assuring NATO’s transatlantic reinforcement plan in crisis and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is growing concern over Russian activity in the Irish Sea, including naval exercises in Irish waters, and the vulnerabilities this poses to Euro-Atlantic security, particularly CUI, with its significant concentration of undersea internet cables that network out to northern Europe. Given the geographical importance of the Republic of Ireland, the UK should also encourage greater engagement between the Republic of Ireland and the JEF on CUI protection, which could help manage the sensitivities surrounding Irish neutrality in a similar fashion to Sweden and Finland joining the JEF in 2017 while non-NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF can also make better use of UK partnerships. As an example, AUKUS recently developed an improved algorithm for its trilateral interoperability of the P8 maritime patrol aircraft, and its members are also planning to integrate UK Sting Ray torpedoes onto the airframe. The UK, the US and Norway operate a similar P8 trilateral operation in the North Atlantic, and this technological improvement could be extended to Norway and thereby increase ASW capabilities and improve the collective ability to counter emerging maritime threats. Furthermore, the growing UK–Japan relationship could help increase links with the JEF, which would be less contentious than doing so through NATO, which has been unable to agree on establishing a liaison office in Japan. The relationship between Japan and JEF countries will become more important as the Northern Sea Route becomes increasingly viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Innovation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEF should maximise its innovation potential by creating a JEF Digital innovation and experimentation hub. Increasing the speed of adoption and value for money in defence software development would be a technological continuation of the CFI and Smart Defence initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new head of the British Army has emphasised the critical importance of software, in conjunction with hardware, to creating a “hybrid” system to transform from old to new ways of future warfare. He has spoken of emulating lessons from the battlefield in Ukraine, where the power and pace of technological innovation is significant, with tactical innovation cycles measured in weeks and in which Ukraine has unrivalled experience. As a result, the JEF could boost its own innovation and create more “wartime urgency” through advanced partnerships with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A specific early area of focus should be in maritime uncrewed surface and underwater vessels, where Ukraine has achieved the “functional defeat” of the Russian navy in the Black Sea without operating a conventional navy of its own. Lessons of this nature could be a potent addition to the JEF’s arsenal in the Baltic Sea. The JEF should do this through the recently established NATO–Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre so as to prevent duplication and make more effective use of existing mechanisms. In addition, the JEF should extend its innovation to adopt original funding mechanisms to pay for the above enhancements through a defence finance fund (a “JEF bank”) modelled on a multilateral lending institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout its first decade, the JEF has proven itself to be a valuable addition to the European security architecture, most clearly demonstrated in three areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the JEF member states have remilitarised quicker and further than the rest of Europe, and the JEF has evolved into a heavyweight military force within NATO, which is increasingly capable of responding to the Russian threat. Second, it supported the swift integration of Finland and Sweden into NATO through political support and the adoption of Alliance interoperability standards as baselines, creating a valuable stepping stone to membership. Third, it has led on diplomatic, military, economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine and has galvanised its membership, and the rest of Europe, to do more. Northern Europe is now a transformed strategic environment compared with 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the second decade of the JEF will be far more challenging as European security deteriorates following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Arctic is quickly becoming the fulcrum of strategic competition and is the area where Russia–China cooperation is most advanced. The re-election of President Trump will create a huge amount of uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and NATO’s ability to successfully defend and deter against increased Russian aggression. Consequently the demands on Europeans to step up and rebalance the burden of upholding Euro-Atlantic security will grow rapidly. While Europeans debate exactly how to do this, the JEF is already prepared, and should anticipate the incoming increase in demand by consciously stepping forward to shoulder more of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this rebalancing of European security, there is an opportunity for the UK and the JEF to show leadership and set the pace – and standard – for the Europeanisation of NATO. The UK SDR process should therefore examine the value and role of the JEF – in support of NATO – and use it as a power maximiser for the UK and the JEF’s other members. A comprehensive cross-department and all-domain JEF strategy would enable it to be set on the right path for the next decade and the JEF’s future should be viewed as a whole-of-government cooperative mechanism. The JEF, alongside the UK’s nuclear capability, should be a central pillar of the UK’s contribution to NATO defence and deterrence and European security more broadly. Now is the time to meet its original intent – delivered in the 2012 RUSI speech – to be “the core of the UK’s contribution to any military action, whether NATO, coalition or independent”. Moreover, Ukraine has shown the need for defence procurement to be hastened and to significantly increase interoperability, and the JEF is the most productive vehicle to harness member comparative strengths and innovation. However, its funding and resourcing must be increased so that the JEF can prepare for the additional demand placed on it in a deteriorating Euro-Atlantic security environment. If the UK misses this opportunity, there will be a growing risk that the JEF fails to live up to its ambitions, leading to a serious loss of UK leadership and credibility within Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a major 27 November surprise offensive into Assad regime-held territory by a collection of opposition groups led by Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), opposition forces across the country have made astonishingly swift gains, using blitzkrieg tactics to keep Syrian government forces off balance and moving too fast to allow a sufficient reaction. Across the whole country, Assad’s forces have collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to overstate how incredible the collapse has been, given the history of the war in Syria. Within four days of the first move on 28 November, rebels had taken control of Syria’s second city, Aleppo. Just over a week in, Hama fell. Homs, a critical crossroads between Syria’s north, its coast, its capital, and Lebanon’s Bekaa valley (a key supply route for Hezbollah) fell on 7 December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lightning-strikes&quot;&gt;Lightning Strikes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patchwork of other forces moving around the country is complex, but important to understand. In parallel, separate opposition forces to the south of Damascus, clearly coordinating with HTS, took the opportunity to move on the key cities of Deraa (where Syria’s protests first began in 2011) and Suwaida, making deals with regime forces to withdraw. In control of the Syria–Jordan border, they advanced swiftly on the capital, with thousands of irregular Syrian opposition fighters encircling the city and facing very limited resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a less-covered but vital fight escalated in Syria’s east. To date, the US-backed and Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been attempting to destroy Islamic State (which has been making a comeback) while defending themselves against Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) forces. Evidence of deconfliction is clear between HTS and SDF and, over the past 10 days, the SDF have preserved escape corridors for civilians from Aleppo, deterred incursions by pro-Iranian militias across the Iraqi border and done deals with Assad regime forces to take over key locations. This indicates a wider opportunistic plan afoot to hold critical locations controlling the Iraqi border and east-west supply routes along the Euphrates, bolstering longer-term positions and limiting exposure to Turkish and Iranian-Iraqi attack. It is also notable that the SDF have largely ended up in control of territory which is among the most resource-rich in Syria – a key tradeable powerbroking element in the current post-Assad landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SDF efforts have also linked up with other US-supported Free Syrian Army (FSA) units, who have swept north from the worst-kept secret in Syria – the US–FSA Al-Tanf base dominating the Jordan–Iraq–Syria triborder area. These have now taken control of the key desert city of Palmyra from regime troops, controlling the desert to the east of Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is directly involved, using air power to fire on Iraqi militias attempting to enter Syria. With regime forces’ withdrawal, this effectively means the US now has fire control over the whole of eastern Syria – a fact it has used to immediate effect, conducting “dozens” of airstrikes on Islamic State camps and operatives in former regime-held areas in an effort to use the interregnum to destroy the organisation to the fullest extent possible and prevent it from using the chaos to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as Syria is a proxy conflict, with external powers backing individual forces, this HTS offensive has several hallmarks of a patient effort to break out of a frozen status quo that had been decided and imposed from abroad years earlier. While an offensive out of Idlib had been expected, nothing like this was foreseen, and its catastrophic success is unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTS has capitalised on a shifting geopolitical landscape, picking a moment when key Assad allies Russia and Iran are drained and preoccupied, and Hezbollah is devastated after a year of war with Israel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these developments come in the context of a four-year long status quo, characterised by the survival of the Assad regime following a decade of bloody civil war and backing from Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah, against opposition forces with (originally) Western and Gulf backing. It also follows major regional ructions, such as the devastating rise and fall of Islamic State, and the more recent transformation of the Assad regime into a narco-state benefiting from the manufacture and regional trade of Captagon, an illicit amphetamine flooding across the region which accounts for an unknown majority (and potentially multiples) of Syria’s current GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For HTS and other opposition units themselves, several more specific recent factors have influenced the success of this offensive. HTS has capitalised on a shifting geopolitical landscape, picking a moment when key Assad allies Russia and Iran are drained and preoccupied, and Hezbollah is devastated after a year of war with Israel. This has obviously reduced the immediate support available to a hollowed-out and corrupt Syrian government, and allowed rapid territorial gains. With the Syrian military putting up no significant resistance, key partners were not going to fight alone. But more than this, Assad’s behaviour – including his covert negotiations with Western countries and offers to eject Iranian forces from Syrian soil – will not have helped relations with those who once propped him up, nor did his rejection of every proposal made to him to make adjustments towards a political settlement of the conflict. It is now clear that Russia has been in contact with opposition groups to secure its critical military base interests in Syria. And both Iran and Russia have moderated the language they use towards the Syrian opposition forces (which includes groups regarded as terrorists by both), effectively consenting to a new political reality and looking to reach out to the new power(s) in Damascus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Idlib-based opposition movements had also improved their military capabilities. What was once a loose collective of Islamist rebel factions has transformed into a well-organised quasi-military force. The unification of fragmentary groups and the establishment of advanced military training, influenced by Western and Russian military doctrines, has created a diverse but coherent force. Benefiting from rampant arms smuggling and building an advanced arms manufacturing industry in Idlib, HTS has produced 3D-printed drones and missiles, enabling the execution of sophisticated mass attacks which overwhelmed the Assad regime’s defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hts-in-a-position-of-national-leadership&quot;&gt;HTS in a Position of National Leadership?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the question of whether the opposition are ready to rule, and have a plan to do so in a way that reflects the plurality of Syrian society. HTS leader Abu Muhammed al-Jolani was interviewed by CNN on 6 December, and said as much. He and HTS have spent years undergoing major rebranding efforts, including changing the group’s name from the Al-Nusra Front, severing ties with Al-Qa’ida (AQ) in 2016 and ruthlessly targeting several AQ affiliates and Islamic State in Syria, as well as mergers with other opposition groups. HTS has also tried to position itself as a more mainstream entity within the Syrian opposition; by all accounts, its approach is now more pragmatic. This, despite myriad former AQ links, the listing of HTS as a US Foreign Terrorist Organisation by the US and Jolani’s own designation as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist”, including a $10 million bounty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTS has made efforts to reassure local populations and reach out to minority groups terrified of another Salafi-Jihadist organisation in a position of power in Syria (after the Islamic State experience). Understanding this fear, HTS has focused on communications about the status all minorities should hold in a post-Assad society, and taken some immediate actions to build confidence. For example, after capturing Aleppo, Jolani appeared personally to assure minorities of their protection and forbid fighters from entering homes, aiming to present HTS as a protector of all civilians (subsequently, there have been reports of residents calling on HTS to deal with looters, many of them from Turkish-backed SNA forces in the area). Other measures have also been taken to win over local populations, such as the sudden delivery of 24-hour electricity and the erection of new mobile phone masts. But these early indications will not reassure many – the proof will be in any agreements struck for longer-term governance, and the extent to which HTS is willing to share power – particularly with other, non-Salafi Jihadi movements and minorities like the Alawites, Kurds, Christians and Druze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also unclear is the opposition’s approach to dealing with former Assad regime loyalists. Military collapses and local dealmaking would suggest that efforts to adapt existing structures may be the initial approach. The rebels would be well advised to be inclusive; an Iraq 2003-style purge of the Baath party would result in the same sort of broad insurgency that sparked – and mass executions would be even worse. This will be a key question to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the array of other Syrian groups, sects and political ideologies that have operated in partnership on the march to Damascus, HTS will have to share power with other Syrians. Either we may be unsurprised to witness a descent into chaotic power struggles between factions, or – if homework has been done – we may be surprised by a less radical government than HTS’s terrorist pedigree would suggest. However, comparisons with the Taliban and other, more fragmented movements are too easily made – until demonstrated otherwise, a radical Islamic fundamentalist government must remain the core assumption if HTS seizes power over the heads of others. This would not bode well for a country crippled by sanctions and reliant on Iranian fuel and foreign humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-key-players-act&quot;&gt;How Did Key Players Act?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has taken pains to say “I told you so”, suggesting that his shift in stance on “holding back” HTS to date was due to Assad’s intransigence on negotiating future dynamics in Syria, particularly the conditions which would permit the return of millions of Syrians currently taking refuge on Turkish soil. But the Turkish role is potentially being inflated. HTS is not controlled by Turkey; its actions align with a message Erdogan wants to send to all stakeholders in Syria – particularly the Russians and the incoming Trump administration – that Turkey holds some of the most significant levers on influence across the region. HTS tactical alliances and strategic coordination with Turkish-backed rebel factions (particularly the SNA, a Turkish auxiliary operating in Syria’s north) have bolstered HTS’s operational strength and facilitated some alignment, but so has careful coordination and deconfliction with the US-backed, Kurdish-led SDF, an implacable enemy of Turkey which its SNA partners continue to attack. If the SDF becomes too prominent in any post-Assad Syria, Turkey may again take military action (a scenario against which the SDF is currently positioning to defend).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Russia’s naval and air bases in Syria and the strategic costs it has sunk into the country since intervening in 2014, it might be surprising that Russia has not done more to defend Assad. But Russia’s strategic priority is clear – Ukraine. Russia has consolidated its positions and is watching opposition movements carefully – their forces are within 30km of Tartus and Hmeimim, key Russian naval and air force bases. It is clear that Russia is in contact with opposition forces and reports now suggest that Russian military bases and diplomatic missions have been “guaranteed security”. Nonetheless, there are indications of Russian concern over the speed of the rebel advance, with limited military movements out of Tartus and Hmeimim. A Russian diplomatic warning to its citizens to leave Syria by commercial means, meanwhile, was an indication that substantial assistance to the regime was not on the way. Russia would not pull troops from Ukraine to aid Assad in Syria, and even reports that the post-Wagner private military company “Africa Corps” would be redirected to Syria were likely out of date; the battlefield situation moved so fast that Russian forces in Syria had to prioritise their own force protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments are critical for Iran, in that opposition control of Homs and the whole M5 highway (the north-south road linking Aleppo to Damascus, running along the Lebanese border) will disrupt Lebanese Hezbollah’s main supply routes. With Hezbollah severely weakened by 14 months of war with Israel, it needs resupply more than ever. Hezbollah will also be concerned about the threat of Sunni jihadist groups entering Lebanon’s north (a situation that has happened in the past, though in a recent statement HTS has denied any such plans). Weakening Hezbollah further by cutting it off from Syria could lead to de-escalation and a new political consensus in Lebanon, but it could equally feasibly pave the way for a further round of fighting with Israel if the fragile 60-day Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire, which ends in January, falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upending of the fragile status quo in Syria is linked with, and impacts, the instability that now extends from the Mediterranean to the borders of Afghanistan. Questions about the second-order effects are now being tested. On the basis of what key actors believe has happened, many Middle Eastern powerbrokers are positioning themselves to limit risks and manage the aftermath for their own pressing security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several states, uncertainty as to the political alignment of HTS and its allies, as well as whether it has really renounced the ideology of its AQ-affiliated roots, will be the immediate challenge in an already uncomfortably complex outlook. And this at a time when there are indications of a resurgence of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now clear that some of Assad’s closest partners, including Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, were all convinced he was finished well before he stood down. In the end, the pace of the offensive was inexorable. Turkey is seen as a key influencer. Russian diplomats are taking care to blame the US, the UK and Israel for backing “Islamists” – but not Turkey. Iran also has moderated the language its state media uses to discuss rebels, and has publicly said it “lost faith” in Assad. This weekend’s gathering of Iranian, Russian and Turkish diplomats in Doha was the key opportunity to create an offramp agreement which protected at least some collective interests in the future stability of Syria, at the cost of an exit for Assad. The signatories to this agreement are all parties likely to maintain interests and take roles in Syria going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Levantine history teaches us to be deeply concerned when dealing with such a fractious society in trauma after a decade of internecine war, torn in different directions by various foreign and non-state actors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments are particularly devastating blows to Iran, which has now lost a key ally, a commercial partner, a conduit to proxies in Lebanon and Palestine and a shadow battlefield with Israel in the space of a year. Iran’s regional influence and security structures are now at a nadir, returning its gaze to its home front. Longer-term, a rearrangement of power in Syria – particularly one which isolates Hezbollah – is likely to have major implications for Iran’s own decision-making. It could have implications for Iranian relations with Gulf countries. But in particular, it may influence the way Iran negotiates over its nuclear programme, and how it regards the timeline to the expiration of snapback sanctions in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This links to US future posture. The US military has taken widespread actions in recent days to suppress Islamic State and prevent the entry of Iran-backed militias into Syria. It is also known to be taking actions to prevent Assad’s remaining chemical weapons stockpiles from falling into the wrong hands. But Trump has made his views on Syria clear (perhaps in response to Assad’s entreaties?): “Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, &amp;amp; THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!”. This sets the direction of travel firmly towards a US step back – a welcome message to some in the region. It would simply be worth noting that US presidents who aim to avoid involvement in the Middle East invariably fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel, meanwhile, considers itself a “free” beneficiary of these developments, even if they risk the emergence of a more powerful, potentially extremist, Sunni power on its border. It has taken early, aggressive steps to secure land militarily in the Syrian Golan, arguing that with Assad gone historical agreements made with Syria no longer stand. And a widespread campaign of precision airstrikes is being conducted against major military bases, air defences and key scientific research centres across Syria (particularly those associated with Assad’s chemical weapons and missile programmes). In effect, Israel is demilitarising Syria to the extent possible, so that whoever ends up in charge can only present a limited threat (including, say, if Syrian airspace was required for strikes further afield).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levantine history teaches us to be deeply concerned when dealing with such a fractious society in trauma after a decade of internecine war, torn in different directions by various foreign and non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in effect, developments since 27 November may have forced a de facto shift that leapfrogs the “ceasefire, political settlement and transition” foreseen in 2015’s UN Security Council Resolution 2254. With Assad gone, so is a major obstacle to progress. Political deals in the four years since the situation in Syria somewhat stabilised have created new channels for dialogue. The bones of a plan to win a peace exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the geopolitical “so whats”, if asked, many, many Syrians will tell you they are overjoyed, sad, worried and hopeful all at once. Only one thing is for certain: Assad is gone, not with a bang but with a whimper. The opportunities are many; the risks are blindingly clear. We must hope that at least some lessons about pluralistic governance, human security and the centrality of the social contract have been learned from two decades of the global war on terror, the mis-named Arab “Spring”, Assad’s hyperviolent and cynical survival strategy, and a wretched collection of short-sighted policies from the international community in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus rests on the role of civilians who are not employed or subcontracted by the military but engage in acts ranging from singing national anthems to launching offensive cyber operations. The paper examines when such civilian participation amounts to direct participation in hostilities and the types of legal implications which follow from such activities. This paper takes a closer look at recent civilian participation in hostilities as seen in Ukraine, particularly focusing on intelligence gathering and cyber activities as conducted by the Ukrainian information technology (IT) army to illustrate the risks to which civilians expose themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper concludes that while there are legitimate reasons for States to include civilians in their defence strategies, it is key that where civilians engage in direct participation in hostilities, they must do so on an informed basis, setting out the legal implications of their actions. Where a State (passively) encourages such activities, it has at least a moral, if not also a legal obligation, to inform civilians of the risks of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s latest aggression against Ukraine was not its first attempt to wage territorial warfare against Ukraine or indeed other Eastern European states, the 2022 invasion is receiving a lot more international attention. However, in contrast to their Western neighbours, Eastern European states were not surprised by the attack on Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity – rather they had prepared strategies and warned that such an event could occur. What is of particular interest to the authors is the way in which civilians are addressed in these strategies and how (if at all) customary international humanitarian law (IHL) addresses civilian defence in an international armed conflict (IAC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilians have played an important role in both the Baltics and Ukraine in strategies against Russian and previous Soviet aggression. The Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania – in particular, have had a lot of experience with civilian defence as an alternative to military defence during times of occupation. More recently, all three Baltic countries have included civilians in their respective defence strategies, primarily in response to Russian geopolitical and military objectives. Ukraine, similarly, explicitly addresses civilians in its current defence strategy and its civilians are involved most prominently in hybrid warfare against Russia. The first part of this paper analyses the national defence strategies of the Baltic countries and how IHL can be applied to them. The second part will focus on Ukraine’s civilian defence strategy before and after the Russian aggression. The in-depth analysis and application of its civilian defence strategy to IHL is limited to the IT army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While civilians often supplement a military force, either as contractors or as civilian employees, this paper focusses yet on a different phenomenon. The authors are interested in the participation of civilians who are not employed or subcontracted by the military. Conversely, this could mean the general public or specific groups of civilians, like IT-experts, who are included in defence strategies outside of conscription or employment of any sort. The Baltic countries and Ukraine have demonstrated how vital the inclusion of civilians can be, both in times of occupation, and during an active armed conflict. We are, therefore, exploring what lessons are to be learnt for future (Western) defence strategies, and the types of possible implications for the application of IHL which follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-civilian-non-violent-defence-a-preliminary-definition&quot;&gt;1.1 Civilian Non-violent Defence: A Preliminary Definition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional military defence, civilian defence relies on the participation of ordinary citizens to resist and undermine an aggressor’s ability to exercise control. In the event of an on-going occupation, civilian defence strategies, at their core, aim to protect social values and the social structure of the society. Yet, it remains unclear how civilian defence could look in the context of deterrence, or in an active IAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at Geneva Convention IV on the protection of civilian persons in time of war for guidance, one realises that Art. 63 prohibiting “any changes in the personnel or structure of these societies” also only applies to occupation, and furthermore, only addresses relief efforts of either relief societies following the Red Cross principles, or other special organisations of a non-military character whose aim is to ensure the living conditions of the civilian population, the maintenance of essential public utilities or organising relief and rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chapter VI of API (Art. 61–67) defines and addresses civil defence in an active IAC, its scope is also limited to traditional relief and rescue efforts, not addressing actions to safeguard values, or inhibiting the aggressor through passive means. What also remains out of scope of both the Geneva Convention and API are actions not undertaken by an organisation in the broadest sense. Individuals or groups of civilians who are not part of an organisational structure are, therefore, not included in this definition. Therefore, one needs to ask the question as to what activities conducted by civilians which are not mentioned in either the Geneva Convention or API still qualify as permissible civilian actions? Civil defence organisations are not, under any circumstances, allowed to conduct activities that are harmful to the enemy – they would lose their special protection under Art. 62. Given that individuals or groups who are not part of such an organisation are not entitled to this special protection anyway, the only possible outcome could be, that they are either considered to be engaging in unlawful behaviour, or would lose their status as a civilian altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating the role of civilian defence in different scenarios is consequently vital to appropriately situate them in IHL. Recently, owing to the emergence of hybrid warfare, some civilian defence strategists propose “deterrence through both denial and offense”, including civilians in these efforts short of using force. Indeed, contemporary strategies are different to previous examples: they are intended to be used in an on-going IAC and arguably aim to achieve more than securing societal values. Therefore, one needs to investigate if such actions have the potential of becoming offensive in nature, crossing the threshold to DPH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-goals-and-research-question&quot;&gt;1.2 Goals and Research Question&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors aim to take a closer look at the concept of civilian defence and how it is used, both in a preparatory or perhaps deterrent way, as well as in an ongoing international armed conflict. In doing so, they first explore historical examples of civilian defence as well as current defence strategies in the Baltics on the one hand, and the current usage of civilian defence in Ukraine on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is of particular interest to the authors is how civilians are addressed in these strategies and how (if at all) customary IHL addresses civilian defence in an IAC. When do civilians cross the threshold of direct participation in hostilities (DPH)? Can this threshold be met through non-violent civilian action? How can cyber operations conducted by civilians during an IAC be assessed? Are Baltic and Ukrainian civilian defence strategies the next logical step in (hybrid) warfare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-civil-defence-under-international-humanitarian-law&quot;&gt;2 Civil Defence under International Humanitarian Law&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While IHL does not prohibit civil defence – or even civilian direct participation – per se, civilians’ actions may nevertheless carry consequences under humanitarian law. Civilians are normally protected from direct attack under the principle of distinction, which requires all parties to the conflict to always distinguish between combatants and civilians, and to only focus direct attacks against combatants or military targets. Except in the case of a levée en masse, individuals who do not belong to organised armed forces but engage in hostilities sporadically, spontaneously, or in an unorganised manner, remain civilians under IHL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle of distinction, however, ceases to apply to civilians temporarily for the time they are directly participating in hostilities (DPH) – a concept which is not defined in treaty law nor clearly defined in customary international law. API provides a starting point, stating that a civil defence organisation loses its protected status if it engages in activities that are harmful to the enemy. The ICRC’s guidelines identify that DPH is comprised of two elements, hostilities, and direct participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an act to qualify as DPH, it must meet three cumulative criteria: it must meet a threshold of harm, there must be a direct causal link between the act and such harm, and the act must be designed to support one party to the conflict to the detriment of the other (belligerent nexus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the ICRC’s guidelines, the threshold of likely harm, must generally be similar to that of military force. While killing and wounding individuals or inflicting structural or functional damage to military objects has an obvious similarity to military force, one must also consider that even non-violent sabotage has the potential to adversely affect the enemy and cause harm. Examples thereof could be disturbing logistics and communications through cyber-attacks against the military computer network of the enemy. Determining whether an act has “adverse military effect” requires having enough information on the act itself and the likely outcomes. Moreover, there must be a causal link between the (likely) outcome of the act and the harm. Acts merely building up capacity to cause such an effect, like engaging in propaganda, repairing roads, or even manufacturing and shipping weapons would not satisfy the causal link. Lastly, the belligerent nexus and intent of the act must be “specifically designed to do so in support of a party to an armed conflict and to the detriment of another”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one agrees to accept the ICRC’s three requirements and a civilian has indeed satisfied them, the civilian loses their protection from direct attack “for such a time as they take a direct part in hostilities”. Civilians engaging in DPH are not entitled to immunity from domestic prosecution, but may be subject to criminal charges. This paper relies on the ICRC’s interpretation to assess whether actions of civilian defence or resistance mean the individuals in question lose their protection from direct attack, as to this date, it is the most established way to determine whether a civilian is partaking in DPH. Having said that, in practice it is often challenging to operationalise the application of such thresholds: it seems unlikely that a member of enemy armed forces would undertake an in-depth analysis of whether a civilian fulfils all of these criteria, particularly where the factual assessment is challenging to conduct at speed. Moreover, civilians engaging in these activities need to take into account the possibility that the enemy power entirely disregards the jus in bello and targets civilians irrespective of whether they engage in DPH or not. We can see this behaviour, for example, in some of the activities conducted by the Russian armed forces and the Wagner group in Ukraine. However, the authors still feel it is important to identify what the law says and how it can be applied – not least because a violation of the law might constitute a war crime that can be prosecuted at the national or potentially the international level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-using-civilian-defence-as-a-strategy-primarily-against-russia--past-and-present-approaches&quot;&gt;3 Using Civilian Defence as a Strategy Primarily against Russia – Past and Present Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To examine how States address civilians in their defence strategies, the authors focus on the Baltic States and Ukraine, which have a long history of being targeted by Russian attacks. Analysing their individual and collective defence strategies can provide valuable insights in how to use civilian defence against Russia’s hegemonial threat, destabilisation attempts, and even aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31-estonia-latvia-and-lithuania--a-long-history-of-successfully-using-civil-defence&quot;&gt;3.1 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – A Long History of Successfully Using Civil Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic countries suffered Soviet aggression and occupation from 1940 to 1941 and again from 1944–1991. During the Soviet occupation and some would argue annexation, the population of the Baltic countries was subjected to mass deportations, forced collectivisation, and other forms of oppression. Despite these atrocities, non-violent resistance prevailed in the civilian population across all three Baltic countries, leading to ordinary citizens organising alternative election lists, tearing down Soviet symbols and flags, or displaying national symbols or signing national songs prohibited by the Soviets. Thereby, the Baltic population preserved their own respective identities, keeping spirits high and making it as unpleasant and costly as possible for the occupying force, without using armed force. All of these civilian efforts, growing in scale over time and using the economic and political crises in the USSR, culminated in a strong, public independence movement across all three countries. Lithuania ultimately declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, Latvia on 4 May 1990, and Estonia on 21 August 1991. Ultimately, the Soviet government recognised the independence of all three states on 6 September 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more recent history, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have been subject to Russian strategic information operations and experienced Russian forces deploying close to their borders. Many wondered if the Baltic countries would be next, especially after the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, they have jointly – and separately – formulated strategies to deter Russian aggression and the revisionist agenda. Notably, these strategies explicitly include civilians. The authors are particularly interested in how exactly civilians are addressed, particularly in situations outside of foreign occupation, i.e., in defensive manoeuvres against an on-going aggressive attack from an enemy state. Based on the previously discussed history, and the permanent Russian threat, two defensive concepts that also include civilians have been integrated in the national defence strategies of the three countries: total defence and unconventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.1.1 Estonia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1993 and 2010, Estonia’s National Defence Concept focussed on total defence as well as territorial defence – prioritising a traditional military approach. While Estonia had a history of civil disobedience which included asking its citizens to refuse any actions that would be breaking Estonian laws, a policy of strict non-cooperation with the Soviets, and the documentation of any activities by the Soviet forces, civilian defence did not play a role after regaining independence. However, there is the Kaitseliit (Defence League) which is a militarily organised voluntary defence organisation. Its roots go back to guerrilla groups which fought against the Soviets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having become a victim of massive hybrid attacks in 2007, the Estonians acknowledged that due to changing potential threats, especially such hybrid challenges, military means alone would not be enough to meet new defensive demands. This realisation was also reflected in its 2011 defence strategy which amended the previous total defence approach to an integrated defence and comprehensive security approach, listing civilian support to military defence as one of the six pillars of this new strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia affirmed and updated its 2010 National Defence Strategy in 2017, branding it “integrated defence and comprehensive security”. This new approach consists of six pillars, one of which is civilian support to military defence, relying e.g., on the Kaiseliit. In the event of an armed conflict, the Kaitseliit will split. The military wing will operate under the Estonian armed forces whilst the civilian wing will engage in non-violent defence. Whereas, members of the military wing would be classified as ordinary combatants, members of the civil wing would remain civilians and would not be legitimate targets as long as they do not take part in DPH. Whether an enemy soldier would understand and recognise this distinction might, however, be a different question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia’s 2017 defence concept vastly expanded a reference to civilian contribution to defence. It acknowledges that networks of civilian volunteers play an important role, and includes civilian contribution to psychological defence. Such measures seem rather close to previously successful Baltic attempts at civilian defence and would not be likely to cross the threshold to DPH as these are non-violent actions directed inwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.1.2 Latvia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Latvia initially encouraged its citizens to non-violent resistance. Latvian total non-cooperation was part of the Latvian Popular Front strategy in 1990. They called on all citizens “to ignore the attackers’ orders, not to participate in any elections or referendums, and to document all crimes perpetrated by the attackers”. Civil defence was intended to be a constant supplement to military defence. Alas, civilian defence did not find its way into Latvia’s defence strategy after it regained independence. The Zemessardze (National Guard) is a militarily organised unconventional defence group the main task of which is to support the regular land forces units. While it is also responsible for civilian crisis management, the organisation cannot reasonably be considered to be part of non-violent civilian defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latvia’s 2016 edition of its National Defence Concept outlines a duty for its civilian administration (state, regional, and local) to coordinate “the readiness and actions undertaken by individual and legal entities during times of peace, threats and war” to support national defence, and to implement national defence measures. For the first time since regaining independence, the defence concept hints at the fact that civilians could also have a role during armed conflict: “The state informs society on what actions should civilians undertake during a military conflict”. While this is a rather vague statement, it would be reasonable to assume that the state would give advice similar to previous strategies, i.e. total non-cooperation, classical peaceful civilian defence methods. A recently published brochure titled “What to do in case of crisis” gives citizens some suggestions on how they could support national defence: join the National Forces, report any movement, actions, or marks and transmitters of the aggressor, offer practical support to National Forces and NATO, help build fortified structures, use deception (remove road signs), help salvage peace and help motivate your colleagues, family members and friends to support national defence, support your company’s continuity planning, or create a local Unit of the National Guard. While some of these suggestions are certainly below the threshold of DPH, some may, depending on the circumstances, cross the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.1.3 Lithuania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As early as 1991, shortly after regaining independence, the Lithuanian Supreme Council adopted a resolution, reminding its citizens to continue to follow the principles of disobedience, non-violent resistance, and non-cooperation in their struggle for independence. Having developed the concept further, Lithuania has referred to civilians in its defence and security strategies since 1992. From this time, Lithuania has relied on the participation of civilians in its defence strategy: “State defence consists of military security, as well as civil resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuanian citizens are, by law, asked to engage in non-violent resistance (not further defined), disobedience and non-collaboration, as well as armed resistance. To help its citizens fulfil these duties, Lithuania has established a Civilian Resistance Training Centre at the Ministry of National Defence in 2000 – alongside preparing civilians, its goal is to also act as a deterrent for any potential aggressor. However, a further noteworthy shift in strategy occurred once Lithuania joined NATO in 2004. Now, protected under Art. 5 and geared towards collective security, civilian defence seems to have been placed on the backburner for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the Lithuanian Ministry of Defence updated its strategy regarding Russian hybrid warfare. In May 2022, the Minister of Defence, Arvydas Anušauskas, stated: “With the Strategy in place, we will begin a consistent and comprehensive education of the public on civil resistance. Such preparations will rest on three components: civil resilience, will to resist, and practical skills in both, armed and civil resistance. We aim to build on each of these. Another important aspect is that the preparation for civil resistance will cross over into the National Defence System area of expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more recently, in April 2023, a Seimas Committee started preparing to advise citizens on how the strategy of civil resistance has evolved since Russia’s attack against Ukraine and how it should be implemented in the future. Lithuania plans for both unarmed and armed civil resistance, educating school children and adults alike, and ultimately planning to raise the share of civilians willing to undertake non-armed violence to 70%. Having briefly analysed Lithuania’s updated approach, it becomes apparent that it has updated and upgraded its capacity for civilian defence. The choice of whether to engage in armed or unarmed resistance would be up to citizens – however Lithuania’s strategy does not necessarily demand a distinction and could, therefore, very likely mean that civilians will cross the threshold to DPH in some situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;32-impact-of-national-strategies-on-ihl&quot;&gt;3.2 Impact of National Strategies on IHL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After examining the national defence strategies of the Baltic countries, a fundamental question arises: do these strategies align with existing IHL, or do they represent the development of new, (possibly regional), customary international law? To address this, we must explore whether any of the acts outlined in the strategies of the Baltic states potentially violate IHL. As previously analysed in section 2, for any act to qualify as DPH, it must meet three cumulative criteria: it must meet a threshold of harm, there must be a direct causal link between the act and such harm, and the act must be designed to support one party to the conflict to the detriment of the other (belligerent nexus). This threshold can only be met by violent actions – Estonian’s duty to engage in psychological warfare, refusing to follow orders from enemy soldiers would not meet such a threshold. Likewise, engaging in other non-violent acts such as building fortified structures or removing road signs cannot be classified as DPH. Therefore, if it does not “even” meet the threshold of DPH, how could it violate established IHL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would the law then be applicable to violent defensive action, particularly such action that does indeed qualify as DPH? As mentioned previously, civilians are not prohibited from using force or otherwise partaking in hostilities; rather, the legal consequence of such behaviour is losing the protection of a civilian. Hence, the principle of distinction no longer applies to them, and they become legitimate targets. Moreover, as they do not qualify for combatant privileges, they potentially could be prosecuted for any violations of domestic criminal law, e.g., murder or destruction of property. These consequences are clearly laid out in IHL without any mention of a prohibition; one could not, therefore, argue that they are a violation. Yet, it should be noted that the spirit of the Geneva Convention very much reflects the strict separation of civilians and combatants. Civilians can only be protected if this separation is adhered to. Any grey-area situation might very well result in the targeting of the civilian in question. While a possible defense to that argument is a reference to the Lotus case and the long-standing principle that everything in international law, that is not prohibited, is allowed, the authors would like to pose the question of whether it is necessary to encourage violent civilian defense, knowing the potential consequences. One would hope that states feel a higher moral – if not also a legal – obligation to safeguard their civilian citizens than to argue that they are allowed to engage in such action, because it is not prohibited. At the very least, States should take said responsibility seriously and inform their citizens of potential consequences which would then enable each and everyone to make an informed choice. This is also in line with States’ obligation to ensure respect for the Geneva Conventions which clearly promote the protection of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise, neither non-violent nor violent civilian defence constitutes a violation of IHL per se. While both forms can be read in conjunction with existing IHL, the authors argue that violent civilian defence certainly goes against the spirit and purpose of the Geneva Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;33-ukraines-civil-defence-before-and-after-russias-attacks&quot;&gt;3.3 Ukraine’s Civil Defence before and after Russia’s Attack(s)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s defence strategy before the war was primarily regulated by the Law “On Fundamentals of National Security of Ukraine” which was passed in 2003. While this law does not address civil defence in the way the Baltic Republics have, it does mention the civil service and its role in Ukraine’s defence. However, the role of civil servants in Ukraine’s defence service was defined as supplemental to the military service. This means, civilians were used, e.g., on a fixed-term contract basis in a specialist function. Their role was to fill positions and provide expertise that the military itself did not have, or to free up the military’s capacity to focus on their original duty: combat and defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russia’s invasion on 24 February 2022, the Ukrainian population had to endure unspeakable things: mass destruction of cities, atrocities, including even the abduction of children. Not to speak of the experiences of Ukrainian soldiers who are subject to atrocious crimes. However, for the purpose of this paper, the authors would like to take a closer look at civilians. How does the civilian population engage in defensive actions – be it a defence of democratic values and the protection of Ukrainian identity, or actions more geared towards restoring territorial integrity. Understandably, information is hard to come by, as this is still an on-going conflict. No one on the ground has, for good reason, shared anything that could potentially be of use to the Russians, hence whatever we can analyse here will remain on the surface. The following sections will, nevertheless, attempt to situate different examples of known Ukrainian civilian defence actions in IHL (if applicable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.3.1 Conventional Means of Civilian Resistance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media coverage was astonished by the bravery of resistance of Ukrainian civilians facing their occupiers, particularly at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine 2022. Videos and photos of unarmed civilians in Ukraine emerged and were shared widely, documenting how inhabitants of attacked villages and towns greeted their invaders: with protests, by singing the Ukrainian national anthem, with road blockades, by stopping moving vehicles from progressing further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the city of Berdyansk, civilians protested against Russian soldiers occupying the city. Civilians have also blocked road access to Zaporizhzhia, the Ukrainian nuclear powerplant now in control of Russian forces. Other video material shows how civilians actively stopped moving vehicles from progressing en route. The bravery of unarmed civilians facing their occupiers is exemplary, but do their activities meet the relevant thresholds to alter their status of protection under international humanitarian law?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil resistance, e.g. in the form of protests or singing the national anthem, do not amount to DPH. Clearly, these activities do not fulfil the necessary harm threshold. Nor is this the case where civilians merely refuse to collaborate with invading or occupying forces. Where civilians join war-sustaining efforts, e.g. by producing camouflage nets or even making Molotov cocktails, they also do not fulfil the requirements of DPH, as these wider activities lack direct causation to hostilities. Constructing road blockades only constitutes DPH where these blockades result in an adverse impact on the military operations or military capacity of a party to the conflict: where no such effect is given and the activity in question is also not likely to cause death, injury, or destruction, building a road blockade would not meet the necessary harm threshold to speak of DPH. Civilians thus have a range of options to take up activities that support the defence of their State and that constitute war-sustaining efforts without losing their civilian protection from direct attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this still the case though where civilian resort to more drastic measures? How about inhabitants who pick up arms and use force and violence to defend themselves against their occupiers? Their exact status depends on the circumstances under which they resort to the use of force. Firstly, where civilians engage in violent civil unrest against occupying forces, such activities would likely not amount to DPH, as they are missing the belligerent nexus that is necessary for such activity to qualify as DPH. Instead, they would fall under the regular law enforcement paradigm. Where civilians, in an unoccupied territory, spontaneously use force to resist invading forces, carry their arms openly, adhere to IHL and wear a distinctive emblem, they might qualify as participants in a levée en masse. As a result, they enjoy combatant privilege and prisoner of war status. However, this requires a level of spontaneity that is not always given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the Russian invasion, Ukraine had passed new legislation in January 2022 that legitimises ad hoc resistance, e.g. when civilians join the territorial defence forces (TDF), and which incorporates these groups into its military command structure. They have been provided with weapons and wear a distinctive emblem, a yellow taped band around their arm. In these instances, those who are fighting would be part of a command structure and likely wear a distinctive emblem. If they also carry their weapons openly and conduct their operations in line with IHL, they could qualify as a volunteer group which is part of the armed forces and therefore enjoys prisoner of war status when captured. However, with this level of organisation, they would no longer be qualified as participating in a levée en masse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilians who do not join organised volunteer groups, and individuals who are not members of a levée en masse, but are also directly participating in hostilities, lose their civilian protection for the duration of their activities when such activities are likely to inflict death, injury or destruction or their activities are integral to a military operation (see section 2). Examples here would include acts of sabotage or using delayed or remote weapons, including booby traps, missiles or mines, and also drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these examples of activities potentially amounting to DPH are not new – after all, these are examples of civilians reacting to or participating in conventional warfare – and established rules of IHL apply to them, the wide availability of video and photographic footage recording these activities brings them closer to those outside the war zone. One still relatively new way in which civilians can participate in hostilities is through cyber means, which will be examined more closely in section 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3.3.2 Intelligence Gathering by Civilians&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any armed conflict, information is key: information about road conditions, the enemy’s location, the equipment used or the enemy’s morale are only a few of the examples on which a party may want to collect data. To do so, it needs information or intelligence, typically obtained through a number of sources, including professional intelligence agencies but also informants in the civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine, for example, civilians have been sending intelligence information, especially via Telegram chats or via the Ukrainian government app Diia that allows users to “report the movements of Russian troops, sending location-tagged videos directly to Ukrainian intelligence”, reportedly receiving tens of thousands submissions a day. The intelligence gathering effort benefits from a wide availability of smart phones that can record sound and photographic material that can be passed on quickly. A Ukrainian intelligence official confirmed in news reports that the local population is “supportive” but did not want to expand on the details of the activities conducted by civilians. Relying on public reporting makes the following examples of information gathering by individuals an anecdotal reference rather than confirmed activities, but they raise a range of interesting questions about civilians gathering intelligence in support of Ukrainian forces: Who organises this? Where do civilians report? What is the information used for? Do civilians know what their information is used for? And finally, does intelligence gathering by civilians amount to DPH?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence gathering would amount to DPH and meet the relevant harm threshold and meets the direct causal link criterion if it forms an integral part of a military operation to the adverse affect of a party to the conflict, e.g. because it is considered a preparatory act for a specific hostile act. For example, it has been reported that one informant passed on information obtained by a farmer who had identified the position of a Russian missile launcher – which was replaced by a hole in the ground the next day. While difficult to confirm, it would seem that the relevant information here was used to provide targeting coordinates and, therefore, was an integral part of a specific military operation. Similarly, Ukrainian informant Dollar, a civilian who had been providing targeting coordinates and other information on Russian operations, provided information on a hotel hosting Russian officers to his handler at the Security Service of Ukraine, with the hotel later being bombed. A further example of civilian involvement stems from U.S. officials who noted that an underground of intelligence informants helped lead to Russia’s withdrawal from Kherson – providing little insight on the information structure and in how far information was used for distinct military operations. In contrast, Reuters reports on an interview with a former policeman who has been gathering intelligence on collaborators, leading to criminal investigations. Such general information gathering, or the reporting of information on potential war crimes, would not be considered DPH given that there is no direct causal link, the belligerent nexus is missing and the intelligence obtained does not form an integral part of a military operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of civilian intelligence gathering is clear: a wide net of undercover informants, who can quickly communicate essential information with the help of smart phones, is critical to the war effort. The Ukrainian Defence Minister has reportedly even awarded decorations to civilian informants for cooperation with the armed forces. However, again it must be noted that it is pivotal that civilians understand the risks and consequences of their activities, including under international humanitarian law, and can, therefore, come to an informed decision about their activities. This is especially key given that enemy soldiers may not be able to distinguish between regular use of a phone and intelligence gathering amounting to DPH in the fog of war, and while any party must adhere to the principle of distinction and, when in doubt, consider civilians to be protected, such legal rule may not in practice always be adhered to. It is thus key that civilians gathering intelligence are aware of such risks and implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-hybrid-warfare-the-ukrainian-it-army-and-civilian-cyber-defence&quot;&gt;4 Hybrid Warfare, the Ukrainian IT Army and Civilian Cyber Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 26 February 2022, Kykhaylo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Digital Transformation announced the launch of an IT Army on Twitter and called upon “digital talents” to join a Telegram channel “to continue the fight on the cyber front”, promising “tasks for everyone”. While many of the details about their activities are unknown or at least not confirmed by official sources, some suggest that over 400 000 people have joined the Ukrainian IT army, many of whom are from outside Ukraine. Although there have been repeated statements that there is no coordination between the Ukrainian government and the cyber IT army, a list of targets, including a number of Russian and Belarussian businesses, banks as well as governmental departments, was initially published in the Telegram chat in which administrators continue to post targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, knowledge of the IT army’s activities remains limited, especially from official sources. Initially, it had been reported that members have conducted a number of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against Russian and Belarussian targets, including against the Kremlin, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Defence, as well as the Moscow Stock Exchange. Furthermore, members of the IT army have been said to patch vulnerabilities and thereby defend Ukrainian networks from Russian attacks. Other reported activities include gathering intelligence through espionage operations. However, some reports find that the IT Army is “purely offensive in nature” and conducts offensive cyber operations against a number of targets, including Russian civilian infrastructure or online pharmacies. As there is little authoritative information on the IT army’s activities, these activities must be assessed with caution but even if they are hypothetical, they raise key questions for the application of IHL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the considerations raised in Section 3 on the question of what is considered to be direct participation in hostilities by civilians, this IT army raises new questions for the concept and its application to hybrid warfare and especially to civilians who participate in the conduct of cyber operations in the wider context of armed conflicts. Against this backdrop, this section considers whether members of the cyber IT army constitute civilians who are directly participating in hostilities (4.1), whether they form a levée en masse (4.2) or whether they indeed must be considered combatants under new reform proposals (4.3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;41-are-the-members-of-the-it-army-civilians-directly-participating-in-hostilities&quot;&gt;4.1 Are the Members of the IT Army Civilians Directly Participating in Hostilities?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian IT army is also sometimes referred to as cyber volunteers or civilian volunteer hackers. Such names carry a different connotation than describing the group as an IT army. What is in the name then, and are the participants of this group actually civilians? According to Art. 5 of the ICRC customary international humanitarian law study, civilians are negatively defined as those who are not combatants. Combatants, in turn, are members of the regular armed forces of one of the parties to the armed conflict. For the purpose of this section, the IT army is not incorporated into the regular structures under the Ukrainian armed forces (on reform plans, see section 4.3). However, some distinguish between the core team of the IT army which may have different, governmental support and assumes a coordinating function, than the wider membership of the IT army. While such distinction could have implications, particularly as to the status of the core group under IHL, this paper does not have further information to analyse the separate status of the “core group” of the IT army, but in line with the paper’s main theme, focuses on the implications of individual civilian participation. This paper also assumes that the Ukrainian IT army does not constitute a separate organised armed group fighting against the Russian armed forces and thereby engaging in a separate non-international armed conflict. To do so, the group in question would have to be sufficiently organised, able to implement IHL norms and also be “capable of engaging in sufficiently intense violence with their adversary”. Even where the organisational requirement is interpreted loosely, the IT army does not identify itself as distinguished group, but instead, members have indicated in interviews that they see themselves as part of the Ukrainian army and they do not fulfil the necessary threshold of violence or intensity of protracted armed violence as set out in the Tadic judgment. The analysis is thus based on the assumption that the individuals of the IT army are civilians in an international armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the members of the IT army are not combatants but indeed civilians, do their activities nevertheless carry consequences for the application of IHL? If participants in the IT army are not combatants, but civilians, they can nevertheless lose their civilian protection if they are directly participating in hostilities. As explained above, DPH requires three elements, i.e. a threshold of harm, direct causation and belligerent nexus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing whether the activities of the IT army meet the harm threshold requires a case-by-case analysis. The reported activities of the IT army have so far included DDoS attacks and fixing vulnerabilities, both activities that arguably do not meet the threshold of harm, as they do not lead to death, injury or destruction and arguably, depending on the exact target, do not adversely affect Russian military operations or military capacity. However, this does not mean that cyber operations cannot principally reach such threshold given that cyber operations that do successfully interrupt the ability of Russian armed forces to communicate or conduct logistics would adversely affect Russian military operations. Soesanto’s examples of offensive cyber operations against Russian (civilian) infrastructure mentioned previously would seemingly reach such threshold and potentially even violate the principle of distinction. Likewise, intelligence collection has in the past been considered to amount to DPH in specific circumstances. Such collection could also be conducted via cyber means. Thus it seems that irrespective of the geographical location of the members of the IT army, some of these (potential) activities may arguably still meet the relevant harm threshold to constitute DPH. This has also been confirmed by the ICRC’s guide on DPH that finds that “Electronic interference with military computer networks could also suffice” to meet the threshold of harm. The authors of this paper find that it is unlikely that general defensive activities, such as patching the vulnerabilities of Ukrainian networks to protect them from Russian cyber- attacks, would meet the harm threshold, but that certain offensive cyber operations, e.g. to interrupt Russian military communications, would indeed meet such threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even where they do, these activities would also still have to fulfil the other two requirements of DPH, i.e. have direct causation and belligerent nexus. To establish a direct causal link, the activity in question must result or be likely to result in harm or be an integral part of a coordinated military operation causing such harm. Currently, little is known about how the activities of the IT army link to other military operations or their direct impact on Russian capabilities. Thus it is not always evident that there is a direct causal link between some of these activities and the harm caused, especially where they contribute to the wider defence of Ukrainian networks or general intelligence efforts. In light of Ukrainian claims that the IT army does not coordinate with the Ukrainian military, it also has not been confirmed that these activities form an integral part of coordinated military operations. However, depending on the activities and the context of each of these, and possibly coordination that is not publicly acknowledged, it is generally feasible that activities conducted by members of the IT army could fulfil the direct causation requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the activities in question must be committed to directly cause the required threshold of harm in support of a party to the conflict and the detriment of the other (belligerent nexus). It seems likely that activities by a hacktivist or a civilian joining the IT army, out of support for the Ukrainian state fighting against the Russian enemy, would meet this requirement. However, little is publicly known about the exact involvement of the participants or their link to the hostilities. One news report states that participants “have different motives, and they use different cyber weapons, from simple tools for online vandalism to sophisticated cyber operations. But they are united in their goal: to support besieged Ukraine”. In that sense, it seems likely that belligerent nexus can be established for specific activities. However, the question arises how loosely such requirement can be interpreted. While some might argue any cyber security measure taken by one party has, in turn, a negative impact on the enemy’s military capacity, such interpretation would go too far in the eyes of the authors of this paper who consider that generic cyber security measures such as fixing vulnerabilities, therefore, do not have a sufficient belligerent nexus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it is thus possible that where members of the IT army conduct cyber operations that have an adverse affect on the military operations or capacity of the enemy, have a direct causal link with the hostilities and have a belligerent nexus, they qualify as civilians directly participating in hostilities. However, where this is not the case and the activities in question do not meet the relevant criteria, as is the case for passive defences protecting Ukraine’s networks or limiting the impact of Russia disinformation campaigns, Väljataga concludes that such activities would merely constitute indirect participation in hostilities. Indirect participation in hostilities, e.g. in the form of activities that are part of the general war effort or war-sustaining, however, does not mean that a civilian loses their protection from direct attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that civilians participating in the IT army that stay below the relevant threshold of harm and do not meet the three requirements of DPH, do not lose their civilian protection. Nevertheless, they may be violating domestic law and could be criminally charged for their activities. However, where the relevant three requirements are met and the individual in question is directly participating in hostilities, they could be directly targeted under IHL provisions for the time they are DPHing, even if such direct targeting could violate other norms of public international law where such civilian is located in a State that is not party to the conflict. Although the publicly available information on the IT army’s activities is limited, it is likely that adversarial forces may hold different information, influencing their judgment on whether or not civilians who have joined the IT army are indeed directly participating in hostilities. Furthermore, Russia has in the past advanced broad interpretations of what support of Ukrainian forces would amount to direct participation in hostilities and thus, who could be directly targeted. Nevertheless, all parties must be reminded that, where doubt as to their legal status exists, individuals must be treated as civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors of this paper would like to stress that civilians who are supporting Ukraine’s cyber efforts are not principally acting in violation of IHL but need to be able to do so on an informed basis. As such, they must be made aware about the legal and practical consequences of their actions. However, where “a growing number of (…) volunteers with little experience in cybersecurity who run hacker programs without fully understanding how they work” are joining these efforts, it is highly questionable whether they are sufficiently informed about the consequences their activities may carry. Arguably, it is up to them to inform themselves before joining such group and conducting these cyber operations, but it is at least questionable whether a State that directly benefits from their activities, if not at least passively supports their activities, has at the very least a moral – if not a legal – obligation to provide information that helps participants to make a conscious decision as to their levels of participation and the possible consequences thereof. After all, all High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions are obliged to ensure respect for the Geneva Conventions under all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;42-are-the-members-of-the-it-army-participants-in-a-levée-en-masse&quot;&gt;4.2 Are the Members of the IT Army Participants in a Levée en Masse?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper has so far argued that the members of the IT army do not form part of the regular armed forces or a separate organised armed group, it could also be considered whether they are participants in a levée en masse. Participants in a levée en masse are “inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy, spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war”. Where participants of the IT army are indeed also participants in a levée en masse, they enjoy prisoner of war status and combatant immunity. However, the application of these requirements to the Ukrainian IT army is unclear, especially given the lack of detailed information on its operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it is unclear as to how far participants of the IT army are “inhabitants” of Ukraine. Whereas, some members may certainly be, it is suspected that a number of individuals who hail from across the globe, i.e. non-inhabitants of Ukraine, have also joined the IT army, or at least have joined the respective Telegram channel. However, those non-inhabitants of Ukraine – whether they are Ukrainian or not – cannot form part of a levée en masse. This first requirement is thus likely only fulfilled in part. Even where non-inhabitants of Ukraine use Ukrainian infrastructure to conduct cyber operations, such limited involvement is not permanent enough to consider them inhabitants of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, participants of the levée en masse must act within an unoccupied territory and to resist the invading forces. In this context, it is clear that the activities in question must be conducted against Russian armed forces. However, what constitutes occupied territory may be less clear, as the situation continues to develop dynamically. The factual uncertainties aside, where it can be established that the Russian armed forces hold effective control and occupy a certain area, inhabitants in such territories could not be participants of a levée en masse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a third requirement, spontaneity is key. Whereas little is known about the actual level of organisation and planning within the IT army, Buchan and Tsagourias elaborate that in their view, “the critical question is whether the group has been organised by the invaded government”. They conclude that the mere invitation or encouragement by government to join such a group does not amount to commanding or organising the relevant participants. Rena Uphoff also finds that the IT army “stood up in an ad-hoc manner without a clear structure and proven plan”. This is in line with Ukrainian officials who have repeatedly claimed that there is no coordination between the government and the cyber IT army, which they see as a volunteer group with multiple leaders. However, some have described the IT army as “government-led” and others consider that “its level of organisation and subordination to the Ukrainian government seems a degree too high for it to be viewed as a levée en masse”. The level of coordination and organisation between the IT army and the Ukrainian government and, therefore, the degree of spontaneity, thus remains subject to speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is unclear whether the members of the Ukrainian IT army carry their arms openly – or what this requirement even constitutes in cyberspace – and whether they adhere to IHL. Given that the ICJ held in the Nuclear Weapons advisory opinion that a weapon can be any instrument that causes harmful effects, this means that the necessary hardware and software used by the members of the IT army could constitute such weapons. However, carrying them openly is also needed. Buchan and Tsagourias argue that for the levée en masse, this means visibly in line with the 1960 Commentary. However, visibility with respect to “cyber weapons” is of course of limited practicality. While a laptop or computer may very well be visible, it is arguably invisible components such as malware that are decisive, especially given that any civilian would nowadays also be likely to carry around a phone or laptop, thus being indistinguishable from members of the IT army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the limited information available, it is also unclear whether the members of the IT army currently comply with the IHL rules. Victor Zhora, a senior Ukrainian cyber official, stressed that the IT army only targets military targets, but some have questioned these assessments, e.g. by pointing out that the Moscow Stock Exchange is a civilian target. Similarly, Soesanto finds that civilian infrastructure has been targeted by the Ukraine IT army. While formerly civilian objects may under certain conditions constitute legitimate military targets, it is nevertheless uncertain to what extent the members of the IT army adhere to IHL rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude, the participants of the Ukrainian IT army are – at least given the limited information available – unlikely to meet the requirements necessary to constitute a levée en masse. This is especially in light of the continued operations throughout the armed conflict and the level of coordination and, therefore, lacking the spontaneity that must be assumed. It follows that they do not enjoy combatant privilege nor are they entitled to prisoner of war status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;43-will-the-it-army-be-integrated-into-the-ukrainian-armed-forces&quot;&gt;4.3 Will the IT Army Be Integrated into the Ukrainian Armed Forces?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New developments indicate that Ukraine wants to incorporate its IT army into its regular armed forces. While aiming for an established cyber command section within the Ukrainian armed forces is not a surprise, the proposal seeks to continue to involve volunteer hackers. Such structure has also been implemented by the Estonian Cyber Defence Unit on which the Ukrainian plans have been modelled, seeking to build a cyber reserve, after training personnel as part of their mandatory service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are currently no further updates on the restructuring of the IT army, if active members of the IT army assume a role within the Ukrainian armed forces, this could change their legal status under IHL. If their plans are indeed based on the Estonian Cyber Defence Unit, it is likely that the Ukrainian model would also constitute a volunteer corps that is, however, part of the armed forces as it also falls under army command structures in armed conflict. As such, active members would then qualify as combatants in line with Article 4(a)(2) GCIII assuming that they fulfil the respective requirements. Where this is the case, members of the IT army would gain combatant privilege, meaning they can lawfully participate in the ongoing armed conflict against Russia, but they would, therefore, also lose their civilian protection and could be directly targeted, both by cyber and conventional means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of this plan, however, are currently unclear. For example, it is not evident how the Ukrainian army would treat foreigners located outside Ukrainian territory who have so far informally joined the IT army. Nevertheless, further steps taken by the Ukrainian government will likely clarify this. Until then, their participation in Ukrainian cyber operations or in support thereof must be assessed with caution. While volunteers provide effective support for Ukraine’s defence against an unlawful intervention and brutal invasion from Russia, their activities can carry severe consequences – not all of which may be clear to those who are civilians and have not been educated and informed about their status and its legal implications under IHL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-concluding-thoughts&quot;&gt;5 Concluding Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania offer valuable insights into how civilian populations can be effectively incorporated into national defence strategies, drawing from their extensive experience in successful non-violent civilian defence. While civilian defence was initially regarded primarily as a non-violent means of maintaining social cohesion and upholding national values, this perception has evolved over time. Our analysis of the Baltic Republics’ defence strategies reveals that civilians are not only encouraged to engage in typical non-violent civilian defence work but to also participate in activities that may potentially meet the threshold for DPH. Non-violent defensive actions cannot cross the threshold to DPH. On the other hand, engaging in violent civilian defence can potentially lead to civilians engaging in DPH. However, such strategies are not in violation of IHL per se – whether they might violate state responsibility is yet another question that cannot be addressed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, and in response to the increasing threat from Russia, civilian defence has morphed into a more blended approach, combining non-violence and violence. A civilian secretary is likely aware that picking up a rifle to join in their country’s defence (irrespective of whether it is a case of levée en masse or not) will mean they are participating in hostilities and, therefore, become a legitimate target. However, a student who is skilled in it and participates in certain cyber-attacks, might not be aware that they are crossing the threshold to DPH and can become a target for lethal force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic countries have shown examples of how civilians can be included in resisting foreign aggression. While it may not be necessary to allow or encourage civilians to engage in violent acts, and such civilianisation of conflict comes with considerable risks, it certainly is necessary to, at the very least, address civilian resilience against hybrid threats. Consequently, NATO and Western states should urgently consider the Baltics’ example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia further underlines the crucial element that civilians play in national defence. Whether in the form of civilian protest, keeping up morale and Ukrainian identity, or by war-sustaining efforts on or offline – examples of how civilian Ukrainians contribute to their defence are manifold. Yet the war in Ukraine also underlines that, whereas civilian contributions may continue to take place in traditional forms, like making camouflage covers or Molotov cocktails, civilian defence contributions in the 21st century may also entail a cyber element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine also exposes the challenge of determining the legal consequences of civilians’ actions, especially assessing when civilian activities qualify as DPH, particularly in the absence of adequate factual information. Civilians often have limited access to comprehensive information, both due to their relative lack of resources and the complex nature of conflict information. Consequently, assessing the extent to which their contributions are integral to military operations and potentially amount to DPH becomes difficult. This means that both based on the limited information that civilians may hold, but also a likely lack of information and understanding about the legal consequences their activities may carry, it will be difficult for civilians to assess the degree to which their contributions are, for example, integral to military operations, and, as a result, amount to DPH which would mean that they lose their protection from direct attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, informing civilians about the implications of their actions is key. While the need for the Ukrainian government to recruit digital skills for their cyber defence or for civilians supplying information is evident and understandable when defending themselves in an armed conflict that seeks to eliminate a sovereign state, this does not mean that the Ukrainian government does not hold at least a moral, if not also a legal, responsibility to inform its civilians about the consequences of their involvement under international humanitarian law. The same applies to any other State seeking to develop defence strategies that include civilian participation of a violent and non-violent kind. Of course, the two researchers writing this paper have limited access to information that confirms the degree to which information sharing on such matters occurs already, for example through warning notifications when using relevant apps or cyber tools. Therefore, this section has been written with caution, merely confirming the central importance of educating all participants – civilian or not – of an armed conflict, about their rights and obligations, but also of the legal consequences of their involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last question the authors sought to address in this paper was whether Baltic and Ukrainian civilian defence strategies are the next logical step in (hybrid) warfare? While civilian direct participation in hostilities per se is compatible with existing IHL, the authors hope that States refrain from encouraging their civilian populations to engage in acts that cross the threshold to DPH. Otherwise, the principle of distinction could lose its bite and dramatically increase civilian deaths and suffering – the very thing the Geneva Conventions sought to minimise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英曾草擬公開信 預計國安法生效、一旦入獄後發布&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MnmIHNL.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第104日審訊，黎智英第12日作供。辯方圍繞黎的意圖提問，開始進入國安法生效之後的7月1日。黎當日早上向數名泛民及員工傳送訊息，指國安法條文「辣到離譜」、「香港將無法治無自由，政府行政無法無天，我們寸步難移，動彈不得」，形容「香港已死」。黎稱知道國安法生效之後，呼籲制裁變了刑事罪行，他否認有繼續相關行為，「這樣做是自殺式的（It’s suicidal to do so）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，黎曾向其教父兼《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn 提交文章「來自香港監獄的信（Letter from a Hong Kong Jail）」，一旦入獄後供外媒發布，但其後改變主意。信件有兩段談及黎向美國人說的話、希望美國人不要忘記香港人，惟黎否認請求外國制裁、封鎖或敵對行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法生效後李兆富退出管理twitter-黎否認立法後呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;國安法生效後李兆富退出管理Twitter 黎否認立法後呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月30日晚國安法生效，昨日黎提到他晚上9時許便睡覺。辯方指，負責管理黎 Twitter 帳戶的李兆富於7月1日凌晨約3時傳送訊息給黎，提出交由其他人管理Twitter帳戶會較好（But it’d be better if your presence on Twitter will be managed by someone else.），並向黎道歉（I am really sorry）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎相隔一段時間，於7月1日早上接近7時回覆李，表示會與其助手 Mark Simon 商討其他人選。黎亦向李提到：「我剛讀了國安法細節，它們非常嚴厲，是對香港法治和自由的嚴重攻擊，很傷心，香港已死。你保持低調是正確的，我們數天後再談吧。這是很嚴重的事情。」（Simon, I just read the details of National Security Law. They are very draconian and a severe attack on HK’s rule of law and freedom. So sad. HK is dead. You’re right to stay low profile. A couple of days later let’s talk a bit more. This is really serious stuff. Cheers, Jimmy）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎向李說「保持低調是正確的」，為何李想低調？黎指「因為很危險。」辯方指國安法生效之前，黎很多時提及制裁，但國安法生效之後，黎是否知道已變了刑事罪行？黎同意，並稱所以他說國安法嚴厲。辯方接著問黎有否繼續呼籲制裁？黎稱：「沒有，這樣做是自殺式的（It’s suicidal to do so）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展出黎與Mark Simon之間的訊息，Mark Simon 指，因李替黎管理Twitter一事被曝光，李感到不開心。黎則向Mark Simon 坦承是他告訴別人，因為想將功勞歸予李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向多名泛民傳送訊息指國安法非常嚴厲-香港已死&quot;&gt;黎向多名泛民傳送訊息指國安法非常嚴厲 「香港已死」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎將李兆富的說話轉述給 Mark Simon 之後，黎也向Mark 提到：「國安法細節剛公布，它們非常嚴厲，是對香港法治和自由的嚴重攻擊，很傷心，香港已死！」（The details of National Security Law just came out. They’re very draconian and a severe attack on HK’s rule of law and freedom. So sad. HK is dead!）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎同日向民主黨創黨主席李柱銘傳送類似的訊息：「國安法細節剛公布，條文非常嚴厲，是對香港法治和自由的嚴重攻擊，很傷心，香港已死！」（The details of National Security Law just came out. The terms are very draconian and is a severe attack on HK’s rule of law and freedom. So sad. HK is dead.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何向不同人傳送相同的東西？黎表示：「因為這是我當時的想法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英亦向民主黨何俊仁傳送訊息：「看了國安法細節簡直辣到離譜，香港將無法治無自由，政府行政完全無法無天，我們寸步難移，動彈不得，我們真的要想清楚以後的策略。」黎亦向同是民主黨的李永達傳送一模一樣的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎也有向陳沛敏傳送訊息：「沛敏，看了國安法細節嚇了一跳，辣到離譜，香港將無法治和自由，政府行政無法無天，泛民寸步難移，動彈不得，先要想好策略對付，不容魯莽。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指管理層對國安法很小心-相信有研究條文&quot;&gt;黎指管理層對國安法很小心 相信有研究條文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於7月1日向林文宗傳送類似訊息。林回覆時提到國安法不止惡，還很嚴厲，「我們也要好好研究當中對付傳媒的條文」。辯方問黎，管理層和黎自己有研究嗎？黎相信管理層有研究，因他們對於國安法的影響很小心，至於他自己，則等待他們的研究結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦稱，在國安法之前，他曾有一次出席張劍虹安排的國安法研討會。至於黎沒有出席的研討會，辯方問其他人事後有否轉述討論內容給黎？黎則稱認為沒有需要，因其他人都知道他會很謹慎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎國安法前撰信-預計入獄後供外媒發布&quot;&gt;黎國安法前撰信 預計入獄後供外媒發布&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎的教父兼《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn，在2020年7月1日早上7時傳送一篇黎的文章「來自香港監獄的信（Letter from a Hong Kong Jail）」。McGurn 指黎在較早前傳送了此文章給他，並提醒黎若有任何地方需要修改，現在便要提出，「我相信會很有力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的信開首提到：「如果你正在讀這封信，代表我正在監獄裡，拜中國共產黨司法所賜。」（If you are reading this, it means I am in jail, courtesy of Chinese Communist justice.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「但是我有很棒的同伴。相比起在外面，我在這裡更自由。一旦當權者將捍衛真相和法治打成罪行時，哪裡應是一個誠實的人的容身之處呢？」（But I am in excellent company. In some ways I am freer here than I was outside. When authorities make it a crime to stand up for truth and the rule of law, where else should an honest man be?）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又提到：「我是一個老人。發生在我身上的事並不重要。未來是屬於年輕人的。大部份香港年輕人未曾活在英國殖民統治底下，或是被中共直接統治，但是他們知道自由是什麼，而他們亦知道北京的主子堅決地不讓他們享受自由。香港新一代人從共產主義得到第一身教訓，而他們永不會接受它。」（I am an old man. What happens to me does not matter. The future belongs to the young. Most of Hong Kong’s young never lived under British colonial rule or direct Communist rule. But they know what freedom is, and they are learning that their masters in Beijing are determined they will never taste it.The rising Hong Kong generation is getting a first hand lesson in Communism, and they will never accept it.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「所以我的朋友例如美國可以做什麼？主要需記住的事，就是我們，手無寸鐵的香港人民，正在同一陣線、為了相同的原則而抗爭。如果中國是如此對待香港人——在中國歷史上創造出最繁盛和創新的社會的人們——你能想像到中國會更好地對待你們嗎？尤其是她在權力中崛起？」（So what can our friends like America do? The main thing to remember is that we the people of Hong Kong, unarmed as we are, are fighting on the same side for the same principles. If China is going to treat Hong Kong people this way – people who produced the most prosperous and innovative society in China history – can you really imagine that China will treat you any better, especially as it grows in power?）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「我一直欽佩美國，我的美國朋友，我現在處於牢房裡說這些話。我們在香港正受到中國輾壓，因為我們與你們的價值觀一致。當我們需要幫助的關頭，請不要忘記你的朋友。」（I have always admired America. To my American friends, I now say this from my jail cell. We in Hong Kong are being crushed by China because we share your values. Please do not forget your friends in our hour of need.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，他與McGurn之間是否知道黎會坐牢？黎表示這只是他的預計。被問到是否想在他入獄後發布文章，黎表示他有這樣的意圖，但是他其後吩咐 Mark Simon 不要發布。黎亦確認，該信件所述反映他當時真誠相信的想法，而他是在7月1日之前撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，信件有兩段談及黎向美國人說的話、想他們做什麼。黎確認，但他否認請求外國制裁、封鎖或敵對行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息稱中共癲咗-黎國安法超乎預期地嚴厲&quot;&gt;訊息稱「中共癲咗」 黎：國安法超乎預期地嚴厲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，2020年7月1日早上黎亦向陳沛敏提到：「今天我去籌款站幫忙籌款，不派海報，你認為怎樣？」陳回覆：「其實如果你是想公開現身作為一種姿態，海報不派也不會影響效用果。」黎回覆：「好，我就去籌站幫手籌款一陣照個相就走。中共癲咗，我們也得重新策劃以後做法。劍虹已有方案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何說「中共癲咗」，黎稱因為國安法超乎預期地嚴厲。辯方提到，黎早前供稱，認為國安法不會如期實施，以及條文不會太嚴厲。黎確認，並重申這是他的一廂情願。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關遊行期間派發海報一事，辯方提到6月29日訊息顯示，黎向民主黨李永達表示會在七一籌款街站派發3,000張海報。至7月1日，黎與張劍虹、羅偉光、林文宗和陳沛敏等管理層商討應否在街站派發海報，他們分別以訊息回覆黎時，均不建議派海報。黎確認，因為國安法實施，他們要求自己謹慎行事。辯方指，最終決定是街站不派發海報；黎則稱不是他的決定，當時有人告訴他，相信是民主派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱國安法後很小心-知道提制裁可囚終身&quot;&gt;黎稱國安法後「很小心」 知道提制裁可囚終身&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，黎在2020年6月接受史丹福大學胡佛研究所（Hoover Institution）訪問時，稱美國應該在香港絕望之前便制裁和懲罰中國，問黎在國安法實施之後，有否提倡相關主張？黎表示沒有再想過，但是強調他必定會知道提出制裁是犯法，「我對此很小心。」辯方問黎知不知道這是可以懲罰的罪行？黎表示：「可以是終身（監禁）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱以一種不同的方式抗爭-否認意指非法手段&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱以「一種不同的方式」抗爭 否認意指非法手段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月2日美聯社刊出黎智英的專訪。黎向記者稱：「我的希望持續了很久，塑造了今天的我。」（The hope I had (in Hong Kong) lasted for a long time, it made me who I am today）。黎確認說過這句話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報導引述黎稱會繼續為民主抗爭，但是現在要以「一種不同的方式」進行（Lai said he will continue fighting for democracy, but it will now have to be in a “very different way.”）。黎確認他曾說過「為民主抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，「一種不同的方式」是什麼意思。黎指：「我意思是這會不同，有新的法律，所以我們的行動應該改變，我們的態度應該改變。」辯方追問有什麼不同。黎說當日只是國安法生效第二日，僅說會十分不同，但他提到：「我還未放棄為民主抗爭，但是這將會是十分不同，所以我們才需要改變。」辯方問黎是否意指使用非法手段抗爭？黎說：「不是，所以我才會說不同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪稱不會離開-不但令自己蒙羞也使蘋果失信於人&quot;&gt;黎受訪稱不會離開 「不但令自己蒙羞，也使《蘋果》失信於人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;美聯社報導引述黎稱：「我要視乎有多少人留在抗爭陣營中」，補充指很多人會被新法律嚇怕。（“We will have to see how many of us are left in the fighting camp,” he said, adding that many will be frightened away by the new law.）黎稱：「我們要站起來，成為運動團結的支柱，以及香港公義的氣節。」（“We will have to stand up and be the backbone of the movement’s integrity, and the integrity of Hong Kong’s justice,” he said.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，上述說話意思是留下來抗爭的人，會成為運動團結的支柱，而「運動團結的支柱」（backbone of the movement’s integrity）是指未有放棄的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報導指黎拒絕闡述民主運動會怎樣繼續，只說需要討論如何前進。（Lai declined to elaborate on how the pro-democracy movement will continue, saying that discussions are needed on how to move forward.）辯方問黎跟誰人討論，黎說那些留下來抗爭的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報導引述黎說：「我不能（離開），如果我離開，不但令自己蒙羞，也使《蘋果》失信於人，我會削弱民主運動的團結⋯⋯有些事情我一定要負責任。」（“I cannot (leave). If I leave, not only do I disgrace myself, I’d discredit Apple Daily, I’d undermine the solidarity of the democratic movement,” he said. “It’s something I have to take responsibility for.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上確認曾說上述言論。辯方指黎當時因為刑事恐嚇案的保釋條件而不能離開香港，並且曾向高院申請離港，但是被拒絕，辯方呈上相關判決理由。黎確認自己不能離開香港，並提到「任何其他方式也不行。」在辯方追問下，黎進一步解釋：「我是說我不能夠離開香港，但是如果我想離開香港，我總有方法⋯⋯你知道，一些非法途徑⋯⋯」黎最後同意他並沒有意圖如此做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李兆富請辭8小時之後-黎稱李會繼續管理-twitter-帳戶&quot;&gt;李兆富請辭8小時之後 黎稱李會繼續管理 Twitter 帳戶&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，2020年7月1日上午約11時，即李兆富提出請辭約8小時之後，Mark Simon 向黎發送訊息：「我正跟他（李兆富）溝通。我會盡我所能協助他。（I’m communicating with him now. I will do all I can for him.）」黎回覆：「他現在起將會繼續管理我的Twitter 。如果他返回美國，他可以在那裡替我管理帳戶，所以不需要找其他人了。（He’s going to continue to manage my Twitter for now. If he goes back to US he can manage it there for me. So no need to find someone else now.）」Mark Simon 指：「他（李）說他會做 Twitter 多幾星期，他將於7月8日返回美國，但他在當地可以繼續做一段時間。我告訴他只要留在美國便應該沒有問題，如果有人問起，我們會說他已沒有做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示黎與李之間的訊息，李提出請辭之後，黎依然繼續傳送新聞及資料給李。而黎的Twitter帳戶在7月1日仍有發布帖文。黎稱帖文是出自李的手筆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，黎收到李的請辭之後，有改變主意嗎？黎指李身在美國，若他在當地管理帳戶，會使他較心安。辯方指訊息使用「返回美國」字眼，是否代表李來自美國？黎同意，並指李在美國有個家庭。黎提到李在國安法生效之前已離開香港，惟法官李運騰引述 Mark Simon 的訊息提及李「將於7月8日返回美國」。辯方則表示會要求控方作進一步披露，關於李的出境紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問及，李是否本案「串謀者」之一？控方確認，指李是「串謀發布煽動刊物」及「串謀勾結外國勢力」兩罪的串謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指國安法不透明不清楚紅線&quot;&gt;黎指國安法不透明、不清楚紅線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年7月1日接受《霍士新聞》（Fox News）訪問，並庭上播放相關片段。黎表示會留在香港直至最後一刻，「不，我不能離開，如果我離開，我令自己蒙羞，我令《蘋果日報》名譽受損，我也損害民主運動的團結。（“I can’t go away, if I go away, I disgrace myself, I discredit Apple Daily, I also undermine the solidarity of the democratic movement.”）」主持人指他曾被捕數次，所涉罪名或能判終身監禁。黎回應稱不知道將會發生什麼事，「但當政府不尊重法律，你不會知道紅線在哪。」他又批評政府不理會人民，既然不知道紅線在哪，便不會予以理會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述黎稱「你不會知道紅線在哪」，黎確認並指「國安法下沒有紅線，它是非常不透明（opaque）。」辯方指，黎既已知道國安法之下請求制裁是超越「紅線」，那麼他口中的「紅線」是指什麼呢？黎僅指，就國安法而言，真的不知道什麼會是犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下星期一（9日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

And they tend to work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, former vice president Mike Pence and Ed Feulner of the Heritage Foundation argued in the Washington Post that the United States has a duty to defend Taiwan. They praised the United States’ role as a global superpower and asked, “What is distance to a global superpower? . . . America remains the world’s only true superpower, fully capable of projecting forces to every corner of the earth.” While the authors are correct about the United States’ dominant global role, they understate the operational complexity of applying military power in an adversary’s backyard. This issue is important to consider, given that support from the American public for defending Taiwan is higher now than it has ever been. This public favor should be tempered by military professionals and policymakers, as operations within range of China’s defense forces present challenges that the U.S. military has not dealt with in generations. With that in mind, the decision to commit forces to a Taiwan conflict should not be made hastily. While many tools are available, a wise superpower employs the tactics that have the highest odds of success. A superpower’s relative power when operating in an adversary’s backyard is less than its absolute power globally. If military action is required in China’s backyard, the United States cannot expect to fight like a dominant power, achieving an overmatch and winning handily. Instead, it will need to adopt the agile tactics of an underdog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While many tools are available, a wise superpower employs the tactics that have the highest odds of success.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After decades as a superpower, the United States is unaccustomed to being on the weaker side of a conflict. In 1991, in response to Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait, the United States demonstrated its vast power projection and decisively defeated the Iraqi army in days. During the Global War on Terror, the United States crossed land and sea without interference to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, in Syria, a U.S. special forces team leader can destroy ISIS strongholds with precision and without endangering himself or his team. These displays of battlefield superiority have imbued an entire generation of military and political leaders with a sense of superiority. A better term might be hubris, as this way of thinking is founded on overconfidence and an underestimation of adversaries. Senior leaders, conditioned by decades of maneuver, air, and information superiority, tend to assume that the United States must represent the militarily superior side in any conflict. This attitude, in turn, influences decisions on force development, organization, and military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. joint force takes such an approach in the South China Sea, it will face multiple dilemmas. A dominant superpower, as described by Pence and Feulner, is “fully capable of projecting forces to every corner of the earth. Distance has no bearing on our responsibility to safeguard American interests.” Dominant powers often demonstrate military strength in order to deter a change in the status quo or to compel a weaker power to comply with demands. In other words, they sometimes “escalate to de-escalate.” These actions would signal that the United States is the stronger power, and that any interference would be met with overwhelming force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age-old concepts like interior lines and new Chinese military capabilities offset the relative superiority of U.S. military might. In any Taiwan contingency, China would enjoy the advantages of interior lines. A line of operation conveys a military force from its bases to the enemy. When a force spreads outward from a central point, interior lines allow for faster and less costly movement, resupply, air defense, and electronic warfare protection. Alternatively, a force forms exterior lines when converging on an enemy from multiple directions. History offers many examples of successful land battles using exterior lines. Exterior lines in oceanic theaters such as the Pacific, however, require substantial resources to protect and sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Indo-Pacific theater, relative distances are significant. Consider mapmaker Andrew Rhodes’ image (Fig. 1) above, with Taiwan at the center. Each potential U.S. approach — from the Philippines in the south, from Guam in the center, and from South Korea and Japan in the north — is within range of Chinese anti-ship/anti-access detection. China is about 400 miles away from the Philippines, and about 100 miles from Taiwan; in contrast, Hawaii is over 5,000 miles from both places. Given this distance, the United States would have to fight just to get to the fight. Long exterior operational lines incur higher risk, as they present adversaries with increased opportunities to disrupt, delay, and deny operations. In a combat situation, China could exploit the natural vulnerabilities of exterior lines, using its substantial military investments to achieve dominance in the Pacific theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/S9ByYdU.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s weapons capabilities and locations give it further near-abroad advantages. As the United States waged the Vietnam War, it did so with freedom of naval maneuver, which enabled ship-to-shore fighter attacks, uninterrupted personnel and munitions resupply, and long-range bombing; still, victory was elusive. There will be no such freedom of maneuver in China’s near abroad. Beijing’s investments in the South China Sea have exemplified the term Anti-Access, Area Denial (A2AD) — the combination of sensors, weapons, and capabilities that prevent an opposing force from entering — and are continuing to grow larger. While the United States focuses its military spending on global presence, China’s military spending is largely focused on the first and second island chains, those islands closest to its mainland. In August 2024, the CSIS ChinaPower series outlined how China could quarantine or blockade Taiwan. Figure 2 from that series shows that any intervention in the South China Sea would face a multidomain operational kill box, deliberately built and refined to prevent the United States and its partners from intervening militarily. Dominant power tactics that are usually peaceful — like shows of force and freedom-of-navigation operations — could be met with a response, lethal or not, within the Chinese sphere of influence. If a miscalculation occurs and violence ensues, Chinese anti-ship, anti-air, and long-range artillery could quickly cause unacceptable U.S. losses. Given the geographic realities and China’s strong capabilities in its near abroad, U.S. military planners should avoid seeking dominance and instead use the tools of the underdog in crafting military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tools-of-the-underdog&quot;&gt;Tools of the Underdog&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one side has less power than the other, it is by definition the underdog; however, when the weaker side accepts risks and aggressively tries to win against the odds, it demonstrates a scrappy mentality that is conducive to success. In his book David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell observed a variety of underdogs and misfits as they battled more powerful adversaries, and he asserted that approaching challenges with an underdog mentality unlocks a bevy of tools and tactics that are beyond a ruling power’s imagination, exploiting its hubris. A review of six underdog campaigns in modern history reveals three underdog tactics that could be useful in future warfare: novel use of readily available things (NURAT), deception, and avoiding adversary strengths. The combination of one or more of these tactics demonstrates an underdog mentality and should contribute to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vignette-1-te-lawrence-in-arabia-1917&quot;&gt;Vignette 1: T.E. Lawrence in Arabia, 1917&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of T.E. Lawrence and his Arab irregulars is relevant: it provides an example of a major power — the United Kingdom — employing small bands of guerrilla forces against another major power — the Ottoman Empire — within that power’s near abroad. The United Kingdom made ingenious use of available technologies in this asymmetrical fight. Dynamite, for instance, was broadly available due to its use in railway construction. Lawrence and his fighters used dynamite to destroy remote Ottoman rail lines. Lawrence’s tactics were also deceptive: strikes on railways and bridges created an impression of a much larger force. The Ottomans responded by spreading their forces thin to secure their outposts, leaving fewer garrison forces to defend against conventional British assaults later in the war. Lawrence also avoided his adversary’s strengths during the seizure of the port of Aqaba: instead of engaging in a pitched battle supported by British naval guns, Lawrence led his guerillas across miles of vast desert to surprise and overwhelm Aqaba’s loosely defended desert fortifications. By embracing the role of the underdog, the Arab irregulars were able to inflict serious damage on a power much larger than them, and Lawrence’s leadership in this fight provides a model for special forces’ advice and assistance missions worldwide. The Ottoman Empire collapsed for a variety of reasons, but Lawrence’s Arab uprising hastened its fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vignette-2-finland-in-the-winter-war-1941&quot;&gt;Vignette 2: Finland in the Winter War, 1941&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1941, the Soviet Union sought to quickly seize Finland in a rapid advance across a narrow stretch of shared border. Knowing it could not compete against the dominant Soviet forces, Finland prepared for an asymmetric defense. For anti-tank warfare, the Finns mixed high-proof alcohol, gasoline, and tar in wine bottles, inventing the Molotov cocktail. When thrown, the cocktails’ flaming, sticky substance would enter enemy tanks’ air hatches, suffocating engines and crew members alike. Finnish soldiers also used their superior knowledge of the snowy terrain to decimate the Soviets with sniper, demolition, and hit-and-run tactics. Their snow and ice equipment — including machine guns on skis — gave maximum mobility to their fighters. One Finnish tactic — named motti, or “chopped firewood” — involved sending ski troopers to attack and “cut apart” road-bound enemy units from the flanks and rear. Deceiving the Soviets, the Finns hid anti-tank and machine-gun posts in well-camouflaged ambush positions and baited Soviet forces to attack targets accessible only by roads surveilled by those posts. Motti tactics did not focus on Soviet strengths, but instead exploited their weaknesses, often doing so during vulnerable periods (while in convoy or at rest). Although the Finns ceded territory, their motti tactics helped prevent total occupation, a fate that befell neighboring Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vignette-3-the-united-states-in-normandy-1944&quot;&gt;Vignette 3: The United States in Normandy, 1944&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States planned the D-Day landings from a position of disadvantage. In 1943, when U.S., British, and Soviet leaders agreed on an Allied invasion, the Allies had 37 divisions compared to the Axis’ 60. To secure a beachhead against those odds, the United States invested in hundreds of “Higgins Boat” amphibious landing craft. In addition, the innovative Norden bombsight enabled precision bombing from the air to suppress and attack defenses. The selection of Normandy instead of Calais was deceptive, as Calais was closer to German lines. In general, U.S. deception efforts in support of the D-Day landings were legendary, ranging from General Patton using a “Ghost Army” of inflatable tanks to suggest a Calais landing to a fake radio transmission that described the Normandy landings as a feint. In this example, the Allies did not avoid the adversary’s strength; they attacked Fortress Europe along the coast that Nazi Germany planned to defend. But their array of innovations and creative deceptions enabled them to gain a foothold — and eventually, victory — in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vignette-4-egypt-in-the-yom-kippur-war-1973&quot;&gt;Vignette 4: Egypt in the Yom Kippur War, 1973&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel performed well and embarrassed its Arab opponents. Six years later, Egypt and Syria were determined to retaliate. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Egypt’s forces acquired new Soviet surface-to-air missiles and anti-tank Sagger missiles to counter Israeli air supremacy and armored advantage. In addition, Egypt developed high-pressure water hoses to shape the banks of the Suez Canal into ramps, allowing for a mechanized assault. Assuming the canal to be an impenetrable obstacle, Israel was unprepared for the attack. The innovative Suez crossing, undertaken on a Jewish holiday, created a momentary period of relative advantage for Egypt. The shock of the attack took a toll on Israelis that was as much psychological as it was physical. In addition to using surprise as a tactic, Egypt combined its assaults in the south with Syrian assaults from the Golan Heights in the north. The Egyptian military actively attacked Israeli strengths — air power and armored warfare — with the latest Soviet technology, influencing force development in the United States for the next decade. Overall, the Arabs adopted an underdog mentality by launching an attack during a Jewish holiday at a location the Israeli military thought was impenetrable, exploiting the hubris of the Israeli military to achieve political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vignette-5-azerbaijan-in-nagorno-karabakh-20202023&quot;&gt;Vignette 5: Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, 2020–2023&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenian defenders enjoyed an advantage along fortifications that had protected ethnic Armenians in the disputed territory for over 30 years. To overcome this relative disadvantage, Azerbaijan acquired Turkish Bayraktar TB-2 drones that overwhelmed the Armenian defenders with superior sensing, targeting, and destructive capability. The Azerbaijanis also creatively employed older equipment to tip the balance: they repurposed biplanes — futile in modern air combat — in remotely piloted kamikaze attacks on the Armenians. In 2020, Azerbaijan decided against a ground assault on superior Armenian defensive lines and instead used drones to pinpoint precision targets for indirect fire. While both Armenia and Azerbaijan possessed similar Soviet-era military hardware, Azerbaijan surprised the Armenians — and the world — with advanced Turkish and Israeli equipment, which allowed it to overcome Armenia’s defensive advantages. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict ended with Armenia ceding the disputed territory to Azerbaijan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vignette-6-ukraine-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-2022present&quot;&gt;Vignette 6: Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine War, 2022–present&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, Ukrainian innovation has thwarted Russia’s attempt to seize the country by integrating Western munitions, modern drones, and unmanned maritime surface vessels. Mirroring U.S. investments in decoy tanks during World War II, Ukraine has invested in a “Potemkin army” of plastic and wood tanks, howitzers, and radars. But nothing has been more essential to the Ukrainian command and control system as the Starlink constellations. Starlink, free for the Ukrainian military, has become the backbone of the Ukrainian military’s communication. It unites command and control, fires, and terminal guidance for drones. As the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues, the Ukrainians are using deception to gain advantages against their larger, more powerful enemy. Many Russian propaganda videos aim to highlight battlefield victories, but actually feature the destruction of makeshift decoys that Ukrainians have either contracted or built, on site. The Ukrainian case also provides two examples — one positive and one negative — of an underdog choosing to avoid adversary strengths. First is the 2023 Kherson offensive, in which Ukraine unintentionally signaled an imminent attack in the direction of Kherson, causing the Russians to move to the south, which in turn opened an opportunity for the Ukrainians to seize Kharkiv, to the east. In this instance, a dynamic situation enabled the underdog to succeed in an area of momentary dominant power weakness. The 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive, on the other hand, is an example of an unsuccessful attack on an adversary strength. While the Russians proved mediocre in their initial attack on Ukraine, their expertise in creating multilayered defensive lines has proved formidable. The failure of the Ukrainian counteroffensive — even when aided by advanced Western equipment and munitions — supports the hypothesis that underdogs should avoid adversary strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In five of the six cases above, the underdog’s actions led to victory, and in one case the conflict is ongoing. The Finns inflicted thousands of causalities on the Soviet Union and forced them to transition from an invading force into a defense along the Finnish border; although the Finns ceded territory, they did not become a Soviet republic like neighboring Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. The United States and its allies, following the D-Day landing in 1944, went on to capture Berlin in 1945. Egypt took Israel by surprise, making large gains; however, Israel later adapted and reversed its losses. In Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan achieved a decisive victory, ending the decades-long conflict by forcing Armenia to cede the disputed territory. The Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated, despite many analysts’ assessments that the powerful Russian military would conquer Ukraine quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j84M5nx.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Evidence of Underdog Tactics in Six Vignettes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underdog tactics are not always the best methods for achieving success. Fighting like an underdog requires an acceptance of risk that might not be tolerable or acceptable to decisionmakers. The 1991 Gulf War is an example of the opposite of the underdog mentality: an overmatch mindset. In that case, the United States and partners had a relative advantage in every instrument of national power, built an overwhelming force in nearby bases, and attacked on their terms with overwhelming odds. When the dominant power has superior capabilities — such as an ability to sustain and protect lines of operation — and desires a quick and decisive victory, that power can adopt an overmatch mindset. Underdog tactics do not preclude large-scale conventional operations; in each of the historical vignettes detailed above, the underdog campaigns complemented conventional objectives. Combining techniques creates multiple dilemmas for adversaries, while also conserving finite conventional resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting like an underdog could increase the odds of success. Political scientist Ivan Arreguin-Toft concluded in How the Weak Win Wars that the weaker party succeeds against dominant powers about 63.6 percent of the time when it uses an opposite approach but only 28.5 percent of the time when it uses the same approach as the adversary. This broader analysis aligns with the results from the brief vignettes to suggest a correlation between underdog tactics and success. Since exterior line vulnerabilities and anti-access and area-denial realities flip relative power ratios against the United States in an adversary’s near abroad, recommendations for operating within that environment should adopt the tactics of the underdog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underdog tactics could be used in multiple ways to affect the outcome in a potential Taiwan contingency. Any recommendations offered without situational details are conjecture, of course; however, borrowing from historical examples can inform future actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first underdog tactic is “novel use of readily available things.” Given China’s advanced electronic warfare and anti-satellite capabilities, acquiring technologies outside of the space and cyber domains could help the United States hedge against debilitating command and control disruption. The fleets of unmanned surface vessels and unmanned aerial vehicles already in development by the Armed Services could prove to be a future novel use of readily available resources. Used dynamically, unmanned technologies enable outsized impact without risking lives, mirroring the motti tactics of the Finnish Winter War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second underdog tactic, deception, requires close interagency coordination to implement creative efforts that increase the chances of success. U.S. Special Operations Command has already invested in various small headquarters and other infrastructure in the South China Sea region and could either launch deception operations with these forces or do so in conjunction with those from other agencies. Deception efforts could resemble Patton’s Ghost Army or involve a massive information campaign that supports a similar feint from a likely yet incorrect location. Mark Cancian’s 2021 CSIS report on inflicting surprise, for instance, provided examples of creative deception operations capable of catching adversaries off guard and exploiting their vulnerabilities. The U.S. special operations community has a reputation for innovation and creativity as scrappy underdogs. Congress can amplify those efforts and underwrite risk with the right authorizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underdogs tend to avoid adversaries’ strengths. In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Egypt chose to use anti-tank missiles because Israel had demonstrated domination in a tank-on-tank matchup in 1967. When planning operations in China’s near abroad, the United States should avoid enemy strengths like electronic warfare, anti-ship missiles, and anti-aircraft defenses. Instead of planning for a pitched sea battle, the United States could deploy swarms of disposable undersea and high-altitude drones to undermine China’s ability to maintain a naval blockade. In addition, unique Taiwanese defenses on the island could disrupt Chinese objectives. Finally, threatening Chinese ports and bases worldwide could divert Beijing’s limited power projection capabilities. All of these actions could impact Chinese forces, and a strategy that combines more than one of these tactics could have a cumulative effect greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting an underdog mindset might be among the most difficult challenges for U.S. leaders. As with many presuppositions of the mind, the first step toward overcoming implicit biases is to acknowledge and actively address them. Tackling implicit hubris is especially challenging for leaders who have spent their formative years fighting the Global War on Terror, against adversaries without supremacy in any wartime domain. In their essay “Propositions on Military Deception,” Donald Daniel and Katherine Herbig note that great powers often lack experience in deception plans and need to “overcome the inertia involved in creating or revivifying them.” Leaders should challenge themselves and their staffs to appreciate and understand enemy advantages, and to accept their own relative disadvantages in certain situations. Doing so can unlock the innovation and creativity to think like an underdog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tackling implicit hubris is especially challenging for leaders who have spent their formative years fighting the Global War on Terror.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have always appreciated tales of underdogs who win against the odds. The biblical tale of David and Goliath resonates because it tells a familiar story, one that readers want to hear and are excited to repeat. David used readily available technology — a sling — and avoided Goliath’s strengths with sword and shield. Readers can appreciate the underdog mentality, one that accepts necessary risk to achieve the deception required to surprise an opponent. Despite the odds (or maybe because of them), the underdog exudes a scrappy resilience that is hard to defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict with China over Taiwan is not a sure thing. The United States is not treaty-bound to defend Taiwan, and there is no credible intelligence that President Xi has ordered a timeline for an invasion. The analysis in this review is just as applicable to Russia’s or Iran’s near abroad as it is to China’s. In any region, a superpower’s relative power when operating in an adversary’s backyard is less than its absolute power globally. And that disparity can be amplified by that adversary’s investments in anti-access, area denial, long-range precision missiles, diplomatic relations with nearby states, and economies of scale. Given strategic logic and these historical vignettes, it is clear that underdog tactics are more effective in an adversary’s near abroad than campaigns that seek dominant overmatch. Most importantly, adopting the mindset of the scrappy underdog can help a fighting force to shed hubristic biases, accept necessary risk, and open itself to creative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英：不想籲員工「抗爭到底」因「他們的人生比《蘋果日報》更加重要」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sn4x0wN.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第103日審訊，黎智英第11日作供。辯方提問圍繞《國安法》生效前黎的意圖，提到2020年6月18日，黎在《蘋果日報》25週年慶祝活動中向員工發言：「無人會迫到你哋做烈士」，籲員工：「攞住對自己嘅良知，攞住對社會嘅良知去做。」當辯方問黎有否籲員工去「抗爭到底」時，黎表示：「我沒有如此說過⋯⋯而且我不想這樣做⋯⋯因為他們的人生比《蘋果日報》更加重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認文章引起憎恨-稱僅陳述事實&quot;&gt;黎否認文章引起憎恨 稱僅陳述事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎的專欄「成敗樂一笑」文章，於2020年6月15日刊登的〈窒息中的香港人 逃亡還是抗爭〉。當中稱「國安法不僅把香港變成沒有自由法治的一般大陸城市，甚至會是新疆一樣恐怖籠罩下的集中營，怎不令香港人害怕」，辯方問黎當時是否已知道《國安法》內容？黎則估計說法只是基於坊間的傳言，因當時有很多有關《國安法》的報導和意見，所有人都關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述控方指控稱，黎在文章將英國稱呼為「前宗主國」，是意圖引起市民對政府的憎恨。黎隨即指這是事實。辯方重申這是控方的指控，問黎為何如此寫。黎指因為美國取消了香港特殊地位之後，英國履行了前宗主國的責任，賦予300萬名持有BNO護照的香港人赴英定居的權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，有否在文章中間接地請求外國制裁，黎否認，重申他只是陳述事實。辯方又指，黎在文章形容「無恥無信的政權」。黎稱是指中國政權，但他否認有意引起市民對中國政府憎恨，「我只是陳述事實⋯⋯《基本法》賦予我們的已化為烏有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指文章指稱「我們的教育制度變成了洗腦機器」，問黎有何根據？黎則稱他在文章中已說明了根據，又提到現在所有教科書，甚至圖書館的書，均受到審查。辯方提醒黎只需集中在2020年6月的情況。黎解釋，當時所有事來得非常迫切，而他有權提出相關例子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在文章中提及自己被控刑事恐嚇的案件，遭控方要求禁止出境，稱：「誰會在國安風頭火勢之下承受政治風險？我們律政司司長鄭若驊不是斬釘截鐵地說，國安法不設追溯期，是大話連篇嗎？」黎庭上稱這是他的個人意見，並無意引起對司法機關的憎恨。辯方大律師關文渭提到處理該案的法官為法官李運騰。李官隨即否認，並指刑事恐嚇案是裁判法院的案件，並非由他處理，更提到自己曾在高院批出黎的保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否在這裡意圖引起憎恨？黎稱沒有意圖引起市民憎恨司法機關，他只是陳述《國安法》所帶來的政治壓力，「而且我的案件很具政治性，沒有人想承受風險。」法官杜麗冰表示不明白，文章提到的案件是關於刑事恐嚇而非政治。黎解釋：「因為我本人已具政治性，不是我的案件。⋯⋯你知道，別人以政治的目光看待我⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李素蘭追問下，黎表示他的想法並非憑空出現，當時閱讀不同文章和報導，有相關印象，而他是基於這些印象來撰寫文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱對攬炒巴不感興趣-沒留意其與國際線有關&quot;&gt;黎稱對攬炒巴不感興趣 沒留意其與國際線有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年6月15日《蘋果》「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為〈中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗〉，其時是黎在壹傳媒大樓會見陳梓華的前一日。黎同意可能從報導標題得知「攬炒巴」劉祖廸加入國際線。辯方問黎在2020年6月的時候，有否留意到一個叫 IPAC 的組織？黎否認，重申在法庭上才首次聽聞 IPAC。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問「重光團隊」（Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）又有否聽過？黎亦說沒有聽過，即使他可能曾聽過，但是沒有印象。法官杜麗冰追問，黎剛才說有聽過 SWHK 嗎？黎解釋，因為李兆富替 Twitter 帖文加上的標籤（hashtag）含有「Stand with Hong Kong」，但他未有留意或對此留下印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示2020年10月24日的《蘋果》報導〈遊行被圍捕險洩身份 攬炒巴死裏逃生 帶署歷警暴 拒保後返英〉。辯方問黎，在2020年1月台灣陽明山會見「攬炒巴」劉祖廸的時候，是否知道劉某程度上與國際線有關？黎則稱當時未有太留意這個人，沒有深入想過。黎亦稱只曾瞥一眼上述報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，黎認為國際線是重要，而這些報導是關於國際線，黎不會有興趣看看報導內容是什麼嗎？黎稱自己讀到報導時僅留意劉一個人，多於國際線，又稱自己對劉從不感興趣，除了籲他運用影響力平息勇武派暴力之外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭一度問黎是否認識報導中顯示的外國政治人物，當中包括被指稱為「共謀者」的時任日本議員菅野志櫻里。黎則稱不認識任何一人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不一定會如期實施-其後說倘國安法實施香港會死&quot;&gt;黎稱「不一定會如期實施」 其後說倘國安法實施香港會死&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月18日，張劍虹向黎傳送新華社的網站文章，當中指《港區國安法》對四類危害國家安全的犯罪行為和刑事責任作出明確決定，包括分裂國家、顛覆國家政權、恐怖活動和勾結外國勢力危害國家安全。黎回覆：「是的，沒新意。現在是通過時間而已」，又表示：「我看不一定會如期實施。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，雖然當時《國安法》條文未公開，之所以說「沒新意」，是因為從當時的報導和傳言，對於《國安法》有粗略理解。至於「我看不一定會如期實施」，黎則表示是一廂情願（wishful thinking）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指同日，黎向李兆富傳送訊息，指香港立《國安法》後，是否取消特殊地位也沒有分別。黎庭上解釋，因為《國安法》實施之後，香港便會「死掉」，當時是回應李兆富的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎的 Twitter 帳戶發布帖文：「Whether or not the world imposes sanctions on #China and revocation of #HK’s special status as an autonomous region depends on the objective standard, ie if the #NSL is imposed, #1C2S is dead and it leaves the world with no other options.」黎稱帖文乃由李兆富撰寫，他亦不知道「1C2S」是什麼意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎曾向張劍虹稱「我看不一定會如期實施」，兩日前黎亦曾向陳梓華說《國安法》不會太嚴厲，為何現在又說若通過《國安法》香港會死掉？黎則解釋，根據李兆富的訊息，顯示立法程序會繼續，說話背景已經完全不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向員工稱無人會迫到你哋做烈士-否認籲員工戰鬥&quot;&gt;黎向員工稱「無人會迫到你哋做烈士」 否認籲員工戰鬥&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年6月18日，壹傳媒大樓舉辦《蘋果日報》25週年慶祝活動，並在庭上當日影片，黎智英身旁是張劍虹和前動新聞平台總監張志偉。黎向一眾員工發言稱：「都未曾試過風調雨順㗎。一係就話我哋血腥八卦，一係就呢個封殺廣告，一係就畀人攻擊。到依家呢，就《國安法》都嚟埋，都唔知點樣做喇真係。就靠你哋去做喇。」黎表示只要求一件事：「你哋對住《國安法》嘅做法就係，你哋用返你哋對自己嘅責任，對社會嘅責任，對你哋家庭嘅責任去做呢份工作，無人會迫你哋點樣去做，無人會迫到你哋做烈士。」黎籲員工：「攞住對自己嘅良知，攞住對社會嘅良知去做」，而他不會叫員工怎樣去做，又笑說：「《蘋果日報》到今日，做到咁樣樣，係你哋造成嘅，唔關我事㗎吓」，影片傳來笑聲和鼓掌聲。黎笑言：「《國安法》嚟唔關我事」，最後表示欣賞一眾員工付出，寄語大家繼續努力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在2020年6月10日接受《自由亞洲電台》訪問時稱：「每一個人要做自己嘅選擇，但係我哋必然會有好多人選擇留喺度抗爭，而我會同呢啲人一齊抗爭到底。」然而8日之後卻向員工說「無人會迫到你哋做烈士」，兩種說法有沒有矛盾。黎稱沒有矛盾，因他在慶祝活動發言所指的是員工的人生，但他受訪時所談論的是自己的人生，「我沒有理所當然地認為我可以談論他們的人生⋯⋯他們理應為自己的人生去做選擇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問黎有否籲員工去「抗爭到底」？黎表示：「我沒有如此說過⋯⋯而且我不想這樣做⋯⋯因為他們的人生比《蘋果日報》更加重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，截至2020年6月18日，他與《蘋果》管理層之間，有沒有任何共識去「抗爭到底」？黎否認，並稱從來沒有談論這些。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，是否認為控方會基於《國安法》之前的行為而起訴他。黎不肯定，但自言一直想法樂觀，想著最好的情況。辯方提到《國安法》沒有追溯效力。黎僅回應：「我希望是如此。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;對談節目稱若特朗普實施制裁將得到美國人民支持-黎否認請求制裁&quot;&gt;對談節目稱若特朗普實施制裁將得到美國人民支持 黎否認請求制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年6月18日在美國智庫 Acton Institute 節目，與美國神父 Robert Sirico 對談。黎稱經過新冠肺炎疫情之後，西方國家不再信任中國，並以審慎的態度與中國貿易，加上中國經濟變得衰弱，是一個好時機去改變中國。黎指，若然特朗普推行一連串的制裁和懲罰措施，會得到很多美國人民的支持，因為新冠疫情導致很多美國人喪失親友、企業倒閉和蒙受金錢損失等等，他們對於中國憤憤不平，必定會支持制裁中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上否認在對談中請求美國制裁或懲罰中國，又指他在對談中是舉例說明中國應該給人民言論自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認說過若自己被捕美英唔會坐視不理&quot;&gt;黎否認說過若自己被捕美英「唔會坐視不理」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇早前作供提及在2020年6月黎住所的飯局中，黎向在座人士稱不怕被捕，若果被捕就「更加證明到中國和香港政府對人權嘅打壓」，並相信「美國、英國同歐洲係唔會坐視不理」。楊又引述黎稱只有實施制裁，才能有助改善香港的人權狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認說過上述言論，又稱自己不會傲慢自大到說自己被捕的話會引起國際關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示2020年6月20日的 Twitter 帖文：「Although there are more details but it doesn’t come with a deadline. Why the delay? Sanctions and condemnations from all over the world certain create the pressure. There might also be divide within the #CCP holding it back as well.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，帖文所說的東西，似乎與黎智英向張劍虹所表達的「一廂情願」一致，但是似乎與李兆富的訊息、稱《國安法》進程繼續的說法有矛盾，然而李兆富撰寫帖文的時候，是否巧合地與黎的想法一致？黎則指，可能李了解他的想法，所以如此撰寫帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，訊息紀錄顯示，李兆富的草擬帖文中並沒有「Sanctions」和「condemnations」的字眼，但是最終發布的帖文卻含有上述字眼，然而根據紀錄，黎在帖文發布翌日下午才回覆同意帖文內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;受訪稱國安法實施是香港的死期-黎稱真誠相信&quot;&gt;受訪稱國安法實施是「香港的死期」 黎稱真誠相信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，2020年6月23日，《蘋果》發布報導〈【港版國安法】黎智英接受日本雜誌專訪：國安法實施就是「香港的死期」〉，指黎智英接受日本《FACTA》月刊訪問，引述黎稱「一旦港版國安法正式實施，公平、公義社會瞬間瓦解，當香港變成人治的社會，那就是香港的死期」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，當時黎尚未有機會看《國安法》內容。黎同意，他解釋其言論只是表達將會發生什麼的概念。黎亦同意報導準確地反映他的想法，而他真誠相信該些想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter帖文稱中共及其傀儡應受罰-黎稱出自李兆富手筆&quot;&gt;Twitter帖文稱中共及其傀儡應受罰 黎稱出自李兆富手筆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎 Twitter 帳戶於2020年6月23日發布的帖文，他轉發王丹的帖文，並加上評論：「#CCP has a trade war with Americans, legal battle with Canadians, fist fight with Indians, psychological warfare against Taiwanese, and street fight with #HKers. Soon it will exhaust itself to death.」黎否認撰寫帖文，相信是李兆富翻譯王丹的帖文及發表。辯方指對話紀錄顯示，黎和李之間在6月22至23日期間並沒有傳送任何訊息。黎同意，指發布上述帖文是李的主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年6月24日，黎的帳戶發布帖文：「#CarrieLam said countries offering #HKers right of abode and proposing sanctions are hypocrites. But the Lams are British nations. Perhaps the #CCP should consider asking the Lams to relinquish their foreign citizenship.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示黎的帳戶於2020年6月26日發布的五則帖文，分別為：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「@HawleyMO thank you for #StandingwithHongKong. #CCPChina and its puppets should be punished for violating the rightful freedom of #HKers.」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「When you are forbidden from doing business simply because of your political opinion, it is no longer the free market, the free society we once cherished. This is how #CCP’s influence slowly murdered #HongKong’s autonomy」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「IFJ did a good job to expose #CCPChina’s attempts to whitewash itself from the horrendous human rights violation. The truth will always prevail. @IFJGlobal」(轉載國際記者聯盟的報告 The China Story: Reshaping the World’s Media）&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「Only terrorists will make such offer. @JustinTrudeau must stand resolutely against #CCP’s bullying. 120 years ago the fanatics of Qing Dynasty did the same thing against foreign nationals in China. It was the beginning of the end of the absolute monarchy.」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「#CCP thinks Australia is dependent on China and the disease is keeping everyone busy. No. The world is beginning to decouple from this opaque and corrupt regime by shifting the global supply chain.」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，雖然帖文所述與他當時的想法一致，但是行文方式並不像他，相信是出自李的手筆。被問到「decouple」的意思，黎指即是「切斷連繫」和「切割」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎即使自己是特別個案也不理-這是頂天立地的時候&quot;&gt;黎即使自己是特別個案也不理 「這是頂天立地的時候」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與張劍虹之間於2020年6月28日的訊息對話，二人談及黎未能出境赴台灣，張劍虹指待黎在8月官司結束之後，便可以出境。張劍虹提到：「消息至今仍然是沒有追溯期」，黎說：「就是我是特別個案，我也不理了，這是頂天立地的時候，其他不重要了」，張說：「上帝會保守老闆你的，每天都為你祈禱」，黎說：「謝謝，我亦相信上主會幫我，所以我無憂無慮，一往直前。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問訊息中提到的「個案」是指什麼案件，惟黎表示不記得。辯方遂提醒黎，他涉刑事恐嚇《東方》記者的案件，於2020年9月被裁定罪名不成立。辯方問黎為何說「就是我是特別個案」，為何認為自己的案件特別。黎稱因為自己是在政治範疇的敏感人物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，2020年6月28日黎與 Mark Simon 在訊息中商討線上會議時間，與會者包括張劍虹、時任動新聞總監張志偉和黎私人公司的職員 Lucia。黎稱 Lucia 有份製作網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，並指提議開設節目者另有其人，相信是 Mark Simon 和李兆富。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾向張劍虹稱金盤洗手不再抗爭無可能&quot;&gt;黎曾向張劍虹稱：金盤洗手不再抗爭無可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年6月29日，張劍虹向黎傳送《蘋果》報導〈【港版國安法】葉國謙稱「金盤洗手」不會追究 陳智思警告市民勿越紅線〉，並說：「老闆加油，蘋果加油，香港加油」，黎回覆：「但願如此，但手（金）盤洗手不再抗爭無可能，煮到埋嚟就食，無所謂，謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，他當時認為香港不可能停止抗爭、不可能放棄，《國安法》亦不是一個終結，不過自己當時過於樂觀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎與張的訊息亦提及時事評論員劉細良，黎稱他認識劉，與劉曾經對談約四次，準確次數不記得，話題關於《國安法》實施後會發生什麼事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認說服陳繼續戰鬥-強調不會叫他自殺&quot;&gt;黎否認說服陳繼續戰鬥 強調不會叫他「自殺」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及，陳梓華作供期間被法官李運騰問到，陳是否有意干犯《國安法》。陳當時回答：「視乎有咩人喺身邊。」李官接著問陳，是否一旦有其他人同行，便會去干犯《國安法》。陳回答，當他與黎在2020年6月會面時，他感到恐懼，表示想退縮，但是被黎說服了，所以繼續做一直所做的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否說服陳繼續？黎堅稱沒有，並自言一直提醒別人謹慎、不要觸犯《國安法》罪行，包括朋友和同事，所以對於關係不太親近的陳，他更加沒有可能說服陳去做相反的事情。黎又形容陳的說法荒謬，強調自己從沒叫他做任何事情，反問：「我會叫他做什麼？難道自殺嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎並否認叫陳請求外國對中國實施制裁，重申一直以來只叫他跟勇武派溝通以平息暴力。黎亦否認要求陳繼續戰鬥，「這從不是我們之間的話題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine is an assault on values and democracy as much as a battle for territory. Whatever President-elect Donald Trump might like to think, the war will not end through territorial concessions, since Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be satisfied only with pieces of Ukraine. And believing that the war is about Ukraine’s attachment to territory alone represents a narrow, somewhat statist view that is out of sync with the country’s contemporary character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has changed in a dramatic way since its independence from the embers of the Soviet Union in 1991, more than 70 years after it first declared its independence with the invasion of the Bolsheviks in late 1917. The next stage in a process of gradually asserting its interests was the Orange Revolution, which delivered a government independent of Russia’s interests in 2004. The revolution of dignity followed 10 years later, leading to the ousting of the pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych and the reinstatement of the 2004 constitution. In 2019, President Petro Poroshenko, who had replaced Yanukovych, was defeated at the polls by Volodymyr Zelensky, and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is not history is Ukraine’s attachment to democracy. “Ukrainians have a voice”, says the country’s Nobel peace laureate Oleksandra Matviichuk, “and they won’t accept peace being made without them”. In this way, Ukraine is no different to South Africa, or any other country where peace has stuck – locals require agency, and the best that international actors can do is to uniformly pressure the parties to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a consistent feature of the last Trump and the current Biden administrations in the US is their disregard for the interests of their allies. The US proved, in cutting and running from Afghanistan, that it is just too big and careless to take on board the interests of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Believing that the war is about Ukraine’s attachment to territory alone represents a narrow, somewhat statist view that is out of sync with the country’s contemporary character&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the time of the talks with the Taliban in Qatar (under Trump, which excluded the government of Afghanistan) to the abandonment of Kabul to the Taliban (under Biden), there is a constant thread. Locals don’t have agency, or at least local allies don’t have agency in the face of geopolitical interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But cutting and running in this way was not cost-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a lesson to be learnt from Afghanistan, it is in the consequences and interconnectedness of foreign policy actions. It is no coincidence that Putin invaded Ukraine (again) in February 2022 just six months after Washington left Kabul in a chaotic and duplicitous manner that could hardly have deterred a watching Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us return to the present, and the prospect of ending what has become a grim war of attrition inexorably grinding up Ukrainian civilians and territory as much as Russian soldiers and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a risk, in Matviichuk’s words, that “without security guarantees, Russia will use the peace simply to prepare for the next round of war”. Any peace treaty has to recognise past failures, such as the Budapest Memorandum signed in 1994, which supposedly prevented Russia, the US and the UK from threatening or using military force or economic coercion against Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, “except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons. Subsequent events have demonstrated that security guarantees are both critical and problematic, since NATO membership – the most useful guarantee against further Russian aggression – is subject to the political whims of Hungary, Slovakia and other governments that will probably, on current form, veto Kyiv’s application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as Matviichuk reminds us, Ukraine will not simply “give up” on its people in the occupied territories in the east and Crimea. “Under occupation means living in a ‘grey zone’”, she says, “without rights, no tools to defend themselves, and meaning a constant fear of torture, rape, murder, disappearance, forced migration to camps. Occupation makes human suffering invisible, but it does not mean that it is not happening”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor is it possible for Ukraine simply to forget these Russian atrocities against civilians. “Only this week Russia launched an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile – or ICBM”, she notes, “against a peaceful civilian city. They have also attacked our energy system, leaving many uncertain how they will survive the winter. But we are still waiting to hear the response, the criticism, of the international community”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For Ukraine, this war is yet another phase in its people’s long struggle for statehood against Russian imperialism, a commitment to values and agency that they are not likely to willingly trade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Nobel laureate, peace is not about trading territory, but “about people”, since it is “immoral not to speak about people”. For Ukraine, this war is yet another phase in its people’s long struggle for statehood against Russian imperialism, a commitment to values and agency that they are not likely to willingly trade, or at least certainly not for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As former President Viktor Yushchenko, who led the Orange Revolution in peeling away Russia’s grip on Ukraine 20 years ago, said in an interview with one of the authors, “An integral part of Ukrainian identity is to fight for our freedom and democracy, our own language and culture. This is why Ukrainians will never submit to Moscow’s brutal imperialism and tyranny.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those trying to cut a deal with Putin cannot expect Kyiv to go along with a version of Taliban redux. Kyiv is, after all, not Kabul, and Ukrainians are not Afghans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;袁弓夷拍片稱示威有人被謀殺強姦 黎智英批常誇大其辭 不予信任&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dHqhGXB.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第102日審訊，黎智英第十日作供。辯方圍繞黎的意圖提問，當中提及《蘋果》曾發布袁弓夷的影片，袁稱反修例中有人被謀殺和強姦，而黎在 Twitter 轉載影片。不過黎稱經過數次接觸後，認為袁常誇大其辭、又想與他攀關係，感到不舒服故疏遠他。2020年6月11日，袁向黎傳送語音訊息，稱自己翌日會見時任美國國際宗教自由大使 Sam Brownback，打算向對方提出制裁夏寶龍，冀黎協助聯絡天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機，冀得到陳的支持和寫信。黎當時回覆指樞機答應的機會不大，但可以嘗試聯絡。黎在庭上稱事實上沒有替袁聯絡樞機，「因為我不相信這個人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方播放黎的受訪片段，黎表示自己準備面對「坐監嘅犧牲」，辯方問當黎所做的事變得不合法，還會否繼續？黎說：「不，不是不合法，我只是準備好面對後果。」法官李素蘭追問，黎理應做了非法的事，才會坐監？黎卻表示：「我不覺得我做過違法的事情，但是我在監獄已有四年。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱經陳梓華找到蘋果寫手-jack-hazlewood-借出戶口收眾籌款項&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱經陳梓華找到《蘋果》寫手 Jack Hazlewood 借出戶口收眾籌款項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒早前供稱，2019年7月的「中英聯合聲明登報眾籌」，即第二次眾籌，使用了另一個眾籌平台「gofundme.com」，惟後來發現該平台規定款項必須經由英國開設的英鎊戶口接收，後來經陳梓華找到《蘋果》寫手 Jack Hazlewood 借出銀行戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱不認識 Jack Hazlewood，亦從沒聽聞他的名字。辯方遂展示他的 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄，顯示 Jack Hazlewood 於2020年5月31日傳送一份文章的 PDF 檔案給黎。黎稱不能開啟 PDF 檔案，Jack Hazlewood 遂傳送3張文章的截圖給黎。黎庭上卻回應：「這些人對我而言就如一種滋擾，通常這樣介紹自己，傳送一些東西給我，要求我們刊登⋯⋯我便回覆交由編輯決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，既然黎稱這些訊息是滋擾、不想收到這些訊息，為何不直接無視它？黎表示不知道。杜官又問，為何黎向 Jack Hazlewood 說會轉發他的截圖？黎僅指他可能之前跟對方溝通過，「可能我說我會轉發，然後睡覺，翌日醒來便忘記了。」法官李運騰追問，但是黎在訊息表明「我會現在轉發」；黎則表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當黎再被問 Jack Hazlewood 是否協助李宇軒轉帳款項，黎反問：「我怎樣知道？」，稱不熟悉這些名字，可能 Jack Hazlewood 曾經替《蘋果》撰文一至兩次，但他不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不知道jack-hazlewood-惟辯方指黎曾轉發其帖文&quot;&gt;黎稱不知道Jack Hazlewood 惟辯方指黎曾轉發其帖文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎於2020年5月31日的 Twitter 帖文，顯示他轉發 Jack Hazlewood 的帖文，並說：「Mr @JackHHazlewood thanks for advocating for Apple English edition. Certainly we need more subscribers so we can be financially viable. Having subscribers from all over the world will also sent #CCP a clear and strong message that the world is watching.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指訊息紀錄亦顯示黎曾將 Jack Hazlewood 相關截圖轉發給李兆富。黎則回應，帖文的內容是完全不同的話題，關於宣傳《蘋果》英文版，而非 Jack Hazlewood 在訊息所述的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎有否閱讀過 Jack Hazlewood 傳來的文章。黎堅稱他肯定沒有，只是當時對方傳送了三張截圖，他以為是緊急事情，所以才會轉發，「如果我快要睡覺，我不會閱讀任何東西。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾轉發jack-hazlewood帖文-感謝宣傳蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;黎曾轉發Jack Hazlewood帖文 感謝宣傳蘋果英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又展示黎與張志偉之間的訊息，張於2020年5月31日傳送兩張 Twitter 截圖，指 Jack Hazlewood 和羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）分別宣傳《蘋果》英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎於同日傳送 Jack Hazlewood 在 Twitter 的另一則帖文截圖，當中稱在外國人在香港以外的地方未能下載《蘋果》手機應用程式。黎並吩咐張盡快解決問題。張回覆「收到」。被問到當時是否已經知道 Jack Hazlewood 這個名字，黎稱沒有留意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳梓華有否向黎提起 Jack Hazlewood 這個人？黎說沒有，並重申除了要求陳平息暴力之外，便沒有與陳討論其他事情。辯方引述李宇軒的證供，指在籌備中英聯合聲明登報期間，Jack Hazlewood 的聯絡方法乃由李宗澤（Wilson Li）提供。黎稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認增加個人影響力若說垃圾說話影響力有何重要&quot;&gt;黎否認增加個人影響力：若說垃圾說話，影響力有何重要？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎對《紐約時報》的取態如何。黎指《紐約時報》是進步自由派（progressive liberal），他們總是對特朗普及其所屬的共和黨有負面評價，但是黎並不苟同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及陳梓華供稱黎聲稱想增加個人影響力，黎否認。辯方追問黎為何替《紐約時報》撰文。黎稱因為希望接觸到更多人，希望自己的信息接觸到愈多人愈好。黎又反問：「如果我說了一些垃圾說話，我的影響力又有何重要呢？⋯⋯我的影響力並不重要，如果我說一些愚蠢的話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年6月3日在 Twitter 發布帖文：「Overseas fellows and Americans, please subscribe to our Apple Daily English edition. Your subscription is more than only the financial help, but it is political protection for us against #CCP crackdown.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋若然海外學者和美國人為香港發聲的話，外國的政客便需要聆聽，又指「我們」可以是指香港人和《蘋果》。被問到為何要特別提及美國人，黎指因為美國人最具影響力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱袁弓夷想攀關係經常誇大其辭&quot;&gt;黎稱袁弓夷想攀關係、經常誇大其辭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，現被國安處通緝的袁弓夷曾拍片響應「一人一信救香港」，影片於2020年5月29日至6月1日在《蘋果》平台播放。黎在 Twitter 亦有轉載影片，並稱期望特朗普實施制裁。袁在影片中呼籲外國投資者從香港撤資，又稱反修例示威中有人被謀殺和強姦。黎則稱沒有看過影片，也沒有參與製作，如今在庭上觀看後，認為袁的說法誇張，自己不認同。至於他轉載影片，他則承認當時是疏忽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，與袁接觸幾次之後，「我有點感到不舒服，我感覺到他總是想與我攀關係」，由於對此感到不舒服，所以後來疏遠他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，袁乘機前往美國華盛頓之前，曾問黎有沒有東西想袁幫忙，黎回覆沒有任何提議。黎確認，因為當時對他感到不舒服，又指袁沒有告訴他要去美國做什麼。被問到這感覺從何而來，黎估計這是日積月累，他看了袁的影片之後，發覺部份言論並非事實，情況並非如他口中那麼極端。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方聞言後，引述黎較早前卻說沒看過袁的影片，要求黎解釋。黎稱不記得有否看過，並重申他感覺到袁總是想與他攀關係，對此感到不舒服，又指袁經常誇大其辭。法官李運騰則提醒辯方是在盤問黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾告訴張劍虹小心袁弓夷-質疑袁隱藏背後動機&quot;&gt;黎曾告訴張劍虹小心袁弓夷 質疑袁隱藏背後動機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹之間的訊息，當中提及一篇訪問。黎不記得是哪一篇訪問，但他確認有告訴張要提防袁這個人，因他對袁感到不舒服。黎在訊息中告訴張「他（袁）是郭文貴的人」，黎解釋意思是袁與郭有關。被問到郭文貴在紐約做了什麼，黎稱不知道他做了什麼，但是：「我只是有個印象，可能他是個騙子。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kqJsMc3.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在訊息中告訴張「他（袁）想與我合作反共」。黎解釋，郭理應對抗中共政權，可是事實不然，而袁卻想與郭合作。黎又指他告訴張，他不認同及不接受袁，質疑袁有隱藏的議程或背後動機，而未有表露出來，因此著張要提防袁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息亦顯示張劍虹說不用害怕《國安法》，黎解釋張的意思是若中共內鬥的話，《國安法》便不會很嚴厲，但最終結果證明他估計錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，若然黎認為《國安法》不會很嚴厲，那黎便不需要呼籲外國制裁，那麼黎當時有否繼續呼籲制裁？黎表示當時有繼續呼籲制裁。辯方追問原因。黎回答指「《國安法》不會很嚴厲」只是他的臆測，如果《國安法》不會嚴厲的話，他認為他不會繼續呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，袁的影片發布一星期之後，才有上述黎與張劍虹之間的訊息，問黎有否要求將袁的影片從《蘋果》網站刪除。黎則表示他未足以警覺到想起袁的影片，他對影片沒有很深的印象。法官杜麗冰指黎聲稱不認同該影片。黎同意，因為影片含有不實和誇大的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官問黎，誰人介紹袁弓夷給他認識？黎稱袁會在 YouTube 發布影片，何俊仁曾提議邀請袁弓夷及其女兒袁彌明一起吃晚飯，相信還有邀請袁彌明的丈夫。黎又稱認識袁彌明很長時間，因她亦有參與民主運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;袁弓夷曾要求黎協助聯絡陳日君-以支持制裁夏寶龍-黎稱沒協助問&quot;&gt;袁弓夷曾要求黎協助聯絡陳日君 以支持制裁夏寶龍 黎稱沒協助問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，袁弓夷在2020年6月11日向黎傳送語音訊息，稱自己翌日會見時任美國國際宗教自由大使 Sam Brownback，對方負責宗教自由，而夏寶龍「呢條友又燒教堂，又拆十字架」，袁稱需要得到天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機的支持，並寫信給 Sam Brownback 或時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧，講述夏寶龍犯了宗教罪行，「應該要馬上制裁」，冀黎可以協助聯絡樞機。黎亦以語音回覆袁，指樞機答應的機會不大，「佢唔熟你嘅話，佢會好謹慎嘅」，但是黎表示即管幫袁問問，惟他相信樞機不會答應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，回覆袁之後，有否協助他問陳日君樞機？黎回答：「沒有，因為我不相信這個人。」辯方又指，袁其後傳送一連串訊息給黎，惟黎並未有回覆。黎確認，並說：「我不認為我曾費神看過。」他稱他沒有理會袁，「因為我不相信他，我不想與他有聯繫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱自己對袁冷淡-傳送針對袁負面評價-惟袁不夠敏感&quot;&gt;黎稱自己對袁冷淡 傳送針對袁負面評價 惟袁不夠敏感&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在一日之前，即2020年6月10日，以通訊軟件 Signal 向袁傳送一篇時事評論員梁啟智對袁的評價節錄，「見咁多人推介袁爸爸條片，即管襟入去睇吓。Sorry，睇咗一半，完全睇唔到落去，個推論亂到離晒大譜」、「一開口鬧泛民，第一個開嘅係李國能⋯⋯李國能幾時做咗泛民？然後又話 Martin Lee，仲講起草基本法開始就讓步⋯⋯成個 CFA 係 Martin Lee 爭取返嚟，八九民運之後仲辭埋草委，讓乜步？然後又開袋住先，問題係袋住先咪就係泛民否決咗囉。咁都可以用嚟鬧泛民？」、「呢啲直頭係 misinformation，虛假信息來的。我真係覺得黃絲圈對信息確切的要求唔見得比藍絲圈高好多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何傳送相關評價給袁？黎說是讓袁知道相關評語，「這是一種我不需要自己說任何話便能拒絕他的做法」，「你知道，使用其他人的評價。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，不過翌日袁依然傳送訊息給黎，要求黎協助取得陳日君樞機的支持，問黎知不知道原因。黎則表示：「我只能說這個人不夠敏感。」辯方追問，袁未能理解黎的暗示嗎？黎同意，「你可以從我的訊息看到，我當時非常冷淡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱愛中國文化人民但不愛中國政府&quot;&gt;黎稱愛中國文化人民但不愛中國政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與李兆富之間於2020年6月6日的訊息，黎稱要集中制裁中國政府，惟辯方指，黎較早前主張制裁對象應集中在中國官員，要求黎解釋為何說法有變？黎則理解「中國」和「中國政府（China government）」是一樣，均破壞了香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎：「你愛中國嗎？」黎表示，以中國作為一個國家（as a country）而言，包含她的文化和人民，「當然我愛她。」可是以中國作為一個受共產黨統治的國家（as a state that is ruled by the communist party）而言，他不認為他愛中國，因為這個國家的價值觀與他的價值觀有抵觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方提問下，黎表示他愛中國、但不愛中國政府，直至現在也是。辯方繼而追問，黎剛才又何以說「中國」和「中國政府」都一樣？黎僅表示他當時只是回答辯方的問題，當時他口中的「中國」就是「中國政府」（China as a state）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;受訪稱有份通過國安法的官員海外銀行戶口存有貪污金錢-黎認屬猜測&quot;&gt;受訪稱有份通過國安法的官員海外銀行戶口存有貪污金錢 黎認屬猜測&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月10日，黎接受史丹福大學胡佛研究所（Hoover Institution）訪問時，稱香港需要國際，尤其是美國，去協助制裁中國，「現在是制裁中國的最佳時機，去迫使中國更好地管束自己的行為，與普世價值接軌，使世界和平。」黎庭上解釋，因為中國的行為和價值觀與西方有衝突，所以才會有貿易戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在受訪時指，美國應該在香港絕望之前便制裁和懲罰中國，「如果中國不放棄訂立《國安法》，香港無論如何都會被破壞，若撤回香港的特殊經濟地位，即管去做，因為怎樣也好都是無意義的。」黎庭上解釋，希望《國安法》能夠減弱或暫緩實施，他當時立場依然是反對取消香港特殊經濟地位；如果香港實施《國安法》的話，香港便會被破壞，屆時取消香港特殊地位與否，也變得亳無意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎受訪時另提到，美國應該凍結中國貪污官員在西方國家的銀行戶口，那些戶口有大量金錢，而那些有份打壓香港的官員，「應該在個人層面感受自己行為所帶來的痛苦。」（“I think those who are involved in this oppression should personally feel the pain of their action.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，他認為有份通過《國安法》的官員，在海外銀行戶口存有涉及貪污的金錢。法官杜麗冰問黎是否猜測？黎同意是猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在訪問中說，如果外國制裁中國的話，香港會是中國與外國貿易的唯一渠道。黎解釋因為香港是國際金融中心，他說這句話的時候，以為《國安法》不會實施，所以才會如此說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，會否繼續抗爭，即使這樣做變得不合法？黎回答他不會在違法的基礎上抗爭，因為這樣的話便會被拘捕。黎接著提到：「如今在《國安法》之下，抗爭是不可能的，現在為香港抗爭已無意義，已經萬劫不復。（“… it’s beyond redemption.”）」辯方提醒黎，現在只需集中在案發當時的想法，而不是現在的想法。黎聞言表示，只是嘗試回答辯方的問題，「因為我不會再抗爭了，這是沒有用的。（“… because I won’t be fighting anymore. It’s useless.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不覺得做過違法事-但在監獄已有四年&quot;&gt;黎：不覺得做過違法事 但在監獄已有四年&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方播放2020年6月10日黎接受《自由亞洲電台》訪問的片段，他稱：「我好耐已經決定咗唔諗後果，如果我每一件事，我諗後果，我都做唔到嘅，我每講一句話，我都諗後果，我係做唔到㗎喇。恐慌呢樣嘢已經唔喺我意識裡面喇。如果我真係要為咗呢度最後犧牲，無論係坐監嘅犧牲，甚至乎冇咗條命都好，我都願意㗎，我都冇選擇㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，他在節目中說準備「犧牲」，換言之當他所做的事變得不合法，還會否繼續？黎說：「不，不是不合法，我只是預計將會面對後果。」辯方追問，那為何黎提到「坐監嘅犧牲」？黎僅說：「我現時正在監獄。」法官李素蘭追問，黎理應做了非法的事，才會坐監？黎卻表示：「我不覺得我做過違法的事情，但是我在監獄已有四年。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中稱：「如果你係愛呢個地方，你亦覺得冇咗呢個地方好可惜，我哋真係要團結一致，去做最後嘅抗爭去保住，香港呢個家園，我係願意同你一齊抗爭落去。或者有啲人，『算數啦，過去佢嚟到，我哋做大陸人囉，無自由，我有得食，有得住，有得歡樂，我咪算囉。』我亦唔怪你，每一個人要做自己嘅選擇，但係我哋必然會有好多人選擇留喺度抗爭，而我會同呢啲人一齊抗爭到底。」播畢影片之後，旁聽席有人拍手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，黎是否會繼續抗爭，即使抗爭變得不合法。黎說，如果抗爭變成不合法，便無論如何都沒有空間抗爭，說像香港現時的情況，沒有人會出來抗爭。辯方則提醒黎，不是要集中現今情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，黎說會跟其他人一起抗爭到底，但是他是否認識這些人？黎表示不知道，就如他不會認識所有參與遊行的200萬人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭後，保安將涉嫌拍手的女旁聽人士帶入庭外的房間，有兩名軍裝警員向她調查。直至下午約4時58分，約7至8名警員把女士帶離法院，約十多名軍裝警員到場設立封鎖線，步行至對面馬路後，便不准市民尾隨。有記者問在場警員是否拘捕及是否涉及任何控罪，警員僅稱純粹帶走該名女士及會放行。&lt;/p&gt;

Pyongyang appears to be concerned that Trump’s electoral victory could restrict its opportunity to become a critical part of Russia’s Eurasian security architecture and to cement its status as a nuclear power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of North Korea’s troop deployments to Russia will likely become clearer over time. However, the repercussions are clear: the North Korean army’s participation in the war will dramatically increase Russia–North Korea cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why did North Korea suddenly take this step? There have been several occasions during the Ukraine war when Russia has been on the defensive. However, the recent situation does not seem particularly difficult for Russia. The true answer is to be found in North Korea’s own strategic objectives: Pyongyang appears to want to reshape the geopolitical landscape on the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Eighth Communist Party Congress in 2021, North Korea’s foreign strategy can be described as a “New Cold War Structure Utilisation Strategy”, which consists of an effort to refashion the geopolitical landscape on the Korean Peninsula. The beginning of this was the improvement of Pyongyang’s relations with Beijing by taking advantage of the rising tensions between the US and China. North Korea also strengthened its relationship with Moscow after Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. To all intents and purposes, Pyongyang viewed the rising US–China strategic competition and the Russo-Ukrainian war as a strategic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s perception of the international situation is evident in his 2021 and 2022 “State of the Nation” addresses, in which he referred to the current international situation as a “New Cold War” and as a period of “multi-polarisation”. As seen from Pyongyang, the country’s old weakness of being overly dependent on China could be offset by better relations with Russia, thereby creating a trilateral relationship which may amount to the best international political situation for North Korea since the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s. This has the added advantage of providing Kim with the ability to rely on both China and Russia to diminish the importance of the UN sanctions regime on North Korea and effectively paralyse any international effort to monitor breaches of these sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen from this perspective, the prospect of Donald Trump’s electoral triumph, which already seemed very real in October, was dreaded in Pyongyang because it was clear that Trump was determined to bring about at least a ceasefire in Ukraine, and if this resulted in the end of the war in Ukraine, the future of North Korea’s relations with Russia would be uncertain. Kim’s policy of “strategic diversification” would have come to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Pyongyang clearly discussed the deployment well before the US election. Yet it is instructive to note that the official justification for North Korea’s entry into the war was the Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory in Kursk. This provided Russia with the excuse to invoke Article 4 in the newly-concluded Russia–North Korea security treaty; the Russian government chose to claim that the Ukrainian army’s advance into Kursk had created a “state of war” in which Russia’s territory was “invaded” from Ukraine, thereby activating the mutual defence provisions of the Russian-North Korean treaty. Of course, it was Russia that invaded Ukraine first, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of other states. However, neither Moscow nor Pyongyang is bothered by such niceties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The participation of large numbers of North Korean regular troops, especially combat troops, in the Russo-Ukrainian war means that the conflict has turned into an international one&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Korean regime is likely to extract financial compensation for the lives of its soldiers that it has now sent into the Russian meat grinder. However, the most significant advantage for Pyongyang is that what it perceives as the entrenchment of a Cold War conflict structure serves its purposes because it makes the resolution of the North Korean issue virtually impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-political-implications-of-russian-troops-deployed-in-north-korea&quot;&gt;International Political Implications of Russian Troops Deployed in North Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispatch of North Korean troops may not have a significant impact on the war situation between Russia and Ukraine. Still, considering the level of North Korea–Russia cooperation, the war will likely cause changes in international relations. The participation of large numbers of North Korean regular troops, especially combat troops, in the Russo-Ukrainian war means that the conflict has turned into an international one. The participation of North Korean forces and the corresponding level of demand from Ukraine for South Korea’s support will also increase in direct proportion to one another. And if the nature of the war changes to an international one, the level of NATO’s involvement will increase, and the threat of a Russian nuclear attack will become more acute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, the dispatch of North Korean troops is a clear sign that North Korea and Russia are joining forces on the anti-US front and that North Korea could become one of the core countries in the non-Western Eurasian security structure that Russia has vowed to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear what the Eurasian security structure promoted by Russia entails. Still, if North Korea, as a country with nuclear weapons, participates in this structure, there is a concern that this will create a new nuclear state alliance that also encompasses Belarus, where Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons have already been deployed, and Iran, whose nuclear ambitions are growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is fully anticipated that, in return for its military participation, North Korea will demand to join the Russian-led Collective Security Organisation, as well as other international organisations such as the BRICS or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and Russia will no longer be able to dither on such membership applications. Should these steps be taken, they will likely increase North Korea’s status and role in the anti-US or anti-Western camp under a multipolar order, which could be an opportunity for North Korea to break out of its diplomatic isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is a concern that North Korea’s status as an “unofficial” nuclear state could be established as a fact, leading to a crisis in the international non-proliferation regime. The trend is already apparent. In September this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov publicly stated that Moscow viewed the notion of “denuclearising” North Korea as a “closed matter”, claiming that Russia understood Pyongyang’s logic of relying on nuclear weapons as the foundation of its defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russia–North Korea New Treaty specifies in its Article 10 “cooperation” between the two countries concerning “peaceful nuclear energy”. If Russia proceeds with nuclear energy cooperation with North Korea – which has violated the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and developed nuclear weapons – this will constitute an approval of North Korea’s possession of atomic weapons. The creation of a new Russian-led nuclear alliance or even Moscow’s acquiescence in North Korea’s nuclear development will pose a threat to the international non-proliferation regime that has been maintained since the end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-on-security-in-northeast-asia-and-the-korean-peninsula&quot;&gt;Impact on Security in Northeast Asia and the Korean Peninsula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispatch of North Korean troops implies a direct link between matters on the Korean Peninsula and the Russo-Ukrainian war. The more pressure that is exerted on Russia in Ukraine, the more opportunities will be created for North Korea, making the Korean Peninsula more susceptible to the effects of the current European war. In particular, with North Korea’s growing leverage over Russia, there is concern about the direct impact of the close relationship between the two countries. Even in the case of conventional armaments, the high degree of complementarity between the weapon systems operated by North Korea and Russia suggests that the synergy in the two countries’ cooperation will be very high. Russia possesses all the core technologies for the development of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, which North Korea claims to have developed but has not yet completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the fact that the North Korean army’s deployment to Russia is justified by Article 4 of the Russia–North Korea Security Treaty, which refers to a mutual security guarantee, must mean that – at least in principle - the same collective security article could be invoked by Moscow to justify a greater Russian involvement in any potential future conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Thus, Russia and North Korea, functioning as a de facto military alliance, could face off against the South Korea–US alliance, increasing the nuclear-based character of such a potential future confrontation. This will further strengthen North Korea’s current position of defining inter-Korean relations as “hostile relations between two countries” (it is no accident that North Korea’s constitution has recently been modified to include precisely such a definition) and will inevitably lead to a prolonged period of political and military tension on the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the dispatch of troops could become a new channel for North Korea to earn foreign currency and an essential opportunity for the North Korean military to gain combat experience. This will considerably increase the security threat to South Korea. In particular, Pyongyang’s accumulation of technology and expertise in operating inexpensive and effective weapon systems such as drones will lead to a different practical threat. At the same time, it should also be admitted that the dispatch of North Korean combat troops could be an opportunity to assess the combat effectiveness and training level of the North Korean military, which would be of interest to South Korea and the militaries of many Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outlook-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Outlook and Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is necessary to consider that the ripple effect of North Korea’s appearance on a European battlefield will vary, depending on North Korean troops’ participation method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most direct and explicit method is for North Korean combat troops to participate in the war as an independent operational authority. This is likely to change the nature of the war to an international one, and it is also a method that will require Russia to pay a higher future political and economic price for North Korea’s involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The dispatch of troops could become a new channel for North Korea to earn foreign currency and an essential opportunity for the North Korean military to gain combat experience&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the North Korean regime may choose to reduce the burden of escalation by having its troops participate in the war as part of the Russian military or as individuals in a “private military company” such as the Wagner Group. However, if the recent report that Kim Young-bok – the deputy chief of staff of the General Staff of the Korean People’s Army – is in charge of the North Korean troops deployed to Russia is accurate, it is likely that the North Korean troops will not be content with participating in the war as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge facing Seoul and all Western governments is that, in the short term, there are limited means to effectively restrain the North Korean military’s participation in the war or to punish Pyongyang for it. Therefore, governments need to take a longer-term view and rely on experience and diplomatic assets accumulated since the end of the Cold War to produce workable responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia’s position on the Korean peninsula was the most pragmatic among the four surrounding powers; it simply re-adjusted its relationship with North Korea to a normal state relationship, notwithstanding Pyongyang’s accusations that Moscow was “selling off” its interest to the “US dollar”. Needless to say, relations between Russia and the West are likely to remain frosty for a considerable time after the Russo-Ukrainian war. Still, Russia’s relationship with the West does not necessarily have to be a reason for South Korea and Russia to live in hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it remains crucial for South Korea to present a vision for the post-war relationship with Russia. Undoubtedly, it won’t be easy to significantly improve relations with China and Russia in the short term. Yet, it is imperative to establish policy measures that can restrain China–Russia–North Korea relations. Seoul also needs to consider a roundabout approach, leveraging its relations with Central Asian countries that are closely linked to China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet none of this obviates the need, in the short term, to continue warning the international community about the risks to global security that the deployment of North Korean troops poses. It is equally important for Seoul to lay out its own “red lines” regarding the cooperation between Russia and North Korea. In particular, Seoul needs to reiterate Russia’s international responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and as a NPT “P5” member, and to continue raising global awareness about the transfer of advanced military technology, including nuclear weapons, that the Moscow–Pyongyang relationship entails.&lt;/p&gt;

A reset in relations between Europe and the region is direly needed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sahel is acquiring a new importance due to recent events that have exponentially increased its capacity to influence the stability and security of the Mediterranean. It is an inhospitable area that is often discussed interchangeably with North Africa. But the Sahel and North Africa are quite distinct and are facing different realities, making it difficult to formulate a single strategy for both regions. North Africa will likely continue its current trajectory of closer integration with Europe, while the Sahel will continue to lag behind in terms of modernization, integration, security and stability, and economic development. The Sahel, therefore, currently requires the most attention from both the European Union and NATO, as well as from southern European nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sahel&quot;&gt;The Sahel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first difficulty in addressing the multiple challenges facing the region lies in defining its boundaries. Sahel means “edge” or “coast” in Arabic, and from this point of view, the Sahel would be a 5,000 kilometer strip stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. But these boundaries have no cultural, historical, or economic meaning and include 12 very different countries. For this reason, it is more usual to use the term to refer to a group of five countries with common historical, economic, cultural, and social characteristics: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. Historically, these areas were part of the great Sahelian empires based on trans-Saharan trade. They were subsequently colonized by France, which left a common political and cultural legacy. This legacy currently coexists with the fundamental role of Islam as the majority religion throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the five countries established the G5 Sahel, born as a result of the conviction of these governments (and of European pressure) about the need to jointly implement a comprehensive approach to ensure the conditions for peace, development, security, and governance. In 2017, a joint force was added to the organization to coordinate counterterrorism efforts, aiming to curb the expansion of armed groups that seriously threaten regional security. The efficacy of this organization is uncertain now, since three of its five founding members have left it, but officially the organization has not been dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also other partially Sahelian states geographically — such as Algeria, Nigeria, and Senegal — which, despite their different historical experiences and current situations, influence the evolution of Sahelian developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-challenges&quot;&gt;The Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sahel is one of the least habitable regions in the world. It has been characterized by a combination of great political instability, little economic development, and very unfavorable environmental conditions, the latter of which has exacerbated the unstable political context and driven migratory flows toward Europe. The lack of instruments to respond to these challenges has long been a source of structural weakness, resulting in a dependency on contributions from the United Nations, the European Union, or third countries. But perhaps the most worrying element is the Sahel’s position as the world epicenter of jihadist terrorism, an issue that has increased in severity since 2016. Not only is it fertile ground for recruiting rootless and disaffected youth into terrorism, but it also provides safe havens for terrorist organizations to plan and launch international attacks. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State are expanding violently in the region and the Sahel suffered 47 percent of all terrorism-related deaths worldwide in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crises already known to have been lurking in the Sahel for more than a decade are, however, entering a new stage due to two main reasons: the domestic political climate and the regional impact of the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political climate in the G5 Sahel has become more volatile in the last three years with the success of a series of military coups: in Mali in August 2020 and May 2021, in Burkina Faso in September 2022, and in Niger in July 2023. The latter is perhaps the most significant because it happened following the military coup in Mali in 2021, where French troops on the ground as part of Operation Barkhane were forced to conduct an accelerated withdrawal. Paris then decided to move its operational center to Niger, becoming the focal point for a renewed security partnership in the Sahel based on lessons learned from previous failures. The Nigerien government was also keen to host other European forces to counter Islamist insurgent groups linked to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State — so much so that the European Union decided to organize a three-year mission to train the Nigerien army. Niger had thus become the focal point of security efforts in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 2023 coup, however, this delicate balance has shifted. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) — the main regional organization — has been unable to respond effectively, showing its weakness and causing Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali to leave its ranks. The G5 Sahel has also been abandoned by its own members. In December 2023, Burkina Faso and Niger announced their withdrawal from the G5 Sahel joint military force, echoing Mali’s departure in May 2022, while Mauritania and Chad have accepted these sovereign decisions. The military juntas of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger have also signed a new security agreement under the name of Alliance of the Sahel States (AES), whose priority will be the fight against terrorism. Outside the continent, France is consolidating a military withdrawal that began in Mali in 2022, continuing in Burkina Faso and more recently in Niger, although it maintains operations in Chad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, for its part, has tried to maintain military collaboration with Niger, where it has built one of the largest drone bases on the continent in Agadez. And yet, despite U.S. wishes and after months of tensions, Niger’s ruling military council announced that it was ending the agreement that allowed U.S. forces to be based in the country. Among the disagreements between the two governments was the desire of Niger to supply Iran with uranium and work more closely with Russian military forces. The United States had completed its military withdrawal from the country by early August 2024, a blow to its counterterrorism effort — and to the broader security situation in the Sahel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Russia’s military offensive against Ukraine is having a significant impact on the region. For one, it has decreased food security, exacerbating the harsh living conditions of Sahelians with rising wheat, fuel, and fertilizer prices. The energy crisis in Europe due to the war has also heightened Europe’s need to strengthen its partnership with African countries, whose natural resources attract them. Thus, in July 2022, Algeria, Niger, and Nigeria signed a memorandum of understanding for the formalization of the Trans-Saharan gas pipeline, which could have great potential for the transportation of gas supplies to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the war in Ukraine has also made the Sahel more permeable to international influence efforts. In fact, it has grown in prominence within the framework of strategic competition, with the growing influence of Russia and China potentially challenging the security of NATO and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although relations between Russia and the Sahelian countries were established decades ago during the Cold War, today the presence of the Wagner Group in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger stands out. Its presence has been demonstrated in the last three years through participation in antiterrorist operations and support to the armed forces of some countries in the area. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has continued to expand its influence in the Sahel, as shown through the Africa-Russia summit held in July 2023. That said, the death of the head of the Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has led Moscow to create a new military structure under the Ministry of Defense called Africa Corps, with which it intends to replace Wagner’s mercenaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s presence, on the other hand, is more linked to the economic sphere and to the Sahel’s natural resources. China’s state-owned companies operate in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, and Niger. Mali potentially has one of the world’s largest lithium reserves, and the Chinese company Ganfeng Lithium has invested heavily in the country. China is the second-largest investor in Niger, with projects led by PetroChina (a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation) and China National Nuclear Corporation. Investments in the oil sector in Chad have also been significant and have made the Chadian army one of the best equipped forces in Africa. And some reports suggest that China would be willing to use the conflicts in the Sahel to test its weapons products, although it seems more plausible to think that it will prioritize the protection of its interests in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growing influence and presence of Russia and China fuels the idea that the countries of the Sahel — along with those in North Africa — are aligning more closely with these two powers, or at least that they want to reinvigorate their foreign policy autonomy vis-à-vis the West in line with that of other countries of the “Global South.” In both cases, this is connected to the relative decline of the influence of Western powers in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This growing influence and presence of Russia and China fuels the idea that the countries of the Sahel — along with those in North Africa — are aligning more closely with these two powers, or at least that they want to reinvigorate their foreign policy autonomy vis-à-vis the West in line with that of other countries of the “Global South.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-european-union&quot;&gt;The European Union&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the coup d’état in Niger, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stated in her last State of the Union address to the European Parliament that the European Union should engage more with African countries. She stated that Europe had to show the same unity of purpose toward Africa as it has shown toward Ukraine, focusing on cooperation with legitimate governments and regional organizations. The president further accused Russia of sowing chaos in the Sahel and stated that military coups destabilize the region, making it prone to the risk of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s concerns about developments beyond the Mediterranean directly impacting the continent’s security and prosperity are not new. But the results of its actions have been disappointing, perhaps because of tactical errors in its approach or inadequate attention paid to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, the perceived risks emanating from the Sahel have generally remained low due to the intangible nature of many of them and the belief that they were somehow under the control of the intervening countries in North Africa. These are countries with which Brussels cooperates under the European Neighborhood Policy, with programs in a wide range of sectors, such as democratic and economic development, rule of law, and migration. The Sahel region was therefore perceived by European policymakers as largely a remote desert area prone to drought and in need of infrastructure and humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of Muammar al-Qaddafi’s regime in Libya in 2011 and the ensuing security crisis in Mali, however, Europe accelerated the process of expanding the borders of its immediate southern neighborhood into the Sahel. It committed more spending, launched more development and stabilization programs, and intensified its external military presence in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, which were beginning to be seen as part of the “gateway to Europe” — a source of dangerous population growth, unwanted migration, and violent extremism, not to mention the favored territory of Russian mercenaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the European Union became involved in the Sahel with the adoption of the EU Sahel Strategy (2011–2020), which was reinforced in 2015 with the Regional Action Plan for the Sahel. These two strategies had a strong militarized approach focused on security. But Brussels also opened new embassies in the region, and an EU high representative for the Sahel was appointed to demonstrate continued diplomatic engagement. The European Union additionally became a founding member of the Sahel Alliance in 2017, pledging to coordinate international development spending in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the expected results were not adequately achieved and the European Union decided to move away from a preeminently security-oriented approach to a more integrated intervention, adopting the EU Integrated Sahel Strategy 2021. This was formulated at a time when most of the current crises had not yet emerged. Indeed, migration flows were fairly under control, political instability in the Sahel was not yet fueled by the ensuing succession of coups, the presence of the Wagner Group was not yet threatening the region, and the European Union was not facing a war on its eastern border. The strategy today must cope with a different and more hostile situation than initially planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, EU policies toward the Sahel have sought to satisfy different interests: to solve the migration issue for the countries bordering the Mediterranean with long-term development programs in the region, to support the French military efforts over the last decade, and to introduce a European dimension to the security and development sector in the region. But the European Union has proven itself not yet ready to respond in all of these dimensions. This lack of European success must be coupled with the unilateral French stance in the Sahel, which has caused considerable frustration among European partners and seems to have had a fragmenting effect on European efforts in the region. More recently, successive military coups in Burkina Faso, Mali, and especially Niger have imposed a limit on the Europeans’ military response capacity. And the latest worrying decision made by EU member states was to not extend the fifth mandate of the European Union Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) beyond May 18, 2024, although it was due to expire in January 2025. The reason given was the evolving political and security situation and consultations with the Malian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In general, EU policies toward the Sahel have sought to satisfy different interests: to solve the migration issue for the countries bordering the Mediterranean with long-term development programs in the region, to support the French military efforts over the last decade, and to introduce a European dimension to the security and development sector in the region.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European governments are reluctant to support undemocratic governments because they undermine Europe’s own priorities, in particular that of advancing democracy. But at the same time, shutting down security support leaves the door open for other actors — such as the Wagner Group — to fill the void and offer support to governments in the aftermath of coups. For now, there seems to be no “good” for Europe in the Sahel. And yet, despite the current paralysis, the region remains of strategic importance to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nato&quot;&gt;NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s southern flank has always existed, although it has been considered strategically secondary to its eastern flank. NATO’s southern members have historically been most concerned about security issues in the Mediterranean and its adjacent regions; they have also been among the most vocal advocates for NATO to pay more attention to its southern neighborhood. However, there is room for improvement in terms of the cohesion of the alliance’s approach, to the extent that, at times, the Mediterranean has become an area of competition rather than coordination among NATO’s southern members. It should not be forgotten that NATO is an alliance of sovereign countries, some of which have permanent interests in the south. That is why NATO accepted the UN Security Council’s invitation to protect civilians in Libya in 2011: it was reflecting French and Italian interests in North Africa. Similarly, in 2012, regional interests were at play when it was decided at the Chicago Summit to erect a southward-oriented missile shield for the alliance. Ultimately, it is the member states that decide to project stability in the south — bilaterally, regionally, or through the European Union, the United Nations, or NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, NATO has not been very explicit in addressing risks emanating from the Sahel region. It was only in 2016 that the alliance formally launched the so-called 360° approach, which addresses threats from all fronts and ensures a focused and tailored response. Thanks to the political commitment of countries such as Spain and Italy, NATO began to adopt — at least theoretically — this global vision that valued all its borders with equal concern. Since then, NATO has tried to reformulate its policies toward the southern region according to the notion of “stability projection,” with the idea of contributing to a stable environment in NATO’s vicinity by increasing regional understanding and situational awareness and by supporting capacity building in partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent NATO Parliamentary Assembly regional outlook reports have identified the security environment in North Africa and the Sahel as among the key trends that will shape the future. They point to the importance of the region because of its geographical proximity to Europe, as well as its cultural, social, economic, postcolonial, and migratory links. In addition, the latest strategic concept adopted in Madrid in 2022 confirmed the alliance’s commitment to work with its partners in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Sahel regions “to address shared security threats,” including war, terrorism, and the growing challenges related to climate change — a commitment that would be reaffirmed at the summit in Vilnius the year after. A few months later, the secretary-general appointed an independent group of experts whose findings of a “comprehensive and deep reflection process” on the southern flank were reflected in a report published in May. The report laid the ground for “an action plan for a stronger, more strategic and result-oriented approach toward our southern neighborhood,” including the Sahel area, an idea that managed to be incorporated into the Washington Summit Declaration of 2024. It should also be noted that the declaration refers to new efforts in the fight against terrorism and the identification of key areas for long-term effort, one of which is undoubtedly the Sahel. The Washington summit also produced the establishment of a special representative for the southern neighborhood, a position to which Spanish deputy assistant secretary general for political affairs and security policy Javier Colomina was appointed shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this aside, the Eastern flank is still considered by the allies the immediate and primary challenge to NATO, while in the long term the Indo-Pacific is beginning to stand out. As a result, the alliance’s political and military leeway to the southern flank risks being limited. What does seem to be clear among the allies, however, is that the increasing instability in the Sahel makes it necessary to consider that a southward-oriented NATO strategy should not necessarily stop at the Mediterranean and its immediate areas of influence. Beyond the Maghreb, Africa is an integral part of the European and transatlantic security calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But an extension of the security space beyond the Mediterranean and North Africa would imply closer cooperation with regional institutions and partner countries. Countries like Senegal and Nigeria could be important in NATO’s effort to “project stability” to the south. But from an operational point of view, NATO’s global engagement has obvious limits. It is therefore important to distinguish between the idea of NATO’s role in the Global South and the alliance’s role as a forum for the discussion of broader strategic concerns and policy coordination. From a political point of view, NATO’s southern flank can extend as far as the allies agree to take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to challenges such as terrorism, instability, and the migration crisis affecting Europe, NATO is not and should not be the first responder. National authorities, the European Union, and ad hoc coalitions should lead the way. Maritime, humanitarian, and low-intensity counterterrorism issues are indeed particularly promising scenarios for NATO-EU cooperation. Practical and effective collaborative strategies already exist, as demonstrated by the support provided by NATO’s Operation Sea Guardian to the European Union’s Operation Sophia, which aims to disrupt criminal networks of smugglers and traffickers operating in the Mediterranean. However, several other crises in the area have not been addressed through NATO-EU cooperation, exemplified by the current situation in Libya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for the long term in a manner that builds on the alliance’s strengths and is sustainable over time is thus an urgent need — even if this amounts to a relatively modest effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;national-interests&quot;&gt;National Interests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly unstable international environment in which a Global South is ascending regardless of Western diplomatic pressure, organizations such as the European Union and NATO are limited in their ability to influence countries beyond the West on security and defense issues. But in the Sahel, there is perhaps still room for them. In the Sahel in particular, governments have traditionally given more importance to relations and cooperation with states, such as France, Italy, and Spain, than relations with multilateral organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current wave of postcolonial African — and, specifically, Sahelian — unease with France may have originated in 2014, when France launched Operation Barkhane to fight jihadism in several countries in the region, starting with Mali. The operation lasted eight years, and although it achieved military successes on the ground, it prevented the collapse of Mali’s government and territorial integrity against a jihadist threat coming mainly from the north of the country. Its continued presence also created resentment and a focal point for growing public discontent with France. A wave of pan-Africanism, centered on anti-Westernism, has been on the rise, mobilizing sectors of the military and political elites in the Sahel countries and highlighting anti-French sentiment as a lever to seize power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than any other country, France has been exposed in Africa because of its military footprint and its adoption of measures perceived as neocolonial. It is the only former colonial power with a wide range of bases from Senegal to Djibouti, via Gabon, the Ivory Coast, and Chad. Since the independence of these countries, Paris has carried out more than 50 military operations or interventions on the continent. However, given the size of the region, its objectives were too ambitious for such a small military force, and this military solution was only a “band-aid” that failed to address the structural weaknesses of regional states. Seen from this perspective, France is reaping the consequences of its interventionism in Africa and its failure to successfully curb terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, when powers like Russia, with no colonial history in the region, offered aid in fighting jihadism, they were welcomed, even if they were financed by appropriating part of the natural wealth of the Sahel countries. This is what French president Emmanuel Macron described as “the baroque alliance of the pseudo-Pan-Africanists and the new imperialists.” Reflecting on the above mistakes, Macron has expressed the desire to develop a relationship with Sahelian states “without paternalism or weaknesses,” warning that the recent string of coups in the region entails “a risk of weakening the West and especially Europe.” That is why Paris bet on Niger — but the partnership has not worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France, however, will likely continue to have a military and diplomatic presence in Africa because it has (primarily geostrategic) interests to preserve. Moreover, France signed the Quirinale Treaty with Italy in 2021, which reflects a will to bet on reinforced bilateral cooperation, the effects of which have begun to be visible in the Sahel. It should be noted that this cooperation does not apply to North Africa, a region in which Rome and Paris have each developed deep ties with local elites, even if this has involved engaging in a struggle for influence that has benefited certain oligarchies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;italy&quot;&gt;Italy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy is another major European player in the Sahel, with a strategy reflecting a “return” to Africa. The focus on the Sahel fits into a more general reorientation of Italian foreign policy — in line with its European partners — manifested by an increase in diplomatic activities, including the opening of new embassies, and an involvement in bilateral military operations and European cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niger has so far been the clearest representation of Italy’s new activities in the area, mainly because of its position as a transit country for migratory flows from sub-Saharan Africa. In its bilateral engagement, for example, Italy reinforced the contingent of its project MISIN (Missione Italiana di Supporto in Niger), which has been present in the country since 2018. Italy has also increased its support of European initiatives in the region, for instance by holding key positions on the ground during European missions and by appointing Emanuela del Re as EU high representative for the Sahel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Italy’s engagement with the Sahel is not without attention to the political and security dynamics of North African countries. The links between the protracted conflict in Libya and the destabilization of the Sahel have long been a subject of debate in Italy, for example. This has manifested in the widespread adoption of the “wider Mediterranean” — an area of interest encompassing countries from West Africa to the Horn of Africa, including the Sahel — into Italian policy. At the European level, Italian engagement is also reflected in the recent creation of the “One Desert Initiative” committee, with Italy as the interlocutor between the European Union, Libya, and the Sahel. Thus, Italy’s new involvement in the Sahel, built through new bilateral proposals and greater leadership within European initiatives, also represents an important search for legitimacy, not only with African partners but also with European ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest impulse has been the presentation of the “Piano Mattei per l’Africa” initiative as a new model for Italy’s cooperation with the continent and, in particular, with the Sahel. It consists of three pillars: immigration control, regional development with investment in various productive sectors, and cooperation in the field of energy. It was presented at the Italy-Africa Summit organized by the government in January 2024 as the inaugural event of its upcoming presidency of the G7. However, it was precisely the Sahel countries that decided not to participate in the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Italy’s ambitions and efforts in the Sahel, NATO’s decision to choose the Spanish Colomina as representative of the southern neighborhood was very badly received by the Meloni government, which sent a letter of protest to Secretary General Stoltenberg. But Italy has not given up the game and will resume efforts to push for an Italian candidacy for the post with the new NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spain&quot;&gt;Spain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain could become a leading force on behalf of Europe in the Sahel. In fact, some international actors have spurred Spain on to play a larger role and increase cooperation in the region. In October 2023, Spain and the United States inaugurated the first meeting of the U.S.-Spain Working Group on the Sahel, which highlights the urgency of addressing the critical situation in the region and the role that Spain could play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madrid has consistently promoted and defended the need to devote more attention to the Mediterranean and surrounding areas, promoting cooperation frameworks and building trust between partners. But Spain’s main priority and concern is the Maghreb and, in particular, the spiral of tension between Morocco and Algeria, both fundamental countries with which Spain works bilaterally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain is the only EU member state that has been in every civilian and military mission deployed in Africa since 2003. In some missions, such as EUTM-Mali, Spanish soldiers have accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total number of troops deployed. Spain has also played an important role in two international coalitions for the region: the Coalition for the Sahel, which has addressed security, governance, and development issues, and the Alliance for the Sahel, whose assembly it chaired for three years until July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unlike other major countries such as France, Germany, Italy, or Poland, Spain does not have a summit at the political level that reinforces its role with the African continent — beyond bilateral meetings or other bodies such as the G5 Sahel — despite the fact that Spain is the only European country that maintains a land border with Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, despite having shown initiative and sometimes leadership capacity in this part of the planet and despite having supported the French and international military presence there, Spain has not managed to establish itself as a leading military actor in the Sahel. It was reluctant to extend the support provided by its armed forces to the Barkhane operation beyond logistical support, and it was absent from the Takuba special force entirely. And yet, the image of Spain’s presence in this region is generally positive — mainly because it has not played a colonial role in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last 15 years, Spain has done invaluable work for the improvement of West Africa and the Sahel, strengthening the capabilities of some countries in the region and strengthening international cooperation. It has done so in multiple areas and initiatives, establishing its own format in its relations with countries such as Mauritania. However, in recent years it has been unable to expand its role in parallel with the new needs that have arisen. This has meant that other European countries, such as Germany or Denmark — with fewer direct interests and less influence in the region — have filled the void left by Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Spain does not want to leave the Sahel behind. In addition to the aforementioned bilateral cooperation with the United States, Spain launched a series of new projects in Mauritania in 2024 with the support of the European Union. These include the development of green hydrogen and a broader strengthening of the partnership between Mauritania and the European Union, which will also serve as an engine for the stability of the Sahel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges emanating from the Sahel are growing more complex, and international attention devoted to the region has risen exponentially. European states must reflect on their existing policies, which are often inadequately adapted to local challenges, and move beyond an agenda focused primarily on containing threats instead of on addressing structural problems. Given the complexity of the current situation — the entire security architecture built over the last decade that was contingent on external support having collapsed in the last year — a reset in relations between Europe and the Sahel is direly needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new geopolitical framework is emerging in the region where Europe and the West increasingly seem out of place. This situation seems to be leading southern European countries, mainly France, Italy, and Spain, to review their policies toward the region while prioritizing bilateral efforts ahead of multilateral ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is a mistake, given the complexity of the challenges emanating from the Sahel. A better solution would be for these countries to set aside rivalry among themselves and coordinate to address the challenges emanating from the Sahel. France, Italy, and Spain are well known in the region and can work together to coordinate agendas, particularly as all have the tacit support of the European Union and NATO. At the same time, both the European Union and NATO could take advantage of the potential coordinated effort of these three countries to harmonize their strategies toward the region, thus reducing intra-European power struggles and increasing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France, Italy, and Spain should also coordinate with the United States, which remains concerned about instability in the Sahel. Given the mediocre results of EU and NATO efforts in the region, the United States has recently been trying to approach southern European countries individually to find effective solutions to specific countries and challenges. With the assistance of NATO’s new southern neighborhood representative, it is time for Paris, Rome, and Madrid to engage in coordinated talks with Washington to try to find new solutions for the Sahel, again leaving aside the perceived competition between them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英認國安法生效前 受訪倡外國制裁阻通過 稱不能等待條文出爐後才反對&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2REPF07.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第101日審訊，黎智英第九日作供。辯方圍繞黎的意圖提問，針對《文匯報》報導指稱黎「為美國打仗」、「為其美國主子說話」，黎否認，並強調香港示威與美國沒有關係，其言論是想證明香港人的價值觀與美國人一致。辯方在庭上播放黎在《國安法》生效之前的受訪片段，黎稱美國應對中國官員實施制裁、凍結銀行帳戶，以及停止向中國輸出技術等，又稱相信特朗普是有信用的人。他在庭上確認提倡制裁，希望阻止中國實施《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒與美國退休軍官討論核武-因核武比喻美國人擁有的價值&quot;&gt;黎稱沒與美國退休軍官討論核武 因核武比喻美國人擁有的價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭繼續主問，就黎智英的意圖提問。昨日提到，黎於2019年7月10日出席美國智庫「保衛民主基金會」（Foundation for Defense of Democracies，簡稱FDD）公開對談。他當時稱美國有「道德權威（moral authority）」，其支持猶如「核武（nuclear weapon）」。黎又指：「他們（中國）好像沒有任何武器便上戰場，當你使用核武的話，只需一分鐘便可擺平他們。」（“It’s like they’re like going to the battle without any weapon, and you have the nuclear weapon you can finish them in a minute.”）辯方今播放相關片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，黎說「我們正在敵方陣營替你們打仗（we are fighting your war in your enemy camp）」，是什麼意思。黎指「我們」是指香港和示威者，正如他之前所說，冷戰是一埸價值之爭，而香港人與美國價值觀一致，因此若然香港與中國對戰，那代表香港與美國屬同一陣線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否與美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz 和退休軍官 Jack Keane 討論過核武？黎稱沒有，因他只是以「核武」比喻美國人所擁有的價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎說很想cia影響我們時在笑-黎同意從來沒有這種事&quot;&gt;辯方指黎說「很想CIA影響我們」時在笑 黎同意：從來沒有這種事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨日提到，黎於2020年5月接受台灣節目《鄉民來衝康》的訪問，當他被問到有沒有CIA（美國中央情報局）影響香港的示威，他說：「我們很想 CIA，我很想美國影響我們，我很想英國影響我們，我很想外國影響我們，他們的支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去的，外國的勢力是現在我們非常需要，讓我們撐下去的。」辯方今在庭上播放相關片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，從畫面可見黎說以上說話時正在笑。黎同意，「因為從來都沒有這種事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認為美國打仗否認美國是主子&quot;&gt;黎否認「為美國打仗」、否認美國是「主子」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示《文匯報》報導〈肥黎默認「為美打仗」 政界批賣港禍國〉，當中引述黎在受訪時提及「中美新冷戰」，並指：「多名立法會議員昨日接受香港文匯報訪問時批評，美國一心箝制中國發展，而黎智英則為其美國主子說話，以各種手段破壞香港社會秩序，其賣港行為令人髮指。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述報導指黎變相承認香港的反政府事件是「為美國打仗」，問黎這說法是否真確。黎否認，並指香港的示威與美國沒有關係；而他在「保衛民主基金會」中說「我們正在敵方陣營替你們打仗」，是用比喻手法來說明香港示威是爭取價值，而該些價值觀與美國的一致。辯方追問黎是否「為美國打仗」，黎回答：「不是，我們不是為美國打仗，我們是為自己而戰」，以避免中國侵害香港的自由，並重申香港示威是爭取與美國一致的價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述報導形容「黎智英則為其美國主子說話」，黎則否認，並稱其言論是想證明香港人的價值觀與美國人一致，強調香港人和美國人沒有實質的關係。辯方追問黎，美國是否他的主子？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱聽過中國內爆但未聞支爆&quot;&gt;黎稱聽過「中國內爆」但未聞「支爆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭重提昨日證供，引述黎提到如果中國經濟內爆的話，中國政府的統治正當性便會崩塌。黎解釋，其意思是中國政府的統治正當性是來自經濟發展，但是如果經濟崩潰的話，中國政府便會失去統治正當性，國家主席習近平亦可能要下台，並強調他只是作出預測和臆測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎，「你是在2019年9月作出預測，這說法正確嗎？」黎確認。法官李素蘭繼而指，黎在當時已撰文提及中國內爆，然而黎作供關於2020年1月11日的陽明山會議時，卻聲稱「支爆」這字詞是由「攬炒巴」劉祖廸在會議上首先提出，質疑黎聲稱當時從沒聽過「支爆」的說法。黎同意，他當時從未聽聞「支爆」一字，正確的字眼應是「中國內爆」（China implosion），而「支爆」和「支那」是一種古老的方式談論「中國」，如果今時今日有人使用這字詞，對方不會明白意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於是次審訊語言為英文，庭上就「支爆」的英語翻譯為「China implosion」，與「中國內爆」的英語翻譯相同。因此黎解釋自己未曾聽聞「支爆（China implosion）」之後，不諳中文的法官李素蘭表示仍然不明白，並重複問題，質疑黎早已撰文提及「中國內爆」（同樣譯作「China implosion」），卻稱未曾聽過「支爆」的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則重申他未曾聽聞「支爆」，他只提及過「中國內爆（China implosion）」，若從英語翻譯過來即是「中國爆」，然而「支爆」則是一種過於古老的方式去說「中國」，他從未聽過有人如此說「支那」、「支爆」，現今人們聽到不會明白是什麼意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭介入並解釋，「支那（Shina）」本來是日本使用的詞語去形容「中國」，是一個帶貶損和貶意的詞語，也是一個古老的詞語，今時今日很少人使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，所以黎的意思是他曾經聽聞「中國內爆」，但是未曾聽過「支爆」。黎同意，所以當劉祖廸說「支爆」時，他表示不明白，要求劉解釋，但是黎確認自己有撰文提及「中國內爆」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法消息傳出翌日-提出開設twitter-黎冀讓世界知道香港發生什麼事&quot;&gt;國安法消息傳出翌日 提出開設Twitter 黎：冀讓世界知道香港發生什麼事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年5月21日，黎向時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏傳送《香港01》的新聞，有關人大擬在港實施《國安法》，黎並說：「仆街打到嚟喇！」翌日即2020年5月22日，黎向李兆富傳送訊息，稱有見人大打算通過在香港實施《國安法》，現在是設立 Twitter 帳戶的好時機。辯方問黎何以這樣說。黎指開設 Twitter 是想讓世界知道香港發生什麼事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DXjywsB.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，當時《國安法》條文尚未公開，問黎何以得知《國安法》內容。黎則指憑當時的新聞報導得知《國安法》將會取代香港現行的法律制度。黎認為《國安法》會凌駕《基本法》和法治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter-帖文標籤magnitskyact-黎稱出自李兆富之手只有粗略理解&quot;&gt;Twitter 帖文標籤「#MagnitskyAct」 黎稱出自李兆富之手、只有粗略理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年5月23日的訊息紀錄，陳沛敏向黎智英傳送一張人大政協委員的合照，相中眾人手持「支持國安立法 護航一國兩制」橫額，陳並稱：「Will they be on the list?」黎問：「What do you mean? Thanks」，陳回覆：「賣港賊，制裁名單？」黎表示：「I see. Good suggest.」陳續表示：「張相和唐英年的發言 disgusted many Hong Kong people」，黎其後稱：「I’ve already put them on my Twitter: should US government put these people (on) the sanction list?」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎同日將同一張人大政協委員合照傳送給李兆富，問原因為何。黎稱是因應陳沛敏的提議，他認為是很好的提議，所以傳送給李兆富，供他在 Twitter 發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎的 Twitter 帳戶同日發布帖文，顯示人大政協委員合照，並加上字句：「Should US government put them on the sanction list? #MagnitskyAct」黎稱帖文是因應陳沛敏的提議，發布合照是因為相中的人大政協委員削弱香港的自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎當時知道《國安法》是關於什麼嗎？黎表示知道得不詳細，但從新聞報導，他得悉《國安法》將會是一個凌駕《基本法》和法治的法律，以及會是嚴厲的法律。辯方追問黎何以得知《國安法》削弱法治？黎指當時市內有很多輿論，包括民主派和作家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到帖文內有標籤「#MagnitskyAct」，黎則稱是由李兆富加上的。辯方問黎當時明白「Magnitsky Act」是什麼嗎？黎稱不明白詳情，但是從表面上來看，這個詞是關於制裁。黎又稱自己對「Magnitsky Act」只有粗略的理解，而且一般而言不會在意李兆富加入的標籤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果發起一人一信救香港-黎用盡所有必要的手段去阻止國安法實施&quot;&gt;《蘋果》發起「一人一信救香港」 黎：用盡所有必要的手段去阻止國安法實施&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年5月24日《蘋果》頭版發起「一人一信救香港」行動。黎稱目的是阻止《國安法》實施，因《國安法》對香港具破壞性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ycUHxF9.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏曾供稱不認同做法，並且同日以 WhatsApp 傳送黃之鋒的 Facebook 帖文截圖給黎。黃在帖文稱「睇到真係覺得有啲骨痹同埋肉麻」，指香港不應要求別國的總統去拯救香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎當時回覆表示：「他（黃）說了什麼並不重要，這是看待美國和目前議題的不同觀點，我不認同他，任何東西可以幫助到我們的話都應該去用。我知道很多人都不認同這行動，包括李柱銘，但是在危機面前我們不能裝作謹慎和聰明，勇敢是唯一出路！現時已沒有其他方法對付中共了。」（“What he says doesn’t matter. That’s a very different view of looking at US and the matter at hand. I don’t agree with him, whatever we can secure to help us we must use now. I know a lot of people don’t agree with this including Martin, but now is time crisis we can’t pretend to be careful and clever. The only way is to be brave! There’s no other way to deal with CCP now.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，當時處於危急關頭，所以他認為要用盡所有必要的方法去阻止《國安法》實施，但他知道陳沛敏和張劍虹均不認同「一人一信」做法。辯方問黎會否視這些訊息為給予陳沛敏指示？黎說不會，「我只是回覆她，這裡沒有任何指示。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qt6lFsz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到，當時陳沛敏和張劍虹均不認同「一人一信救香港」，黎又如何發起行動？黎表示：「因為我是老闆。」他其後表示，當時提出這行動的同事必定認同這行動，並舉例指時任動新聞總監張志偉認同。張在本案中沒有被起訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指李兆富提議twitter上載信件照片及標註特朗普-惟最終沒有實行&quot;&gt;黎指李兆富提議Twitter上載信件照片及標註特朗普 惟最終沒有實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，由於當時正值疫情，郵寄實體信件的話可能需時一個月，所以李兆富提議在 Twitter 上載信件，然後標註特朗普的帳戶，但是黎相信最後沒有實行，因他記不起有人上載信件照片及標註特朗普。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示「一人一信救香港」頭版，當中提到「三大方法向特朗普表達訴求」，包括 Twitter、Facebook 和白宮聯署。黎確認三種方法均不需要經過《蘋果》便能做到。法官李運騰問黎是否不會知道讀者最終有否採用 Twitter 的方法。黎同意，因上載信件的照片到 Twitter 毋須經過《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，為何上載信件照片到 Twitter 並標註特朗普最終未有實行？黎則表示不記得原因，起初他提出實體信件較震撼，可是後來他們收集到信件之後，並沒有拍照及標註特朗普，他記不起有如此做過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦確認，頭版上的信件樣本是 Mark Simon 基於黎的理念而撰寫出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎國安法破壞香港言論自由-作為老闆應承擔所有責任&quot;&gt;黎：國安法破壞香港言論自由 作為老闆應承擔所有責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，黎於2020年5月25日重新擔任壹傳媒集團主席，他早前證供亦解釋：「《國安法》之後，如果《蘋果》發生了任何事，我希望我會是完全承擔責任的那一個人。」辯方問，黎說會承擔責任，是否與這個「一人一信救香港」行動有關？黎則表示，承擔責任是概括的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問黎是為了什麼事情承擔責任？黎指即將來臨的《國安法》，使傳媒生意非常危險，「作為老闆，我理應承擔所有責任，面對這些危險。」辯方問為什麼形容為「危險」？黎指：「因為我們大概都知道《國安法》是什麼，我們大概都知道《國安法》是嚴厲的，它會對香港的言論自由帶來破壞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎受訪及twitter均倡制裁中國官員凍結帳戶-冀阻國安法通過&quot;&gt;黎受訪及Twitter均倡制裁中國官員、凍結帳戶 冀阻國安法通過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方庭上播放《霍士新聞》片段，黎於2020年5月26日受訪時稱美國應對中國官員實施制裁、凍結銀行帳戶，以及停止向中國輸出技術等。辯方問黎是否提倡制裁？黎同意。辯方繼而問，當黎說停止向中國輸出技術時，黎是否提倡封鎖和敵對行動？黎則指這是制裁而非敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與張劍虹之間的訊息紀錄，張引述時事評論員桑普在D100節目中稱美國將會實施制裁；黎則回應張，指這不足以阻嚇中國，而他期望見到更嚴厲的制裁。辯方問黎說不足以阻嚇中國是什麼意思。黎表示當時認為制裁力度不足夠去阻止中國訂立國安法。至於「更嚴厲的制裁」，黎稱只是表達自己意見，他當時正觀望有沒有其他措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年5月27日黎發布的 Twitter 帖文，他轉發《霍士新聞》的影片連結，並說：「Thank you @MariaBartiromo for being so caring about me and about #HKers. We will continue our #FightforFreedom. #CCPChina must change or it will be a threat to the freedom of the rest of the world. We must do what it takes and what we can.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日黎的帳戶發布另一則帖文：「There should be sanctions on #CCPChina officials who violate universal value of human rights. Nations should stop exporting technology #CCPChina must play by the international rules.」黎相信帖文是出自他手筆。辯方問黎為何會說應該向中國官員實施制裁？黎說因為制裁可以阻止《國安法》實施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示同日另一則帖文：「The most effective sanction you can impose is to freeze Chinese officials’ bank accounts in US. Expose how corrupted they are. Your action will be much appreciated not only by #Hkers, but also the Chinese who suppressed by #CCP and every soul aspired to be free.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示同日另一則帖文，黎分享《彭博》文章〈U.S. Weighs Sanctions on Chinese Officials, Firms Over Hong Kong〉，並加上字句：「Mr. President @realDonaldTrump. You’re a man of his words. You said if China passes the national security act there will be serious consequences.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認國安法前受訪倡外國制裁-稱不能等待條文後出爐才反對&quot;&gt;黎認國安法前受訪倡外國制裁 稱不能等待條文後出爐才反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示黎與張劍虹之間的訊息，於2020年5月27日，黎提及美國制裁中國官員和企業的話，將會是對中國經濟「打擊」。被問到「打擊（blow）」是什麼意思，黎稱即是「打（the hit）」、「輾壓（the crush）」及「制裁官員和企業」。辯方問為了什麼目的？黎表示他理解特朗普對中國官員實施制裁是為了阻止《國安法》；至於為何要制裁中國企業，他則稱不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月28日黎智英接受《彭博》訪問，主持人問黎為何認為時任美國總統特朗普是「香港的最後希望」？黎引述特朗普說過如果香港實施《國安法》，「他會做一些認真的事（“he would do something serious”）」，但是他不知道特朗普相關措施會有多嚴厲。他促請美國實施制裁，相信特朗普是守信用的人，希望特朗普能在週末對中國實施嚴厲的制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，他認為美國最有效的制裁措施是凍結中國高官的外地銀行戶口，因為他們有大量貪污的錢（corrupted money）儲存在美國和歐洲的銀行戶口裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認上述說話反映他當時所真誠相信的想法。辯方提到，主持人說其時黎尚未有機會看到《國安法》條文，直至6月30日實施的晚上，為何不等待實際條文出爐，之後才反對它？黎在節目中回答，不能夠等待，世界應該阻止《國安法》通過。辯方問黎當時為何如此說。黎說不能等待條文公開，因外國需要對中國作出反應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另播放《英國廣播公司》（BBC）的訪問片段，黎引述特朗普稱，若然中國實施港區《國安法》的話會有「嚴重後果」，又指美國單憑說話是不足夠，還要有實際行動。辯方問黎口中的「行動」是什麼意思。黎說是制裁，即請求美國對中國實施最嚴厲的制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第100日審訊，黎智英第八日作供。黎於2019年7月參與美國智庫「保衛民主基金會」公開對談，期間稱美國政府有「道德權威」，好比「核武」，因此香港極需要美國的支持。黎庭上強調，中美之間的「戰爭」並不牽涉武器，乃價值上的爭鋒，並否認提倡冷戰。法官杜麗冰一度問黎，他稱「他們好像沒有任何武器便上戰場，當你使用核武的話，只需一分鐘便可擺平他們」，是什麼意思。黎則稱他並非意指真實的核武，他只是使用誇張手法表達，以及將道德權威比喻為核武。法官李素蘭追問，黎為何會以「核武」作為比喻？黎聞言則笑指：「如果我選擇另一些比喻的話，你也會問我相同的問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱給予陳梓華的金錢從不牽涉報酬成份&quot;&gt;黎稱給予陳梓華的金錢從不牽涉「報酬」成份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭繼續主問，圍繞黎與另一被告陳梓華之間的金錢往來。辯方展示2019年10月11日陳梓華的銀行帳戶紀錄，可見一筆144,100港元的支票存入款項。財務文件顯示該14萬元是給予陳梓華舉辦展覽的贊助。黎則稱當時沒有留意詳情便簽名，並指 Mark Simon 提供相關資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示支票紀錄，顯示由黎持有的力高顧問有限公司，在2020年2月底，以支票形式把80,273元存入陳梓華的戶口。陳早前供稱，黎智英支付他英國和台北之旅的費用，合共約6萬元，而其餘款項是林姓女示威者的開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則表示對這8萬元不知情，也沒有牽涉其中。被問到力高的銀行戶口有多少個授權簽署人，黎則稱不知道。黎另被問到如何向陳支付旅程的開支，黎亦稱不知道，可能是 Mark Simon 以支票形式歸還給陳。黎又稱，Mark Simon 會作出決定，並不需要經他的同意才能批出該筆款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提及，黎早前否認轉讓離岸公司 LACOCK 是作為給予陳的「報酬」。黎堅稱，與陳梓華之間的金錢往來中，從來沒有牽涉「報酬」的性質。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認陳梓華提及成立流亡政府和軍隊&quot;&gt;黎否認陳梓華提及成立流亡政府和軍隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒作供時，提到陳梓華透露他領導一隊勇武隊，以及有一處地方儲存物資，其小隊亦涉及製作爆炸品的「科學實驗」。李亦提到，陳曾評論一宗大埔開槍事件，以及討論成立流亡政府和軍隊、找以色列軍隊協助訓練勇武。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過黎在庭上稱，在與陳的溝通之中，陳從沒向他提及上述事情，陳也沒提及自己牽涉該宗大埔開槍事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎twitter轉發ipac推文-惟堅稱不知道ipac&quot;&gt;黎Twitter轉發IPAC推文 惟堅稱不知道IPAC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著圍繞黎的 Twitter（現稱X）提問。辯方指黎在2020年5月22日開設Twitter帳戶，問黎當時是否知道「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）。黎稱不知道，也沒有與負責管理帳戶的李兆富討論過 IPAC，而黎亦稱自己對 IPAC 不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在2020年6月13日在 Twitter 轉發一則《華爾街日報》的文章〈Global Coalition of Legislators Faces Challenges Countering China〉，當中提及不同國家的議員組成聯盟 IPAC，以應付中國帶來的挑戰。黎並加上評論：「It is encouraging to see leaders from different nationalities and ideological backgrounds to join force @ipcglobal to tackle the world’s most urgent geopolitical challenge #CCP, a belligerent regime imposes distorted values on its people and others.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱整個推文都是由李兆富準備，而他在發布之前可能只曾瞥一眼（had a glance）。辯方指從黎與李之間的訊息紀錄可見，在該推文發布之前，二人從未提及過 IPAC 或《華爾街日報》。黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱信任李兆富-幾乎全部批准發布-官質疑李事前理應曾徵詢黎&quot;&gt;黎稱信任李兆富 幾乎全部批准發布 官質疑李事前理應曾徵詢黎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，李有否得到黎的同意才發布上述推文。黎則稱，每當李兆富傳送草擬推文給他，他幾乎都會批准，而他只會粗略過目。辯方追問，黎如何批准李發布？黎則稱他信任李，因李是他的徒弟（mentee），替他工作了很長時間，所以認為李知道自己想要的是什麼，後來李不需要得到他的批准也可以自行決定發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，黎聲稱推文發布之前沒有過目，只依賴李的理解，可是這是黎自己的 Twitter 帳戶，李必然事先知道黎的理解，才會使用他的帳戶來發布相關帖文，例如李會問黎「這樣發布IPAC是否合適」之類。黎否認，並重申帳戶是由李負責管理。黎強調當時沒有留意 IPAC，也未有問李有關 IPAC 的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不知道避風港法案不知道知道羅傑斯和裴倫德與ipac有關&quot;&gt;黎稱不知道「避風港法案」、不知道知道羅傑斯和裴倫德與IPAC有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於國安法生效之後，辯方展示黎於2020年7月17日的推文：「#HongKong #SafeHarborAct and #PeoplesFreedomandChoiceAct are good wherewithals to our resistance movement. Salute all former CGs and State Dept staff for caring about this place we call home.」。辯方指根據黎與李兆富之間的 WhatsApp，二人在推文發布之前，並沒有提及過《香港避風港法案》（Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act）和《香港人自由和選擇法》（Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act）。黎在庭上表示，從不知道「避風港法案」，直至在法庭上才知道。至於推文中的標籤（hashtag），黎稱肯定是李兆富加入的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示2020年7月22日的推文，乃轉發 IPAC 的推文。惟黎庭上稱當時沒有留意 IPAC，當李兆富徵詢他的時候，他可能只是瞥了一眼，又稱當時不關注 IPAC 這類組織，因為與他沒有任何關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，當時是7月22日，換言之《國安法》已經生效，問黎是否有興趣知道國際社會怎樣回應《國安法》生效？黎同意，他認為國際社會應提供支持，以保護香港的自由免受侵蝕，但他只是希望。被問到希望社會提供怎樣的支持，黎則稱沒有想過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在2020年8月14日轉發 IPAC 的一則推文，並標註了羅傑斯和標籤「#IPAC」，其時是黎首次被捕四日之後。惟黎稱不記得自己有見過這個推文。黎否認知道羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）與 IPAC 有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;推文向攬炒巴致敬及標註standwithhongkong-黎稱不知攬炒巴與swhk關係&quot;&gt;推文向攬炒巴致敬及標註「#StandwithHongKong」 黎稱不知攬炒巴與SWHK關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年10月24日黎的推文，當中標註「攬炒巴」劉祖廸的帳戶：「I salute to @finnlau_cd. At only 26, he has the wisdom knowing exactly when and what the right role to play. He inspired his peers in his former role, and he’ll do it this time. The outside world support is very important. #StandwithHongKong」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱他記得有份草擬此推文，其後傳送給李兆富。最終發布的推文含有標籤「#StandwithHongKong」，黎稱是由李加上。法官李素蘭問黎，當時知不知道劉祖廸與「重光團隊」（Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）的關係。黎稱不知道，沒有人告訴過他，他也沒有思考過兩者之間的關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，他當時閱讀了《蘋果》於2020年10月24日的中文報導「遊行被圍捕險洩身份 攬炒巴死裏逃生 帶署歷警暴 拒保後返英」，然後草擬上述推文，惟報導中未有提及劉與「重光團隊」的關係，他並沒有深入思考兩者關係。辯方提到報紙版面載有「Stand with Hong Kong until dawn」的廣告，惟黎當時認為這是一句口號，而不知道「Stand with Hong Kong」是一個組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，向劉致敬是因為他的勇氣，而劉的年紀（26歲）乃從報導中得知。推文提及劉的「過去角色」以及他「這次會去做」，黎解釋意思是劉過去在「連登」擔當精神領袖，而他將會進行游說爭取國際支持香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報導提及劉曾在一次未經批准集結中被捕，日子是2020年1月1日。黎則稱當時未有閱讀整篇報導，後來從陳梓華口中才知道此事。辯方展示陳梓華在2020年1月2日的訊息，陳向黎說，劉遇上麻煩事，所以旅程需延誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認串謀陳梓華李宇軒和攬炒巴等人請求外國制裁&quot;&gt;黎否認串謀陳梓華、李宇軒和攬炒巴等人請求外國制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方總結串謀勾結外國勢力罪，問黎有否串謀或同意陳梓華，請求外國對中國實施制裁、封鎖或敵對行為。黎稱他除了要求陳跟勇武派溝通以平息暴力之外，便從來沒要求陳做任何事情。黎亦否認串謀或同意 Mark Simon 和劉祖廸請求外國制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於被控方指稱為「串謀者」的李宇軒、時任日本議員菅野志櫻里和協助在全球各地推動馬格尼茨基人權問責法（Magnitsky Act）的英國金融家 Bill Browder，黎則稱當時未聽聞過他們的名字，直至在庭上才聽過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指新冷戰屬價值之爭-以核武比喻道德權威-官問為何以核武為比喻&quot;&gt;黎指新冷戰屬價值之爭 以「核武」比喻道德權威 官問為何以「核武」為比喻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英於2019年7月赴美會見時任美國副總統彭斯和時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧之後，在7月10日與「保衛民主基金會」（Foundation for Defense of Democracies，簡稱FDD）的資深副主席 Johnathan Schanzer 進行公開對談，並向黎展示對談錄音謄本。當時黎強調反修例是「最後一戰」，而香港人的反抗是道德力量的戰爭，又指美國政府有「道德權威（moral authority）」，其支持是「核武（nuclear weapon）」，因此香港極需要美國的支持。黎形容中國與美國之間進入「新冷戰」，是關乎價值的鬥爭，而香港正在「前線」，他最後指，美國不能只說不做，同時亦要以行動支持香港人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎說「新冷戰」和「核武」是什麼意思？黎則指這是一種比喻，意思是美國人的道德權威好比「核武」，強調中美之間的「戰爭」並不牽涉武器。辯方問黎是否提倡中美冷戰？黎表示，他當時乃指出特朗普政府與中國已經形成和正在進行冷戰；「當然我支持與中國冷戰」，惟他否認提倡冷戰。而「戰爭」是價值上的爭鋒，而非使用武器的戰爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，他認為美國應該用道德權威作為武器，來與中國對戰。被問到「道德權威」意思是什麼，黎指「道德權威」是「正義、公義和公平，以及活在真實和正確的事情之中」，而這與中國有別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，黎在對談中聲稱：「他們好像沒有任何武器便上戰場，當你使用核武的話，只需一分鐘便可擺平他們。」（“It’s like they’re like going to the battle without any weapon, and you have the nuclear weapon you can finish them in a minute.”）如果正如黎所稱「核武」的意思是「道德權威」的話，怎樣以「道德權威」在一分鐘內擺平？黎重申以上言論只是比喻。惟杜官表示不明白。黎則回應，他並非意指真實的核武，他只是使用誇張手法表達，以及將道德權威比喻為核武。黎亦解釋，中國有真實的核武，但是他們沒有道德權威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭追問，黎為何會以「核武」作為比喻？黎聞言則笑指：「如果我選擇另一些比喻的話，你也會問我相同的問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭又問，該對談影片在網上廣播，黎會否認為觀眾會從字面的意思理解「核武」？黎解釋，他在節目中指中國沒有「核武」，可是現實裡中國的確有核武，所以他提及的「核武」意思就是「道德權威」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認文章提倡中美貿易戰&quot;&gt;黎否認文章提倡中美貿易戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示黎於2019年9月30日，刊登於《華爾街日報》的文章〈There’s Hope for Freedom, Even in China〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否提倡中美貿易戰？黎則指他撰寫文章的時候，特朗普政府與中國之間的貿易戰已經發生，因此否認自己提倡貿易戰。黎表示，他在文章中稱希望美國與中國交涉時能夠連繫到價值層面，是因為他認為這樣的話能夠改變中國，使中國加入普世的核心價值體系。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則指，當黎使用「西方核心價值」這詞語的時候，便代表該些價值不是「普世」，因為世界上有很多國家，不只西方國家。黎認同，但是該些價值在世界貿易之中會交換，包括法治和透明度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，是否認為當美國與中國交涉時連繫到人權和核心價值，就會令中國讓步？黎同意。法官李運騰指，當黎撰寫文章的時候，美國與中國交涉時還未連繫上人權和價值議題。黎同意，並指中美兩國只是在對抗。李官追問，黎是否希望兩國交涉時連繫上人權和價值議題，增加貿易戰的另一面向？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章提及中國經濟內爆-黎嘗試舉例說明若經濟爆破政府統治正當性隨之崩塌&quot;&gt;文章提及「中國經濟內爆」 黎：嘗試舉例說明若經濟爆破政府統治正當性隨之崩塌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又指，文章提到「如果中國經濟內爆（If China’s economy implodes）」，問黎撰寫文章時有沒有與其他人討論過？黎則表示沒有與任何人討論，他在文章中的意思是，當中國經濟內爆的話，中國政府的統治正當性也會崩塌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問黎是否發明「中國經濟內爆」這個概念，還是從其他人的文章讀來或從其他人口中聽來？黎回答，他只是嘗試舉例說明，當中國經濟爆破，其政府的統治正當性也會隨之崩塌，因為中國政府的統治正當性一直建基於經濟發展。他亦指，不排除有人曾經提出過這個概念，可是他撰寫這篇文章之時，並未有閱讀過其他相關文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎同意，他相信當中國接受國際貿易的核心價值時，便能夠改變中國，並補充指之所以有貿易戰，是因為有價值觀上的差異。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示黎在2020年2月19日刊登於《華爾街日報》的文章，其時正值新冠疫情爆發。辯方指，黎在文章中形容美國是自由和開放，又指中美缺乏互信，貿易戰是源於信任問題，問黎想在文章帶出什麼信息。黎則指「純粹讓事實說話」。被問到有否意圖要求美國去做任何事情，黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;受訪稱很想cia美國影響我們-黎利用謠言&quot;&gt;受訪稱「很想CIA、美國影響我們」 黎：利用謠言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年5月接受台灣節目「鄉民來衝康」的訪問，他曾說：「我們很想 CIA，我很想美國影響我們，我很想英國影響我們，我很想外國影響我們，他們的支持是我們唯一能夠撐下去的，外國的勢力是現在我們非常需要，讓我們撐下去的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上回應：「我們需要美國的影響，我們需要英國的影響。」被問到什麼影響，黎則指意思是美國和英國對香港的支持，而他們的支持是香港撐下去的唯一方法。他又指，當時被問到香港示威有否受到 CIA（美國中央情報局）的影響，所以他才會如此回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，為何黎會說需要 CIA 的影響？黎則指，因為當時有很多謠言，指 CIA 叫人出來參與示威、香港的示威是由 CIA 指示等。黎反覆強調這些謠言並不是真實的，所以他受訪時說希望 CIA 影響他們，乃利用該謠言來表示希望美國能影響他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎強調沒有任何外國影響香港的示威-官質疑怎樣保證&quot;&gt;黎強調沒有任何外國影響香港的示威 官質疑怎樣保證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎強調，當時從沒有任何外國勢力影響香港的示威，「如果有任何外國影響的話，那便是他們的支持。」辯方繼而追問，當時的示威有沒有受到美國的影響？黎回答：「完全沒有，我可以保證。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭追問，「你說你可以保證，你可以怎樣保證？」黎則指，如果有任何外國的影響，人們會知道。黎又指，正如他在節目中說，「美國怎樣叫200萬人出來示威？」，反問：「如果美國能叫200萬人出來示威，如果他們能這樣做的話，那為什麼他們不在內地做同樣的事情？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎受訪時稱「外國的勢力是現在我們非常需要」，問黎是什麼意思。黎則指，「外國勢力」就是國際社會的支持，即是任何可以令運動持續的「支持」。法官李運騰問，「支持」是以什麼形式？黎指，可以是「為我們發聲，為我們跟中國對話，為我們向中國交涉，甚至為我們而譴責中國」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英明言希望美國推制裁 以阻止國安法 惟稱僅願望未必發生&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YKRDME2.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（29日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第99日審訊，黎智英第七日作供。2020年5月28日，即有新聞報導人大準備推行港版國安法的時候，黎向同案被告陳梓華傳送訊息：「更多嚴苛的制裁將出自特朗普，希望是今個週末。」黎稱在訊息表達個人願望而非事實，並認為若美國推行制裁，中國會重新考慮是否推行國安法，但他不認為必然發生，只是一個願望。在法官提問下，黎同意希望制裁措施出台，因時間緊迫，希望制裁愈早出台愈好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，陳梓華曾指稱黎動用了大量人脈以及媒體資源去協助初選舉行，「我諗我係少數人知道當初初選一直以嚟構思嘅係黎智英。」但當辯方問黎在訊息中為何會形容初選為「奇蹟」，黎卻似乎混淆初選和區議會選舉，兩度回答因為「大勝」。黎亦堅稱從沒有與陳討論過初選的事宜，並不關注事態發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認在會議提及初選-指攬炒巴居英不可能參選&quot;&gt;黎否認在會議提及初選 指攬炒巴居英不可能參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方大律師關文渭的主問下，繼續圍繞同案另一被告陳梓華的證供，牽涉「串謀勾結外國勢力」控罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月11日，黎智英在台灣陽明山別墅，與陳梓華、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和一名女子見面及交談。陳梓華早前指稱，黎在會上談及初選，並問劉祖廸會否嘗試參選，又表示「佢（黎）本人會幫啲政治素人，去幫佢哋做傳媒曝光，同埋經濟上支持佢哋，只要佢哋肯去參選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱他不可能問劉會否參選立法會，因劉當時居於英國倫敦。法官李素蘭問，黎如何得知劉居於倫敦？黎引述劉在會面時表示在倫敦工作，工作性質與梁振英一樣，都是從事測量行業。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，若然劉居於倫敦，而不是在香港，黎又如何期望劉去影響勇武派？黎則表示，他不是叫劉去領導勇武派，而是叫他游說勇武派，因劉擁有很大的影響力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎到底是想劉做勇武派的領袖、還是意見領袖（KOL）？黎則指，運動無領袖導致了街頭暴力不受控制，因此認為需要有一個領袖團隊。在追問下，黎稱劉在「連登」很有影響力，猶如一個「精神領袖」，而他只是請求劉運用其影響力去令勇武派平息暴力。他又指自己從不瀏覽「連登」，只是從報紙上得知「連登」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關陳引述黎稱會資助政治素人參與初選，辯方問黎有否在會議上談及初選。黎否認，並稱從沒觸及這個話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，在該次會面之後，便沒有再與劉聯絡過，包括親身會面和透過電子通訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱向黎匯報李宇軒劉祖廸同意支持國際線-黎否認&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱向黎匯報李宇軒劉祖廸同意支持國際線 黎否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，陽明山會議翌日，他與已故台灣民運人士施明德見面，當晚在酒店與劉祖廸跟李宇軒進行線上會議，將會見黎智英的內容告知李。陳續稱，線上會議結束之後，他透過WhatsApp Call 聯絡黎，陳告訴黎：「Andy（李宇軒）同劉祖廸都同意喺國際線上面跟隨你嘅行動。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今稱，他不知道有這個線上會議，也沒有參與。對於陳稱曾向黎匯報李宇軒和劉祖廸均同意支持國際線，黎否認有此對話，因他當時不知道李宇軒，直至閱讀新聞和在庭上才知道這個人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英否認出面調停美國線爭拗&quot;&gt;黎智英否認出面調停美國線爭拗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，他在2020年1月底再次聯絡黎，告知黎，劉祖廸「唔想打議會線，但係喺國際線上面，就會全力開火。」惟黎則表示，不認為這次通話曾存在，因為劉是否在國際線上，從不是自己所關注的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另供稱，他在通話中向黎提及「當時有條日本線，就係李宇軒打嘅」。黎則反駁，他從沒聽聞過李宇軒或任何關於日本的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦稱，當時美國線由劉祖廸、李宇軒和Shirley Ho帶頭，但他們與當地的港人組織「有啲拗撬」，所以希望黎智英出面調停，而黎則叫陳聯絡Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎知不知道美國線的領袖是劉祖廸、李宇軒和Shirley Ho。黎則否認，並稱從沒與陳討論美國線事宜，「所以這必定是他捏造出來。（So this must be a fabrication by him.）」黎亦否認陳希望他出面調停，反問：「我不認識他們（美國線）任何一個，又如何出面調停？」他並否認曾叫 Mark Simon 協助調停。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華傳送初選消息-黎從沒討論初選沒關注事態發展&quot;&gt;陳梓華傳送初選消息 黎：從沒討論初選、沒關注事態發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年2月26日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「眾志聯盟」的出選名單，新西派出朱凱廸、新東派出何桂藍、九東派出黃之鋒、梁凱晴做「Plan B」、九西派出張崑陽、港島派出羅冠聰、超區則派出岑敖暉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎當時回覆陳：「我們要著手處理，如果初選有認受性，他們也必須參與。且看看事態發展如何。（Thanks. We’ve to work on them. But if the primary has legitimacy, they will have to join. Let’s see.）」陳回覆：「我會盡力處理它。（I will try my best to work on it.）」、「至少不會讓他們拖累。（At least not to let them ruin it.）」陳庭上解釋，黎智英當時希望令到眾志聯盟名單上的人士參與初選，以及受到初選的約束。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則表示，從沒有與陳討論過初選的事宜，自己也從沒接觸上述名單上的人士，或者叫他們參與初選。他稱不認識朱凱廸和何桂藍，但是私下認識黃之鋒和張崑陽，羅冠聰和岑敖暉則是點頭之交。他強調當時不在意初選的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎知不知道初選在2020年7月的時候舉行，黎稱不知道。有份審理初選47人案的法官李運騰提到，《蘋果日報》當時有大量關於初選的報導，而根據初選案的指控，《蘋果》提供了平台舉行初選論壇。黎則回應，自己沒有關注事件發展，他當然他是知道有初選，但重申沒有與陳討論過。法官李素蘭質疑，陳當時只是突然向黎提起初選（So out of the blue）？黎同意，並指陳可能認為初選重要，所以傳送相關消息給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎直至庭上才知道與李宇軒牽涉同一案件&quot;&gt;黎：直至庭上才知道與李宇軒牽涉同一案件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年8月10日首次被拘捕，而在同一天，李宇軒也警方以勾結外國勢力罪拘捕。在數星期之後，李在中國水域被內地當局拘捕。黎表示有看過相關新聞，記得當時並非還柙當中。辯方問黎當時是否知道，李宇軒跟他牽涉同一宗案件。黎則稱不知道，直至在庭上才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾轉讓離岸公司予陳梓華-黎否認是推動制裁的報酬&quot;&gt;曾轉讓離岸公司予陳梓華 黎否認是推動制裁的「報酬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，在2020年1月，Mark Simon將一間在英屬維爾京群島註冊的公司 LACOCK 及一個匯豐銀行本地戶口，轉讓給陳。他後來得悉文件上的簽名屬於黎智英，又稱這是黎智英和 Mark Simon 給他的「報酬（reward）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否記得 LACOCK，黎稱不知道，他只知道其私人公司「力高顧問有限公司」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LACOCK文件顯示直至2019年11月30日，戶口存款為8萬元，至2020年2月7日，銀行扣除辦理轉讓的200元手續費之後，存款最終為79,800元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，相信是因為當時陳梓華向 Mark Simon 投訴無法開設銀行戶口，所以便轉讓了這間離岸公司及銀行戶口給陳。辯方隨即指，轉讓的不只是銀行戶口，還有戶口內的8萬元。黎僅指，「對，這是銀行戶口，當然有款項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，可能在黎眼中8萬元並不是大數目，但是就一般香港人而言，8萬元可能是一筆大數目，問黎有否將該8萬元，作為陳請求外國制裁的回報？黎否認，並稱從沒有要求陳請求外國制裁，他只是要求他協助聯絡勇武派，以平息暴力，而該筆錢也不是一個「報酬」。他又指，陳投訴不能開設銀行戶口，而Mark Simon 只是出於好心才會幫助陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，Mark Simon進行轉讓手續之前並未有徵求他的批准，但是他是同意這件事情，因此有在文件上簽名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據控辯雙方承認事實，在2018年4月26日至2020年1月13日之間，黎智英、Mark Simon 和前壹傳媒財務總裁周達權是 LACOCK 銀行戶口的授權簽署人。由2020年1月14日開始，該銀行戶口唯一授權簽署人轉為陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎轉發美國內部消息予陳-含制裁內容-黎稱只關注暴力升級&quot;&gt;黎轉發美國內部消息予陳 含制裁內容 黎稱只關注暴力升級&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年4月5日，英國駐港澳前總領事郭明瀚（Jim Cunningham）向黎智英傳送美國政府的內部消息，並要求黎保密。訊息稱美國政府關注示威者日益升級的暴力，包括炸彈（I was told the US is very concerned about new violence from demonstrators, increased threats from bombs/IEDs），若有導致警察或市民死亡的話，便會使美國政府、國會和輿論疏遠運動，內部人士亦認同暴力對反修例運動構成嚴重威脅，既刺激北京亦失去美國政府的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後向陳梓華轉發相關訊息，並叫陳保密。黎庭上解釋，因為他關注示威者日漸升級的暴力，以及警方的暴力，所以轉發訊息給陳。辯方追問，訊息亦含有制裁的內容。黎則稱，他將整段訊息轉發時，不能刪除有關制裁的內容。他稱轉發目的純粹讓陳知道美國關注香港示威暴力升級。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，他很想將美國的內部消息轉發給劉祖廸和李宇軒，於是致電黎徵詢其同意，而黎回覆不要複製貼上（copy and paste），只需把相關消息告知劉祖廸和李宇軒。惟黎否認有相關對話，也不知道李宇軒的Telegram 帳號是「rip」。他亦稱不記得當時有沒有示威者使用炸彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾嘗試安排陳梓華等人赴台見唐鳳-黎否認與政治有關&quot;&gt;黎曾嘗試安排陳梓華等人赴台見唐鳳 黎否認與政治有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年5月，黎智英向陳梓華轉發訊息，顯示黎聯絡台灣《蘋果日報》社長陳裕鑫，嘗試安排「逆權運動年輕人陣營」到台灣，與時任台灣行政院政務委員唐鳳和中華文化協會見面。陳早前供稱，當時SWHK內部討論過發展台灣線，而黎問他們想不想見唐鳳和中華文化協會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則在庭上反駁，不明白為何陳會牽扯到唐鳳的政治立場上，因唐鳳是一名資訊科技天才，而不是一名示威或政治運動的專家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方澄清，從訊息可見，當時是黎問陳想不想見唐鳳。黎則回應，他不會將唐鳳與任何政見或政治的事宜聯繫上，因唐鳳只是一名資訊科技天才。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又提到，唐鳳在疫情期間編寫了一個程式，用來追蹤病毒走勢，以保護市民免受病毒感染，令其非常受歡迎，形容唐鳳是一個傳奇。法官李運騰問黎，但是陳並不是對病毒有興趣。黎則表示不知道，僅指可能陳想與傳奇人物見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於中華文化協會，黎指它不是一個政府機構，只是一個關於藝術和文化的組織，沒有牽涉香港的事務。黎相信陳後來未有成行，因為疫情期間的隔離政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒想過自己會觸犯國安法-堅持留在香港面對&quot;&gt;黎稱沒想過自己會觸犯國安法 堅持留在香港面對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施「港版國安法」的報導，並說：「仆街打到嚟喇！」陳回覆黎：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與Martin及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，黎為何認為國安法會影響到陳？黎稱因為陳是示威者之一。法官李運騰指陳的訊息提及「國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士」，問是否因為陳認為黎會墮入上述三個類別，所以如此說。黎則稱不知道，陳純粹提到這三類人。法官李素蘭問，陳會否認為黎會墮入「煽惑群眾人士」這一類別？黎表示，當時沒有進一步思考訊息的意思，對陳的說話不在意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，黎其後回覆陳：「我們不要擔心個人安危。一旦站出來爭取自由，便要準備作戰至最後一刻，我們雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去。不用擔心。更好的日子即將來臨（Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，當陳梓華提到國安法針對的三類人時，為何會回覆「我們不要擔心個人安危」，若然黎認為自己不會墮入法網，為何當時不回覆：「不用擔心，我不會墮入該三個類別」之類。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則回應：「因為我不會好像你這樣思考」，又說：「你是在把說話塞進我的口。」他表示，當時沒有為意陳所關注的三類人士，他只關注自己和李柱銘及其家人的自身安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎當時有否擔心自己會觸犯國安法？黎表示沒有想過。李官再問，是否代表國安法生效之後，黎會繼續做他一直在做的事情？黎說：「我會堅持留在香港，和面對它。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華其後回覆黎，說：「我沒有退後的餘地，我亦有責任盡量保留最多的力量。我也不會放棄。如果你們都倒下了，我會是最後一個站著的人。最好的即將來臨（There is no turning back for me and I do have a sense of duty to conserve our forces as much as possible. I won’t give up too. If all of you fall, I will be the last man standing. The best is yet to come.）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指從訊息可見，陳打算繼續堅持抗爭，參與在地運動。辯方指訊息提到保留「力量」，黎認為「力量」意思是陳的同儕，包括勇武派和年輕人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎明言希望美國制裁-以阻止國安法&quot;&gt;黎明言希望美國制裁 以阻止國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年5月28日向陳傳送一條連結，惟該連結現已不能開啟，無法知道網站內容是什麼；黎並說：「剛剛見到，特朗普將推出更嚴苛的制裁，希望是今個週末。（Just saw it. More draconian sanctions were coming from Trump, hopefully this weekend）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，他希望特朗普會盡力阻止國安法通過，透過對中國實施制裁。辯方問黎在訊息中是表達事實還是個人願望。黎稱是願望。辯方問黎為何認為制裁能夠阻止國安法通過。黎則稱這是阻止國安法通過的唯一可能性，因此他才會說這是「願望」。他不認為必然發生，只是一個願望。辯方問，透過制裁來阻止國安法背後的原理是什麼。黎僅指，中國會重新考慮是否推行國安法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，黎在訊息中使用的字眼是「More draconian sanctions」，是否代表此前已經有嚴苛的制裁，而黎希望有「更多」制裁措施？黎則表示，無法得知美國是否會推出更多制裁措施，而美國最後也沒有制裁。但他其後指，「more draconian」意思是「更具毀滅性（more damaging）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎使用「hopefully」這個字眼，是否代表他希望制裁措施出台？黎同意，又指時間緊迫，有這樣的願望。李官又問，是否代表黎希望制裁愈早出台愈好？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華傳送重光計劃眾籌資料給黎智英&quot;&gt;陳梓華傳送「重光計劃」眾籌資料給黎智英&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月28日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送一條「連登」討論區連結，題為「【突發】攬炒過後是晨曦！攬炒團隊《重光香港計劃》眾籌上線！」。陳早前供稱，當時SWHK的資金即將耗盡，決定舉辦眾籌，把連結傳送給黎，是「因為要報告返俾佢知我哋做過啲咩」，並希望黎智英能夠幫手宣傳眾籌計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟黎在庭上稱，相信陳只是純粹讓他知道相關消息，又指從沒與陳談論過渡性貸款的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華赴壹傳媒大樓-黎指陳擔心身份曝光&quot;&gt;陳梓華赴壹傳媒大樓 黎指陳擔心身份曝光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月16日，陳梓華到達將軍澳壹傳媒大樓與黎智英會面，該次是第六次見面。陳早前供稱，因為黎希望避開所有傳媒鏡頭，故陳由黎的私人司機接載往壹傳媒大樓，「擔心俾人見到佢同年輕嘅抗爭者有聯繫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，當日壹傳媒大樓外面有沒有記者？黎笑言：「外面不知道，但裡面有很多。」黎又反駁指，擔心傳媒鏡頭的是陳，所以才會安排私人司機在另一處接載他到大樓，陳亦要求經後門進入大樓而不經正門，並且不想接觸到大樓內的記者。黎又提到過往陳到他的家食飯，陳也會問及如何避開住宅外的記者，擔心身份被曝光。辯方問，當時有否關於陳的新聞報導？黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱會面僅關於劉祖廸在英國受襲一事&quot;&gt;黎稱會面僅關於劉祖廸在英國受襲一事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，該次會面是因為劉祖廸在英國被人襲擊，故陳想見面討論事件。黎引述陳認為襲擊是中國政府安排的；惟黎跟陳說不是，這不像是中國政府的操作，認為純粹是打劫；陳則不認為是打劫，這是陳來大樓見黎的原因。黎稱，除了劉祖廸受襲事件之外，便沒有其他重要的事情討論過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又憶述，當陳提起劉祖廸時，黎說他認為劉不是一個「有效的領袖（effective leader）」，因他的「兄弟姐妹」均在前線對抗警察，可是他卻留在倫敦，然而一名領袖不應該遠離險境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎稱在2020年1月台灣會見劉的時候，沒有打算叫他成為領袖，只是想他運用其影響力，可是到了6月的時候，黎卻說劉不是一個有效的領袖，問為何會突然這樣談論劉。黎肯定是陳首先提起劉，因劉受襲一事，所以陳提起他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認說過將蘋果由本地傳媒變成國際傳媒&quot;&gt;黎否認說過將《蘋果》由本地傳媒變成國際傳媒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，黎在會面期間稱國安法不會太過嚴厲。黎今認為陳的說法正確，因他不認為中國想摧毀香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，黎指當時《蘋果日報》不斷虧蝕，所以需要商業上的支持；又指黎推行英文版需要大量資金。黎則指自己可能有說過《蘋果》虧蝕，因為當時的確蝕了很多錢，但是英文版需要大量資金的說法不真確，因成本很低，所以才會推行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，黎說：「呢個英文版相當於一個國際版，就係俾外國人睇嘅。雖然係蝕錢，但係對於佢嚟講好有價值。」黎則指自己當時不可能說英文版蝕錢，因英文版只推行了兩星期，不可能期望它能夠賺錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱黎說：「如果《蘋果日報》有英文版嘅話，就可以好直接同埋好快咁俾到一手資訊，去俾外國嘅枱底人睇到，咁佢哋可以作出更加有利黎智英政治理念嘅判斷。」惟黎指陳的證供不是真實，因「枱底人」不是他會使用的詞語，而且英文版是給所有人看的，而非僅僅給「枱底人」看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述黎說，英文版可以令《蘋果》由一個本地傳媒變成國際傳媒，「咁喺國際上面就更加有國際話語權，同埋會有更加多人關注。」惟黎稱自己不可能這樣說，因不可能在英文版推行短短兩星期內，將《蘋果》變成國際媒體。法官李運騰追問黎有否說過相關言論。黎表示當然不記得，但是如果他有說過的話，也只是期望或是抱負，多於談論事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認籲swhk在文宣線和國際線上繼續做-稱做法不負責任&quot;&gt;黎否認籲SWHK在文宣線和國際線上「繼續做」 稱做法不負責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，黎在會面時說：「國安法雷聲大、雨點小」。黎同意，這是他當時的想法。至於陳引述黎稱「會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注」，黎則反駁，說出這樣的言論是很荒謬，因他沒提及制裁，他亦一直叫員工小心行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，黎籲他叫 SWHK 其他人在文宣線和國際線上「繼續做」，以及要支持初選。惟黎重申，他從沒與SWHK有交雜，而且呼籲其他人繼續做的話是太不負責任。他亦否認叫陳或SWHK支持初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，黎問他為何不加入「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（簡稱 IPAC），「佢（黎）覺得 IPAC 好重要，一定要有呢啲國際支持，先會有用。」惟黎否認，並稱當時不知道IPAC，也不知道「攬炒團隊」，直至在庭上才首次知道這兩個組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於陳指稱黎說可以幫到年青人，「佢（黎）話佢已經同美國嗰邊傾緊」，黎亦否認。黎指會面歷時大約一小時，因為當時非常忙碌，這是他和陳最後一次見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎訊息指初選是奇蹟-惟庭上混淆區選&quot;&gt;黎訊息指初選是奇蹟 惟庭上混淆區選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，2020年7月12日初選之後，陳在通訊軟件Signal向黎說，「感謝你為初選所做的一切，這是香港歷史上重要的一頁（Hi Jimmy, thanks for everything on the primary election. It’s remarkable on our HK history.）。」黎回覆：「這是一個奇蹟！（It’s a miracle!）」陳回覆：「毋庸置疑！（No doubt!）」，並問：「你的案件今日順利嗎？（Is your case going well today?）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華曾指稱黎動用了大量人脈以及媒體資源去協助初選舉行，「我諗我係少數人知道當初初選一直以嚟構思嘅係黎智英。」但當辯方問黎為何會形容初選為「奇蹟」？黎指因為是「大勝（landslide victory）」。辯方問黎是否知道初選是關於什麼。黎稱知道，並重複稱當時「大勝」。法官李運騰指，現在說的是初選，而不是區議會選舉。黎才說，因為所有人都參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/resaO5b.png&quot; alt=&quot;iamge01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（28日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第98日審訊，黎智英第六日作供。同案被告、從犯證人陳梓華曾供稱，在2019年11月曾與黎智英會面，引述黎認為區議會選舉民主派大勝之後，「佢（黎）覺得嚟緊應該結合議會嘅力量、街頭嘅力量，同國際嘅力量，先可以延續呢個反修例運動嘅熱情，同埋推爆個政府，push it to the edge，去逼迫個政府去回應市民訴求。」黎智英今否認說過相關言論，因「國際力量」從不在自己的腦海裡，也並非自己會使用的言辭。他亦否認說過「推爆個政府」，強調：「這不是我會說的東西，這不是我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指控之一是黎向陳梓華下達指示，而陳再傳達指示予李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人參與國際游說。黎則表示，他當時相信陳是勇武人士的領袖，並信任陳有能力呼籲勇武派克制，惟一直也不知道陳梓華與國際線有關連。至於為何在 WhatsApp 傳送《香港人權與民主法案》的消息給陳，黎則稱純粹向陳提供資訊，沒有其他原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎傳送香港人權與民主法案給陳梓華-黎僅提供資訊&quot;&gt;黎傳送《香港人權與民主法案》給陳梓華 黎：僅提供資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方大律師關文渭的主問下，黎昨日回應另一名從犯證人陳梓華的證供，談及二人之間在2019年7月及11月的會面。今日辯方繼續圍繞陳梓華的證供提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2019年11月15日的訊息紀錄，黎傳送香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council）的 Twitter 截圖給陳，當中提及《香港人權與民主法案》。黎亦在訊息表示，美國議會即將表決，沒有理由不通過法案，形容這是一個非常棒的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華當時供稱，黎之所以傳送以上訊息給他，是因為黎「想證明國際嘅力量係好重要，同埋美國並沒有離棄或者係唔理香港發生緊咩事」。惟黎今在庭上則稱，相信當時純粹向陳提供資訊，沒有其他原因，又稱自己平時向很多人傳送資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指陳梓華熟悉勇武派內部板塊&quot;&gt;黎指陳梓華熟悉勇武派內部板塊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示2019年11月16日的訊息，黎智英向陳轉發一則中大校友通訊，當中提及「各類車的司機已經是黑衣人，不是中大職員」、「校內情況惡劣，建築物被破壞，飯堂關門，住在宿舍的師生缺糧」等。黎問陳：「Wetland (Wayland)，你知道這些黑衣人到底是謝（誰）人嗎？謝謝。」陳回覆：「不同組別人士，由屠龍及 Black Boc 等隊伍為首，形成的一幫沒有紀律人士」、「他們希望霸佔中大作據點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年11月17日，陳向黎傳送訊息，叫黎特別留意數隊勇武小隊，包括「屠龍、中移動、閃燈、蜘蛛、V小隊、毒蛇、粉紅、Pink Team」，指他們帶領著不能接受的暴力升級，而《蘋果》曾訪問其中三隊，以及其中一隊的領袖「Max」，他正在理大衝突中領導防守。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何傳送有關中大的訊息給陳，黎則稱，當時留意到那些「神秘」的年輕人，不肯定陳是否認識他們，所以向他提問。黎又表示，只聽聞過「屠龍」，而其他小隊的名字則未聽過，從陳的訊息可見他熟悉勇武人士的內部板塊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2019年11月19日的訊息，黎與陳討論警方團封理大事件是否「警方的陰謀」、「這局面其實很易設計」、「理工在城市，警方封了路就無法逃脫」，又指警方「把我最精銳的人一網打盡，希望昨天逃出來的都是勇武精銳份子」。二人亦討論警方部署是否屬「圍點打援」。黎確認訊息內容，並指陳清楚事態發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎相信陳梓華是勇武派領袖有能力平息暴力&quot;&gt;黎：相信陳梓華是勇武派領袖、有能力平息暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著展示2020年11月20日的訊息，黎告知陳，美國參議院一致通過支持香港示威者的措施（Senate Unanimously Approves Measures Backing Hong Kong Protesters）；陳當時回覆已經得悉相關消息，希望該措施能向政府施壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，當時尚未知道措施的內容，只知道是支援香港示威者的措施，並與制裁沒有關係。他又稱當當時沒有想過制裁的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，2019年區選之前，陳向黎提及「聽說小樺被捕了」，又稱：「我已經呼籲大家24日前別生事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上表示，當時相信陳有能力叫示威者不要生事，因為他相信陳是勇武人士的領袖，而且他信任陳，所以才會託陳呼籲勇武派克制。昨日黎供稱，當李柱銘介紹陳時，形容陳為「勇武派之中的保守派」。黎稱直至2019年11月，他仍然相信陳能夠有效地平息街頭暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認提倡區選後結合國際力量否認曾說推爆個政府&quot;&gt;黎否認提倡區選後結合國際力量、否認曾說「推爆個政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華曾供稱，他在2019年11月27日，獲安排在黎智英的座駕上會面，該座駕停泊在法院對面。陳稱他向黎表示聯絡不到勇武派領袖，惟黎稱不緊要，因他「大致掌握勇武派嘅資料同動向」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上解釋，相信他是從張崑陽及其朋友得到勇武派的資訊，因曾經與他們吃飯，理解張是就讀港大的學生領袖，而其朋友是參與前線示威的大學生。陳指稱黎對張的評價好高。黎確認，因閱讀過張的文章，認為寫得很好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱黎談及區議會選舉大勝，「佢（黎）覺得嚟緊應該結合議會嘅力量、街頭嘅力量，同國際嘅力量，先可以延續呢個反修例運動嘅熱情，同埋推爆個政府，push it to the edge，去逼迫個政府去回應市民訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上稱，他有可能談及過區議會大勝和延續運動的熱情，因為當年區選結果真的很好。至於結合議會力量、街頭力量和國際力量，黎指自己可能講過議會力量和街頭力量，但是否認講過國際力量，因他從沒想過國際線的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後補充，他當時不認為陳梓華與國際線有任何關係，而且「國際線」並不是他會使用的措辭。辯方問，若然黎認為陳與國際線無關，為何會傳送 HKDC 的資訊給陳。黎則稱因為陳是示威者的領袖，又稱一直也不知道陳與國際線有關連。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「推爆個政府」，黎亦否認說過：「這不是我會說的東西。」辯方問黎有否說過類似的說話？黎同樣否認：「這不是我會說的東西，這不是我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華亦稱在車上與黎討論過眾籌事宜，黎則否認：「我從不會談論到眾籌，這是他們的事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎只是希望勇武派能在自己的社群內建立領袖&quot;&gt;黎：只是希望勇武派能在自己的社群內建立領袖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又供稱，黎想建立一個結合議會力量、街頭力量和國際力量的領袖團隊。黎則肯定自己從沒有這樣說過，因國際線從不在他的腦海中，而且他的想法只是希望勇武派能在自己的社群內建立領袖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又質疑，在車上15分鐘的會面，陳梓華好像把它說成是一段很長的對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否認識本土派陣營中任何人。黎表示，本土派並非他會想接觸的人士，因他一直以來都反對港獨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認在會面中向陳談及請求外國實施制裁、封鎖和敵對行動，因為這些都是脫離會面主題的話題。而且他與陳沒有達成任何可行動的協議，因他認為沒有需要，他一直以來只是希望陳能平息前線的暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（28日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第98日審訊，黎智英第六日作供。他稱2019年12月的時候仍強烈希望勇武派可以建立領袖團隊，以平息街頭暴力，於是透過同案被告陳梓華來聯絡「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，因理解劉有很大影響力，追隨者包括勇武派。2020年1月，黎在台北陽明山別墅首次與劉見面，陳早前供稱黎在會上表示想培養劉做政治明星，又提及「支爆」；黎則反駁指說法荒謬可笑，質疑陳編造故事，又指「支爆」是由劉祖廸首先提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳曾指稱，黎在會議上提及這一代人未必可以實現「推翻中共」。黎今在庭上反問：「香港人可以推翻中共政府？⋯⋯我沒有瘋癲到思考這些瘋狂的事情。」黎又指若然希望透過制裁或封鎖措施來推翻中共政府，是「比荒謬更荒謬」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指攬炒巴在年輕人之中影響力很大-追隨者包括勇武人士&quot;&gt;黎指「攬炒巴」在年輕人之中影響力很大 追隨者包括勇武人士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭就黎智英與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸的相識經過提問。2019年12月4日的訊息紀錄顯示，另一被告陳梓華向黎提及一名叫「攬炒」的人。黎則表示當時未曾閱讀「攬炒」寫的文章、未曾聽過他說話，但知道「攬炒」對陳的影響很大。黎亦相信自己當時未聽過「攬炒團隊」，因他沒有留意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，他與黎於2019年11月在座駕見面之後，二人曾在電話通話，陳指黎留意到「攬炒團隊發展得好好」，並要求陳聯絡「喺國際線上面、文宣線上面比較出名嘅『攬炒巴』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，「攬炒巴」的話題為何開始出現。黎表示，他當時強烈希望勇武派能建立領袖團隊，認為「攬炒團隊」有能力協助達成。他又稱，透過傳媒首次得悉「攬炒巴」這個人，而陳亦指「攬炒巴」有號召力。惟他否認說過「喺國際線上面、文宣線上面比較出名嘅『攬炒巴』」，因他從沒想過和談及「國際線」和「文宣線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示不知道「攬炒巴」在運動中的角色，但是知道他在年輕人之中影響力很大，有很多追隨者，包括勇武人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;介紹羅傑斯給陳梓華-黎稱純粹想陳會見值得見面的人&quot;&gt;介紹羅傑斯給陳梓華 黎稱純粹想陳會見值得見面的人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2019年12月20日，身在英國的陳在訊息中問黎，在英國可以會見什麼人；黎則建議陳會見「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和英國議員 Lord David Alton，並稱可以幫陳安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NgX7TSk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ Lord David Alton（左）、Benedict Rogers（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，黎「想我識多啲人，方便我將來參加國際游說嘅工作」。惟黎今反駁，從來沒有想過國際游說的事宜，介紹羅傑斯純粹想陳會見一些值得見面的人，因羅傑斯為香港做了很多事。而 Lord Alton 處理BNO政策，也是為香港做事，與羅傑斯關係密切，二人均想與年輕人溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎認為與二人會面對陳有好處，黎稱當時知道可以透過陳來聯絡「攬炒巴」，以協助平息街頭暴力，又指如果請求陳梓華平息暴力，有需要協助他，讓他知道得更加多，因此安排他會見羅傑斯和 Lord Alton ，對香港和對陳個人而言均有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認羅傑斯郭明瀚等人為其代理人&quot;&gt;黎否認羅傑斯、郭明瀚等人為其代理人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向黎展示控方開案陳詞，當中指羅傑斯、英國駐港澳前總領事郭明瀚（Jim Cunningham）和 Mark Simon 是黎的「代理人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認羅傑斯和郭明瀚是他的代理人。至於 Mark Simon，黎同意他是其助手，也是其代理人。惟黎不認為身為共和黨黨員的 Mark Simon 是美國政府或共和黨的代理人，因他只處理黎的私人事務，二人的交流裡從未牽涉共和黨的事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，會見時任美國副總統彭斯和時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧，均由美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 安排，因黎聘請了他作為顧問，安排會見美國議員和官員等，而非由 Mark Simon 安排。黎亦否認 Christian Whiton 是其代理人，並指他亦非美國政府的代理人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎當時認為攬炒巴身份敏感&quot;&gt;黎：當時認為攬炒巴身份敏感&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，他在2019年12月31日與黎智英再度會面。黎表示，因陳赴英國會見劉祖廸，他希望知道二人的會面情況，所以安排是次見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭指，二人的訊息僅稱呼劉祖廸為「guest」，問原因為何。黎相信，陳當時希望盡量保密，因他們之間均認為劉祖廸是一個身份敏感的人，因理解他是勇武派的領袖。黎又指當時「攬炒巴」的真實身份尚未公開，甚至在台北陽明山會面時，劉也拒絕回答他的姓名。黎在後來才知道「攬炒巴」姓名是劉祖廸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就12月31日的會面內容，陳梓華供稱「當時呢國際線上係好亂嘅，有唔同嘅聲音」，而黎認為年青人「喺度搶緊個話語權」。不過黎今反駁，他從沒有與陳談論任何有關國際線的事情，而且「話語權」並非他會使用的字詞，「我甚至不知道這個字詞的完整意思，這是他（陳）的言詞。」黎並否認在會面中提及制裁、封鎖、敵對行動和「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎理解攬炒有如殉道&quot;&gt;黎：理解「攬炒」有如「殉道」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，在2019年12月的時候，對「攬炒」有什麼理解。黎表示，「攬炒」就好像「殉道（martyrdom）」般，透過犧牲自己來破壞敵方，就如損害雙方般。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英在2020年1月8日，即在台北陽明山別墅會面之前，向陳梓華傳送一篇裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）刊登於《蘋果日報》網站的文章，當中對「無領袖運動」提出數項關注。陳回覆稱他看過文章，認為可以幫助到他說服那些「頑固的領袖」；黎亦指文章值得閱讀，而「攬炒巴」劉祖廸也應該看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱，傳送文章給陳純粹是因認為文章很好，能夠幫助到陳。辯方問黎，為何提議劉祖廸應該閱讀該文章。黎則稱，認為文章的觀點很好、有說服力，而且正是他當時準備向劉祖廸說的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認推薦裴倫德的文章是因為文中談及國際游說，並重申會見劉的目的只是希望他能夠協助成立勇武派的領袖團隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認陽明山別墅會議上要求攬炒巴做任何事&quot;&gt;黎否認陽明山別墅會議上要求攬炒巴做任何事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月11日，黎智英在台灣陽明山的別墅舉行飯局。黎起初邀請台灣已故民運人士施明德出席，惟後來施臨時表示不能出席。黎稱施是著名的革命人士，對他認識很深。由於黎認為施是有見地的人（a wiseman），相信他能夠說一些對陳有啟發的東西，所以安排施與陳見面。辯方問，施有否參與國際游說或國際前線？黎說沒有，因施已年紀老邁，而且已退出政壇（out of the picture）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱在晚飯之前，他與陳梓華、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和一名女子見面及交談。黎稱無法記起當時的討論內容，但是他主要談及理大一役之後，勇武派有需要組成領袖團隊，以減少暴力。至於劉祖廸，黎指他發言不多，予人印象他願意接受建議，是一個少言和謹慎的人，不會說多過自己所需說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否在會議上要求劉做任何事。黎稱沒有，並指連他問劉叫什麼名字，劉也不肯回答，更何況叫他做事。他亦沒有問劉來自哪裡，因他當時已經知道劉來自倫敦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，他有可能談及區選和中國監控人民，但是沒有談及國際游說和眾籌，因脫離了討論的主題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱在庭上才首次得悉攬炒團隊&quot;&gt;黎稱在庭上才首次得悉「攬炒團隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前陳梓華供稱，他在會面初頭簡介劉祖廸的過往工作，包括「中英聯合聲明登報團隊」、「攬炒團隊」、組織外國議員到香港作區選監選團等。惟黎庭上否認會上有相關對話，也沒有聽聞過「中英聯合聲明登報團隊」和「攬炒團隊」等，在庭上才首次得悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，黎在會議上問劉，為何劉的眾籌可以達到如此龐大規模。黎今在庭上反駁，他並不知道劉有份眾籌，就算自己有提及眾籌，也只是概括地作出評論、稱讚眾籌做得好。惟他否認帶起眾籌的話題，也沒有提及過渡性貸款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他曾提及李宇軒（Andy Li）在2019年12月到訪美國。惟黎否認在會上聽過李的名字，直至在庭上才知道這個人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎想培養攬炒巴做政治明星-黎反駁荒謬可笑&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎想培養攬炒巴做政治明星 黎反駁：荒謬可笑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦指稱黎在會上表示想培養劉做政治明星，並稱可以資助他一萬磅生活費。黎今表示說法荒謬可笑（farcical），因為人性神秘莫測，難以改變一個人的性格，若然有人說要培養某個人成為政治明星的話是荒謬的，「（那個人）不是無知，就是高傲自大，這是不可能的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否認為不能夠培養劉成為政治明星。黎則表示，認為陳梓華在憶述事件期間編造故事，因要培養劉做政治明星的說法是愚蠢和荒謬的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，黎在會上指：「應該識多啲枱底人，而唔係一直喺度識啲枱面人，例如 Rick Scott、Ted Cruz、Tod Young，呢啲係老泛民本身就已經有 connection。」黎今否認，並重申會議中沒有談及任何有關國際游說的事宜。黎亦否認在會面中提及經濟封鎖、制裁等話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，黎舉例指前政務司司長陳方安生和前美國眾議院議長佩洛西，在彼此年輕的時候便開始認識，這些長遠的關係對於國際游說便很有用。黎今表示不知道二人互相認識，他亦沒有提及二人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱支爆乃攬炒巴首先提出&quot;&gt;黎稱「支爆」乃攬炒巴首先提出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華曾供稱，黎在會上提及長遠而言應該爭取國際認同，讓外國實施禁運、制裁及向政府施壓，然後香港要團結不同板塊，再結合民間力量，才能達至「支爆」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上反稱，「支爆」是由劉祖廸首先提出。他稱在那時才首次聽聞這個字詞，他即場問劉什麼是「支爆」，劉解釋指「中國的內爆」。黎相信劉對中國有很多思考，並且嘗試預計將來會發生的事。黎稱，他當時回應劉，指中國花費大量金錢在監視和控制人民，所以支出比其他國家更多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華稱，黎認為應團結議會、海外組織、街頭力量、國際線及商人。對此，黎反駁指：「我從沒有這樣的想法，這是他（陳）自己的想法，然後把說話塞進我的口。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳曾引述黎向劉說：「『國際游說唔係好似你哋咁樣做。』」惟黎反駁指，當時他並不知道劉等人參與國際游說，不可能說過相關言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指冀透過制裁或封鎖來推翻中共政府的想法比荒謬更荒謬&quot;&gt;黎指冀透過制裁或封鎖來推翻中共政府的想法「比荒謬更荒謬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳曾引述黎在會上說，這一代人未必可以實現到推翻中共，「佢希望以劉祖廸牽頭嘅攬炒團隊，同呢班年青人，可以接棒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上反問：「香港人可以推翻中共政府？」，接著說：「我沒有瘋癲到思考這些瘋狂的事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，會議上有否談論到推翻中共的方法。黎僅指，推翻中共政府的想法，是完全不切實際的（out of dimension of any discussions），又指若然希望透過制裁或封鎖措施來推翻中共政府，「我認為是比荒謬更荒謬。（“I think it’s more than ridiculous.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎：若市民和平地示威、站於道德高地 便可獲國際社會同情和支持 乃「最強大的游說」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎認為，當香港人和平地示威，得到國際社會的支持，便能夠拯救到香港，避免受到中國侵害自由。被問到國際社會可以做到什麼，黎指當國際支持是壓倒性的，中國作決定時便必須予以考慮。他補充，「支持」是概括性的概念，並不是指特定行動，可以是國際壓力、言論或行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰和李素蘭先後追問，若如黎較早前所供稱，從沒想過國際游說的事宜，又如何得到國際的支持呢？黎認為，如果市民能和平地示威、站於道德高地，便可以得到國際社會的同情，又指國際社會與香港人價值觀一致，如果香港人追求相關價值的話，國際社會會認為香港人也是在替他們追求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，當一般人聽到「國際游說」時，會聯想到涉及「說服」。黎則回應，如果香港人站在道德高地上示威，並獲得國際社會的支持的話，「我認為這是我們最強大的游說。」黎續指，如果只是與外國議員和官員對話，而欠缺廣大市民站在一起，也是沒有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，當黎會見時任美國副總統彭斯和時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧的時候，是否正在屬於「國際游說」？黎回答可以算是（kind of），去請求他們為香港發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is becoming an ever-more prominent actor in the global maritime commons, emerging as a key player in sectors such as global shipping. China is also gradually expanding its military footprint outside its region and developing the capacity for power projection at reach. For policymakers in the Euro-Atlantic, this raises the prospect of a Chinese military presence in the region and its environs (such as the South Atlantic and the Arctic). This paper seeks to outline the likely scope of a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) putative presence in and around the Euro-Atlantic in the next 15 years and the nature of the foreign policy it will support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While there is some rationale for a PLAN presence in the Euro-Atlantic and its environs, the challenges of maintaining an extra-regional military presence at any scale will limit its scope. China’s blue-water capabilities are still nascent and even after likely growth, resourcing either a rotational or permanent deployment of PLAN capabilities will impose challenging force structure trade-offs on a navy that already faces the daunting task of competing in both the Pacific and Indian oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite this, the bottlenecks in key Chinese supply chains that begin in the Atlantic may provide incentives for a future Chinese leader to decide that a military presence at scale is warranted – such a choice will probably not be made in the medium term (10–15 years). Much of China’s military activity, including defence engagement, is likely to be Phase 0 shaping to set the conditions if such a shift is chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While China will represent a very limited military challenge in the region, it is likely to seek coercive options towards Europe. Beijing’s most likely foreign policy towards Europe would combine elements of coercion and engagement, since China needs the European market, but seeks a degree of leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China has several coercive options that leverage maritime power. Its central role in port infrastructure and support to Russia’s economy and military are two options that it might leverage. While many of these options either do not involve the PLAN, or involve it primarily as a supporting element, they can have second-order ramifications for European navies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although a future PLAN presence should not be a basis for strategic distraction from the core tasks of Europe’s navies in terms of deterring Russia, its shaping activities in the region should be monitored and where possible constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, NATO’s then Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg voiced concerns that although “there’s no way that NATO will move into the South China Sea … we have to address the fact that China is coming closer to us, investing heavily in infrastructure”. The prospect of China moving into the Euro-Atlantic area poses new questions for the UK and its partners in the region. Given that China has not yet emerged as a major defence and security actor in the Atlantic (although it wields considerable economic influence), policymakers and ministries of defence will benefit from an understanding of the potential scope of China’s regional ambitions, and their ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore China’s likely approach to the Euro-Atlantic, this paper’s analysis is based on some assumptions about the principles driving China’s foreign policy. These are derived from public statements and published scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of China’s engagement in the Euro-Atlantic is apparent more from its conflicting economic imperatives than its modest military presence. The capacity of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) for sustained power projection remains limited. However, China has strong incentives to maintain stable relations with states whose markets partly sustain its investment-led, export-dependent economy. There are also reasons for China to pursue coercive leverage over European states that have, to some extent, cooperated with US efforts to economically contain China (most notably through exercising control over key technologies, such as semiconductors). An assessment of how Beijing might balance these conflicting imperatives and the emerging military implications of its approach will help European leaders avoid either complacency or overreaction. The Royal Navy Strategic Studies Centre and the Centre for Strategic Studies of the French Navy (CESM) have supported this project, conducted by RUSI and the Council on Geostrategy. The project examines how China may evolve as a power in the Euro-Atlantic. The research for this paper, conducted in July 2024, involved a review of existing literature on China’s capabilities and wider geostrategic imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several trajectories that China’s foreign policy in the Euro-Atlantic may take, each of which corresponds to a different set of naval priorities. It might opt for an increasingly coercive approach, aimed at fixing US and European assets in the region and thus giving it more of a free hand in the Indo-Pacific. This approach has been advocated by members of China’s military and analytical communities. It might entail the deployment of forces in the Atlantic at a scale sufficient to occupy the attention of a meaningful number of US forces and to give European states pause on their commitments to the Indo-Pacific. More explicit support to Russia than has been offered by China thus far might also constitute a coercive approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum is the view, espoused by others in China, that Europe’s consumer economies represent “the endpoints” for many of the infrastructure projects that form part of the Belt and Road Initiative – a large number of which would serve the primary role of linking Chinese producers with European markets (since few other markets in Eurasia are of a comparable scale). While strategic engagement in the Euro-Atlantic is part of this view of China’s priorities, the main focus is not to alienate European states. To do so would drive them to coordinate with the US more closely, which incentivises non-military forms of regional engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not mutually exclusive options, as coercion and engagement can form complementary strands of a state’s foreign policy. However, a nakedly coercive foreign policy makes engagement more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper contends that dissuasion is the foreign policy that Beijing is most likely to embark on in the Atlantic. China needs the markets of Europe, given its own structural export surpluses, which will prove difficult to export elsewhere. However, China’s latent capacity for coercion can serve as a useful means of dissuading policies that directly impact China’s interests in its immediate periphery. It is thus likely that China’s foreign policy in the Euro-Atlantic will attempt to maintain a constructive relationship with Europe (eschewing some aggressive foreign policy tools) while attempting to ensure that the principles on which the relationship rest are amenable to Beijing’s interests, particularly with respect to European policies in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The direct military ramifications of a strategy of dissuasion are likely to be limited in the short to medium term. While there are some reasons for China to seek a military presence in the vicinity of the Euro-Atlantic area (for example, in the Arctic and South Atlantic), there are considerable practical limitations, which are likely to prove enduring. China is likely to engage in what Western military parlance would term “Phase 0 shaping activities” in the South Atlantic and potentially also the Arctic. Phase 0 activities would be designed to cultivate regional influence, habituate the PLAN to longer deployments, and set the conditions for a more substantial presence in the longer term. Naval presence and activities, such as joint exercises with Russia, might also be used as a means of signalling to Europe China’s capacity to indirectly play a more significant security role in the Euro-Atlantic. For example, China might provide more explicit military and economic support to Russia as one way of seeking to reinforce a strategy of dissuasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main conclusion of the paper is that for Europe’s navies, the presence of the PLAN in the Atlantic is a relatively distant and low-probability concern, but that growing Chinese interests in the region will lead to an increase in activity, which should at this stage be monitored and matched as an economy-of-force effort. In the long term, China may become increasingly dependent on sea lines of communication (SLOCs) in the South Atlantic and may have the capacity to commit significant resources to their protection. Similarly, its footprint in the Arctic might grow, for reasons that are discussed in the paper. While it is not likely that China’s presence will materialise until well beyond the next decade, it is a contingency to plan for, and the shaping activity that might enable this eventual development should be monitored. In the period most relevant to national defence reviews, the most significant consideration from a security standpoint is the Sino-Russian relationship in the High North and beyond, which might have more direct military ramifications in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has three chapters. Chapter I describes the underlying assumptions about China’s foreign policy drivers on which the assessment of its military engagement with the Euro-Atlantic is based. Chapter II provides further detail on Beijing’s strategic imperatives in the Euro-Atlantic that have a plausible maritime dimension. Chapter III describes the employment and potential limitations of China’s naval power in the Euro-Atlantic. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of a Chinese presence in the Euro-Atlantic for European navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-assumptions-about-drivers-for-chinas-foreign-policy&quot;&gt;I. Assumptions About Drivers for China’s Foreign Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessments in this paper are based on a number of underlying assumptions for the next decade. The first is that the US will increasingly prioritise strategic competition with China. This will involve a rebalancing of US military capabilities towards the Indo-Pacific, potentially leaving gaps in the European security architecture. The 2022 Indo-Pacific Strategy released by President Joe Biden’s administration, for example, explicitly states an intention to “renew our focus on innovation to ensure the U.S. military can operate in rapidly evolving threat environments” in the Indo-Pacific region. It is likely that the US Indo-Pacific Command, which already absorbs 60% of critical capabilities, such as nuclear attack submarines, will see its allocation of naval assets grow. One outcome of this refocusing is that, much like the British and German fleets before the First World War, the US Navy and the PLAN might fix much of the other’s naval power in static opposition within a single region, ironically limiting the extra-regional footprints of both global aspirants. Both navies may seek to maintain an extra-regional presence to secure lines of communication and, in the case of China, to potentially fix US resources elsewhere. However, the very fragility of the regional balance of power will limit each navy’s slack capacity for deployment elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second assumption is that, to the greatest extent possible, China will remain committed to securing its supply chains and maintaining market access. Beijing’s economic plan hinges on a delicate balancing act: constructing a trade framework that supports regime security and self-sufficiency while fostering in other countries greater economic dependence on it. China’s trajectory of economic growth is heavily reliant on expanding its share of global manufacturing, a strategy which necessitates sustained increases in both production capacity and global market penetration. Beijing recognises the vulnerability of its economic model to external disruptions and will continue to pursue strategies to mitigate these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third assumption is that China’s efforts to reduce its dependence on external markets and technology through initiatives such as the “dual circulation” economy and “Made in China 2025” are unlikely to fully materialise by 2032. However, if this changes, it will affect the likelihood of a coercive foreign policy in the Euro-Atlantic by setting the economic incentive structures of China and European states at odds. Although these initiatives are aimed at mitigating reliance on foreign technologies and markets, China remains deeply integrated in the international systems from which it seeks to partially detach, and its growing role in some sectors (such as electric vehicles and solar panels) will also create new dependencies on suppliers in regions such as West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth assumption is that Beijing will be heavily influenced by status concerns as well as security interests. The two may significantly overlap since global acceptance of China as a rule-setter in key regions will aid its economic and security interests. As China continues to rise on the global stage, Beijing will be increasingly motivated by the desire to be recognised as a great power and to shape international norms and institutions in the image of the values and interests of the Communist Party of China (CCP). Evidence for this desire to be a rule-setter rather than a rule-follower is apparent in initiatives such as the Global Development Initiative (2021), the Global Security Initiative (2022) and the Global Civilisation Initiative (2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the instruments that China will apply to deliver this engagement are non-military, although a limited military presence can serve several aims for China. These include enabling certain forms of engagement (such as coordination on non-traditional security threats) and supporting China’s scientific establishment, as well as the efforts of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to generate maritime domain awareness and setting the conditions for a more ambitious military posture, should political and military circumstances require it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-chinas-strategic-interests-in-the-euro-atlantic&quot;&gt;II. China’s Strategic Interests in the Euro-Atlantic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has several major areas of strategic interest in the Euro-Atlantic and adjoining regions to which its position in the maritime domain may be relevant. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing SLOCs and access to critical resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining market access to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protecting Chinese overseas interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining the capacity to put pressure on the US and other Western states on “exterior lines”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;securing-sea-lines-of-communication&quot;&gt;Securing Sea Lines of Communication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While energy supplies that traverse the Indian Ocean have historically been an area of focus for Chinese strategists, a number of critical Chinese supply chains have bottlenecks in the Atlantic. For example, 98% of China’s cobalt is imported, with the majority from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Cobalt plays a vital role in several industrial processes, including oil refining. Similarly, much of China’s manganese, used in the production of steel and anodes for lithium-ion batteries, is procured from South Africa, Gabon and Ghana. This can have long-term military ramifications. Despite the fears of Chinese strategists, the prospect of a US blockade of the Strait of Malacca has always been remote: it would also have an impact on countries within the cordon (and the PLAN would inflict considerable attrition on any enforcing vessels). Many of China’s avenues to securing other key inputs, such as cobalt, are far more fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efforts of the US and its allies to control flows of key industrial and military inputs that must cross the South Atlantic in a conflict are, in theory, more militarily achievable. The US Navy could constrain flows of these inputs with a close blockade in more militarily permissive waters. Whether the US has an appetite to enforce such a cordon on distant neutral states is debatable, especially as this would also rob the US Navy of resources it would need in the Pacific. However, it would seem logical that a country that has spent decades treating the “Malacca dilemma” as a real concern should be equally worried about the prospects of such a blockade. It should perhaps not be surprising, therefore, that the PLAN is reportedly seeking bases capable of hosting its aircraft carriers in West African states such as Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and that it has conducted visible naval exercises with Russia and South Africa. Chinese military authors have posited that aircraft carriers have an important role in protecting SLOCs and a carrier strike group acting as a fleet in being need not be preponderant to significantly complicate SLOC interdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there are a number of alternative and arguably less risky methods of supply-chain derisking available to China, including diversification and stockpiling – the same approach China applies to oil. Moreover, in a conflict, the precedence taken by military production over civilian consumption and the ability of a sophisticated economy to engage in import substitution is typically a limiting factor on the immediate impact of a blockade. Short of imposing something analogous to the Navicert system on vessels leaving African ports, it is unclear how the US Navy could impose a blockade, since most shipping to China occurs on vessels that are not Chinese-flagged. It is entirely plausible that the assertions of the Chinese military community regarding the need for “far seas protection” reflect institutional beliefs and interests of the PLAN rather than China’s strategy. If this is the case, it might well be that these interests will not translate into a military presence adjacent to the Euro-Atlantic, with some questioning the evidence that China has indeed sought a base in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, however, a plausible rationale for a military presence does exist and China has reportedly already set up military infrastructure, such as telemetry stations in Kenya. If the naval protection of SLOCs becomes a core mission for China, this would place sizeable Chinese forces within the Atlantic. On balance, this paper argues that this is unlikely to occur until well beyond the next decade, but efforts to set the conditions for a Chinese naval presence in the Atlantic, should a future leader opt to create one, may be visible during the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintaining-market-access-to-europe&quot;&gt;Maintaining Market Access to Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market access to the consumption-led economies of Europe represents a second area of focus for China. The country has invested substantially in efforts to increase its connectivity across Eurasia through the Belt and Road Initiative, and the ability to move finished goods to European markets is likely to remain a significant driver of Chinese foreign policy, especially as its investment-led economic model will make it difficult to shift to a consumption-led economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic investments in port infrastructure in Europe, including Piraeus in Greece and Hamburg in Germany, as well as ports in countries such as Egypt, give Chinese companies a controlling share in a number of critical maritime nodes, with Chinese firms owning or having a stake in all 15 of the world’s busiest ports. Chinese firms are deploying sophisticated logistics management platforms such as LOGINK, which already has agreements with at least 24 ports, and security inspection equipment manufactured by Nuctech. These technologies provide unprecedented opportunity for covert gathering of intelligence about maritime traffic, trade flows, cargo data and even biometric information of individuals working at ports. In principle, there are sound commercial reasons for China’s port investments and they do not necessarily provide Beijing with control over operations. However, a central position in global transport networks can be employed as a coercive instrument. Port operators are bound by national laws and cannot easily refuse services on political grounds, but countries can exercise other forms of control over their companies and capital. Consider, for example, recent US restrictions on the ability of US nationals to work with Chinese companies in key sectors. Moreover, coercive activity can be presented as administrative procedure, as was the case during China’s 2010 rare earths embargo on Japan (under the aegis of production issues) and its embargo on Norwegian salmon after the latter hosted the dissident Liu Xiabo (under the aegis of health inspections, conducted repeatedly until the produce rotted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic entanglement, even if not designed explicitly for coercion, can create latent coercive tools – consider how networks such as SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications – the leading provider of secure financial messaging services) have been weaponised against Russia and Iran. The dominance of Chinese companies, such as engineering giant ZPMC, in providing critical port equipment such as ship-to-shore cranes, enhances Beijing’s potential influence over port operations. For navies, a major consideration is likely to be that, for many deployments, routine resupply of non-sensitive goods depends on suppliers operating through civilian ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protecting-chinese-overseas-interests&quot;&gt;Protecting Chinese Overseas Interests&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protection of China’s overseas interests, including the considerable number of Chinese nationals who work abroad, is also an increasingly important goal, the salience of which was illustrated by events such as the 2011 non-combatant evacuation operation for Chinese nationals in Libya carried out by the PLAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other overseas interests include exploration for resources in international waters, which falls under the purview of the State Oceanic Administration. In the past decade, Chinese authors have highlighted the fact that there was scope for China to increase the number of applications it made to the International Seabed Authority for mining rights in the Atlantic, with a specific focus on metallic sulphides in the South Atlantic. China has recently concluded its first deep-sea expedition in the Atlantic, in which the State Oceanic Administration’s research ship Shenyai Yihao (which can operate a range of submersibles) played a leading role. China has also conducted a number of scientific expeditions in the Atlantic in the past decade, with a particular focus on the South Atlantic. A number of Chinese scholars and analysts have also expressed interest in resource extraction in areas such as the Arctic, which, although not part of the Euro-Atlantic, have a symbiotic relationship with it, particularly since several NATO members are Arctic states. Activity in the Arctic can serve a range of aims, including setting the conditions for access to seabed resources in international waters and generating usable data to support navigation that Chinese entities, including the PLA, can leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has committed significant resources to scientific activity in the Arctic, coordinated through the State Oceanic Administration, but which the PLA supports with personnel. The PLA is also represented on China’s Polar advisory committee. To date, China has completed 13 scientific expeditions to the region, employing platforms such as the polar icebreaker Xuelong-2, and its share of research outputs related to the region is growing rapidly. In addition, China has sought to increase its regional access through investments in infrastructure, including an abortive bid by China Communications Construction Company to construct airports in Greenland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, however, China has worked primarily (but not exclusively) through Russia, an approach that dovetails with Russia’s own aspirations to become a primary goods provider in the Indo-Pacific. For example, in 2021 Russia articulated plans to fill gaps in the Chinese coal sector left by China’s decision to embargo Australian coal. Much of Russia’s coal mining occurs in the Arctic and the country maintains coal mines in geopolitically sensitive Svalbard, Norway. Similarly, since 2014, Russia has relied on China for financial support to underpin its efforts to tap its liquefied natural gas (LNG) reserves in the Arctic and, in February 2021, Novatek (Russia’s second-largest gas producer) and China’s investment company Shenergy Group signed a deal to ship several million tonnes of LNG from Russia’s now-sanctioned Arctic LNG-2 project to the Yamal peninsula in northwest Siberia for onward transit to China. Despite this, China’s embrace of Russian hydrocarbons remains lukewarm. Although coal exports from Russia have risen, nearby Indonesia has been the primary beneficiary of China’s frictions with Australia, while Arctic LNG-2 has had to suspend operations due to a paucity of tankers following Western sanctions. Moreover, China’s foreign policy aspirations to be regarded as a “near Arctic” state have roused suspicions in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintaining-pressure-on-western-states-exterior-lines&quot;&gt;Maintaining Pressure on Western States’ Exterior Lines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of expanding strategic space on exterior lines is a common feature of Chinese analytical discourse. China is, as mentioned, likely to seek latent coercive levers to apply to Europe, if only to shape European behaviour regarding its own interests in Asia. China’s foreign policy, however, beyond its immediate environs, has thus far largely (but not exclusively) eschewed military coercion. While not averse to flexing the state’s economic muscle (for example when then Premier Wen Jiabao cancelled trade talks with France in 2007 after the latter hosted the Dalai Lama, or cutting off imports from Lithuania in 2021 over the latter’s decision to open a Taiwan Representative Office), China has by and large limited its coercive statecraft to economics and has been judicious in its use of non-military coercive tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Chinese analysts suggest that maritime presence in the Atlantic should be part of a strategy of operating on exterior lines and a means of relieving pressure in East Asia, although there is a lack of consensus to some degree on whether such a strategy should be militarised. Some advocate a cautious approach, emphasising geo-economics and investments in port infrastructure in which the PLAN should focus on multilateral engagement and cooperation with European states on non-traditional security threats such as piracy – partly as a means of countering the narrative that it represents a threat. Other Chinese analysts, such as Hu Bo of Beijing University, have called for a force of two to three carrier strike groups to be deployed beyond East Asia to “pin down” US assets that might be deployed to the region. Similarly, China’s premier doctrinal publication, The Science of Military Strategy, calls for aircraft carriers to be deployed to protect Chinese SLOCs. By and large, discussions of operating on exterior lines tend to focus on the Indian Ocean and Central Pacific. However, and as discussed in subsequent sections of this paper, the practicalities of operating in the Atlantic will limit possibilities for the PLAN over the next decade. Advocates of a larger presence in the Atlantic do consider the prospect of a more prominent role for Chinese “escort forces” in the region in the future but appear to recognise that the PLAN’s presence will be limited for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of operating on exterior lines may also be relevant to China’s nuclear deterrent. While China’s ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) would struggle to break out of the First Island Chain in a crisis, the Arctic in theory offers a safe bastion and an energy efficient route for submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) such as the JL-3 (successor to China’s current SLBM) to reach the US, leading the Pentagon to raise the prospect of Chinese submarines operating in the Arctic. However, the practicalities of operating in the Arctic make this a highly questionable means of increasing the survivability of China’s second-strike capabilities, for reasons which are explored in greater depth in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the PLAN’s presence in both the Euro-Atlantic and its immediate peripheries (the Arctic and South Atlantic) is for the next decade likely to be relatively modest, but the deployment of such a limited presence to set the conditions for a more significant presence beyond the next decade should not be overlooked. Moreover, while China may not have a direct regional security presence, it can have an indirect impact on the security environment in the Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s (SACEUR) Area of Responsibility in ways that bear considering, primarily through its relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-chinas-blue-water-navy-as-a-foreign-policy-instrument&quot;&gt;III. China’s Blue-Water Navy as a Foreign Policy Instrument&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past three decades have seen China grow as a maritime power, moving from a regional power, built for contingencies related to Taiwan and the South China Sea, into a more expeditionary force. A continued build-up of maritime capability meant that, by 2022, the PLAN had more hulls than the US Navy. Nonetheless, the US Navy remains the largest in terms of gross tonnage, while the PLAN is still in the process of moving from a regional force with a large number of smaller vessels towards a blue-water navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ambition has been manifested in projects such as the Type 055 cruiser (equipped with a higher vertical launch system capacity than the US Navy’s Ticonderoga-class, since its individual cells are larger), and the Type 076 landing helicopter assault (LHA) carrier, which may be equipped with CATOBAR (catapult launchers). Similarly, the People’s Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps (PLANMC) has grown five-fold in the past decade, with an explicitly stated focus on expeditionary missions. Notably, contingencies involving Taiwan remain the preserve of the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force (PLAGF), which controls the six heavy amphibious brigades in the Eastern Theatre Command and retained this despite the growth of the PLANMC. Moreover, since 2015 the PLA has added “far seas protection” to the list of the PLAN’s missions. It seems clear, then, that China desires the capacity to project power beyond its environs, but the answers to the questions of where, to what end and to what extent are less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that despite its substantial growth, the PLAN still has relatively limited (although rapidly growing) blue-water capabilities. For example, the force fields fewer major surface combatants (vessels of destroyer size or larger) than the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) – the PLAN operates 31 destroyers and cruisers to the JMSDF’s 36 destroyers. The PLAN also fields four Type 075 landing helicopter docks (LHDs) in support of its marine corps. It is likely that the PLAN will also grow rapidly, but it will have significant regional commitments even within the First Island Chain, given the scale of the area the chain encompasses. For example, the Spratly Islands are 1,200 kilometres from China’s nearest land-based airfields on Hainan Island off China’s south coast. Moreover, most contemporary Chinese discussions of PLAN activity beyond the First Island Chain tend to focus on the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where establishing a militarily significant naval presence will prove highly resource intensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;practical-limitations-of-chinas-naval-power&quot;&gt;Practical Limitations of China’s Naval Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, the fact that most of the several critical materials on which China relies, including cobalt and magnesium, come from a limited number of West and South African providers, including the DRC, Gabon and South Africa, provides a cogent rationale for a Chinese presence in the Atlantic, which would be entirely consistent with the logic of far-seas protection. That Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are states that China has reportedly approached to secure a facility large enough to house an aircraft carrier would also be consistent with the logic of SLOC protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there would be several impediments to the emergence of a standing PLAN presence in the Atlantic. The most obvious is the fact that in the Atlantic the PLAN would be operating at considerable distances from the wellsprings of Chinese power and in an area where the US and its allies militarily dominate – a fact acknowledged by most Chinese strategists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be argued (as have analysts such as Bo) that China can secure its major aims at reach by creating a distant fleet in being large enough to make the US enforcement of a blockade unfeasibly costly (especially if the US were also confronting China in East Asia). Indeed, it is precisely the difficulty of managing both a distant blockade and events in the First Island Chain (which, as several studies have noted, is not viable) that would, in theory, incentivise the US to focus on bottlenecks. Such bottlenecks include China’s access to materials that come from a small number of states where a close blockade could be more readily enforced given the absence of a Chinese naval or anti-access threat beyond the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with this reasoning, as discussed, is that the immediate demands of balancing commitments within China’s region and outside it are considerations for China as well. Despite its rapid recent growth, the PLAN has a limited blue-water fleet (it fields just eight Type 055 cruisers, for example). This will change in due course, but even a much larger PLAN fielding the six aircraft carriers that China aspires to have by 2035 will be bound by the logic of force structuring. Factors such as vessel maintenance cycles and workup periods impact all navies, and experience suggests that perhaps half of the PLAN’s notional future carrier fleet will be at sea at any given time. The forward deployment of a carrier battlegroup, particularly one that includes the nine escort cruisers, frigates and destroyers discussed by Chinese analysts, would imply that China would have to make considerable sacrifices to its force availability in East Asia. Similarly, China’s fleet of Type 075 and Type 076 LHDs and LHAs, although growing in number, is still small relative to the scale of some of the tasks required by the PLAN in the First Island Chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms such as the Type 093 nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) could be used as an alternative to surface vessels for deployments beyond the First Island Chain because they are both more self-sustaining and have limited prospects of escaping the First Island Chain in a conflict (and so have bounded utility in this theatre, where China’s diesel electric submarines are more useful). However the Type 093 is relatively noisy, which, it has been suggested, appears to be a function of its propulsion systems and deficiencies in its anechoic coating, and this would limit its military utility. Since the prospective bases which might give the PLAN access to the Atlantic are likely to be in Africa, there is also a political dimension to the issue which must be considered. SSN deployments, although not strictly speaking contrary to the Treaty of Pelindaba (which declares Africa a nuclear weapons-free zone), would also create political complications for both China and the host nation. That said, there may be other rationales for extended deployments, including habituating Chinese submariners to longer periods at sea, which is presently a challenge as illustrated by the mental health issues that extended deployments are causing among Chinese submariners who are not used to them. The logic of using extended rotational deployments as a means of exposing the PLAN to the rigours of sustained activity at sea would also apply to surface vessels, but it would suggest deployments comparable to the UK’s periodic carrier strike group deployments to the Indo-Pacific, rather than a standing presence. These deployments, should they occur, would have diplomatic significance – and would represent a means for European navies to gain situational awareness of the PLAN – but their military significance in the Euro-Atlantic would be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of the PLAN to operate from bases in states such as Gabon and Equatorial Guinea – and presumably hold at risk US platforms – would require a degree of willingness on the part of these states to take risks on behalf of China in both establishing bases and allowing their use. In the short to medium term, this level of risk acceptance is unlikely in what are largely transactional relationships. While the concept of the PLAN using dual-use commercial facilities to resupply distant vessels has been considered by the PLAN as a more non-committal option through which to rely on prospective partners, this is more useful to enable deployments in support of diplomacy and engagement than it is to sustain credible naval forces. It is relatively unlikely, for example, that volatile goods, such as munitions, can be stored in civilian ports for long, even if neutral ports could be used for refuelling in wartime. While the pursuit of bases by the PLAN cannot be ruled out, it is unclear whether these facilities would have a significant military role. The risk of SLOC interdiction could in the final instance be offset by other means, including stockpiling and overland transport of goods to ports in third countries to which the US is not constraining access for onward transport. In effect, the problem of resourcing a distant blockade would remain for the US, and the use of the PLAN to protect Atlantic SLOCs appears unlikely to be viable for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the prospects for a Chinese SSBN bastion in the Arctic are constrained by several factors. First, the PLAN does not currently operate SSBNs capable of operating under ice, although its future Type 095 SSN and Type 096 SSBN may be able to do so. Thus far, however, the only indicators of this are academic research, which is inconclusive. Even if this is the case, the Type 096 (for which construction began in the early 2020s) will only be fielded in numbers necessary to ensure a consistent presence at sea by the end of this decade. Second, following the arrival of the first Type 096, the PLAN would need to spend additional years habituating its submariners to operations under ice (which relatively few NATO navies, such as the US Navy and Royal Navy, can do). Third, Chinese SSBNs would need to transit chokepoints such as the Bering Strait to enter the Arctic, meaning that a survivable presence would require at least one SSBN out of a planned fleet of six to be permanently in the Arctic (meaning, in effect, that the majority of the fleet would need to be committed to resourcing this mission). This would also mean that Russian support would be vital to sustain China’s undersea deterrent since Russia is the only non-Western state with experience operating submarines under ice – a strategic commitment neither nation indicated a desire to undertake. And fourth, an Arctic SSBN presence is considerably more complex to deliver than China’s other means of assuring its second strike. China is currently placing multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles, which permit a missile to deliver multiple nuclear warheads to different targets on road-mobile DF-41 ICBMs. This has the effect of ensuring that even a small number of missiles which survive a first strike can both deliver a large number of warheads and pose a complex problem to missile defences. China is also expanding its number of missile silos, increasing the number of targets that the US would need to strike to cripple its arsenal. These palliatives are far more readily achievable than an under-ice SSBN patrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely, then, that within the next 15 years, material constraints on the PLAN will make a military presence capable of supporting Chinese interests in a high-intensity scenario either in the Euro-Atlantic or its environs unlikely. It is still plausible, however, that China is attempting to create optionality for itself and set the conditions for a more expansive presence, should this be deemed desirable and feasible. But this is unlikely to be the case for well over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-potential-uses-of-chinas-maritime-power&quot;&gt;Other Potential Uses of China’s Maritime Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other functions that naval and maritime power can fulfil for China in the Euro-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diplomatic Signalling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naval activity can be used as a tool of diplomatic signalling for both Europe and other actors. As noted, China has conducted several joint exercises with the Russian navy in the previous decade, including the 2017 Naval Interaction exercises in the Baltic Sea, exercises in the Mediterranean and more recent exercises with the Russian and South African navies on the periphery of the Atlantic. A PLAN Type 052D guided missile destroyer also took part in Russia’s Navy Day celebrations in St Petersburg in July 2024. One aim of joint exercises with Russia may be to signal China’s capacity to play a more significant and not entirely welcome role in Europe, should European states become more engaged in the Indo-Pacific. While not wishing to stoke paranoia, this paper notes that the coincidence of a Chinese exercise in Belarus at the same time as the NATO Summit in July 2024 and on the back of the participation of several European states in RIMPAC 24 (Rim of the Pacific Exercise, the world’s largest international maritime exercise) could be seen as exactly the kind of behaviour that best illustrates this scenario. It may be intended to signal China’s capacity to insert itself into the European security environment if European states play a larger role in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PLAN as a Supporting Arm in the Euro-Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, naval activity would in this instance not be China’s primary threat to Europe – rather it would represent a relatively costly signal of China’s potential willingness to employ other tools that may be more immediately consequential. While China is unlikely to have considerable local military strength in the Euro-Atlantic over the next 15 years, it can have an indirect impact on the security of the region. For example, China could reinforce Russia’s capacity to generate export revenue. Russia still relies on Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;amp;I) Club-insured shipping for the transfer of 45% of the vessels carrying hydrocarbons from terminals in the Baltic Sea. Russia’s continued reliance on vessels that depend on Western insurers and thus probably obey the oil price cap, and the decrepitude of the vessels in Russia’s “shadow fleet”, all point to the limits, as a means of sanctions evasion, of any Russian effort to substitute its shadow fleet for international carriers that are exposed to Western pressure. The environmental risks that older vessels pose could also be a legal basis for their eventual denied access to ports and key straits. If the major bottleneck is a lack of available seaworthy ships, Chinese state-owned oil tankers might offer Russia a means of transporting oil at above price-cap rates, particularly since the two largest global operators of oil tankers are Chinese. So far, China’s financial institutions have shied away from transactions that might fall foul of these sanctions – given the exposure of Chinese banks trading in dollars and euros to international sanctions. However, Russia’s growing reliance on Chinese-made dual-use goods and its trade deficit with China mean that transactions in renminbi would give Russia access to a currency for which it has increasing use, despite it being less tradeable than the US dollar. China could also collaborate with Russia in the production of commercial shipping for Russian state-owned firms – a possibility floated by the head of Russia’s VTB Bank Andrey Kostin as a means of clearing the backlogs in Russia’s Zvezda shipyard – or China could sell excess capacity to third-party carriers dealing in Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s military support for Russia could also take more direct forms. The idea that Chinese shipyards could provide Russia’s navy with capacity was, apparently, hinted at by Vice Admiral Sergei Avakyants, then head of Russia’s Pacific Fleet, after joint exercises between the Russian navy and the PLAN. Avakyants suggested that the proportion of modern PLAN vessels allocated to exercises with the Russian Pacific Fleet partly reflected a desire to advertise China’s shipbuilding capabilities. While this assessment may or may not have been accurate, it is often the case that military support that begins as covert or partially deniable assistance escalates to more direct forms over time. Additionally, it is notable that China has recently announced that it will sell the Type 052 destroyer internationally, since few Chinese partners other than Russia have a rationale for procuring the vessel, or the funds to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China’s Presence in Africa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese and Western security interests may well clash in third-party states where China seeks a growing security footprint. To some extent this may have already occurred. In July 2024, Italian authorities interned a Chinese vessel carrying Wing Loong UAVs to Libya’s General Khalifa Haftar, in contravention of the UN arms embargo on Libya. The reality of Chinese-operated ports on Europe’s immediate periphery may make similar interdictions more difficult to achieve in the future. China also has a growing security presence in states such as the DRC, where it has supplied the government with CH-4 UAVs to fight rebel forces, and the Chinese aeronautics company, China National Aero-Technology Import &amp;amp; Export Corporation, has offered to supply the DRC with J-10 aircraft. If longstanding Chinese investment (which comes with fewer political strings than Western alternatives) is combined with more lenient terms, military support between China and Russia could, unchecked, leave both countries with an even greater level of control over Western economy supply chains than they currently enjoy. China can support such activity through the provision of advise and assist missions and by acting as an alternative partner to Western states on issues such as counterpiracy, as it has with Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sabotage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also potential for Chinese limited and deniable coercive activity in the Euro-Atlantic, in tandem with Russia. Consider, for example, the alleged sabotage of the Balticconnector pipeline (a natural gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia) by the NewNew Polar Bear (a vessel registered in China owned by several Russian and Chinese commercial entities) which appears to have dragged its anchor over the pipeline. Chinese survey ships and commercial companies associated with the cable industry or deep sea mining could step up activity near submarine cables in the Atlantic in areas with a lighter NATO presence, such as the Azores Fibre Optic System, and near connections from West Africa such as the Cabo Verde node. The surveying activity being conducted by the Ministry of National Resources could certainly support this, particularly since data gathered must be shared with the PLA. However, there are several impediments to the option of sabotage activity in the Atlantic. China is itself seeking to become a major, if not quite monopolistic, provider of cable services linking European companies to East Asia – a concern that led the US to force China Telecom out of the consortium building the SEA-ME-WE-6 cable (an optical fibre submarine communications cable system that carries telecommunications between Singapore and France) in 2023. Notably, China chose to bankroll an alternative cable linking Asia and Europe (Europe–Middle East–Asia, known as the EMA). Any suggestion of China’s involvement in sabotage would make it considerably easier to build a political consensus for excluding Chinese companies from sensitive projects in the Euro-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Russia, China has not invested heavily in the specialised military equipment needed to target infrastructure, such as cables at depths that make repair difficult, although civil capabilities such as uncrewed underwater vehicles, built for exploring the seabed, could be used in a military capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not possible to entirely exclude sabotage as a tool of dissuasion, it remains relatively unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transfer of Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more significant challenge is the prospect of China becoming a key provider of services related to the transfer of data, which can be employed for intelligence gathering. The latter contingency would, however, only become an extreme consideration if China became a monopolistic actor in the cable market, and with Chinese companies such as HMN Tech (which provides submarine network system solutions) currently holding a 10% market share, this is some way off, although ensuring this remains the case is a policy consideration for Western states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the PLA can support foreign policy aims in the Euro-Atlantic and its environs that are contrary to European interests, it is these policies themselves rather than the military presence involved in them that are the major concern. For the most part, the PLA will be a supporting element in the Euro-Atlantic, reinforcing Chinese foreign policy aims as a tool of military signalling and engagement. These functions can, however, set the conditions for a more militarily credible presence in the long term, and the evolution of the PLAN’s footprint should be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-lessons-for-european-navies&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Lessons for European Navies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For European navies, the direct military threat posed by the growing Chinese presence in the Atlantic will be low for at least the next 15 years. Moreover, most Chinese activity relevant to the Atlantic will occur just beyond the peripheries of the Euro-Atlantic, off West Africa, in the South Atlantic, and the Arctic. The key consideration for Europe’s navies will be how much capacity they allocate to hedging against the prospective evolution of China’s Atlantic posture, given the resource demands of contending with other acute threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appears to be no consensus from Beijing on requirements for a significant military presence in the Atlantic, although considerable attention is paid to the question of expanding “strategic space” in other ways. While China faces tangible risks to some of its supply lines in the Atlantic, there is little that it can do to rectify this challenge in military terms in the medium term. Moreover, there are non-military means by which China can mitigate risk, including diversification, stockpiling and rerouting goods. It is conceivable, however, that the PLAN could pursue rotational deployments in the South Atlantic within the next two decades as a means of both setting the conditions for a more substantial presence in the longer term and habituating the force to operations at reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, much of the activity that this entails will effectively amount to Phase 0 shaping activity in areas adjoining (but not part of) SACEUR’s Area of Responsibility, including the South Atlantic and the Arctic. Port visits by PLAN vessels, maritime data acquisition, military cooperation on non-traditional security issues, and defence engagement in the form of arms sales can, collectively, set the conditions for the PLAN to secure access in areas such as the South Atlantic. While these pursuits are not immediately threatening, they do accord to the importance of European navies remaining engaged in regions that many of them may wish to de-emphasise to refocus resources on the much more pressing challenge of deterrence regarding Russia. While the prioritisation of acute threats represents a rational choice, an economy-of-force effort to match China’s Phase 0 activity should be retained as an economy-of-force task. This need not always involve the deployment of assets – in the Gulf of Guinea, for example, the Anglo-French MDAD-GoG (Maritime Domain Awareness Trade-Gulf of Guinea) has arguably been the most useful European contribution to the safety of regional shipping. Frameworks allowing for the pooling and rotational commitment of ships to tasks such as engagement might also be a means for European navies to manage competing commitments with limited force structures, and this might be a role for the Anglo-French Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, which has lost its original rationale (resourcing expeditionary commitments comparable to the 2011 intervention in Libya).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operating in proximity to the PLAN may also offer it information-gathering opportunities, much as was the case in 2021 when the activities of Chinese Type 093 SSNs near the UK’s carrier strike group revealed (or at a minimum provided the opportunity to verify) a number of details regarding the platform’s acoustic signatures. This represents not only an information-gathering opportunity, but potentially also a constraint on Chinese activity in the Atlantic if this activity raises the prospect of sensitive data regarding deployed vessels being gathered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to China’s limited naval presence, China’s engagement on the peripheries of the Euro-Atlantic could have immediate effects. For example, deeper Chinese engagement with Russia as a means of derisking some of China’s own supply lines and pressuring European states cannot be ruled out. In economic terms, China can substantially increase Russia’s capacity to generate revenue both through China’s own deeper engagement with Russian hydrocarbons extraction in the Arctic and by enabling Russia to circumvent oil price caps without having to rely on an old and relatively small fleet of dark ships (unregistered and uninsured vessels that have turned off or disabled their automatic identification systems).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In military terms, China’s capacity to serial-produce vessels such as the Type 052D represents the last plausible avenue through which Russia could generate a blue-water surface capability. While China’s engagement with Russian hydrocarbons remains relatively cautious, there are sound reasons for this to change, including the fact that Russia offers China a means of hedging against the Malacca dilemma. Moreover, China’s export of dual-use military goods to Russia illustrates a willingness in principle to engage in defence exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These possibilities do not change any of NATO’s core missions, but they do mean that planning for deterrence with regard to Russia should include the possibility that in areas where Russia is currently assessed to have relatively dim prospects (such as long-term growth and the size of its surface fleet), Chinese support is one of the few means that could enable Russia in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, the optimal direct response for Europe’s navies to a PLAN with a limited but gradually expanding Euro-Atlantic footprint should be one premised on mirroring the non-committal but potentially useful Phase 0 shaping activities that the PLAN itself appears to be undertaking. It should further set the conditions to constrain a more assertive China if need be, without overreacting to a prospect that may never materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華指稱黎智英欲領導勇武派 黎反駁：荒誕可笑、不可能這樣說&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EAtyQtX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第97日審訊，黎智英第五日作供。另一名從犯證人陳梓華曾引述黎指勇武需要減少暴力，否則會使運動失去道德高地，又形容黎「想領導或主導勇武派」。黎否認，反指：「這是荒誕可笑的，我沒有可能這樣說」，「若我說出這樣的話是愚蠢的，這是自以為是的。」他又指那些年輕人不會聆聽任何人，故此不可能聆聽像他這樣的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官針對黎 Twitter 推文含有標籤「#StandWithHongKong」提問，黎則指是李兆富負責編輯和加入標籤，當時純粹理解這串字是代表「支持香港」的立場，認為與「重光團隊（Stand With Hong Kong）」無關。他又重申在庭上才首次得知「重光團隊」的存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱黎在飯盒會下達編採指示-黎否認&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱黎在飯盒會下達編採指示 黎否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就首項控罪「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」，控方指稱黎智英透過舉行「飯盒會」來下達編採指示。「從犯證人」、時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹曾供稱，在「飯盒會」裡，所有出席者會坐下來吃飯盒，期間黎會談及對時局的看法、其政治取態，以及下達《蘋果日報》的編採政策。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上否認張的說法，反指「飯盒會」的形式是出席者向他提問，然後他解答問題。黎續指，會議歷時約15至20分鐘，大部份時間都是沉默，因為大家都在吃飯，即使有人說話，話題也不是關於報紙，而是一些無關重要的事情。他指並不是如張所稱的情況，「我們正在吃飯，不會有任何認真的事情要說，當你吃飯的時候是不會說話的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，當大家吃完飯盒之後，每名出席者會輪流向他發問或提出意見，而他會回答問題。辯方問，情形是否好像「問答環節」和討論？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎蘋果從不需要編採指示-因核心價值與港人一致&quot;&gt;黎：《蘋果》從不需要編採指示 因核心價值與港人一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，黎有否在會議上談及編採指示？黎稱沒有，因《蘋果》從不需要任何編採指示，也不需要訓練員工，因為他相信員工所抱持的核心價值與香港人一致，相關價值包括言論自由、遊行自由、宗教自由、民主和法治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則指，編採指示與核心價值是兩回事，而黎曾經提及《蘋果》應該報導《南華早報》不會報導的新聞，屬於編採指示多於核心價值。黎僅重申，《蘋果》需要符合（coincident with）香港人的價值，而他從不需要開口下達編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問：「那報導角度又如何呢？」，黎則指交由記者自行判斷，因他認為不可能指示記者的報導角度，每人的寫作風格都不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報導稱黎向蓬佩奧談及制裁-黎對報導內容沒有懷疑&quot;&gt;報導稱黎向蓬佩奧談及制裁 黎對報導內容沒有懷疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指2019年7月，黎智英赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯。黎確認，並指當時沒有記者在場。辯方續指，黎在同日會見時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧。黎亦確認，指雖然其私人助手 Mark Simon 陪同他前往會見地點，但是他不被容許進入，因此需留在外面等候，而他自己則單獨與蓬佩奧見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The arrest of @JimmyLaiApple in Hong Kong is deeply offensive &amp;amp; an affront to freedom loving people around the world.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹早前供稱，黎智英出席何俊仁主持的網上節目「細說中南海」後，曾致電吩咐他報導節目內容及「做大佢」；其後《蘋果》刊登相關報導，指黎在節目中談及與蓬佩奧會面，蓬佩奧問黎：「美國可以怎樣做？」黎則回答美國可以實施制裁，讓中國官員知道其所作所為會有後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上被問到有否向蓬佩奧提及制裁，黎起初稱：「其實我未曾提及制裁，如果我沒記錯的話。」回到香港之後，除了在何俊仁的節目之外，黎不知道自己有否跟任何人談及該次會面的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過其後黎改稱，他不清楚自己有否說過，但是如果《蘋果》的報導引述他說過「美國應該實施制裁，使打壓示威者的人知道有後果」的話，那麼他應該有跟蓬佩奧討論過。法官李運騰問，所以黎對於報導內容沒有懷疑？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter含標籤standwithhongkong黎稱沒問李兆富-庭上首次聽聞重光團隊&quot;&gt;Twitter含標籤「#StandWithHongKong」黎稱沒問李兆富 庭上首次聽聞重光團隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年8月21日的 Twitter：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「President @realDonaldTrump calls me a brave man. I am flattered. But I am not brave enough to stand against the whole world like #Xi. I only #StandWithHongKong #StandwithTaiwan」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示推文由他草擬，之後由李兆富編輯及標註特朗普，因為他不懂標註特朗普。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，推文中有一個標籤（hashtag）「#StandWithHongKong」，是一個單字，中間沒有空格。黎則指這是出自李兆富之手，因他不懂加標籤。法官杜麗冰問，但是李兆富理應不會添加一些黎不認同的內容。黎同意，並指李會加一些籠統的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎在2020年8月的時候，有沒有留意到「重光團隊（Stand With Hong Kong）」這個組織。黎不認為自己有留意，並問：「是否陳梓華的組織？」法官杜麗冰問黎有否在後來知道這組織。黎則稱在庭上才首次知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰又問黎當時有否問李兆富「#StandWithHongKong」是什麼意思。黎表示沒有，因他不知道什麼是標籤。法官李素蘭追問：「不會好奇？」黎稱不會感到好奇，因這對於他來說不是非常重要的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱當時理解standwithhongkong代表支持香港的立場-非某個團體&quot;&gt;黎稱當時理解「#StandWithHongKong」代表支持香港的立場 非某個團體&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，黎當時沒有留意到「Stand With Hong Kong」是一個團體嗎？黎同意，當時純粹理解這串字是代表「支持香港」，就如另一個標籤「#StandwithTaiwan」代表「支持台灣」，然而「Stand with Taiwan」並非一個團體。他認為這些標籤就如一個籠統的立場，代表支持香港或台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，通常李兆富發布推文之後，便不會再閱讀該推文，因此不會留意李新增了什麼標籤，並重申標籤對他而言不是重要的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問黎當時知不知道一個叫李宇軒的人。黎則稱，當他從新聞得悉李嘗試跨越邊境到台灣時，才首次聽聞李的名字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6k7nccG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李宇軒&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎後來補充，他不認為李兆富加入標籤「#StandWithHongKong」的時候，是指涉李宇軒的組織「重光團隊」，重申這個標籤與「重光團隊」無關。辯方問李有否向黎提及「重光團隊」，黎稱從沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱高層物色社論寫手不會徵詢他意見-聘用後才通知他&quot;&gt;黎稱高層物色社論寫手不會徵詢他意見 聘用後才通知他&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關於《蘋果》社評（《蘋論》）的撰寫人，張劍虹早前供稱寫手須經黎的批准才能聘用，包括馮偉光（筆名盧峯）、顏純鈎（筆名方圓）和楊清奇（筆名李平）。黎則在庭上稱不知自己有否「批准」，但是張劍虹、陳沛敏等高層揀選寫手之後，便會通知他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，高層物色寫手時並不會徵詢他的意見，但是決定寫手人選時便會通知他，他也不會反對，「我沒有收到任何請示，他們只是通知我。」他亦否認陳沛敏所稱，總編輯羅偉光對於黎所揀選的社論寫手沒有反對的餘地，又稱自己從沒有提議或揀選社評寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇曾供稱，作為《蘋果》社論的寫手，「我哋都明白，要跟從報館嘅基本立場，啫係要留意黎智英先生嘅立場。」黎同意說法，下屬知道他反對港獨，便不應觸碰這個話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱推薦桑普因其文章寫得好-悉倡港獨後決定不起用&quot;&gt;黎稱推薦桑普因其文章寫得好 悉倡港獨後決定不起用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏曾供稱，黎曾向張劍虹提議邀請時評作家桑普在論壇版撰寫專欄，但是因為張告知桑普提倡港獨，所以最終決定不起用他。辯方問及原因，黎指因為若有任何寫手提倡港獨，《蘋果》都不應該聘用，而自己當初推薦桑普是因為閱讀過他的文章，認為寫得很好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎還柙之後，張劍虹曾到監獄探訪黎四至五次，問黎在該段期間，有否要求張找桑普撰文。黎說沒有，因為桑普提倡港獨，而且探訪時不會談及這些事情，因在還柙期間這些事情變得無關重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張亦供稱，黎推薦顏純鈎替《蘋果》論壇版或副刊撰文，因他認為顏對中國十分了解。黎同意。黎憶述，張劍虹曾與他討論邀請顏的事宜，但他不記得是張問顏每週寫一篇社論好不好，還是張提議顏每週寫一篇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認發布煽動刊物-指下屬發布文章從不需要經他的批准&quot;&gt;黎否認發布煽動刊物 指下屬發布文章從不需要經他的批准&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方就「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪作總結，問黎有否如控罪所稱，串謀張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、林文宗、馮偉光和楊清奇等人，發布具煽動意圖的刊物。黎否認，指他們發布文章之前從不需要經他的批准。被問到事實上有否同意他們發布，黎則指他們從未徵求自己的同意。黎又指：「我從沒想過他們會發布任何煽動性的東西，他們發布的所有文章應是合法的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著問黎，有沒有意圖利用《蘋果》來發布文章，使人憎恨政府、企圖改變現有政制或引起居民之間的不滿情緒等。黎否認：「從不。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎替g20文宣登報墊支156萬元-稱沒留意收款人身份不關注團隊名稱&quot;&gt;黎替G20文宣登報墊支156萬元 稱沒留意收款人身份、不關注團隊名稱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著圍繞其中一項牽涉陳梓華和李宇軒的「串謀勾結外國勢力」罪提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據訊息紀錄，2019年6月底，時任立法會議員郭榮鏗向黎傳送有關G20登報眾籌的宣傳，黎向郭表示會捐出10萬元。其後 Mark Simon 透過訊息告知黎，由於眾籌已達標，所以不能再捐款，後來眾籌款項已超過670萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「從犯證人」陳梓華曾供稱，2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃遇到資金問題，故他嘗試經李柱銘聯絡黎智英，後來聯絡到 Mark Simon。最終 Mark Simon 及黎一方墊支了約150萬元，其餘廣告費則由李宇軒墊支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9X8H6Lc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息，轉述李柱銘指眾籌登報遇到問題，他們直至7月2日之前都不能從眾籌平台支取籌得款項，因此李問黎能否向G20登報團隊提供500萬元過渡性貸款，並指他們會在7月4日歸還款項。（“Jimmy, I just heard from Martin. The fundraising for the newspaper ads has one major problem. They don’t have access to all the funds until July 2. As such Martin is asking if we can do a bridge loan of Hong Kong dollar 5 million to the group. We would get our money back by July 4th.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 向黎表示，明白為何登報團隊未能收取眾籌款項及背後的理由，而這亦有道理的，希望黎能提出建議。（“I do understand the rationale of why they can’t get the money and it is legitimate. Please advise”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示電郵紀錄，指 Mark Simon 在6月27日指示黎私人公司「力高」的秘書墊支登報費用，並且以李宇軒（Li Yu Hin）的名義。辯方問黎當時有否留意是以另一人的名義付款，以及該人的身份。黎表示：「沒有，我為何要留意？」，又指沒有人告訴他會以李宇軒的名義付款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，最終黎在該次登報計劃中，合共墊支了156萬元，問黎有否留意付款人是誰。黎表示：「沒有，這是 Mark Simon 的責任，而不是我的責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，他記得後來 Mark Simon 告知他，該筆款項已全數歸還。辯方遂展示訊息紀錄，Mark Simon 向黎指國際登報團隊已全數歸還款項：「Also, the Fight For Freedom Group, ones we helped with international ads last time, has paid us back in full.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到訊息中的「Fight For Freedom Group」，惟黎表示：「我不知道，我不在乎，該團隊的名字並非我所關注的事情。」辯方問黎不關注該團隊的性質嗎？黎表示不關注，並反問為什麼要關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon-向黎指所有墊支款項已歸還&quot;&gt;Mark Simon 向黎指所有墊支款項已歸還&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一名「從犯證人」李宇軒曾供稱，2019年8月的第三次眾籌活動中籌得約180萬美元，由於眾籌平台規定要用美國當地的美元戶口來接收眾籌款項，所以在陳梓華的協助下，找來了 Mark Simon 借出美國的銀行戶口收取款項，扣除墊支款項之後，餘款便轉帳至「The Project Hong Kong Trust」的戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示11月16日，Mark Simon 向黎傳訊息，指所有替國際倡議所墊支的款項已經歸還，並存入了Mark Simon 在美國的銀行戶口。（“Jimmy, Just wanted to let you know that all monies that were used for the international ad campaign are now back with us. They had sent to a US account where it sat, under my control, but banks just cleared its movement &amp;amp; now with you.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱2019年7月首次與黎見面-辯方呈結帳紀錄證10月&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱2019年7月首次與黎見面 辯方呈結帳紀錄證10月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著圍繞陳梓華的證供提問。陳梓華早前供稱，他於2019年7月獲李柱銘邀請，到位於中環、由何俊仁胞弟何俊麒經營的日本料理餐廳出席飯局，該次是黎首次與陳親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過辯方針對該次見面的日子提出另一說法，指黎智英的信用卡結帳紀錄顯示，黎於2019年10月18日向該日本餐廳支付853.1元，因此黎與陳首次見面應是10月，而非陳所稱的7月。黎確認相關紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華稱，他到達餐廳後，黎基於保安理由而要求收起他的手機，隨後陳的手機交由餐廳職員保管。黎今指，收起手機的做法是李柱銘提出，因為李認為即使手機在關閉狀態下，也可以被不知名人士竊聽他們的討論內容，形容李一直以來都很謹慎，凡出席會議時都會收起手機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎冀透過陳梓華籲前線克制平息暴力&quot;&gt;黎：冀透過陳梓華籲前線克制、平息暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，李柱銘之所以介紹陳梓華給他認識，是因為李知道他關注年輕人的激進思想和示威前線的暴力，希望藉邀請陳參與飯局，讓年輕人明白暴力是有損運動及他們應該克制。當時他理解陳是前線示威者的領袖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hbWY8mh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李柱銘&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示不記得飯局的詳細討論內容，只記得陳梓華嘗試解釋前線年輕人的想法，而黎自己則嘗試叫他們克制。黎又指，其後他與陳有過一連串的會面和溝通，目的都是希望透過陳向勇武派傳話，使年輕人能夠平息暴力（pacified）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又稱，一直稱呼陳為 Wayland，並不知道他的中文姓名，因此當警方首次問及「陳梓華」時，他表示不認識這個人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認向陳梓華談及自己與mark-simon的關係&quot;&gt;黎否認向陳梓華談及自己與Mark Simon的關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華曾供稱，黎在飯局中指 Mark Simon 每日都會聯絡他，亦會向他匯報。黎則在庭上稱，不記得自己有如此說過，況且 Mark Simon 一直與陳聯絡，實沒有需要向陳提及自己與 Mark Simon 之間的關係。黎其後確認自己沒有這樣說過，因為除了過渡貸款一事之外，他沒有需要在陳面前談及 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華曾供稱：「當我開始嘗試介紹自己嘅時候，好快就畀黎智英打斷咗，佢話唔使介紹喇，佢話 Mark Simon 已經話畀我聽，佢已經係咁𠵱查過我。」黎則在庭上稱，陳的說法不是真的，因為從訊息紀錄可見，他在會面之前並不認識陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不認為陳梓華是暴力人士&quot;&gt;黎：不認為陳梓華是暴力人士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於對陳梓華的印象，黎不認為陳是暴力的人，這印象來自李柱銘的介紹，因為自己被視為較保守的人，陳既然是經李介紹的，理應不會是暴力的人。再者，黎憑對話感到陳不是暴力的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭則質疑，黎一方面說陳是「前線的年輕人」一方面說他不是暴力的人，說法有矛盾。黎僅回應，陳是前線的人，但他不是暴力，所以才會叫他向勇武人士轉達要克制的信息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述黎飯局發言-部份言論黎否認說過&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述黎飯局發言 部份言論黎否認說過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2019年11月12日向陳傳送訊息，指一名男子在馬鞍山天橋上被黑衣人點火，使他感到害怕（dreaded），並指勇武派應該有人領導，並提議在翌日的會面中詳細討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認，翌日他住宅舉行飯局，出席者包括陳梓華、何俊仁、李永達和林卓廷。這是黎與陳第二次親身見面。黎稱邀請陳出席，是為了介紹他給其他人認識，並讓陳解釋前線的想法等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，黎就當時的反修例運動發表意見，「佢（黎）覺得勇武派冇組織、冇分寸，然後愈嚟愈濫用暴力，如果搞出咗人命嘅話，咁整個運動就會失去道德高地去對抗香港政府，從而亦都會失去國際嘅支持。」黎表示不記得自己這樣說過，但是確實反映他當時的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦引述黎稱勇武需要減少暴力，應採取「和平、理性、非暴力」手段。黎同意如此說過，至於「黃藍係政見，黑白係良知」，他稱自己有可能說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指黎說：「有啲嘅底線，佢需要堅守嘅」，黎表示整個飯局不只他一人說話，何俊仁、林卓廷也有參與討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另引述黎稱：「佢話如果年青人做唔到嘅嘢，佢可以以傳媒嘅力量做到」，黎則不認自己有這樣說過，因為這脫離了討論主題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳稱黎說過：「《蘋果日報》唔係要報道啲勇武，只要唔報道佢哋，佢哋嘅影響力已經會細咗好多。」黎則否認，因這不是他當時的想法，據他記憶，《蘋果日報》從來都不是飯局討論的話題。他亦否認提及過「五大訴求」，因與討論離題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認想領導勇武派這是荒誕可笑的&quot;&gt;黎否認想領導勇武派：「這是荒誕可笑的」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，陳曾形容黎「想領導或主導勇武派」。黎隨即否認，「這是荒誕可笑的（farcical），我沒有可能這樣說」，「若我說出這樣的話是愚蠢的，這是自以為是的（presumptuous）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續指，那些年輕人不聆聽任何人，單是要他們平息暴力已是非常困難，反問：「我是誰呢？」，並重申：「若說出這樣的話是非常瘋狂的。」辯方回應：「你不再年輕了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否在飯局中說過想領導勇武派，黎聞言反問：「我會說出這樣的話嗎？這是荒謬的⋯⋯我不是年輕人了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認在飯局中提及制裁、封鎖和敵對行動，也否認提及佩洛西、彭斯和蓬佩奧，因當晚討論僅圍繞勇武派、暴力和反修例運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎經歷理大失利-應建立領袖團隊奪回話語權&quot;&gt;黎：經歷理大失利 應建立領袖團隊奪回話語權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月24日民主派在區選中大勝，黎向陳發訊息，稱當日是「美妙的一天」，並指：「自從理大失著，我也這樣想，現在是組織領袖團隊的時候，我星期三與泛民大佬傾好後，請你找幾位同儕一同商討，可以嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，經歷理大事件、多人被捕之後，認識正是適當時候建立領袖團隊，奪回對運動的話語權。黎其後安排與陳在其座駕上見面，希望聆聽陳的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

This paper seeks to provide some of that grounding through a combination of Chinese policy document analysis and new financial and market share data for leading semiconductor equipment firms in China, the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. What follows are a set of 10 key judgments based on the author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-chinas-ambitions-for-eliminating-dependence-on-foreign-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment-started-long-before-americas-expanded-usage-of-technology-export-controls&quot;&gt;1. China’s ambitions for eliminating dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment started long before America’s expanded usage of technology export controls.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important argument among critics of U.S. export controls is that they weaken U.S. technology leadership by incentivizing China to eliminate U.S. technology from its semiconductor supply chain. However, reducing dependence on foreign semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers was official Chinese policy before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls restricting sales of U.S.-designed chips to ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications firm, launched the new era of semiconductor export controls. “The Roadmap of Major Technical Domains for Made in China 2025,” which was published in September 2015 and covered semiconductors and other sectors, included goals such as “replacement of imports with Chinese-made products basically achieved in key industries” by 2025. It set specific targets and deadlines for the degree of market share that Chinese companies were supposed to reach and by what date. Targets for the semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;50 percent localization rate of 90–32 nanometer (nm) process equipment before 2020&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;50 percent localization of 90 nm lithography machines before 2020&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30 percent localization rate of 20–14 nm process equipment before 2025&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic production of immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography machines before 2025&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic production of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment before 2030&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Made in China 2025 technical document roadmap stated, “meeting domestic market demand, improving the self-sufficiency rate of integrated circuit products, meeting national security needs, and occupying the strategic product market have always been the greatest demand and driving force for the development of the integrated circuit industry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even earlier policies, though less well resourced, sought to dramatically reduce use of foreign semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For example, the 2006 “Medium Long Range Plan for the Development of Science and Technology” explicitly called for self-sufficiency in semiconductor technologies and initiated so-called “mega projects” to drive toward that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, China’s government has provided lavish subsidies in the form of tax breaks, free land, government grants, and equity infusions to a number of Chinese semiconductor equipment companies. Naura, one of China’s leading domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies received $1.3 billion in state support in 2021, even before the imposition of the Biden administration’s export controls. AMEC, another leading Chinese semiconductor equipment company, received a similar equity investment from the “Big Fund” in 2015. Simply put, China’s goal of semiconductor equipment industry localization and robust policy support predated any modern effort to impose meaningful export controls on China’s chip fabrication capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-there-is-not-a-simple-relationship-between-export-controls-and-chinas-rate-of-technological-progress-chinas-greatest-progress-came-in-sectors-with-no-export-controls&quot;&gt;2. There is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s rate of technological progress. China’s greatest progress came in sectors with no export controls.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A September 2024 analysis by Bernstein Research, an equity research firm, included a review of China’s semiconductor self-sufficiency goals from the 2015 roadmap and found that “China has made impressive progress and likely will beat the ‘Made in China 2025’ targets for integrated circuit (IC) Design and Manufacturing, but may miss the goals for IC equipment and Materials.” As the Bernstein analysis shows, the rate of China’s progress toward self-sufficiency is best predicted by the market and technological complexities of each semiconductor market segment, not by the extent to which export controls were applied. It is certainly not the case that the segments in which China has made the most progress — or even devoted the most resources — are the areas in which the United States has applied export controls most forcefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That there is not a simple relationship between export controls and China’s technological progress should be obvious given that China has made rapid progress in other technological domains — such as solar cells and electric vehicles (EVs) — where the United States applied no export controls and in some cases actively supported the rise of a Chinese supply chain. The United States applied no export controls in the case of the equipment used to manufacture silicon solar cells, yet today China dominates both production of solar cells and production of the equipment used to make them. This equipment is in many ways similar to (though less sophisticated than) the equipment used to make and process silicon wafers for semiconductors. In fact, one Chinese company, Naura, is a domestic leader in both manufacturing equipment for both solar cells and semiconductors. The biggest difference in Chinese outcomes between those two industries is not the presence or absence of export controls but the far greater technological complexity of producing semiconductor manufacturing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EV maker Tesla made a major push into Chinese manufacturing in late 2018, launching deep partnerships with many local Chinese suppliers, such as battery-maker CATL. As a November 2024 commentary in a major Chinese state-run newspaper stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tesla’s rapid growth in sales, fueled by its technological and branding advantages and backed by China’s massive consumer market, has driven the rapid development of upstream and downstream supply chains. Today, the localization rate of parts for Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory exceeds 95%, with more than 60 suppliers integrated into Tesla’s global supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese EV supply chain, which Tesla helped dramatically increase in both scale and technological sophistication, is now also supplying Tesla’s competitors. Defections of Tesla-trained skilled employees are also a challenge. An April 2024 New York Times report claimed that most of Tesla’s early Chinese employees now work at competing Chinese firms. In a January Tesla earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said “The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. . . . Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point here is not to suggest with unwarranted certainty that export controls would have definitively prevented China’s rise in the solar and EV industries. Rather, it is to caution the reader against relying too heavily on cursory anecdotal evidence to reach conclusions about when export controls do or do not work and what the counterfactual outcome would have been if export controls were or were not applied. Much depends upon the state of the global market landscape, the complexity of the controlled technology, the current technological sophistication of the targeted country, the design of the export control regulations, and the robustness of the controls’ implementation and enforcement. Only a detailed analysis can hope to reach anything approaching insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-semiconductor-export-controls--as-implemented-thus-far--have-in-different-ways-and-at-different-times-both-helped-and-hindered-chinese-firms&quot;&gt;3. Semiconductor export controls — as implemented thus far — have in different ways and at different times both helped and hindered Chinese firms.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as foreign firms have supported Chinese competitor growth in solar cells and EVs in the absence of export controls, so have they done in semiconductor manufacturing. The major semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers all have major service businesses, where, among other things, they train customer companies on how to get the most out of their equipment. Prior to the October 2022 changes in U.S. export controls, this could include assisting with the facility planning, installation, repairs, and operational troubleshooting of equipment as part of advanced chip manufacturing operations. Industry sources told CSIS that this sometimes included contract research and development (R&amp;amp;D) of advanced node semiconductor process technology on behalf of or in partnership with Chinese clients. At least as of November 2024, this is still legal in the case of providing support to Chinese legacy chip manufacturing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, earlier U.S. export controls meaningfully reversed progress in some segments of the Chinese semiconductor sector, such as NAND memory manufacturing and smartphone chip design, though the durability of those setbacks, even if temporary, will depend on many factors. More recent export controls have also made life harder in many ways for Chinese semiconductor equipment firms, who can no longer legally obtain U.S. subcomponents or technical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is simply wrong to say that export controls always, in isolation, accelerate Chinese technological indigenization and that making it easier for U.S. firms to export will always slow Chinese indigenization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is unambiguously the case that the United States’ use of semiconductor export controls, beginning with ZTE in April 2018, made a massive impression on both political and corporate leaders in China. Speeches at the time by Chinese leadership, including General Secretary Xi Jinping, indicate that ZTE was viewed as a turning point and justified China’s aggressive pursuit of “self-reliance” in science and technology. Pony Ma, the chairman of Tencent, one of China’s largest technology firms, said in May 2018, “The recent ZTE incident made us see clearly that no matter how advanced our mobile payment is, without mobile devices, without microchips and operating systems, we can’t compete competently.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence goes beyond talk to specific actions. China made significant changes to its semiconductor policy in the years following ZTE, and China’s central government directed local governments to “do everything in their power” to promote the semiconductor sector. Some Chinese companies also took drastic measures to respond after ZTE. For example, Nikkei Asia reported that Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation (YMTC) — one of China’s most advanced semiconductor manufacturers — began a full-blown de-Americanization campaign in 2019 involving the full-time work of more than 800 staff (both YMTC and its suppliers). This included the establishment of multiple new major partnerships with domestic Chinese equipment producers. Of note, at the time when YMTC began this de-Americanization initiative, no significant U.S. export controls applied to the company. YMTC began their work based on fear of future controls, not the reality of current ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined, this provides strong evidence that the export controls did increase the desire of both the Chinese government and Chinese companies to increase the capabilities of local semiconductor equipment providers, but that is not the same thing as saying that export controls caused accelerated indigenization, which depends upon more than just desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-the-biden-administrations-2022-export-controls-strengthened-a-policy-approach-to-semiconductor-equipment-controls-that-began-in-2019-during-the-first-trump-administration&quot;&gt;4. The Biden administration’s 2022 export controls strengthened a policy approach to semiconductor equipment controls that began in 2019 during the first Trump administration.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with chip export controls, the first Trump administration launched the U.S. government’s modern approach to semiconductor manufacturing equipment export controls. According to reporting by Reuters, the U.S. government successfully persuaded the Dutch government in July 2019 to cancel the export license of EUV lithography equipment to SMIC, China’s most advanced logic chip foundry. In December 2020, SMIC was added to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, prohibiting the company from buying certain kinds of U.S. equipment, specifically, “items uniquely required for production of semiconductors at advanced technology nodes (10 nanometers and below, including extreme ultraviolet technology).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, the Biden administration significantly expanded U.S. export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, including not only Entity List and end-use restrictions but also some country-wide export controls that applied to China as a whole (including a use of the U.S. persons rule). Just as importantly, the Biden administration made some of these controls more multilateral in nature, engagingJapan and the Netherlands to overhaul their export control policies for advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Even though these controls did not entirely align with U.S. controls, this was important to ensure that Dutch and Japanese companies did not provide China with alternative sources for the items that the United States was no longer willing to sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-chinese-semiconductor-equipment-firms-started-very-small-but-have-grown-rapidly-however-this-rapid-growth-occurred-both-before-and-after-export-controls-and-took-place-during-a-period-of-massive-chinese-equipment-demand-growth&quot;&gt;5. Chinese semiconductor equipment firms started very small but have grown rapidly. However, this rapid growth occurred both before and after export controls and took place during a period of massive Chinese equipment demand growth.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry has long been both small and technologically inferior to the global state of the art. To understand the growth trajectory of the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment sector, CSIS gathered market data on how China’s global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market share has changed over time across both supply and demand (see Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mL9mPYr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Chinese Semiconductor Equipment Global Supply and Demand Share.&lt;/strong&gt; Sources: CSIS Analysis; Semiconductor Equipment Association of Japan; “Semiconductor Equipment Database,” TechInsights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has grown as both a supplier and as a buyer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment over the past 15 years. And while Chinese firms have in aggregate increased China’s share of global supply, they remain quite small in comparison to foreign firms, providing only 3.2 percent of the equipment (by dollar value) globally and 9.6 percent of the equipment purchased by customers operating in China in 2023 (see Figure 1). Some industry sources, such as the research firm Sanford Bernstein, estimate that the Chinese domestic market share captured by Chinese equipment providers (aka Chinese self-sufficiency) is 15 percent. Whether the true figure is closer to 9.6 percent or 15 percent, the equipment that Chinese firms sell remains almost exclusively confined to legacy nodes and remains far behind the global state of the art. However, industry sources have told CSIS that Chinese equipment has grown in competitiveness compared with the legacy node equipment sold by leading global suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until the Biden administration’s October 2022 export controls, it was generally legal to sell critical subcomponents or expert consulting services to Chinese equipment firms, assisting with their growth in both sales and technological knowhow. In addition to voluntary foreign support, Chinese firms have benefitted from industrial espionage that has included state-backed cyberattacks on equipment companies. Chinese equipment firms have also benefitted from hundreds of billions of dollars in government investments, tax credits, and subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the above data shows, the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry started out with comparatively low R&amp;amp;D expenditure but has shown extraordinary growth since the beginning of the Made in China 2025 policy era in 2015. Relative growth rates of R&amp;amp;D have slowed in the industry over the past two years, but growth in absolute terms remains very high. This data is not consistent with a simple story of “export controls caused a boom in the Chinese semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry” and instead shows that annual growth rates were very high both before and after the United States began imposing export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One plausible interpretation of the data is that U.S. and Dutch export controls in the 2018–2020 period increased desire among both the Chinese government and Chinese equipment customers in strengthening the local equipment industry, but they did so without making it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain help — even from U.S. experts and equipment subcomponent providers. The export controls of 2022 and 2023 may have further increased interest among the Chinese government and customers, but such interest and ability to productively absorb additional investment was already nearly maxed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the export controls of 2022 and 2023 also took extensive steps (e.g., extensive application of the Foreign Direct Product Rule and the U.S. persons rule, multilateralization of the controls) to make it more difficult for Chinese firms to obtain foreign help in advancing the reliability and competitiveness of their technology. Thus, the pace of revenue and R&amp;amp;D expenditure growth among Chinese equipment providers slowed somewhat (while remaining high in absolute terms). Again, this is a plausible interpretation that is consistent with the available data, but the available data is not sufficient in and of itself to definitively state that this is the correct interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another plausible interpretation for slowing pace of growth — discussed in the next section — is that Chinese customers for semiconductor manufacturing equipment dramatically accelerated equipment purchases in an effort to stockpile equipment in anticipation of future export controls and that this surge of foreign imports stockpiling temporarily reduced demand growth for domestic equipment (while not changing China’s long-term commitment to end reliance on imports).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations in the R&amp;amp;D data, as not all of the companies are exclusively focused on the semiconductor equipment industry. Naura, for example, has lithium battery and photovoltaic business units which industry sources told CSIS are responsible for about 18 percent of the firm’s revenue (and presumably comprised a comparable share of its R&amp;amp;D for at least some period), but these are not broken out in the firm’s public financial reporting. Additionally, there are important Chinese semiconductor equipment firms that are not included in this analysis, such as Shanghai Microelectronics Equipment (SMEE) and Huawei’s recently established semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, because they do report such data publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of Huawei’s semiconductor equipment subsidiaries, in particular, could be an important missing source of data. Huawei’s private investment in R&amp;amp;D and the semiconductor equipment that it produces for its own secret network of chip manufacturers would not be captured in any of the data sources used in this report. In October 2023, the Dutch newspaper NRC, citing anonymous ASML employees, reported that an employee who stole significant semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology secrets moved to China and now works for Huawei. This suggests that Huawei is making a significant investment in lithography equipment, as does a 2022 Huawei patent filed under the name “Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these complications mean that the specific R&amp;amp;D values as presented have an error bar, the overall trajectory characterized is likely close to the reality of the Chinese semiconductor equipment industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-in-the-20162024-period-leading-us-and-international-semiconductor-equipment-firms-continued-to-demonstrate-strong-chinese-revenue-growth-after-imposition-of-increasingly-strict-export-controls&quot;&gt;7. In the 2016–2024 period, leading U.S. and international semiconductor equipment firms continued to demonstrate strong Chinese revenue growth after imposition of increasingly strict export controls.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment providers are Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation. Together with ASML of the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron and Advantest of Japan, they comprise the six largest semiconductor equipment providers in the world by revenue. In their financial reports, these firms report the share of their revenue derived from China (not including Taiwan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS extracted and aggregated this data to show that these firms have grown revenue in China both before and after the United States began imposing export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For the top three U.S. providers, Chinese revenue growth outperformed growth in the rest of the world every year in the 2016–2024E period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, ASML, the Dutch lithography equipment firm, also saw dramatic growth in sales of equipment to China that exceeded growth in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rd3GmYV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the same is true of Tokyo Electron and Advantest, the two leading Japanese equipment providers. Both saw superior performance in China compared with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mOLIeZf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely explanation for this is that Chinese firms have shifted their purchases of international equipment earlier so that they occurred prior to expected future export controls (which the U.S. government has maintained since 2022 will be updated annually). Just as Huawei built up a U.S. chip stockpile equivalent to multiple years of demand during a period prior to U.S. export control loopholes being closed, Chinese semiconductor manufacturers have acquired a stockpile of U.S. and other foreign equipment in anticipation of strengthened export controls coming in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “pulling demand forward” interpretation is the one that many executives in the semiconductor equipment industry have evidently reached. In July 2024, both the CEO of ASML and the CEO of ASM said during investor earnings calls that Chinese semiconductor manufacturers would likely decrease purchases of equipment soon, as they have struggled to “digest” all of the accelerated purchases of equipment and spare parts that they have made, effectively confirming that many tools that have been sold to China are still likely awaiting installation and remain unused. Similarly, in August 2024, a Lam Research executive likewise described “inventory stocking” behavior among Chinese customers over the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-export-controls-changed-the-composition-of-equipment-demand-both-technologically-decreasing-the-technological-sophistication-of-demand-in-china-and-geographically-shifting-more-demand-outside-of-china-but-likely-did-not-change-the-overall-demand-trajectory&quot;&gt;8. Export controls changed the composition of equipment demand both technologically (decreasing the technological sophistication of demand in China) and geographically (shifting more demand outside of China) but likely did not change the overall demand trajectory.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades before the Trump administration’s April 2018 export controls on ZTE ushered in the modern era of semiconductor export controls, the U.S. policy goal for exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China was already to restrict sales of advanced equipment to trusted U.S. allies and partners while allowing the sale of older, less advanced equipment to China. A 2002 U.S. government policy review of semiconductor technology exports to China stated this explicitly. Neither the Trump administration nor the Biden administration fundamentally changed this approach at a high level. Both administrations continued to allow the sale of legacy equipment, though they increased restrictions on sales of advanced equipment exports. In the case of the Biden administration, it also communicated an intent to end the “sliding scale” approach that allowed the sophistication of equipment exports to China to advance, but on a multiyear delay from the global state of the art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, China has continued to be a large and growing market for equipment exports even after the more recent export controls, but Chinese firms have changed their focus from a rush to compete at the most advanced semiconductor technological nodes to maximizing both domestic self-sufficiency and global leadership in legacy chip production. China was likely to pursue a massive expansion of chip production capacity regardless of U.S. actions, but the export controls helped ensure that this capacity did not drive the U.S. and allies toward a strategic dependence on China for the most technologically advanced chips, such as those that power AI systems or high-end smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the overall demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment fundamentally depends on the overall demand for manufactured chips. As the demand for advanced chips grows, that demand will translate into demand for advanced equipment. And if China is not in a position to purchase advanced equipment, then the purchase and production will instead take place outside of China. The chief financial officer of ASML, Roger Dassen, said this explicitly during ASML’s July 2024 earnings call with investment analysts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . the way we look at the demand for our tools is not from a specific geography. In this case, China. We look at — and that’s the way we model our sales medium term and long term. We look at what is the global demand for wafers and whether those wafers are being produced in country X or country Y, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. And I think that is very important to recognize in looking at your model. We don’t have a specific China element in our models. It is the global demand for wafers that drives our modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, U.S. and allied controls did not so much destroy demand as change its composition. China is buying fewer advanced tools than it would have otherwise and is instead purchasing more legacy tools. The advanced tools that would have been sold to China have instead been sold to places like the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Europe. Likewise, given that many foreign players are wary of investing in legacy nodes due to fears of Chinese overcapacity, the tools are being largely sold to China for those production lines, not elsewhere. Chinese firms are also likely attempting to use many “node-agnostic” or “backwards compatible” equipment tools not subject to a control to bolster their advanced node efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9-increased-application-of-semiconductor-equipment-export-controls-coincided-with-and-likely-caused-us-equipment-firms-to-ensure-that-sales-to-china-did-not-ship-from-the-united-states-andor-were-manufactured-outside-the-united-states&quot;&gt;9. Increased application of semiconductor equipment export controls coincided with and likely caused U.S. equipment firms to ensure that sales to China did not ship from the United States and/or were manufactured outside the United States.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS has produced an estimate of the Chinese semiconductor equipment revenue of each of the top three U.S. semiconductor equipment companies by taking their topline revenue from China and subtracting the share reported as services and non-semiconductor equipment businesses (e.g., display, printed circuit board inspection). This figure would include any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales to China from these three firms shipped from any of their facilities worldwide, whether those facilities are in the United States or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. trade data provided by the International Trade Commission (ITC) reports the dollar value of all U.S. exports based on six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The NAICS Code for “Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing” is 333242, which covers all front-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment. CSIS collected ITC trade data for all U.S. exports of 333242 goods to China. This figure includes any semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales made from U.S. soil, whether those sales are made by U.S.-owned or internationally owned firms. In practice, the top three U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment companies — Applied Materials, Lam Research, and KLA Corporation — tend to dominate 333242 exports to nearly all countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these two datasets, one could see that U.S. equipment sales to China by U.S. firms have increasingly become exported from non-U.S. countries since 2016 and especially after 2019 (see Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JmJpwEK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: Comparing Firm-reported Equipment Sales to China with U.S.-China Equipment Exports Data.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS analysis; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataweb.usitc.gov/&quot;&gt;“DataWeb,” U.S. International Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;; and 10-K/10-Q reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2016 to 2020, the ratio of sales to exports grew 34 percent, from 1.1 to 1.5. However, from 2021 to 2024, the ratio nearly doubled, from 1.6 to 3.1. In other words, exports to China and sales to China used to be nearly identical, but sales overwhelmingly outgrew exports in the post-2020 period, the same period when the United States adopted significantly stricter export controls. Industry sources told CSIS that much of the change was originally due to U.S. firms seeking to legally avoid export controls that — in the absence of strict usage of the Foreign Direct Product Rule — only applied to exports from U.S. soil. This interpretation is consistent with the remarks of KLA CEO Rick Wallace, who discussed how some versions of U.S. semiconductor equipment export controls did not apply to U.S. companies manufacturing their equipment abroad and shipping from abroad during the company’s 2020 Q3 earnings call. The exchange is important and worth quoting at length:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it’s still very early, and I’m sure you’re awaiting clarity on how broader now the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what’s been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. and considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you read today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rick Wallace:&lt;/strong&gt; Our understanding at this point is, this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have three major manufacturing sites; Israel, Singapore and here. So there is a potential impact depending on the customer. And our final understanding of the ruling that [is that it] will impact tools that come out of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, export controls that do not include strict implementation and enforcement of the Foreign Direct Product Rule or U.S. persons rule can incentivize U.S. firms to move production offshore, costing the United States manufacturing jobs. In recent years, U.S. semiconductor manufacturing equipment firms have doubled-down and expanded their non-U.S. manufacturing operations. Both KLA Corporation and Applied Materials have committed to major expansions of their Singapore manufacturing facilities, while LAM Research has built out its largest manufacturing site in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quantitative terms, this is one of the most striking effects of the export controls as implemented thus far, and it clearly illustrates the risk that countries take by applying export controls that do not apply extraterritorially in industries where off-shoring some or all production is relatively easy. As one Japanese business executive stated, his company will “develop duplicate supply chains — one for the U.S.-led economic bloc and one for [the] China-led bloc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry sources told CSIS that, more recently, both U.S. and international semiconductor equipment companies are being required by their Chinese customers to remove all U.S. citizens from their supply chain and ship from outside the United States when selling to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact shows that there is really no turning back from the export control path that the United States and its allies have gone down. Half measures incur nearly all of the costs of an aggressive export control policy — in terms of incentivizing U.S. firm outsourcing, foreign substitution, and Chinese indigenous investment — while delivering comparatively few of the strategic benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;10-there-is-no-change-in-us-or-allied-policy-that-will-persuade-the-chinese-government-and-chinese-firms-to-abandon-their-semiconductor-equipment-de-americanization-and-decoupling-efforts-however-the-united-states-can-take-steps-to-make-those-efforts-more-difficult-and-to-extract-more-strategic-benefits-in-semiconductor-and-ai-competition&quot;&gt;10. There is no change in U.S. or allied policy that will persuade the Chinese government and Chinese firms to abandon their semiconductor equipment de-Americanization and decoupling efforts. However, the United States can take steps to make those efforts more difficult and to extract more strategic benefits in semiconductor and AI competition.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics of export controls oftentimes make two related arguments. First, revenues from China can be reinvested in R&amp;amp;D and thus contribute to increased U.S. technological competitiveness, including against Chinese firms. Second, prohibiting exports increases willingness on the part of Chinese firms and the Chinese government to invest in competitors to U.S. firms, decreasing U.S. technological competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these arguments assume that the strategic approach of the Chinese government and Chinese firms depends solely or primarily upon U.S. actions, which is contradicted by the review of Chinese policy at the beginning of this paper and from the experience of the EV and solar industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a thought experiment: What would be the likely policy response of the Chinese government if the United States decided to begin unrestricted exports of nuclear submarines to China? U.S. nuclear submarines are widely regarded as the best in the world, and China’s spies have long devoted major efforts to stealing U.S. submarine technology secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably, therefore, China would leap at the chance to buy U.S. nuclear submarines on the open market. And, under the logic of the above two arguments — increased U.S. revenue and decreased Chinese investment — these sales would increase, not decrease, the U.S. technological advantage in nuclear submarine technology. Are American policymakers fools for using export controls to block nuclear submarine sales to China?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a hypothetical reckless U.S. president and Congress were to allow China to buy as many submarines as U.S. firms could make, China would never accept that this state of affairs is likely to continue on a permanent basis. China would obviously take the submarines they could get and reverse engineer the technology as fast as possible and transfer that technology to their domestic submarine industry, which they would continue to financially support. The increased revenue from R&amp;amp;D for U.S. firms is not going to make nearly as much of a difference as China’s hands-on opportunity to reverse engineer U.S. technology. Neither would the lost sales among Chinese submarine manufacturers decrease China’s commitment to supporting a domestic industry. This is not to even mention the grave risks to national security of a hypothetical Chinese navy equipped with U.S.-built nuclear submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This admittedly extreme thought experiment bears consideration because, while some in the West question whether semiconductor manufacturing equipment deserves to be viewed as a strategic technology of major importance to national security, China’s leaders do not. This belief is evident not only in words but also the deeds, whether that be Chinese state-backed espionage against equipment firms, aggressive reverse engineering of purchased Western equipment, or the astonishing amount of financial resources dedicated to indigenization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is simply no policy that the United States could articulate that would persuade China to abandon its goals of de-Americanization and decoupling in the semiconductor equipment sector. As the United States and allied governments consider reforms to semiconductor equipment controls, they should focus less on how to change China’s goals and more on how to make achieving those goals as expensive and complicated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, because of the U.S. industrial policies creating positions in targeted industries and an aging workforce tied to specific career paths, shortages are set to become more dire in the medium term.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This report counters the argument that if more people enter the United States, fewer resources will be left for those already here. Immigrants create more benefits than costs while putting the country in a more globally competitive position. Lifting barriers to immigration would improve Americans’ ability to find affordable housing, medical care, and groceries and create the workforce needed both in the near term and in the long run.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” These words, inscribed on the Statue of Liberty pedestal, tell the world that people searching for new lives and new opportunities are welcome in the United States. Indeed, foreigners becoming part of the country’s economic success has been a constant throughout U.S. history. Immigrants have been confident in their ability to pursue a better life in the United States. Insights from U.S. labor markets also show that immigration is essential to the country’s wealth and security; it has been a boon to a growing U.S. economy in dire need of additional workers. Their contributions benefit all Americans and provide the key to a better life for them and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite migrants’ importance, immigration remains a fraught issue in the U.S. political system. The last successful overhaul of U.S. policy was almost 40 years ago. Despite the influx of proposals and debate, optimism for immigration reform remains unlikely. Rather than address the details of immigration law reform, this paper explores the current state of the U.S. economy and the role migrants can play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. labor market cooled in the first half of 2024, but critical sectors remain badly understaffed. Additionally, because of U.S. industrial policies creating positions in targeted industries and an aging workforce tied to specific career paths, shortages are set to become more dire in the medium term. These shortages will affect the affordability of necessities, including housing, medical care, and groceries. The situation will worsen without a drastic increase in the number of available workers, and changes to U.S. immigration policy are the most effective pathways to that end. As policymakers face considerable domestic economic challenges, it is worth remembering that the country’s best tool is letting the huddled masses in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. labor market cooled in the first half of 2024, but critical sectors remain badly understaffed . . . shortages will affect the affordability of necessities, including housing, medical care, and groceries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three main factors contribute to positive economic growth: people, capital, and technology. The upside hopes for growth-fostering technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing are significant, as are the expectations for future reductions in interest rates. But the labor market cannot be ignored. Moreover, given how tight the U.S. labor market is, there are signs that it is contributing to inflation and hindering U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth. While hiring rates are slowing and the overall tightness of the labor market may unwind, the labor shortage described in the following four case studies remains acute. The sectors explored in these case studies are central to U.S. prosperity, which is why ameliorating these shortages will be key to continued U.S. economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help the U.S. economy achieve its greatest potential, jobs must be filled. Physically demanding in-person roles are facing shortfalls, including in construction, healthcare, transportation, and food production. These demanding roles could be filled with increases in legal immigration, supporting U.S. growth, ensuring a higher degree of affordability, and mitigating additional inflationary pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;demography&quot;&gt;Demography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domestic birth rate is insufficient to address the labor shortages already emerging in the U.S. economy. The U.S. fertility rate has been decreasing since the 2008 financial crisis, dropping almost 23 percent between 2007 and 2022. Birth rates are now below the replacement rate and are unlikely to return to that rate anytime soon (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dlSdT7n.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: U.S. Fertility Rate, 1960–2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SPDYNTFRTINUSA&quot;&gt;“Fertility Rate, Total for the United States,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average U.S. fertility rate was 1.67 children per woman as of 2022, far below the 2.1 children necessary to sustain a population. Yet the United States is faring better than many other developed countries. Germany’s rate was around 1.46 children per woman in 2022, and Japan’s was 1.26 children per woman in 2023. Italy, in turn, is in a tougher spot, with only 1.24 children per woman as of 2022. South Korea’s birth rate, a very low 0.78 children per woman, is expected to fall further. Out of the Group of Seven (G7) nations, only France boasts a higher rate than the United States, at around 1.79 children per woman. However, the French rate — which is falling, like that of every other nation mentioned above — is still not enough to stabilize the population (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Aa95Gjs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the United States, along with many developed countries, is aging (Figure 3). The proportion of the U.S. population over 65 increased at the fastest rate ever between 2010 and 2020. In 2020, one in six people in the United States was 65 or older. The median age in the United States increased from 37.2 years in 2010 to 38.4 years in 2019 — a trend that shows no signs of slowing, driven by aging baby boomers. Dr. Luke Rogers, chief of the Census Bureau’s Population Estimates Branch, highlighted the fact that no other age group witnessed a significant increase alongside the 65-and-older age group. In fact, the 18-and-below age group was smaller in 2019 than in 2010. Working-age adults, by nature of their role in society, produce more than they consume and serve as a source of financial support to the nonworking population, chiefly through tax contributions to public transfer programs, as well as direct private transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate at which the U.S. population is aging is also outpacing the growth of the working-age population, posing a significant threat to the economic future of the United States. The U.S. dependency ratio, which is the ratio of Americans under 15 or over 65 to the working population, reveals this issue clearly. In 2010, the U.S. dependency ratio sat at 49, meaning that there were 49 dependents for every 100 working-age Americans. By 2019, the ratio grew to 53.7 dependents per 100 working-age Americans, driven by the growth in the 65-and-older population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shrinking workforce as a proportion of the population will pose significant problems for the U.S. economy if these concerns are not addressed promptly to ensure existing labor shortages do not continue to grow and that future shortages are addressed preemptively. The reality is that the productive segments of the population — namely, the workforce — contribute most significantly to the economy through their labor, consumption, and contribution to public services through taxation. In comparison, the labor force participation rate for those over 65 was only 24.5 percent in September 2024 due to the high number of retirees. Moreover, retirees do not contribute income taxes while simultaneously consuming less and being a greater burden on public services. Effectively addressing the impacts of an aging workforce depends on using immigration to ameliorate labor shortages, sustain U.S. economic growth, and improve the affordability of critical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-labor-market&quot;&gt;The U.S. Labor Market&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, tightness in the U.S. labor market could be seen across economic indicators, with an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent and only 1.861 million people collecting unemployment in late September 2024 (Figure 3). At the same time, data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), indicated that there were 8.04 million open jobs in August 2024, meaning that there were almost 6.2 million more open jobs than people collecting unemployment (Figure 4). Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, that figure would have been an all-time record. The high number of open jobs in the wake of the pandemic may be attributed to the fiscal and monetary policy stimulus response to Covid-19. But now that four years have passed since the beginning of the pandemic, the high number of open jobs may be an ongoing risk for the labor market, especially since many open jobs are in physically demanding in-person roles. Meanwhile, the number of people collecting unemployment represents only around 1.1 percent of the labor force — one of the lowest percentages in U.S. history (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tightness in the labor market is most pronounced for roles that are physically demanding and require an in-person presence to fulfill the job’s core functions. In other words, whereas many analysts, consultants, and knowledge workers can do their jobs remotely, this is not true for professions that require hands-on activities. Four industries at the top of this list are construction, healthcare, childcare, and food production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reveal some of the economic potential that a lack of labor hinders, the following case studies explore four physically demanding in-person roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;Construction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite high interest and mortgage rates, there are massive unmet labor market needs in construction. In August 2024, there were 370,000 open construction jobs, according to JOLTS data (Figure 6). But why is construction so hot with such a high cost of capital, and what is the outlook when interest rates fall?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ibRuCvX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: U.S. Construction Job Openings, 2000–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTS2300JOL&quot;&gt;“Job Openings: Construction,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far more job openings are expected in the construction field in the aftermath of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The IIJA is one of the largest investments in infrastructure in the history of the United States, but job shortages have hindered progress for many IIJA projects. A 2022 survey of major companies involved in these projects showed that 91 percent of construction firms were struggling to fill open positions that conduct much of the on-site construction, especially in manual craftwork labor. With expectations that the IIJA will create 175,000 new construction jobs per year, immigration can help address some of this shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The untapped potential in construction stems from broad strength across the U.S. labor force. There are more Americans on nonfarm payrolls than ever before, and wages rose by almost $7 per hour between February 2020 and September 2024. Overall, there are more workers on payrolls today than in the history of the United States, and they are making more money than ever before (Figure 7). But high mortgage rates and limited housing options have caused rents to rise, adding inflationary pressures across the U.S. economy and keeping year-on-year consumer price index (CPI) inflation rates elevated. This presents a challenge for the Federal Reserve as it seeks to restore an environment of low, stable prices for reducing interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uHNYaEK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second quarter of 2024, the rental vacancy rate was only 6.6 percent (Figure 8). Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, a lower vacancy rate had not been seen since the second quarter of 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9LpGXcD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a tight U.S. rental market, sales of existing homes were sluggish in 2023 and the first half of 2024 as new housing starts remained relatively low. As a result, home prices have continued to rise. Plus, interest rates are at the highest levels in decades. With the prospect of lower interest rates and mortgage rates over the next couple of years, housing demand and associated sticker prices could rise even further — a situation greatly exacerbated by an already tight construction labor market that could experience tremendous and rapid growth in labor demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the owner’s equivalent rent component of the CPI is about 25 percent of the total CPI and about 33 percent of the core CPI, ensuring sufficient construction labor to meet needs within the U.S. economy is critical for mitigating inflationary pressures across the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;healthcare&quot;&gt;Healthcare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations of labor market shortfalls in healthcare have existed for some time, but demographic shifts of an aging population in the United States are exacerbating already severe shortfalls in the healthcare field. For many years, the BLS has forecasted that healthcare fields will see some of the greatest labor market growth the past ten years. But with an extremely tight labor market as a backdrop, the challenge of filling those roles is greater than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook from Fall 2024 reflects that 5 of the top 10 projected fastest-growing occupations between 2023 and 2033 are in healthcare, including nurse practitioners (no. 3), medical and health service managers (no. 6), epidemiologists (no. 20), physical therapy assistants (no. 9), and occupational therapy assistants (no. 11). Also among the top 20 occupations are home health and personal care aides (no. 14) and substance abuse, behavioral disorder, and mental health counselors (no. 19).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, there were 1,394,000 openings in healthcare and social assistance (Figure 9). This figure alone almost eclipses the 1.861 million people the U.S. Department of Labor reported were collecting unemployment benefits in late September 2024. U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy has highlighted that this shortage is expected to increase over time to around 3 million low-wage healthcare workers by 2027 and 140,000 physicians by 2033.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0eNQzsZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 9: U.S. Healthcare and Social Assistance Job Openings, 2000–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTU6200JOL&quot;&gt;“Job Openings: Health Care and Social Assistance,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The healthcare worker shortage is unlikely to subside without intervention. As it stands, the number of U.S. medical students is insufficient to address the shortage despite increased applications and enrollment in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. One in five physicians in the United States is foreign born and educated, representing a 30 percent increase since 2004. The significant lack of funding for residencies further contributes to the difficulty in training enough physicians to address the shortage. The final element is that the demographic shift within the United States and the aging population will only increase demand for healthcare over time, with no end to the shortage in sight, barring a concerted effort to address it. Immigration for low-wage healthcare workers and physicians could help alleviate these issues, improving access to healthcare while medical education reform takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aging U.S. population and labor market shortfalls in healthcare are translating into increased inflationary pressures and costs for U.S. consumers, which can be seen in the CPI. The base years for the U.S. CPI are 1982–84. The total basket of goods for consumers rose as an index from 100 in 1982–84 to almost 315 in September 2024 (Figure 10). However, while all consumer prices have tripled since the early 1980 base years, the medical care cost index has risen from 100 to almost 566 — a more than fivefold increase in costs (Figure 10). With generational churn and a higher proportion of elderly residents, the costs for medical care are at risk of rising further and will be exacerbated by ongoing and potentially worsening shortfalls in the healthcare professions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/W9Dozad.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transportation&quot;&gt;Transportation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transportation is a key sector both inside and outside U.S. cities. Workers in this sector transport people or cargo by land, air, sea, pipeline, or rail. A labor shortage in this sector fundamentally hurts U.S. growth through negative impacts on urban public transport, on the consistency of just-in-time inventory supply chains, and even on U.S. capacity to export or import. As a by-product, labor shortages also affect the accessibility of goods for consumers, especially in rural and inland areas of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transportation has been linked quite closely with economic performance, as shown in past research by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The Transportation Services Index (TSI) measures monthly freight and passenger transportation services, with proof that movement on the freight TSI usually occurs prior to changes in the economy. Similarly, GDP and freight TSI tend to move simultaneously to varying magnitudes, again cementing the importance of transportation to the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a broader level, JOLTS data in the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sectors show 359,000 job openings in August 2024 (Figure 11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sp8wsyx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11: U.S. Transportation, Warehousing, and Utilities Job Openings, 2000–2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTU480099JOL&quot;&gt;“Job Openings: Transportation, Warehousing, and Utilities,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the transportation workforce is aging, with 24.3 percent of all transportation workers aged 55 or older, compared to an average of 23.2 percent across all industries. Certain modes of transportation show more alarming signs of aging, with the percentage of workers aged 55 or older at 30.8 percent for water transport, 27.9 percent for trucking, and 27.8 percent for air transport. Transit workers are also aging rapidly, with 37.9 percent aged 55 or older. All these transportation modes are aging faster than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For transportation as a whole, the most alarming aspect of the aging workforce is the severe lack of younger workers to replace those who are aging. As it stands across the entire sector, only 12.7 percent of all workers are aged 16–24, with some modes, such as transit, having only 2 percent of workers aged 16–24. These signs cumulatively point to an existing labor shortage, which will only increase in severity as the workforce continues to age. Crucially, as many transportation workers near retirement age without younger workers to replace them, the sector will struggle with vacancies in the short term, exacerbating the labor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, an estimated 1.3 million jobs will need to be filled every year in the transportation sector between 2021 and 2026. Currently, immigrants play a key role in transportation, providing essential services to U.S. citizens and making up an estimated 20.6 percent of the transportation workforce. Providing more pathways to legal immigration to address labor shortages in the transportation industry can play a role in maintaining the affordability of both goods and transportation services. In 2023, a survey conducted by the American Transportation Research Institute showed that motor carriers’ second-largest concern was driver shortages, which has been high on the list of concerns for several years, topping it in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IIJA also holds some potential for transportation job creation with the construction of new railways and roads. Naturally, transportation workers are needed to operate much of the infrastructure as well as support these projects during their construction. The IIJA estimates about 100,000 new jobs in transportation and material moving are created each year, outlining the need for novel solutions and immigration reform to address a shortage that will not decrease in the medium to long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall transportation CPI has been rising rapidly in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic across all modes of transportation, hitting directly at household finances. These higher costs drive up wholesale producer inflation across industries and sectors that rely on transportation, which eventually reach consumers, driving up consumer inflation. This is clear when considering the significant price increases in transportation services that have taken place in recent decades. The CPI for all items rose from an index of 100 in 1982–84 to almost 315 in September 2024. In the meantime, the index for transportation services rose to over 436 in September 2024, representing a fourfold increase from the index in 1982–84.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;agriculture-and-food-production&quot;&gt;Agriculture and Food Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has also suffered from acute labor shortages in the agriculture and food production industries, with archaic and restrictive immigration laws contributing to the shortage. Farms are struggling to fill an estimated 1.5–2 million positions per year. For example, 56 percent of California farmers stated that they were having difficulty filling jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These acute shortages reduce productivity, incentivize imports to replace decreasing domestic production, and hinder U.S. food security. Most importantly for the U.S. public, these labor shortages have a direct impact on grocery and food prices, with food inflation in 2022 reaching the highest levels since 1979. The imperative to modernize and expand the agricultural workforce through immigration reform becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of growth in crop production is also coinciding with more demand than ever for fresh fruits and vegetables, with growing shares being imported. This deficit has expanded significantly over the last two decades, as 42.7 percent of fresh fruit in 2019 was imported to the United States rather than produced domestically, compared to 20.1 percent in 2000. Vegetables show a similar deficit, as 13.3 percent were imported into the United States in 2000 compared to 31.9 percent in 2019. In large part, the main beneficiaries of decreasing U.S. farm productivity and increasing U.S. produce demand have been Mexico and Canada, which now dominate fresh produce and meat imports into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigrants already make up 73 percent of the total farming workforce in the United States, more than any other economic sector. As a result, the agriculture industry suffers disproportionately when legal immigration is significantly restricted. The lack of legal immigration leads farmers to a dilemma between accepting production cuts and crop losses or resorting to undocumented migrants. Due to the lack of legal migrant labor, an estimated 48 percent of the U.S. farming workforce consists of undocumented migrants, which signifies the unworkable nature of existing immigration laws for many within the agriculture sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant concern is the rise in the average age of the immigrant workforce in agriculture due to the lack of young immigrants joining the field to replace aging workers. Between 2006 and 2021, the immigrant farm workforce aged seven years, dragging up the average age of the agricultural workforce. In contrast, the average age of U.S.-born farmworkers remained constant over the same period. With immigrants making up the majority of farmworkers, not addressing this issue could exacerbate the labor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shortage extends beyond farms to other key junctions within the food supply chain. In 2020, immigrants made up 21 percent of the overall food industry workforce, excluding restaurants but including transportation, animal and crop production, retail, food production, and food wholesale. In certain key states, these levels are exacerbated. For instance, 65 percent of the agriculture workforce in California consists of immigrants. Alaska and Nebraska have similar figures in their seafood and meat processing industries, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The labor shortage then directly affects food prices, with prices already rising due to major supply chain disruptions resulting from Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one of the world’s major grain producers. In the United States, food prices increased by 11.2 percent between September 2021 and September 2022, in large part due to the aforementioned shocks, which increased agricultural commodity pricing, especially for corn and wheat. However, these price increases have not stopped, with around a 6 percent increase between 2022 and 2023. On a wider scale, between 2019 and 2023, food prices increased by around 25 percent due to Covid-19, the war in Ukraine, and immigration. A recent report by Texas A&amp;amp;M International University showed that increased immigrant worker admittance directly relates to lower prices for poultry, meat, eggs, dairy, fruits, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immigration-policys-role&quot;&gt;Immigration Policy’s Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-us-immigration-law-for-the-case-study-sectors&quot;&gt;Overview of U.S. Immigration Law for the Case Study Sectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the sectors included in this study would benefit in particular from H-2 (temporary worker) visa reform: transportation, construction, and agriculture. Seasonal demand plays a significant role in these sectors. By contrast, healthcare likely requires H-1B (skilled worker) visa reform, especially in the context of the impending physician shortage and the high-skilled nature of the healthcare industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H-2 visa category is split into H-2A (temporary agricultural worker) and H-2B (temporary nonagricultural worker) visas, which allow employers to apply for foreign nonimmigrant workers to satisfy seasonal demands. The H-2A visa operates independently with its own application process and allocation exclusively for the agricultural sector. While the H-2A program does not cap the number of visas allocated, often there are fewer visas than jobs certified by the Department of Labor for H-2A due to inadequate U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processing resources. Also, the strict country eligibility requirements have expanded over time, from 28 countries in 2008 to 87 countries in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fiscal year 2023, 372,000 jobs were certified for the H-2A visa, but USCIS issued only around 298,000 H-2A visas. The visas are highly concentrated within the farming industry, with 600 farms accounting for 70 percent of all H-2A jobs, highlighting issues that certain farm employers may have in certifying and applying for visas given USCIS’ shortcomings in issuing them effectively. Another H-2A issue is the high level of noncompliance with regulations among some farms, with the Department of Labor finding that 70 percent of the 1,000 farms investigated had failed to comply with regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H-2B visa, by contrast, can apply across many seasonal sectors, including restaurants, hospitality, transportation, maintenance, janitorial services, and more. However, there is a cap on the number of H-2B visas allocated. The H-2B visa had 88 eligible countries as of August 2024, one more than the number of H-2A countries. The cap is divided into 33,000 visas for each half of the fiscal year, totaling 66,000. Historically, demand has varied, with some years seeing demand below supply. However, recent years have seen demand exceed the supply of visas, with ad hoc measures being used to increase the cap for the current fiscal year. For example, in fiscal year 2024, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) increased the cap twice to meet demand, making 85,432 additional visas available and highlighting the insufficiency of the existing H-2B cap. The labor market has changed significantly since the H-2B visa cap was set in 1986, making it necessary to reconsider the sectors eligible for the visa and the size of the cap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of H-2A and H-2B visas can range from three to ten months for the initial employment term, with the possibility to extend the visa to three years. It is also possible to apply for an initial three-year period if the employment is considered a “one-time occurrence.” After three years, the worker must leave the United States for an uninterrupted three months before reapplying for an H-2 visa, which potentially causes issues for employers in finding temporary replacements or aggregating their workforce over periods to avoid worker shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The H-1B visa category has an annual cap of 65,000 new visas each fiscal year. However, an additional 20,000 petitions for individuals with a master’s degree or higher from a U.S. institution are exempt from this cap. The relevant applicant occupation eligibility criteria include theoretical and practical application of highly specialized knowledge and a minimum of a bachelor’s degree or higher in the specific field (or its equivalent). H-1B specialty occupation workers are granted an initial stay of up to three years. This period may be extended but generally cannot exceed a total of six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;role-of-immigration-in-us-economic-security&quot;&gt;Role of Immigration in U.S. Economic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial policy has emerged as a key tool in the U.S. arsenal to support economic growth and direct investments in industries key to national security. However, labor shortages could upend these investments’ ability to deploy manufacturing operations effectively. The IIJA, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the CHIPS and Science Act are all set to bolster U.S. economic security by targeting sectors essential to American life — infrastructure, green technologies, and semiconductors — and creating scores of open positions. A recent report from the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) analyzes labor supply, demand, and potential shortages stemming from recent U.S. industrial policy initiatives. The report identifies 48 occupations expected to see significant increases in demand due to direct job creation from these investments. Of these, 20 occupations are projected to experience labor shortages, leading to an anticipated overall shortage of nearly 1.1 million workers if the investments reach their full potential without a corresponding increase in the number of newly qualified workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Industrial policy has emerged as a key tool in the U.S. arsenal to support economic growth and direct investments in industries key to national security. However, labor shortages could upend these investments’ ability to deploy manufacturing operations effectively.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IIJA’s promise of renewed U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure could be resting on shaky ground. The construction sector is already facing challenges. A recent survey by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce revealed that 88 percent of commercial construction contractors are experiencing moderate-to-high levels of difficulty in finding skilled workers. Additionally, over one-third of the contractors surveyed had to decline work because of labor shortages. The Association of Builders and Contractors, a trade group representing the commercial and industrial construction sector, estimates there will be 500,000 unfilled construction jobs in 2024. According to Moody’s Analytics, the IIJA will result in 872,000 additional jobs by the fourth quarter of 2025. Notably, over half of these new positions (461,000) will be in the construction industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies targeting climate change in the IRA — such as tax credits for wind and solar power, investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and grants to reduce pollution in disadvantaged communities — will create 537,000 jobs annually over the next decade. When it comes to the CHIPS and Science Act, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) anticipates the semiconductor industry workforce will expand by nearly 115,000 jobs by 2030, increasing from around 345,000 jobs today to approximately 460,000 by the end of the decade, which reflects growth of 33 percent. However, SIA also estimates that about 67,000 of these new positions — or 58 percent of the projected job growth (and 80 percent of the projected increase in technical roles) — may go unfilled at current rates of degree completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. labor market is struggling to fill physically demanding in-person roles. Increased legal immigration with targeted labor market policies could help fill open roles that employers are struggling to fill. Without obtaining the labor required, the U.S. economy is unlikely to function at its full potential. Moreover, additional workers would likely reduce inflationary pressures while boosting corporate profits. In addition, while the U.S. labor market has cooled, critical economic sectors still face acute shortages that endanger key aspects of American life. Opening U.S. immigration pathways would mitigate these shortages and support the country’s economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase H-2A noncompliance costs and use funds to enhance USCIS processing capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The H-2A visa suffers from two contradicting problems. First, noncompliance rates are high, as 70 percent of farms investigated fail to comply with regulations. Secondly, USCIS fails to allocate the certified number of visas: only around 80 percent of certified visas were distributed in 2023. The second issue relates to USCIS staffing and capabilities. The agency simply does not have the means to process these necessary applications and faces increasingly worsening backlogs that threaten the integrity of the U.S. legal immigration system. The issue can be mitigated by allocating additional funding to the agency, which can be obtained, in part, by more robust noncompliance fines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease restrictions on extension and renewal processes for temporary worker visas.&lt;/strong&gt; The initial duration for both the H-2A and H-2B visas can vary from three to ten months, with the option to extend up to three years. In cases where the employment qualifies as a “one-time occurrence,” an initial three-year visa may be granted. After completing the three-year term, the worker must depart the United States for a continuous period of three months before they can reapply for an H-2 visa. The need to apply for an initial extension after three to ten months, as well as the significant barriers to renewal, renders the workforce landscape too volatile for employers in need of labor while reducing the attractiveness of applying to work in the United States for prospective employees. U.S. immigration authorities should explore doing away with the one-time-occurrence requirement to grant the initial three-year visa and lift current barriers on extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid imposing barriers to work opportunities for foreign students.&lt;/strong&gt; Between 2015 and 2020, a slew of tentative pieces of legislation and executive orders aimed to place extraordinary restrictions on the ability of foreign students to enter the U.S. workforce through H-1B visas, endangering multiple sectors’ ability to acquire workers, including healthcare. These measures include eliminating optional practical training (OPT) and requiring students to work outside the United States for a decade, imposing high salary thresholds for H-1B eligibility, and directing consular officers to consider the “Buy American and Hire American” executive order when deciding to grant a visa. In short, these measures are meant to break the link between international students and their ability to be employed in the United States after graduation. These kinds of measures exacerbate worker shortages in the U.S. economy, add undue volatility in key sectors, and ultimately upend Americans’ ability to find essential services such as medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As geopolitical tensions flare up and economic security concerns take center stage in policy considerations, Washington has striven to prop up sources of U.S. national strength. For instance, policymakers have embraced industrial policy to secure the nation’s energy landscape, public infrastructure, and advanced technology ecosystem. However, opening legal immigration pathways — historically a critical feature of U.S. competitiveness — has been ignored. Policymakers would do well to remember the parting words of President Ronald Reagan near the end of this term: “Unique among nations, we draw our people — our strength — from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, at a time when the U.S. economy badly needs additional workers in physically demanding in-person roles, politics have become increasingly hostile to the huddled masses who have historically enriched the United States. This report counters the argument that if more people enter the United States, fewer resources will be left for those already here. Immigrants create more benefits than costs while putting the country in a more globally competitive position. Lifting barriers to immigration would improve Americans’ ability to find affordable housing, medical care, and groceries and create the workforce needed both in the near term and in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every decade or so, countries are assessed on their technical compliance with the Recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing and on the effectiveness of the measures that they have put in place. The on-site visit for the UK’s next evaluation is scheduled for August 2027 and preparations will begin in earnest in 2025. While the UK has generally been regarded as having a robust legal and regulatory framework, FATF’s increasing focus on the effectiveness of a country in managing money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing risks means that technical compliance with the Recommendations alone is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s last evaluation, in 2018, was positive overall, however, some areas of significant weakness were identified. The UK has sought to address these over the last decade, but has it done enough? How will the UK fare when it comes to its effectiveness ratings? How will the changes in methodology for this round of evaluations impact the assessment of the UK? What about new areas, such as the FATF’s recommendations on virtual assets and the strengthening of its recommendations on asset recovery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help answer these questions, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI has established a UK FATF Taskforce, bringing together a small group of experts to explore these areas and provide practical recommendations on how the UK can best prepare for its upcoming evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce held its first meeting in October 2024. The discussion was divided into two parts. First, Taskforce members reflected on the UK’s 2018 mutual evaluation, some of the areas of weakness that were identified, and the extent to which progress had been made by the UK in the intervening years. Second, the group discussed some of the major global challenges over the last decade and what impact those could potentially have on the UK’s evaluation. Given the overlap between these two areas, this report sets out the themes that emerged during the Taskforce meeting, rather than being a narrative description of the points raised by participants. While there was some discussion about changes to some of the technical requirements of FATF’s Recommendations, such as the standards on virtual assets, this will be covered in more detail in the second Taskforce meeting. Although the Taskforce’s remit focuses on the UK’s fifth round evaluation, many of the points raised will be relevant for other jurisdictions as they contemplate their next mutual evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-direction-of-travel-since-2018&quot;&gt;The Direction of Travel since 2018&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was broad consensus in the group that the UK’s 2018 mutual evaluation was better than could have been expected and, for some, better than the UK deserved. The months of hard work and organisation in the lead-up to the evaluation enabled the UK to present a coherent and persuasive narrative to the assessors. This was rewarded with the headline that the “UK takes top spot in fight against dirty money” and much was made of the UK’s, at the time, world-leading ranking in compliance with the FATF standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Taskforce did not doubt the UK government’s continued public commitment to tackling financial crime: participants pointed to the two Economic Crime Plans that previous governments had issued; legislative changes, including much-needed reforms to Companies House; and increased investment in the UK’s response, for example through the Economic Crime Levy. This, together with the UK’s global lead in the response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, suggests that the UK will again have the basis from which to craft a strong narrative to the assessors in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it is clear that there are a number of potential pitfalls for the UK. These can be broadly grouped into two themes. First, participants discussed the overall application of the risk-based approach in the UK, from the National Risk Assessment (NRA) to risk-based supervision and the application of risk-based preventative measures. Second, participants identified specific areas where they felt that there had been little progress since the 2018 mutual evaluation, including enforcement, the role of the financial intelligence unit (FIU), and public–private partnerships (PPPs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-changing-global-context&quot;&gt;The Changing Global Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants acknowledged the significant global changes and challenges over the decade since the UK’s last evaluation. Of these, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has had the most impact on the UK’s response to illicit finance. The design, implementation and enforcement of sanctions against Russia have dominated the work of policymakers, regulators and regulated institutions. While acknowledging the point made above, that the UK’s response to the invasion of Ukraine may feed into a positive narrative for the evaluation, some Taskforce members felt that the increased focus on sanctions implementation had hindered the ability of the UK to make progress on anti-money laundering (AML) and counterterrorist financing (CTF), particularly in the application of the risk-based approach by supervisors and institutions. This is primarily because of the resources – at both levels – that have had to pivot towards compliance with sanctions regulations rather than AML/CTF, but also because of the difference in the type of regime, one being risk-based and the other being more rules-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the post-2022 sanctions on Russia was also felt to have had a similar knock-on impact on resourcing of law enforcement, with efforts directed towards kleptocracy and sanctions evasion rather than areas like international corruption. From a purely technical perspective, only targeted financial sanctions under the UN’s sanctions regime are within scope of the FATF (that is, sanctions associated with proliferation financing activity). Therefore, Russia sanctions, or indeed other autonomous sanctions regimes, are outside the scope of the FATF’s assessments, and robust and effective implementation of these type of sanctions does not necessarily buy you any credit with the FATF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the full-scale invasion of Ukraine may have dominated the past few years, there have been other developments which have had an impact on the application of AML/CTF controls, such as regulatory changes in the UK. The consumer duty requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) were given as one example of this, where there needs to be a balance between effective measures to prevent financial crime and good outcomes for consumers, recognising that these two principles can, occasionally, come into conflict. While banks and others have had to manage the implementation of multiple new sanctions, the significant global attention on the issue of fraud has also demanded much of their time and attention, further “squeezing” the available time and resourcing for tackling AML/CTF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-understanding-of-the-risks-to-which-it-is-exposed&quot;&gt;The UK’s Understanding of the Risks to which it is Exposed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FATF’s assessment of effectiveness of the risk-based approach, as set out in its Immediate Outcome 1 (IO1), requires that countries not only understand their risks, but also take action to combat those risks where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all participants felt that there was poor and inconsistent understanding of the UK’s risks at all levels, particularly in terms of the UK’s role as one of the world’s most significant global financial centres. The UK’s NRA, last published in 2020, was given as an example of this, being described as somewhat haphazard and of limited use to its target audience. The UK’s approach to identifying risk was also seen as very much reactive rather than proactive and, while noting the size and complexity of the UK’s exposure to financial crime risks, it was felt that other jurisdictions prioritised keeping their understanding of risks and threats up to date and sharing that information on a timely basis with supervisors and regulated institutions to inform the application of the risk-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also felt, however, that the 2018 mutual evaluation itself did not acknowledge the scale and extent of the threats facing the UK, leading to what many felt was a more positive outcome than the UK deserved and/or that assessors may not have focused enough on some of the higher-risk areas, including the overarching risks associated with the UK’s role as a global financial centre. This is a topic that will be discussed further in the second Taskforce meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;risk-based-supervision&quot;&gt;Risk-based Supervision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of effective and risk-based AML/CTF supervision in the UK formed a significant part of the Taskforce’s discussions. Participants felt that the lack of a coherent and robust understanding of risks extended beyond the NRA, to include supervisors and regulated institutions as well. This was discussed particularly in the context of risk-based supervision. For example, some participants expressed the view that the FCA’s supervision of financial institutions was too focused on the systemically important banks, rather than on other parts of the financial system that may present significant vulnerabilities, such as new entrants to the market who may have poor AML/CTF controls and expose the UK to higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was felt that supervisors may not have the confidence to apply a truly risk-based approach to supervision, the proper application of which would require supervisors to deprioritise areas, whether industry sectors or specific services and products. The FCA, and indeed other supervisors, may not be willing to do this or to be seen to be doing this. Linked to this point, and maybe a consequence of it, some Taskforce members felt that the FCA had recently been moving away from a risk-based approach to supervision and towards more of a formal and technical approach, driven by a large number of data requests to firms (not limited to AML/CTF but also extending to sanctions and fraud). As a result of this, regulated entities may not be encouraged to take a risk-based approach to preventative measures. This, in turn, can lead to unintended consequences, such as de-risking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the discussion focused on AML/CTF supervision of the financial sector, participants also acknowledged broader issues with supervision in other sectors, particularly supervision by the Professional Body Supervisors (PBSs) responsible for the legal and accountancy sectors. Improvements were introduced after the mixed assessment in the 2018 evaluation, with the establishment of the Office for Professional Body Anti-Money Laundering Supervisors (OPBAS). This was intended to bring consistency and drive improvement in standards of supervision across the 22 legal and accountancy PBSs. While participants acknowledged the positive impact of OPBAS to date, it was still felt that there were weaknesses in the performance of some of the PBSs, as evidenced by recent publications from OPBAS itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the government consulted on reforms to the structure of supervision in the UK and, in particular, on the extent to which there should be consolidation of the PBSs and the statutory supervisors in order to improve the effectiveness of the UK’s regime. The timing of the government’s consultation means that it is likely that the UK will be in some sort of transition phase by the time of the next mutual evaluation, at least as it relates to the supervision of the professional services. As a result, the UK may struggle to evidence the required level of effectiveness in supervisory outcomes to the FATF assessors, and consideration needs to be given to what type of data can be provided to assessors while the system is in a state of flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the methodology changes for the fifth round of evaluations will be a focus for the next Taskforce meeting, specific changes to the IOs relating to supervision (IO3 and IO4) were also raised as part of the discussion. The previous assessment methodology (which the UK was assessed under in 2018) combined the assessment of supervision of financial institutions and non-financial institutions into one IO (IO3). The UK was rated as only being moderately effective in relation to this IO in 2018, although it is not significantly out of step with its international peers; no country received the top rating (“highly effective”) and only a handful received a rating of “substantially effective”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the new methodology that will be used in 2027, countries will receive separate ratings for the effectiveness of supervision in the financial (IO3) and non-financial sectors (IO4). However, the reformulated IO3 and IO4 will extend beyond just considering the effectiveness of supervision to include the effectiveness of the preventative measures put into place by regulated entities.12 These changes may have a number of implications for the UK’s assessment. First, the lack of progress on addressing the weaknesses that the FATF assessors identified on supervision of the legal and accountancy sectors in 2018 may be more clearly called out now that it is considered as its own separate IO. On the other hand,Under the new methodology that will be used in 2027, countries will receive separate ratings for the effectiveness of supervision in the financial (IO3) and non-financial sectors (IO4). However, the reformulated IO3 and IO4 will extend beyond just considering the effectiveness of supervision to include the effectiveness of the preventative measures put into place by regulated entities. These changes may have a number of implications for the UK’s assessment. First, the lack of progress on addressing the weaknesses that the FATF assessors identified on supervision of the legal and accountancy sectors in 2018 may be more clearly called out now that it is considered as its own separate IO. On the other hand, combining the assessment of effectiveness to include both supervision and preventative measures into one score may mean that deficiencies in supervision will be ignored and/or negated by a more positive relative assessment of preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-areas-of-concern&quot;&gt;Three Areas of Concern&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reflecting on the 2018 evaluation and looking ahead to the next evaluation, participants raised three further areas of concern: enforcement; the role of the UK FIU; and the UK’s approach to PPPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enforcement&quot;&gt;Enforcement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the UK was described in 2018 as “routinely and aggressively” investigating and prosecuting money laundering, the assessors did highlight that it was not clear whether the level of prosecutions and convictions in relation to high-end money laundering were consistent with the UK’s risks. Taskforce members felt that enforcement in this area continued to be a challenge for the UK, pointing to the lack of standalone money laundering prosecutions. Participants felt that there remains a lack of skills, expertise and/or resources for law enforcement to investigate high-value cases, including cases of trade-based money laundering. These, however, are the types of cases that the FATF assessors should expect to see the UK authorities prosecuting, especially given the threats to which the UK is exposed and the size and complexity of its financial services sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-the-fiu&quot;&gt;The Role of the FIU&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2018 mutual evaluation, the UK’s FIU was singled out for criticism by the assessors. The 2018 report states that “the UKFIU suffers from a lack of available resources (human and IT) and analytical capability which is a serious concern considering similar issues were raised over a decade ago in the UK’s previous FATF mutual evaluation”. Taskforce members felt that little had changed with regards to the UK FIU since the last evaluation; a concern, given the comments in the 2018 evaluation about how longstanding the issues were at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the finding in 2018, a number of Taskforce members highlighted that the UK FIU is not well regarded overseas, with delays in responding to requests for information and a lack of effective data sharing. While this is, in part, reflective of broader issues with cross-border information sharing, it is a weakness identified by the previous evaluation that does not seem to have been addressed by the UK to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-uks-approach-to-ppps&quot;&gt;The UK’s Approach to PPPs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2018 evaluation, the UK’s PPP, the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT) was described as “an innovative model for public/private information sharing that has generated very positive results since its inception in 2015 and is considered to be an example of best practice”. While this could be fairly said in 2018, members of the Taskforce felt that other countries had managed to accelerate progress of their own PPPs, whereas JMLIT was felt to have stalled in comparison. While the lack of progress in JMLIT may not necessarily count against the UK in its assessment, it was felt that the UK was unlikely to get any continued credit for its efforts in PPPs and that this could harm the narrative of the UK as a world leader in tackling financial crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants generally felt that the UK would perform well in its next mutual evaluation, not least because of the ability of the machinery of the UK government to spring into action, but that it would be challenging to receive as glowing an evaluation as in 2018. A broader point was made that the dynamic of the discussion between a country’s delegation and the assessment team can influence the outcome of the evaluation. The likelihood of the UK repeating its success of 2018 could well be determined, therefore, by the makeup and experience of the assessment team. However, a well-organised and thorough approach by the UK authorities would also likely mean that the UK performs well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second meeting of the Taskforce is planned for spring 2025 to discuss the FATF’s new methodology for the fifth round of assessments and how the UK might fare under the revised criteria, including the implementation of the FATF standards in relation to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, and the progress the UK has made as it relates to areas of the FATF’s recent priorities, such as asset recovery and non-profit organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英：倘真相煽動他人憎恨政府 依然會報導 不認為構成罪行&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uYHl7q5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第96日審訊，黎智英第四日作供。2020年5月《蘋果》推英文版新聞，同案被告張劍虹和楊清奇曾供稱黎希望透過英文版讓美國人了解香港情況、「希望美國政府採取更強硬嘅措施」，例如制裁或敵對行動。黎則否認，因「制裁」和「敵對行動」均是他很少使用的詞語。此外，張劍虹稱黎一直以來下達的編採指示包括報導關於美國制裁、抗爭和示威的新聞，黎則反駁稱自己從沒談及制裁，「所以他虛構證供。（“… so he made it up.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方一度問黎，若然報導真相會煽動市民憎恨政府，是否仍會報導？黎表示會，因為這是真相；他稱不認為會構成罪行，又指：「如果這是罪行的話，我們當時便不會報導，我們所做的只是合法地報導。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英南華早報忽視中國的負面新聞&quot;&gt;黎智英：《南華早報》忽視中國的負面新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭繼續圍繞《蘋果》英文版提問。他播放一段2020年5月13日的錄音，當中黎提議選取一些中國大陸新聞和文章，當黎提及「反對派」時，一把男聲補充說：「維權人士」，黎認同並舉例指被囚18年的企業家任志強、大學教授或《方方日記》等，「每日好似花絮咁，譯一段嘢」，使英文版成為「一個 alternative to (South China) Morning Post，關於大陸嘅新聞」，又形容《南華早報》的新聞是「大宣傳」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示2020年5月10日的「English news」群組訊息，黎稱：「我們揀選寫手時，我們不需要向外國人平衡這裡的不同顏色的政見，我們只需要集中在《蘋果》的香港觀點和黃營的普遍觀點。」（“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side.”）黎又指：「我們不是要嘗試平衡報導，而是要報導保護香港一方的觀點。這是世界需要知道的聲音。」（“We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，《蘋果》英文版是有限的，每天只有約20篇新聞，正如他早前提及的「鳥籠」，每間傳媒都有一套價值觀，在報導新聞時確保與相關價值觀一致，並要知道自己想要的是什麼，在選材時找一些符合自己價值觀的新聞。辯方問《蘋果》英文版會否報導中國的好消息？黎說不會。辯方接著問誰會報導中國的好消息？黎說《南華早報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於訊息中「保護香港一方的觀點」（“the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK”），黎指可理解為「黃營」，而相反一方可理解為「藍營」，即支持政府或支持中國的人。法官李素蘭聞言問，是否代表「黃營」即是「反政府」和「反中國」？黎雖然同意，但是他表示自己不會形容「黃營」為「反政府」和「反中國」，反而會形容為「對政府和中國較具批判性」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於訊息中「這是世界需要知道的聲音」，黎解釋這樣說是因為疫情令全世界對中國有負面印象，英文版的新聞可以保護他們、使他們免於受到中國所帶來的危險，包括病毒。黎智英又指，《南華早報》忽視很多中國的負面新聞，例如有關經濟發展的負面數據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息稱冀英文版成為我們與美國政治的槓桿-黎稱冀外國讀者能替香港發聲&quot;&gt;訊息稱冀英文版「成為我們與美國政治的槓桿」 黎稱冀外國讀者能替香港發聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後在英文版群組中稱：「請努力量（盡）快推動這事，現在很多美國大媒體要訪問我是想撐我哋，是時候走向美國讀者，讓他們的存在成為我們與美國政治的槓桿，是很大支持柱樑。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，如果外國的讀者閱讀《蘋果》英文版的話，便會為香港發聲，他認為屆時外國政客會聆聽相關聲音。被問到為何認為外國支持是重要，黎指因為在香港裡他們沒有任何支持，而外國社會和外國讀者的支持是他們僅有的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到支持香港什麼，黎指是支持香港的爭取自由和民主運動。辯方接著問，反修例運動有否獲得外國的支持？黎起初稱「沒有，從不」，但是其後修正說法，指在2019年4月運動醞釀期間，外國透過新聞報導及有西方政治人物為香港發聲來支持運動，包括美國和英國的政治人物和組織。法官李運騰問IPAC（「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」，英文：Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China）是否其中之一。黎則表示：「我從未得知 IPAC 的存在」，後來才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾構思邀美副總統彭斯訂閱英文版-惟最終不成功&quot;&gt;黎曾構思邀美副總統彭斯訂閱英文版 惟最終不成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎於2020年5月10日傳送給 Mark Simon 的訊息：「Imaging if we can get Mike Pence to subscribe to Apple Daily app! The publicity and respect it command would arouse much support for us. I know it’s almost impossible to pull it off. But can try?」（「試想像若果我們能使彭斯訂閱蘋果，相關宣傳和尊重會為我們帶來很多支持。我知道這是幾乎沒可能，但可以一試？」）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今解釋，如果美國副總統訂閱《蘋果》英文版的話，其聲望可以使更加多人關注《蘋果》，但他亦補充，他在訊息裡表示這是幾乎不可能，純粹嘗試。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，兩日後 Mark Simon 回覆。黎確認，指這個嘗試最終不成功，因為美國的保安政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認曾向張劍虹和楊清奇談及制裁或敵對行動-因很少使用相關字眼&quot;&gt;黎否認曾向張劍虹和楊清奇談及制裁或敵對行動 因很少使用相關字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果》主筆兼論壇版主管楊清奇早前證供稱，2020年5月曾到黎的住宅出席飯局，黎在席上稱希望開設《蘋果》英文版，幫助美國人更加了解香港情況，「希望美國政府採取更強硬嘅措施，咁《蘋果》英文版有多啲呢啲內容，咁美國政府就可以做嘢。」當被問到相關行動是什麼時，楊稱：「當時講得最多係制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上表示，「我不記得有否講過這些說話，但是有可能我講過類似的說話。」黎亦稱，他不會知道美國政府會採取什麼行動或措施，因他不是美國政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，張劍虹早前作供稱，黎於2020年5月指示他們發起「一人一信救香港」，希望時任美國總統特朗普施壓，阻止港區國安法通過，例如透過採取敵對行動。當控方追問敵對行動是什麼時，張稱：「啫係黎生講嘅 sanction 或其他敵對行動」，並堅稱黎的確有使用「制裁」一字，但不記得是用中文還是英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上表示：「我不知道為何我會這樣跟他說話，因為沒有任何理由我會這樣跟他說話。」他堅稱自己沒有明確談及敵對行動（hostility），「因為敵對行動是一個我很少使用的詞語。」同樣，他亦稱甚少使用「制裁」一詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意若報導真相會煽動憎恨政府依然報導&quot;&gt;黎同意若報導真相會煽動憎恨政府依然報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，《蘋果》英文版於2020年5月31日正式面世，創刊宣傳提到港版國安法已成定局，英文版旨在維護新聞自由和報導真相，並包含標語：「一日一《蘋果》，假新聞遠離我（an Apple a day keeps the fake news away）」，黎表示文章非出自其手筆，但是他同意文章內容，正如《蘋果》1995年創刊時的口號：「一日一蘋果，無人呃到我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，若然報導真相會煽動市民憎恨政府，是否仍會報導？黎表示會，因為這是真相。辯方接著問，黎當時知不知道這可以構成罪行。黎不認為會構成罪行，又指：「如果這是罪行的話，我們當時便不會報導，我們所做的只是合法地報導。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎提議運用大數據-因可以更客觀地反映中國的真實面貌&quot;&gt;黎提議運用大數據 因可以更客觀地反映中國的真實面貌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示 WhatsApp 群組「Index」對話，群組成員只有黎、張劍虹和筆名盧峯的馮偉光。2020年7月10日紀錄顯示，黎智英談及坊間有關中國大陸的說法不正確、有很多誇大了的負面報導，《蘋果》可以透過大數據去找出問題，讓數據說話，並澄清事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，有的對於中國的報導較負面，只抽取負面一面來放大，他認為大數據可以更客觀地反映中國的真實面貌，又指人們不僅僅對於新聞有興趣，對於例如日常生活、娛樂等資訊，這些均能夠反映中國的面貌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續指，運用大數據可以達至新聞的客觀性，他曾嘗試找專家實行大數據分析，但是未等到分析結果，他便於8月被捕，並且基於技術原因，大數據分析結果最終沒有出爐。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認下達指示報導制裁新聞-質疑張劍虹捏造證供&quot;&gt;黎否認下達指示報導制裁新聞 質疑張劍虹捏造證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，2020年8月8日黎智英向群組說：「劍虹，盧峯，我們新聞數目太少，沒有 critical mass（群聚效應）吸引讀者，應想想辦法增加。或可增加一些財經新聞？但時事新聞肯（定）要增加。謝謝。」馮偉光回覆：「明白，正逐步增加，有重大新聞如美國制裁林鄭會即時增加幾條。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，從馮的回覆可見，群組有否共識在增加新聞時，包含關於制裁的新聞？黎則重申，他從沒提及制裁，只有提及群聚效應（critical mass），並說英文新聞不夠，需要擴張英文版規模，而他相信馮只是舉例指出已增加了新聞數量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張劍虹稱黎一直以來下達的編採指示包括報導關於美國制裁、抗爭和示威的新聞，黎則反駁稱自己從沒談及制裁，「所以他虛構證供。（“… so he made it up.”）」辯方展示2020年8月26日的訊息，黎在群組中傳送有關拜登的新聞，向馮偉光表示不認為英文版要包含國際新聞，因其他媒體也會報導，而《蘋果》英文版應集中在中國內地的新聞。馮偉光其後表示，會即日起停止報導國際新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎自言不懂用twitter-李兆富負責管理發推文和追蹤其他帳戶-包括特朗普&quot;&gt;黎自言不懂用Twitter 李兆富負責管理、發推文和追蹤其他帳戶 包括特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年5月開設個人 Twitter（現稱X）帳戶，並於5月22日發布首個推文。黎指該 Twitter 帳戶是由李兆富（筆名利世民）管理。辯方遂展示李的薪金紀錄，黎確認李當時的職位是集團行政總裁助理（Assistant to Group CEO）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎會怎樣形容自己與李之間的關係，黎指：「他幾乎就像我的徒弟（mentee），我們互相認識很久。」黎稱，早在2014年之前，李開始替《蘋果》撰寫專欄文章時，他們便互相認識。黎並指，李是信奉自由市場的經濟學者，二人開始討論事情，而李後來變成好像他的徒弟般。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，李會替黎選材和發布推文，因他自己不懂使用 Twitter；李亦會根據自己的個人判斷而替黎的帳戶追蹤其他帳戶。黎相信其帳戶之所以追蹤時任美國總統特朗普，也是因為李的緣故，因為他自己不懂如何追蹤其他帳戶。被問到是否知道自己的帳戶追蹤了誰，黎則稱不知道，因有太多人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，李追蹤其他帳戶之前須否得到黎的批准。黎則指起初須要得到他的批准，但是因為信任李，所以後來李自行處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指從訊息紀錄可見，開設 Twitter 的意念是由其私人助手 Mark Simon 提議。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認開設twitter為了增加個人影響力&quot;&gt;黎否認開設Twitter為了增加個人影響力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇早前證供提到，黎在飯局中稱有意設立 Twitter 帳戶，籲在座人士提供新聞和評論，供他在 Twitter 發表，「佢希望通過呢個社交媒體，擴大佢嘅影響力，擴大《蘋果日報》嘅影響力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今庭上指，他開設 Twitter 帳戶的目的，是讓更多人更容易地知道香港發生什麼事，並跟進香港的情況。辯方問黎有否想過為了增加個人影響力。黎則否認，指開設 Twitter 帳戶不是為了增加個人影響力，而是想讓人們知道香港最新情況。他又表示：「我沒有想過個人影響力，我並不是那種專橫（presumptuous）的人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於控方案情指稱黎開設 Twitter 是為了增加個人在國際上的影響力，黎則重申：「我從沒考慮過自己的影響力，因為這是專橫的（presumptuous）。」他又表示，甚至到現在他也沒有這種想法，「我只是嘗試告知人們發生了什麼事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，黎又是否想透過 Twitter 來增加《蘋果》的影響力？黎則指：「這是我的個人 Twitter，我不知道為什麼這與《蘋果》有任何關係。」黎並確認《蘋果》有自己的 Twitter 帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎的 Twitter 截圖，顯示 IPAC 裴倫德和「重光團隊」（SWHK）的帳戶在黎的推文下留言。黎則表示沒有留意留言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與李兆富之間的訊息，顯示黎把草擬的推文傳送給李，然後李修改了一些字眼，但意思維持不變，或者李提出修改建議。黎確認，又指最終發布的推文中的標籤（hashtag），是由李加上的，「因為我不懂怎麼加 hashtag。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認在slack討論編採指示&quot;&gt;黎否認在Slack討論編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著就「飯盒會」提問。控方案情指稱黎透過舉行「飯盒會」，向《蘋果》管理層下達編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎早前證供提到，他在2014年辭去壹傳媒集團主席並退休，但是因為集團業績倒退，故他在2018年重返集團工作。黎形容當時公司士氣低落，因為公司業務正在衰退，很多員工害怕公司會倒閉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與時任動新聞平台總監張志偉的訊息紀錄，黎確認當時張進行一個內部問卷調查，旨在尋求改善《蘋果》動新聞影片的質素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示訊息紀錄，顯示黎與員工商討舉行「飯盒會」的時間和地點。黎確認首次「飯盒會」是在2018年8月舉行，出席的人士均是公司中高層員工，包括張劍虹、陳沛敏等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，張劍虹證供指稱黎會在通訊軟件 Slack 群組中發布編採指示。惟黎則在庭上否認，並稱從來沒有在 Slack 討論編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方在庭上展示《蘋果》員工的 Slack 群組紀錄截圖，並要求黎按時序逐一確認。不過，控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行則質疑相關紀錄是否完整，有可能部份紀錄被刪除，以及次序掉亂。法官則關注，若然控方質疑辯方呈上的紀錄的話，黎需要在庭上逐一檢視及確認，所需時間將會很長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周三（27日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英：疫情現反中情緒 良機設英文版 利用中國負面新聞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e9vmYOE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第95日審訊，黎智英第三日作供。黎否認其個人專欄文章煽惑他人使用暴力，他視自己為「和理非」，提倡「和勇不分」是希望把勇武派吸納入「和理非」陣營，使他們在「和理非」的影響下能克制，減少暴力行為和停止暴力升級，最終變得完全和平。至於《蘋果》英文版，黎認為可以爭取美國人知道香港狀況，並使他們為香港發聲，但他認為外國人為香港發聲並不代表干預香港。他確認曾在群組中說：「在疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看」，由於疫情關係，人們出現反中情緒，而這是一個良機去利用他們不滿情緒。黎又指，外國人在南華早報看不到負面的中國新聞，認為這是一個好機會去創辦《蘋果》英文版，報導及利用中國的負面新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同案被告、已承認串謀勾結外國勢力罪的馮偉光（筆名盧峯）今亦到場旁聽，獲安排坐在屬於延伸庭的第二庭，觀看正庭的實時直播。他身穿藍綠色格仔恤衫、深藍色西裝褸，戴啡色框眼鏡，在被告欄內受三名懲教人員看管。黎作供期間，馮不時低頭抄寫筆記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;專欄文章提及游說-黎否認要求外國實施制裁或封鎖&quot;&gt;專欄文章提及「游說」 黎否認要求外國實施制裁或封鎖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就首項控罪「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」，控方指控《蘋果》在2019年4月至2020年5月期間，共發布161篇具煽動意圖的文章，涵蓋新聞報導、評論文章，以及黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今早繼續向黎展示其個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」於2019年10月27日發布的文章〈美國人想對我們說的話〉。文章開首稱：「這幾天身在美國，難以抽身撰寫專欄，公司手足反問我是否可解答一些疑問，造就以下答問。」黎確認當時著時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏構思十條問題，關於香港當時情況和華盛頓游說之旅，供他以問答形式撰寫專欄文章，因此「手足」是指陳沛敏。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mme7rhA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中第十道問題「香港人還可以做甚麼爭取美國及國際社會支持？」黎在文章中回答：「要得到外國人支持，就要不斷游說。加上傳媒報道，讓他們了解我們的道德、勇氣、良知，讓他們在生活上發聲，支持只會越來越大，不會減少的，只要我們做好本份，以道德力量感動他們的良知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱，「不斷游說」的意思是強調反修例運動非暴力和堅持，他稱文章字句反映他所想的事實和他內心真實想法，並無任何敵意或意圖去煽動仇恨。黎否認「游說」是指要求外國實施制裁或封鎖，因當時香港還未出現相關討論。他亦否認控方所指文章意圖引起對中央和特區政府的憎恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;休庭至下午讓黎閱讀餘下文章&quot;&gt;休庭至下午讓黎閱讀餘下文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上閱讀每篇文章需時數分鐘，昨日法官關注進度，問辯方能否一次過就五篇文章提問，惟黎表示當他讀到第五篇文章時，便會忘記頭四篇文章的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至今天，辯方指黎能夠在法官不在席下，在庭上一次過閱讀餘下12篇文章，然後下午回答問題。法官杜麗冰遂押後至下午續審，讓黎留在庭內證人台閱讀文章，期間允許控辯雙方法律團隊和公眾人士逗留在庭內，惟要求他們安靜，否則職員會要求他們離開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英否認所有文章具煽動意圖-惟承認其中一篇部份字句冒犯性並致歉&quot;&gt;黎智英否認所有文章具煽動意圖 惟承認其中一篇部份字句冒犯性並致歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;午休之後，辯方指黎已閱讀12篇文章，並問黎這些文章之中，有沒有任何一篇具有控方所指稱的煽動意圖。黎說沒有，他本人亦沒有任何煽動意圖，「我只是評論正在發生的事，處理輿論，和預測後果是什麼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過黎主動提到，他留意到〈2020年和勇一起撐下去〉一文中，他評論一名少女向警察講粗口，但如今看來，他認為自己受到當時的氛圍影響，才會作出具冒犯性的評論，他承認是「品味低俗（bad taste）」，感到後悔並為此道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該文章提到，黎看到一個十四、五歲戴口罩的少女，大喊：「黑警死全家！」和「香港差佬，X 你老母」，他當時對何俊仁說：「有這樣的後生，我哋冇得輸。」黎並在文中稱：「有這樣疾惡如仇的優秀勇敢年輕人，香港真是塊福地。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英區議會民主派大勝能給年輕人希望-以致減少街頭暴力&quot;&gt;黎智英：區議會民主派大勝能給年輕人希望 以致減少街頭暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年12月22日的文章〈我們堅持下去才有希望〉，黎亦否認煽動暴力。他指2019年11月區議會中民主派大勝，能夠給予年輕人希望，如果所有人團結的話，能夠形成強大的政治力量並給年輕人希望，使他們減少街頭上的暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於有示威者用汽油彈或槍械，黎表示：「我懷疑這些可怕的暴力是出自滲透者（penetrators）之手，有人當時告訴我。」他指這是非常危險，所以必須提防。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在文章中籲「勇武手足們」考慮陳日君樞機的意見，他解釋，陳樞機曾說過運動需有領袖和有組織，便能減少暴力情況；如果依賴「無大台」的自發行動的話，有時候暴力會超越界線。他指：「暴力是壞，當它超出界線的時候更壞」，所以要確保它受到控制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;文章引用邱吉爾二戰名言-黎智英只想鼓勵人們自救團結一致地反抗-沒提及暴力&quot;&gt;文章引用邱吉爾二戰名言 黎智英：只想鼓勵人們自救、團結一致地反抗 沒提及暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月29日的文章〈反極權 台灣更不用怕〉中，黎指「香港年青人掀起一場轟轟烈烈的逆權運動」、「年輕人抗爭衝突更勇武」等，他否認煽動暴力，反指自己只是說出事實，它就是這樣發生，並沒有煽動任何東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月5日〈2020年和勇一起撐下去〉，文中提及老師和校長「因言入罪」，「我們和勇派必須挺身而出，一起反抗。」黎表示這裡雖然提倡「和勇不分」，但是不代表呼籲和平的人變得暴力，相反勇武派應該加入和平的行列，又指自己並不是呼籲以暴力的手段反抗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年2月9日的文章〈武漢瘟疫 中共喪鐘〉，當中指「我們就像醫護人員一樣群起反抗」。黎否認煽動暴力，因醫護人員並沒有使用暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章亦指：「要是傷亡滿目瘡痍，人民面對瘟疫死亡的威脅，極權便變得不可怕了。瘟疫死亡的威脅，讓我們忘記了對極權的恐懼，十四億人民齊向中共發出憤怒的獅子吼！」辯方問，黎是否提議以暴力反抗？黎則指人們只是呼喊、發聲，當中並沒有任何暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年3月29日的文章〈我們最光輝的時刻〉，黎引用英國前首相邱吉爾在二戰期間在議會發表的演說。黎今否認意圖煽動他人對特區政府使用暴力。辯方則指，邱吉爾的言論是涉及英國與德國之間的戰事，而戰事牽涉暴力。惟黎指香港並沒有戰事，他引用邱吉爾的句子，只是想鼓勵人們自救、團結一致地反抗，並沒有提及暴力，而他一直都堅持使用和平手段抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指問題是反抗的對象是什麼，問黎是要反抗什麼。黎回答是要反抗中國政府對香港自由的侵害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英非支持勇武-提倡和勇不分旨在吸納勇武派-減少暴力&quot;&gt;黎智英：非支持勇武 提倡「和勇不分」旨在吸納勇武派 減少暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年4月26日的〈專橫暴政打壓，我們氣魄不滅〉，黎提及他、李卓人、楊森和李柱銘等民主派涉非法集結被捕，「和理非的大部份香港人抗爭意志被嚇窒了，小撮的勇武派便失去了市民眾志成城的維護和支持，衝擊暴力的士氣和勇氣被削弱，中共便輕易制服這幫人，我們整個運動儘管不是完結，也畫上休止符了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否嘗試英雄化一小撮勇武派？黎則表示沒有，他只是想說當局拘捕李卓人、楊森等人一事，試圖阻嚇「和理非」示威人士上街，結果剩下來的人只得勇武派，那麼整個運動便會失去士氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認他視自己為「和理非」，他稱自己並不是支持勇武派，而是嘗試透過提倡「和勇不分」，把他們吸納入「和理非」陣營，使他們在「和理非」的影響下能克制，減少暴力行為和停止暴力升級，最終變得完全和平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另問及「煲底見」意思，黎則指這是來自勇武派的字句，起初他們使用這字句，後來所有人都使用。辯方問「煲底」是否指立法會大樓示威區，惟黎表示不知道，以他的理解「煲底見」意思是「相見直至最後一刻（let’s see each other until the end）」。黎亦否認使用「抗爭」一詞的意思是煽惑暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英希望爭取美國的政客注意到香港的情況和需要&quot;&gt;黎智英：希望爭取美國的政客注意到香港的情況和需要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方接著圍繞《蘋果》英文版提問，並展示美國國務院前資深顧問Christian Whiton的訊息，提議《蘋果》應創辦英文版報紙。惟黎智英表示：「我覺得這是瘋狂的主意，因為這樣做太高成本了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示作家馮睎乾於2020年5月10日的專欄文章〈不撐蘋果的100萬人〉，當中提到《蘋果》增值的方法包括「八卦式公義」和「國際文宣線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英確認他於同日創立WhatsApp 群組「English news」，群組成員有張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、張志偉等人，筆名盧峯的馮偉光後來才加入群組。黎在群組中說：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示黎與私人助手Mark Simon之間的訊息，後者指「（英文版）這是一個機會去爭取美國人和外國人支持香港，爭取支持是其中一種做法，這會是龐大的經濟和政治支援。」（This gives us an opportunity to capture the support of Americans or foreigners who want to support HK, find supporting us is one of the ways to do it. That would be tremendous financial and political support.）黎在庭上解釋，希望爭取美國的政客注意到香港的情況和需要，因為外國的支持對於香港非常重要。黎又指，透過引起外國人和外國媒體的關注，使外國的政客能為香港發聲，是十分重要，他只是想讓更加多人知道香港發生了什麼事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英外國人為香港發聲並不代表干預香港-外國政府可以與中國政府溝通&quot;&gt;黎智英：外國人為香港發聲並不代表干預香港 外國政府可以與中國政府溝通&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，請求外國人為香港發聲是否等於請求外國干預香港。黎指可能如此理解，但是他認為外國人為香港發聲並不代表干預香港，因為外國可以通過外交渠道與中國當局對話，改善香港情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，外國關注、發聲以及在外交層面與中國溝通之所以重要，是因為當時即將來臨的國安法帶來危機感，當時有報導指國安法即將實施，但他尚未知道條文內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon的訊息中提到「經濟和政治支援」，黎指經濟支援方面，訂閱者需付費，這可以帶來金錢收入；政治支援方面，黎指外國讀者閱讀英文版新聞之後，會為香港發聲，外國的政客會聆聽他們的聲音，使政客也為香港發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「政治保護」，辯方問黎認為外國政府可以如何保護一個中國的地區。黎則指外國政府可以與中國政府溝通。黎亦確認英文版的主要對象是美國人，因為他們是最重要的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英疫情現反中情緒-良機設英文版利用中國負面新聞&quot;&gt;黎智英：疫情現反中情緒 良機設英文版利用中國負面新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎於2020年5月13日向英文版群組發訊息：「我越想越覺得英文版應該着重大陸新聞，專題和文章花絮等。在疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看。我們把大陸方面內容質量做到最好尤其重要，訂閱我們的都會是有識之士，對新聞要求比一般人高。我們的目標是提供外國人在南華早報看不到的中國新聞，打破南早在這方面的壟斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「在疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看」一句，黎表示他的意思是由於疫情關係，人們出現反中情緒，而這是一個良機去捕捉（catch）他們的不滿情緒（emotional tut）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英真誠地希望打破南華早報壟斷&quot;&gt;黎智英：真誠地希望打破南華早報壟斷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「打破南早在這方面的壟斷」一句，黎說：「我真誠地希望如此。」辯方問黎，有什麼中國新聞是外國人在南華早報看不到的。黎認為是一些負面的中國新聞，例如失業率和很多內地的示威暴動，它們沒有被報導，而黎認為這是一個好機會去創辦《蘋果》英文版，在反中情緒高漲時利用（capitalise）中國的負面新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問到：「但是《南華早報》並不是香港唯一的英文報紙。」黎則笑言，不把另一份英文報紙即《英文虎報》視為「報紙」，因為他們沒有影響力，只是從其他新聞複製而成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（21日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）續審，黎智英第二日作供，針對前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏的證供反駁，並重申他是「提議」而非下達「指示」。2019年6月9日一百萬人參與反送中大遊行，黎向陳說「為勇敢的香港人乾杯」會是很好的頭版標題，惟陳最終沒有採用，翌日頭版標題為〈香港人漂亮的固執 1,030,000〉，而陳沒有因為未採用他的提議而受罰。7.1佔領立會之後，黎傳訊息「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」；黎則強調其意思並非下達編採指示，只是跟陳一起討論事件，並沒有要求她做任何事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳曾稱黎要求她製作一份「制裁名單」，惟黎否認，稱由於他不懂使用 Signal 的轉發訊息功能，所以直接將消息人士的訊息「複製和貼上」（copy and paste），傳送給朋友，未有留意到訊息裡含有「制裁名單（shit list）」的字句，直至在法庭上才首次知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;多次轉發香港監察羅傑斯文章給陳沛敏-黎智英稱讓她決定採用與否&quot;&gt;多次轉發「香港監察」羅傑斯文章給陳沛敏 黎智英稱讓她決定採用與否&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首被告黎智英昨日起開始作供，他針對前《蘋果》社長張劍虹的證供提出反駁；今日他在辯方大律師關文渭主問下，針對前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏的證供作出反駁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英和陳沛敏之間的 WhatsApp 對話紀錄顯示，黎多次將「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯的文章或新聞稿轉發給陳，陳供稱，每當有羅傑斯和「香港監察」的新聞稿，黎便會轉發給她，形容黎「似乎好重視 Benedict Rogers 同埋佢個機構嘅事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I call on the world to act to save Hong Kong, to put pressure on Carrie Lam to pull back from the brink, demand an end to impunity for police barbarity, to impose targeted Magnitsky sanctions on those responsible for torture #HongKongProtest #StandwithHK #DemocracyForHK @hk_watch pic.twitter.com/vh07uKOCO2 — Benedict Rogers 羅傑斯 (@benedictrogers) November 12, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今供稱，轉發羅傑斯的文章純粹是因為純粹想讓陳沛敏知道，看看對她是否有用，如果文章對她來說有意思，便可以採用，又稱交由陳決定是否採用。黎又指，陳從不向他匯報最終採用與否。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;佔領立會後向陳沛敏稱盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情-黎否認下指示&quot;&gt;佔領立會後向陳沛敏稱「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」 黎否認下指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月1日示威者在七一佔領立法會，事後黎智英向前動新聞總監張志偉傳送訊息：「Nick，很好。年輕人衝（擊）立法會事（件）令我心情沈（沉）重，你們認為泛民善後工作有什麼該做令運動可以持續？好彩市民對年輕人闖立法院會是多少有些體諒，損害可能不太大。你們認為呢？謝謝。」陳回覆：「收到」，黎其後回覆：「是，要再做。明天是否集中做年輕人的心聲，盡量為他們在這件事上爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反？謝謝。」、「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱，因為他關注佔領立會事件，可能影響到整個反修例運動，所以傳送上述訊息給陳，但強調沒有下編採指示，只是跟陳一起討論事件，並沒有要求她做任何事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OMrLLnm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」一句，黎表示雖然它看起來可以被理解為「指示」，但是他本意並非下達指示，因為他希望報導能著眼於年輕人的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及黎昨日證供表明反對暴力，黎確認，但是他認為佔領立會事件不屬「嚴重暴力」，未有導致人命傷亡，只是導致財產損壞。「如果我不是認為這是負面事件的話，我便不會要求他們去解釋，以爭取香港市民同情」，「我認為他們做錯了事，所以有需要解釋，以爭取香港市民支持，使運動不會被破壞。」但他重申，這是「提議」而非「指示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又說：「我一直都關注年輕人、激進主義。」希望年輕人能汲取教訓，日後能以和平、非暴力方式示威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提議百萬遊行頭版標題為勇敢的香港人乾杯-終未被採用-黎指沒因而懲罰陳沛敏&quot;&gt;提議百萬遊行頭版標題「為勇敢的香港人乾杯」 終未被採用 黎指沒因而懲罰陳沛敏&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年6月9日超過一百萬人參與反送中大遊行。黎向陳轉發前《蘋果日報》社長、著名作家董橋的訊息「Jimmy，你和你的報紙的努力沒有白費！為勇敢的香港人乾杯！」，並說：「沛敏，董橋以上說，為勇敢香港人乾！會是個好標題，請看是否適合，謝謝。」陳則回覆：「好的，我們研究一下，或用地道的語言表達這意思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今表示，他當時認為董橋的句子是好句子，所以轉發訊息給陳，又指這不是「指示」，因為訊息不涉任何需要報導的東西，只是一個標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年6月10日的《蘋果日報》頭版，標題為〈香港人漂亮的固執 1,030,000〉。換言之，陳並未採用黎的提議。辯方問她有否因而被懲罰，黎說沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏指黎智英提出製作制裁名單-黎否認&quot;&gt;陳沛敏指黎智英提出製作制裁名單 黎否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日，時任美國總統特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act），法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翌日黎智英以 WhatsApp 向陳沛敏傳送相關行政命令內文，以及相關白宮網站連結。黎的訊息亦包含一句：「I’d say we should work up a shit list on those involved in censorship, which can include intimidation.」陳早前供稱，根據訊息前文後理，她理解黎的意思是要製作「制裁名單」，不過與同事商討之後，她認為很難在新聞中建議一些制裁對象，所以最終未有落實黎的提議。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今稱，不記得從誰人收到這個訊息，但是肯定該人是來自特朗普政府或白宮有關的人，因為訊息用字「很外國」，「這不是我會用的措辭。」黎解釋，在《國安法》生效之前，他轉用通訊軟件 Signal，由於他不懂使用 Signal 的轉發訊息功能，所以直接將消息人士的訊息「複製和貼上」（copy and paste），傳送給朋友。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認在任何時候要求陳沛敏構思和製作「制裁名單」，他又稱訊息太長，未有仔細閱讀，甚至乎不知道訊息裡含有「shit list」那段字，直至在法庭上才首次知道。至於傳送給陳的原因，黎稱認為該訊息是重要及有新聞價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎智英分別與民主黨前主席胡志偉、何俊仁、李永達、前工黨主席李卓人、林卓廷等訊息紀錄，顯示黎曾向上述泛民人士傳送相同的訊息。黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黎智英（左）、李永達（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方一度問黎有否叫李永達製作「制裁名單」？黎否認，笑言：「這會是荒謬的。」黎又指紀錄可見，很明顯地他先傳送該段訊息給泛民朋友，之後才傳送給陳；假如他想叫陳製作「制裁名單」的話，他理應第一個傳送給陳，惟事實不是如此。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指黎曾傳送給《蘋果》前總編輯羅偉光，惟黎表示不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（21日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）續審，黎智英第二日作供，針對前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏和前主筆楊清奇的證供提出反駁。其中楊作供時曾以「鳥籠自主」來形容《蘋果》的採編自主，指：「黎先生 set 咗《蘋果》嘅基本立場，就好似 set 定咗個鳥籠嘅」，因此員工有一定的自主，但不能越過框架。黎在庭上反駁，堅稱：「我從來沒設任何限制或鳥籠。」但他理解楊有此比喻，是因為每間媒體各自有一套價值體系要遵守，使其立場貫徹，就《蘋果日報》而言，「反民主」、「反自由」乃屬於「鳥籠」以外的範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱只曾向楊清奇推薦區家麟和顏純鈎&quot;&gt;黎智英稱只曾向楊清奇推薦區家麟和顏純鈎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，前《蘋果》主筆楊清奇（筆名李平）乃接手已故作家李怡擔任主筆兼論壇版主管，此前並不認識楊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇作供時曾稱，黎在2018年起轉趨激進，他此後推薦的評論作者「立場都係比較激進」，並舉例指黎推薦過資深傳媒人區家麟和旅美作家「一劍飄塵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過黎智英表示，他推薦作者的準則是他們必須在評論政治和經濟時寫得好。他稱，因為看過區家麟的文章，認為寫得很好，所以向楊推薦區。此外，黎表示他亦曾經推薦顏純鈎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「一劍飄塵」，黎稱從來沒有推薦他，反指是楊清奇自己邀請他撰文。黎稱，他只是閱讀了「一劍飄塵」的專欄文章，認為寫得很好，所以正面評價、稱讚他，但是沒有推薦他做寫手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英否認設任何限制或鳥籠-惟媒體須遵守各自價值體系&quot;&gt;黎智英否認設任何限制或鳥籠 惟媒體須遵守各自價值體系&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇作供時曾以「鳥籠自主」來形容《蘋果》的採編自主，指：「黎先生 set 咗《蘋果》嘅基本立場，就好似 set 定咗個鳥籠嘅，咁採編人員喺鳥籠入面有一定嘅自主，有一定嘅自主，有一定嘅採編自主權，但唔可以超過呢個框架，就唔可以超過呢個鳥籠，所以唔可以簡單講有冇採編自主。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英今在庭上反駁：「我從來沒設任何限制或鳥籠。」他認為，楊之所以使用「鳥籠自主」這個比喻，是因為每間媒體各自有一套價值體系要遵守，使其立場貫徹，「你不會見到《星島日報》或《東方日報》說一些支持反修例和示威的說話，更遑論《大公》、《文匯》。」他指傳媒生意是傳播新聞和評論，背後有一套價值體系在他們思想和心中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，黎曾提及《紐約時報》和 CNN 均是反對特朗普，如果某人替某媒體工作，便要遵守該套價值觀，換言之《紐約時報》和 CNN 的「鳥籠」就是反對特朗普？黎智英同意，他指《紐約時報》和 CNN 是進步派（progressive），所以反對屬於保守派的特朗普，形容反對特朗普的取態是「自由主義的鳥籠（a bird cage of liberalism）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到，那麼有員工撰文「反民主」、「反人權」，便會屬於鳥籠以外的範圍？黎智英同意，並指這情況永遠不會發生（“That would never happen.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱曾邀請曾鈺成撰文-惟對方拒絕&quot;&gt;黎智英稱曾邀請曾鈺成撰文 惟對方拒絕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，《蘋果》是否曾經嘗試邀請建制派人士撰寫評論文章。黎表示，他們打算擴張專欄版，所以製作了一份打算邀請的作者名單，但是名單上屬於「鳥籠」之外的人只有民建聯前立法會主席曾鈺成，除此之外，其他作者包括李柱銘和戴耀廷都屬「鳥籠」之內。至於名單上的任志剛，黎則指任崇尚自由市場，所以認為其取態屬於「鳥籠」之內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示他認識曾鈺成，有時會交談，所以曾經親自邀請曾鈺成，但是對方拒絕了。此外，任志剛、曾俊華等亦拒絕了邀請。而陳沛敏成功邀請到林和立撰文，惟已故歷史學者余英時當時則因為年紀大而拒絕邀請。黎又指，練乙錚和已故作家李怡本來便替《蘋果》撰寫專欄文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英否認個人專欄文章意圖引起憎恨&quot;&gt;黎智英否認個人專欄文章意圖引起憎恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指控《蘋果》在2019年4月至2020年5月期間，共發布161篇具煽動意圖的文章，涵蓋新聞報導、評論文章，以及黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向黎展示三篇「成敗樂一笑」專欄文章，〈請站出來保住最後防線〉、〈諗移⺠定諗遊行〉及〈為自己和下一代 阻擋香港沉淪〉，黎在庭上逐一閱讀，每篇文章需時數分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱〈請站出來保住最後防線〉有意引起市民憎恨政府和司法機關。黎則否認，反稱自己只是推演一旦修例通過的後果。他亦否認控方所稱，文章意圖引起市民對司法機關的憎恨，反稱「整篇文章都沒有憎恨」，他的意圖只是推測若然修例通過的後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就〈諗移⺠定諗遊行〉，黎提及：「香港被劃分在中國的地圖內，香港人的命運便被掌控在京官權力的範圍內，土生土長視香港為家園的香港人，卻是對這塊土地沒有半點兒話事權，被蔑視被離間被摒棄想說要自主，卻被說成是『港獨』，現在 DQ 你，將來修訂了「逃犯條例」還可以隨時拉你鎖你，多神奇的權力，多神聖的地圖啊！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認文章意圖激使讀者憎恨中央政府，反稱只是利用例子來呼籲市民上街遊行，嘗試讓市民明白為何他們要出來示威，去阻止修例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英否認文章意圖激使讀者不守法只是呼籲遊行&quot;&gt;黎智英否認文章意圖激使讀者不守法：只是呼籲遊行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就〈為自己和下一代 阻擋香港沉淪〉，黎在文章提及：「你要跟中共講法律，你從火星來的嗎？你不要太天真太簡單，修訂《逃犯條例》就是要奪去香港的法治，拿住大陸那套『陽光司法』在港任拉任鎖肆虐橫行。不要這樣傻，中共法律永遠官字兩個口，法律不外是他們的行政手段來的。」文章亦提及「六四屠城」，指倘修例通過的話，同樣情況也可能在香港重演，倘香港被斷送給中央的「陽光司法」控制下，「香港無形中成為了集中營」，呼籲市民上街遊行發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，文章提及1989年北京「六四屠城」，是因為如果香港沒有法治的話，便會變成內地。他否認控方指稱文章意圖引起憎恨中央及特區政府，重申文章沒有任何憎恨，他只是嘗試說服讀者，如果不上街示威、阻些修例通過的話，會有什麼可預見的後果，從而呼籲市民上街。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於控方另一個指控，指稱文章有意激使人們透過非法手段來改變香港現制，黎則反駁稱文章沒有提及任何違法手段，「我呼籲他們示威，以維持香港的既有制度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指控文章意圖激使讀者不守法，黎則反駁：「我沒有叫他們不遵守法律，我只是呼籲他們去遊行，在香港這是合法的。」他亦指文章沒有任何句子叫人違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，2019年6月9日有沒有參與任何遊行。黎表示有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

As such, lessons from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) can help us understand the CCP’s approach to governance today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soviet-origin governing institutions and processes exert enduring influence on the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Its substantially imported political structure arguably has at least as much practical impact on Beijing’s behavior as the ideology it also imported from Moscow. While the PRC is not a carbon copy of the USSR, Soviet lessons still have much to teach observers about Chinese governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRC policy shifts over the past two decades have reinforced the relevance of these lessons, and the increased opacity of the Chinese political system makes it necessary to exploit all available tools to assess its behavior. The Soviet experience illuminates, for instance, the impact of the Leninist apparatus on PRC regime behavior, the challenges for understanding China, and the future of its political system. Key insights include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Leninist system’s functional requirements substantially account for China’s conservative departure in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PRC system is opaque by design, with information deployed solely to advance the party-state’s current goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China will ultimately transition from Leninist rule but under unpredictable circumstances and probably only after many more years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet model is not China’s destiny; it is only one of several factors that have shaped PRC history and will continue to influence its future. Nonetheless, understanding it is indispensable to making sense of China’s behavior and prospects for change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-leninist-system&quot;&gt;The Leninist System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP embraces a Leninist apparatus that exhibits strong continuity with the party-state transferred to Beijing by the Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union between the early 1920s and 1950s. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin pioneered its operating norms before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and led the system’s improvisational build-out during its early years in power. Other Soviet leaders, especially Joseph Stalin, contributed to its development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leninist regimes — especially the surviving communist states (China, North Korea, Laos, Vietnam, and Cuba) and the two former European ones established principally through indigenous struggle (the USSR and Yugoslavia) — represent a category of authoritarianism with characteristic institutions and processes that manifest recurring patterns of behavior. (The Leninist regimes of other East European communist states were largely external creations that ended with the USSR’s demise.) All authoritarian regimes are repressive, and some practices of Leninist regimes are common among them, but most of them are not Leninist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Leninist system features an authoritarian regime in which the ruling elite monopolizes political power in the name of a revolutionary ideology through a highly articulated party structure that parallels, penetrates, and dominates the state at all levels and extends to workplaces, residential areas, and local institutions. Party members are subject to strict discipline and ideological indoctrination, regardless of whether they work in the party apparatus or, like most, outside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its struggle to seize and then hold power, the Bolshevik Party pioneered hallmark institutions long familiar to outside observers: a Central Committee, a secretariat with specialized departments (e.g., propaganda, personnel, and internal discipline), and a supreme leadership body at the very center commonly known as the Politburo — all mirrored at subordinate levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the capital to the most distant locality, a Leninist party controls leadership appointments and transfers not merely within itself and the state but also among the military and security forces, the economy, academia, the media, the arts, religious institutions, social organizations, and beyond. Classic Soviet operational practices — such as centralization, mobilization, united front operations, and cadre self-criticism — endure in China. A ruling Leninist regime always seeks to maintain robustly coercive security services that are loyal, first and foremost, to the party itself. It also exhibits high levels of intervention in the economy, ranging widely from state capitalism to command economics. Control of the economy is as important to party dominance as it is to overall national strength or the popular welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundations of CCP ideology also came from Moscow. This body of thought combined a Marxist, class-based economic interpretation of history progressing inexorably toward utopia, Lenin’s own theoretical revisions to Marxism, and, crucial to governance, his advocacy of an elite revolutionary party’s unique role in leading the masses. To a ruling communist party, Marxism-Leninism’s single greatest ideological value may well be in granting the secular equivalent of divine right rule through its role as the sole interpreter of “laws” of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karl Marx’s thoughts on social and economic justice remained enormously appealing, but it was Lenin’s ruthless pragmatism that enabled communist regimes to seize and hold onto power. Chinese communists learned from Moscow that although the content of the ideology could vary substantially, its mere existence was functionally vital to the party’s survival. It is telling that while communist regimes around the world have extensively revised their ideologies, they have been less liberal in modifying core structures, norms, and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is telling that while communist regimes around the world have extensively revised their ideologies, they have been less liberal in modifying core structures, norms, and processes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leadership’s ability to require all party members to embrace its shifting interpretations of reality was and remains an indispensable component of rule. Among the tools at the top leader’s disposal, command of the ideology is a brass ring of power, enabling him not only to legitimize shifting priorities but also suppress opposition and impose unity. Pity the poor Chinese communist who, over a long membership, has been expected to accept unconditionally the “scientific” need for, variously, a Soviet command economy, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, “reform and opening,” and now a New Era of economic statism and intensified political control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No notion of limited government constrains a Leninist party. Like the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), CCP official doctrine explicitly extols the concentration of power in its hands and rejects external restraints. Through the party’s penetration of the state, society, and the economy, it can mobilize markedly disparate powers to advance its goals. Its core ruling institutions tend to be very durable: The Central Committee is now over a century old, and the CCP itself has governed all of China for over 75 years. Central Party officials operate within longstanding administrative norms, draw on time-tested doctrine, and have the luxury of long-term planning horizons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfettered by legal or normative limits to the regime’s reach into society or abroad, expedience in the service of the party is the North Star of decisionmaking at all levels. Political interests and vulnerabilities are always front and center in internal deliberations, reflecting the CCP’s origin story — it understands subversion all too well — and the internal surveillance system’s daily reminders of threats great and small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a ruling Leninist party like China’s is permanently on alert to threats to its power. It is paranoid by design. This is in part ideological (e.g., the assumed hostility of “counterrevolutionary” forces at home and capitalist countries abroad) but is more a habit of rule in a system that brooks no challenge. Like most Leninist party-states, the CCP eschews an independent civil society and seeks to dominate all institutions. A Leninist party seeks not merely its survival but its unbroken monopoly on power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all political systems, Leninist regimes can adapt to changing circumstances to a considerable extent without losing their essential characteristics. Yugoslavia, driven by existential threat, managed to sustain significant economic and social liberalization. Understanding tensions and tendencies within the Leninist model nonetheless helps explain why China has experienced a historic conservative shift over the past 20 years toward reinforced centralization, sweeping internal discipline campaigns, ideological orthodoxy, and suppression of civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observers naturally contrast these policies with those of the preceding “reform and opening” period, which Deng Xiaoping launched in 1978. Deng was, in fact, no less committed to Leninist rule, as he demonstrated brutally on June 4, 1989. Amid the rubble of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, however, desperation to save the party-state drove him and his peers to radical experimentation: agricultural decollectivization, the gradual introduction of market forces, and a retreat of the party from the average citizen’s daily life. While democracy was never on offer, the changes at the time were remarkable and exhibited a surprising tolerance for risk to Leninist prerogatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reform and opening delivered on growth and revitalization, it also diluted the system’s controls, reduced discipline, and unleashed pressures for liberalization. The Tiananmen Square crackdown put a halt to official consideration of political change, but continued economic reform and attendant societal developments in the 1990s and 2000s further undermined the Leninist system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once reform and opening propelled China to a certain level of wealth and power, however, the arguments for further gambling with party equities were bound to encounter increasing opposition. The principal forces behind this counterreformation were internal to the CCP, organic, and flowed from longstanding discomfort with the political effects of reform and perceptions of a shifting cost-benefit ratio. This resistance began to coalesce well before Xi Jinping’s 2012 ascent to power. As Professor Susan Shirk argues in her important volume Overreach: How China Derailed Its Peaceful Rise, the process likely began in earnest no later than the mid-2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For governments that represent themselves as innately progressive, communist regimes are, in practice, notably conservative and intolerant. The CPSU’s Leninist threat perceptions extended far beyond the conventional political sphere, so it was logical that the Kremlin would reject not merely explicit opposition but also unsanctioned manifestations of ethnic identity, religious faith, women’s and other human rights, sexual identity, artistic creativity, intellectual exploration, and economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reform and opening period affirmed that some liberalization in all these areas was possible under a Leninist system. Nonetheless, limits always remained in place; the control apparatus never disappeared, and the party elite ultimately united against a growing threat to the system’s very existence. Conservatism and intolerance in today’s China reflect not merely Xi Jinping’s whim but the same logic that drove Soviet behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the PRC party-state as a familiar political model, in fact, helps deepen understanding of Xi Jinping himself. Xi is the ultimate company man. However much his tumultuous youth informs his views, his professional life has been one of a decades-long ascent through a complex, established institution. Xi is the product and beneficiary of a distinct bureaucratic culture. His comparators are not revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, or Deng Xiaoping but leaders who came of age under ruling Leninist orders — say, Leonid Brezhnev or Jiang Zemin. The former were innovators: often visionary, necessarily iconoclastic. The latter were creatures of established bureaucracies in which institutional interests and preservation of the system were paramount. While not necessarily the gray apparatchiks of Western fancy, neither were these bureaucratic autocrats likely to challenge the fundamentals of a system that defined their very perceptions of threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National power, wealth, and popular welfare are important to Leninist leaders, but internal dominance — not mere survival — ultimately takes precedence. No liberal democracies and comparatively few authoritarian systems judge policy by such a broad scope of aspirations for regime control. China’s affirmation of a statist economy at the July 2024 Third Central Committee Plenum makes sense in this context, and it is unlikely that Beijing’s subsequent stimulus measures will represent a fundamental change to this course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is entirely reasonable that the CCP today willingly takes a pass on the higher growth rates genuine market reforms could yield, correctly recognizing them as intrinsically dangerous politically. A systemic rebalancing of the economy to favor consumption is off the table for the same reason. If Beijing doubles down on state control, technology, and officially sanctioned innovation as economic drivers, it is largely because the regime’s political imperatives rule out structural alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Beijing’s leftist shift has deepened the conformism typical of Leninist systems. From 1978, reform and opening gradually introduced greater willingness among leaders at all levels to take risks to promote growth, then their primary goal. Party members today operate in a climate of sharply reduced risk tolerance and appreciate that everything is political again — or could be at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s perpetual anti-corruption campaign has raised the stakes for all leaders and penalizes not merely malfeasance but also failure to perceive and implement the Center’s will — itself harder to divine than before, with security in myriad forms having been prioritized to the same extent as economic development. At the very time subordinate officials are under pressure to obey and please, economic malaise robs them of tools to satisfy their political masters and increases the chances that poor local performance will invite punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking the optimal balance between power and the requirements of governing an immense, diverse, and relatively open society is a constant challenge for today’s CCP. Over a decade into the Xi era, the average Han citizen (though decidedly not their fellow Tibetan and Uyghur citizens) remains freer and more affluent than they were in the early days of reform and opening, to say nothing of the high noon of Maoism. So far, Beijing still appears to understand that applying crude mobilization and control techniques to its ethnic majority is less likely to yield the regime’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing nonetheless appears willing to accept a balance that involves substantial economic and social costs: A vibrant national economy for its own sake is unacceptable, dissatisfied elites strive to move themselves and their wealth abroad, and the treatment of the Uyghurs confirms the party’s willingness to revive totalitarianism as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reversion to reform and opening is unlikely. Barring a successful leadership challenge (rare in established Leninist systems) or ill health, Xi Jinping is in charge indefinitely — and, if anything, his views will grow more illiberal as he ages. Moreover, while Beijing faces many difficulties, it is unlikely to confront challenges anytime soon on the scale that necessitated and enabled Deng Xiaoping’s great gamble. Barring extraordinary developments, today’s CCP will remain in a defensive crouch for the foreseeable future and respond to challenges conservatively to protect its Leninist order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Barring extraordinary developments, today’s CCP will remain in a defensive crouch for the foreseeable future and respond to challenges conservatively to protect its Leninist order.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;confused-observers&quot;&gt;Confused Observers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opacity, disinformation, and foreign influence operations are enduring PRC practices with deep Soviet roots that have long impaired comprehension of China. An understanding of the mechanisms of governance Moscow transferred to the Chinese communists helps illuminate this area as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Lenin’s leadership, propaganda was always a strategic asset in pursuing control of the Russian state. Formalizing party practice, the Bolsheviks established a propaganda department within the Central Committee soon after they seized power. The CCP today retains propaganda organs at all levels of administration, and the shaping of public opinion and suppression of dissent are obligations for all party members. Soviet principles for the operation of these bodies and the regime as a whole remain very much alive. Leninist parties are highly secretive by norm and regulation. The party does not see itself as obliged to keep its own citizens — much less foreigners — informed of its intent. Control of popular opinion is its top public relations goal; transparency is innately suspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting their Soviet heritage, Chinese propaganda organs are under no obligation to respect truth or consistency. They are not subject to legislative, judicial, or media oversight. As CCP entities, their priorities, unsurprisingly, are party rule and advancement of party goals. Also copying Bolshevik practice, Chinese official rhetoric is freighted with ideological pronouncements that can be variously obscure, ambiguous, and (as necessary) dishonest. Even what appear to be routine statements can stump party members and long-term observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ruling party habitually speaks of its place in the world in triumphalist terms. Short foreign attention spans, especially in democracies, guarantee Beijing has international audiences that are periodically refreshed. Out of practice since the Soviet Union’s demise, overseas observers are less likely today to recognize Xi Jinping’s dramatic assertions of PRC ascendance as (at least in part) echoes of Mao’s claims to leadership of the “third world” and Lenin’s celebration of the Bolshevik spark to the global revolution. This is how Leninist parties speak to the world and, just as importantly, themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leninist propaganda also obfuscates by repurposing liberal references to serve authoritarianism. Thus, like the USSR before it, the PRC avers that its repressive system is democratic — indeed, more perfectly so than Western liberal democracies. Beijing represents itself as a champion of human rights, but the CCP categorically rejects universal rights (such as those of speech or assembly) that China has nominally embraced in international covenants and, for that matter, its own state constitution (as opposed to the party constitution). While the party extols its commitment to sexual equality, for example, Xi Jinping in October 2023 used the All-China Women’s Federation meeting to exhort Chinese women to marry and have babies. In the world at large, an autocratic, mercantilist China improbably represents itself as the champion of a “democratic” global order and free trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denial of information is also a powerful tool for shaping opinion at home and abroad. While the PRC remains more open today than the USSR was for most of its history (or China itself was 40 years ago), restrictions on data, always robust, have sharply revived in recent years. Foreign businesses, academics, and others have found it increasingly difficult to access previously available information. Meanwhile, Beijing has sharply reduced Western media presence in China, removing critical reporting about the PRC from the front page in many markets and enhancing the ability of CCP-originated stories to shape public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional inheritance from the USSR is interference in other countries’ internal affairs. The creation of the CCP was itself an exercise in covert Soviet external operations: Comintern agents helped organize the Chinese Communist Party’s 1921 underground founding congress in Shanghai and provided indispensable funding, equipment, and expertise during the CCP’s early years. For their largesse, the Bolsheviks exacted strict obedience from what was at the time merely the Chinese branch of the Moscow-centered world communist movement. Soviet interference in other countries’ internal affairs extended around the world and continued throughout the USSR’s history, varying in content and intensity. While Leninist states have no more of a monopoly on foreign interference than they do on misleading state propaganda, they are noteworthy for the formal institutional and normative drivers of these activities and the absence of restrictions on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is yet another area in which ideology flavors and justifies behavior: styling itself as the sole interpreter of “scientific” historic forces, a Leninist party operates with a deep sense of exceptionalism. It observes international rules and norms only insofar as they advance the leadership’s goals. The law is no more a constraint on the party’s overseas behavior than it is at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observers therefore cannot be surprised that there is an unbroken link between, say, PRC direction of communist insurgents in colonial Malaya in the 1950s and Beijing’s contemporary efforts to manipulate democratic elections and local media around the world. All have been directed by enduring CCP institutions to shape an international order to Beijing’s liking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While never an unvarnished success, China’s influence operations over time have promoted a positive view of the PRC in many countries and certainly obscured understanding of its intent and ambitions in others. Xi Jinping has substantially invigorated foreign influence operations but remained within the orthodox boundaries of the system CCP founders accepted from Moscow a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-past-and-chinas-future&quot;&gt;Russia’s Past and China’s Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union’s history can also help observers anticipate aspects of the PRC’s future. The demise of the USSR confirmed that communist regimes are not immortal. The CCP’s party-state could nonetheless rule China for an extended period yet, and the system is unlikely to end the same way the Soviet one did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leninist systems are extremely tough and can survive tremendous internal and external abuse. In countries where such regimes arose through indigenous struggle, the mortal vulnerability has been internal elite discord, not foreign pressure or popular revolt. Indeed, the peaceful collapse of the USSR along republic lines was arguably one of the least likely major political events of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If North Korea and Cuba have survived the decades after coming off the Soviet dole, surely the USSR, with all its advantages, could have muddled on longer had it not been for the unintended consequences of Mikhail Gorbachev’s reformist zeal. The assertion that U.S. pressure was the principal driver of the USSR’s demise is unfounded. A more conventional general secretary would have exploited the foreign threat to extend the system’s life — albeit at further cost to prosperity and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCP is unlikely to follow the CPSU’s road to oblivion, if for no other reason than that Beijing is obsessed with the lessons of the Soviet collapse and on watch to prevent its replication. Moreover, China’s party-state has assets Gorbachev’s did not — in particular, a massive economy that is likely to grow well into the future, even if at a slower rate. When China eventually transitions from Leninist rule, it will be via a different route than the one the Soviet Union took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USSR’s collapse nonetheless can still be helpful to anticipating change in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, surprises happen. The demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 was not remotely inevitable and could have been avoided at many points. Nonetheless, it did happen, despite the best intentions of the Soviet leadership and, until quite late in the process, the loyalty of the military and security forces. History is replete with political change driven by surprise, confusion, and compounded errors. This almost certainly will apply to CCP dominance someday. One of the biggest questions, perhaps, is whether it will occur through a sudden convulsion or prolonged evolutionary processes. For now, this is unknowable — though the evolutionary route seems unlikely in the years immediately ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another insight from the Soviet experience is that the diversity of party membership ensures there is a huge range of perspectives within the ruling class once citizens perceive a genuine prospect for systemic change. Leninist parties’ conceit that they are elite revolutionary vanguards contributes to foreign misunderstanding on this point. In fact, with nearly 100 million members, the CCP is second only to India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party as the world’s largest political party. China’s Soviet-style “mass” organizations — such as those for workers, women, and young people — link yet hundreds of millions more to the CCP. Despite a daunting appearance of uniformity in thought and goals, the party’s faithful in fact represent a huge cross-section of the PRC’s 1.4 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as a ruling Leninist party remains a well-lubricated, disciplined operation, most citizens “go along to get along.” When a serious prospect for change augers, however, the diversity lurking behind party control, personal self-interest, and ideology’s wall of sound can become evident. In the case of the CPSU, a huge, apparently monolithic party disintegrated in less than seven years, with many of its members joining the range of political parties that emerged. Suggesting similar diversity in China, foreigners who lived there in the 1990s and 2000s often encountered communists who in private articulated sharp dissatisfaction with CCP rule for a range of reasons. Those people are still there, and it is difficult to believe others aren’t joining them — however much their public behavior currently suggests otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of its bravado, China’s Leninist system displays ample awareness that its survival depends on perpetual vigilance. Whether it be stock market instability, mishandling of a pandemic, or protesters holding up blank sheets of paper, the CCP needs to treat every surprise as a potential threat to the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Whether it be stock market instability, mishandling of a pandemic, or protesters holding up blank sheets of paper, the CCP needs to treat every surprise as a potential threat to the entire system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of the Soviet model by communist parties around the world was never a simple cookie-cutter process. As parties came to power, local histories, circumstances, and interests profoundly shaped the new regimes. There was considerable variation in Leninist practice; the PRC’s ruling party is not the identical twin of the USSR’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been important for CCP rule that China’s pre-1949 political history was overwhelmingly authoritarian, its philosophies skewed toward hierarchy and control, and its culture conservative. These conditions provided fertile soil for communist rule in general and the particular nature of the Chinese Leninist state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those conditions did not, however, preordain CCP rule as we know it. It is significant that the party’s founders modeled themselves not on just any Western Marxist party but on one of the most ruthless. The CCP’s internal wiring chart today, its practical behavior, and the continued veneration of Marxism-Leninism in the Party Constitution make abundantly clear that the Soviet model still deeply informs PRC governance.&lt;/p&gt;

Global private capital investors have been allocating resources toward software-heavy capabilities, such as e-commerce and software as a service, leaving funding gaps for critical components and capabilities where investors perceive greater risk.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;DOD’s new Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) was set up to address this challenge by catalyzing investments in cutting-edge technologies to support the development and maturation of critical components and capabilities. To do this, OSC aims to go beyond direct contract and grant funding to leverage various financing tools used by U.S. government agencies outside DOD. This report provides an overview of these alternative funding mechanisms. By examining these financing tools and their ongoing use, DOD may better prepare to effectively leverage alternative financing toward national security aims.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States faces increasing technological competition from adversaries around the globe as its strategic rivals — particularly China — accelerate the development, production, and scaling of critical technologies. The Department of Defense (DOD) strives to achieve technological advantage through various tools that focus most frequently on new acquisition approaches, organizations dedicated to innovation, and direct funding of contracts. There is new urgency around technological research and development (R&amp;amp;D), particularly for emerging technologies, as strategic competitors have made clear through documents and public statements that they intend to accelerate their work in emerging technologies. Given that most development of emerging technology is now funded through private capital, U.S. policymakers have the task of jump-starting progress in areas critical to U.S. national security. This presents a challenge to U.S. policymakers, who must galvanize private sector investment without the coercive tools or centralized economy that competitors such as China or Russia use when crafting and executing industrial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOD founded the Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) in December 2022 to solve a persistent and increasingly important question: how can the government ensure “the future warfighter has the capabilities they need by attracting and scaling private capital to critical technologies for national security?” To support this goal, OSC received $49 million in appropriations and $984 million in budget authority in the fiscal year (FY) 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As DOD and OSC navigate this terrain, they can look to other U.S. agencies and departments that have gone beyond direct funding to use alternative funding mechanisms, including a variety of debt and equity tools, and that have operated such programs for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government organizations making use of alternative funding mechanisms that can help crowd in private capital include the Department of Commerce and Department of Energy (DOE), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and its predecessor, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). While several reports discuss these agencies, their missions, and their funding tools, there is a lack of literature summarizing the various non-direct funding tools. To fill that gap, this report pulls together publicly available data on investments made by these government agencies and departments, with a specific focus on investments that align with the 14 critical technologies DOD has identified as vital to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the other agencies mentioned, DOD seeks to attract more capital to critical technologies through strong and consistent demand signals, financing, and innovative use of alternative funding mechanisms. In the past two decades, private capital markets have targeted software investments instead of hardware, as they typically generate a greater and more rapid return on investment. Capital has flowed to e-commerce and software as a service (SaaS) and away from deep technology relevant to national security. In 2006, venture capitalists invested 55 percent of funds in software and 45 percent in hardware, but by 2017 that balance had shifted significantly to 92 percent in software and only 8 percent in hardware. More recent data suggests that this trend continued through the Covid-19 pandemic. As of 2023, $66.6 billion in venture capital funding went to software, while only $6.3 billion went to hardware. Companies made this choice because software has lower barriers to entry, less risk, and higher profit margins. This trend accentuates the need for DOD to look for new tools to mobilize private sector capital into investments it deems critical for national security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOD must grapple with the same challenge as the rest of the U.S. government in this domain, which is how to influence investment in transformative technologies and sectors critical to national security in ways that are commercially viable and do not distort the market. The alternative finance mechanisms covered in this report also work toward that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-and-definitions&quot;&gt;Overview and Definitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the authors look at how five federal credit agencies have used different kinds of funding mechanisms over the last 20 years in their quest to generate innovation: the SBA, DFC, EXIM, DOE, and Department of Commerce. The goal of this research is to create foundational knowledge on these programs and offer insights into how DOD, including the newly created OSC, could use these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated a range of investment mechanisms from cases of loans, loan guarantees, loan portfolio guarantees, equity financing, export financing, and investment funds to funding through acts of Congress, such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act. Each agency has some flexibility in the use of its financial instruments — for example, setting interest rates on debt financing or establishing the length of tenors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis uses the following definitions for each financial tool and explains how agencies deploy it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loans:&lt;/strong&gt; A federal agency offers debt financing with set terms on tenors (length of repayment) and rates (set at the U.S. Treasury rate or a widely used benchmark). Loans are typically disbursed and repaid in dollar denominations and may be referred to as direct loans or debt financing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loan guarantees:&lt;/strong&gt; A federal agency assumes the debt obligation if the borrower defaults. A government agency can also purchase the debt from the lending financial institution and take responsibility for the loan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loan portfolio guarantees:&lt;/strong&gt; A federal credit agency guarantees a portfolio of loans, which enables the guaranteed party to scale up its lending activities to qualifying borrowers. Guarantees are typically provided to local banks to lend to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity financing:&lt;/strong&gt; Equity authority is the ability of the U.S. government to make investments in companies either directly by buying a percentage of the company or indirectly through funds that invest in those companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export financing:&lt;/strong&gt; Government agencies can provide financing to suppliers (exporters) trading with overseas buyers (importers). Export finance allows suppliers to access working capital while they wait for buyers to pay invoices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment funds:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. government agencies can invest debt and equity into emerging market private equity funds to help address the shortfall of private equity capital or into investment funds in critical technologies where there are financing gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis focuses on investments that align most closely with DOD’s 14 critical technology areas, which include biotechnology, quantum science, future-generation wireless technology, advanced materials, trusted artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy, integrated network systems of systems, microelectronics, space technology, renewable energy generation and storage, advanced computing and software, human-machine interfaces, directed energy, hypersonics, and integrated sensing and cyber. Several sources use the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to identify critical technology areas, with the downside that such categories are construed broadly, often combining cutting-edge technologies with commonplace consumer goods. Each agency invests in a cross section of sectors beyond the 14 critical technology areas; however, this analysis focuses exclusively on areas of overlap with DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis pulls open-source data on each of the federal credit agencies from annual financial reports and databases from each of the agencies covered, as well as from the federal government-wide website USAspending.gov. The site is “the official open data source of federal spending information, including information about federal awards such as contracts, grants, and loans.” This report is not intended to be a review of non-DOD agencies or their use of funding mechanisms to achieve their goals, but it may offer useful insights for those agencies as well as DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DFC is the U.S. government’s development finance institution. DFC assumed the functions of OPIC and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Development Credit Authority (DCA) through Congress’s Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act. The BUILD Act increased DFC’s exposure cap to $60 billion, doubling OPIC’s former $29 billion exposure cap. DFC officially launched operations in December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its mandate to prioritize less-developed countries, DFC gives preference to projects involving U.S. persons as project sponsors or participants, as well as projects in countries complying with international trade obligations and embracing private enterprise. In its selection of projects, DFC considers factors such as environmental and social impact, workers’ rights, human rights, and compliance with U.S. sanctions. DFC also seeks to complement — not compete with — the private sector by mobilizing private sector capital. DFC currently prioritizes the energy, healthcare, financial inclusion, food security and agriculture, technology and infrastructure, and water and sanitation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS study team examined four DFC financial products: direct loans, loan guarantees, equity financing, and investment funds. DFC guarantee and loan sizes range from $1 million to $1 billion. DFC typically can lend up to 50 percent of the project cost but may consider somewhat higher participation in the case of an expansion of an existing profitable foreign enterprise or for projects with significant offtake agreements. Loan or guarantee tenor is usually between 5 and 15 years but can go up to 25 years. DFC can provide direct loans to clients who lack a funding source of their own or do not have access to commercial lending sources and require DFC to arrange physical disbursement of funds. DFC disburses funds directly from the Department of the Treasury and lends them to an eligible borrower. DFC also provides direct loans in the form of investment guarantees funded by certificates of participation in the U.S. fixed-income debt capital markets. DFC also can provide loan guarantees to clients that have an independent funding source or are independent funding sources (e.g., financial institutions) but are unable to provide funding without risk mitigation by DFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of DFC debt financing, loan guarantees, and loan portfolio guarantees include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, DFC provided $300 million in debt financing (direct loan) to Africa Data Centres Holdings Limited to support the development of critical information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure in Kenya, South Africa, and other DFC-eligible countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, DFC announced a $267 million guarantee to Smart RJ Concessionária de Iluminação Pública SPE S.A. to support the modernization of the public lighting system and installation and management of smart city infrastructure in the city of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DFC also provides financial support to emerging market investment funds. DFC selects funds for investment by evaluating the fund’s strategy, management team, track record, fundraising capabilities, and fund terms. In 2019, DFC provided $50 million in financing to the Meridiam Infrastructure Africa Fund. Meridiam was expected to make up to 10 infrastructure investments across Africa, primarily in the renewable energy, transportation, and environmental sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

Akhtar and Nick M. Brown, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation: Overview and Issues, CRS Report No. R47006 (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, January 2022)&lt;/a&gt;, based on data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dfc.gov/what-we-do/active-projects&quot;&gt;DFC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the BUILD Act, the DFC also has a new financial tool in the form of equity financing. Investments in equity are limited to (1) 30 percent of the total project and (2) a total of 35 percent of the DFC’s total investment exposure, up to $21 billion. In addition to adhering to the same requirements to obtain debt financing, equity financing applicants must demonstrate a strong business model, solid revenue, potential for scale, an experienced management team, and good corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DFC is funded through a corporate capital account (CCA) consisting of appropriations and collections. DFC appropriations designate a portion of CCA collections that may be retained for operating expenses, and excess collections are credited to the Department of the Treasury. DFC’s activities are demand driven (usage depends on commercial interest and the availability of bankable projects), but the agency seeks to attract applications with outreach, business development, calls for proposal, and action through administration initiatives, partnerships, and policies, such as the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, the Quad (a partnership among the governments of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (an economic framework covering climate, technology, anticorruption, and trade among the United States and 13 partner countries in the Indo-Pacific). In FY 2023, DFC committed $9.1 billion, up from $7.4 billion in FY 2022 and $6.7 billion in FY 2021&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DFC is led by a nine-member board of directors comprising a chief executive officer, four other U.S. government officials (the secretary of state, who is the chairperson of the board; the USAID administrator, who is the vice chairperson; the secretary of the treasury; and the secretary of commerce) or their designees, and four nongovernment members (for three-year terms, renewable once). All board positions are presidentially appointed and subject to Senate confirmation. All DFC powers are vested in the board, which provides direction and general oversight and approves major DFC decisions. The CEO acts on the board’s direction. The board meets quarterly, and a quorum is five members. Other DFC officers include the deputy CEO (also a Senate-confirmed, presidentially appointed position), chief risk officer, chief development officer, and inspector general (IG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investments totaling more than $50 million go to the board for approval; transactions below that amount are approved by a credit committee internal to DFC. All investments of $10 million or in specified countries require congressional notification to oversight committees (the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investments&quot;&gt;Investments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that DFC invests primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries and does not invest in defense-related industries, many of DFC’s and OPIC’s (its predecessor) investments do not align with DOD’s 14 critical technology areas or its supply chains. However, the team identified DOD-DFC alignment in renewable energy, data, ICT, and biotechnology investments. DFC investments in these sectors began in 2010, and the total amount invested was $4,112,092,249.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy accounts for most investments, at more than 88 percent of total investments aligned with DOD criteria, for a total of 63 of 71 identified projects. Much of DFC support for the renewable energy sector is geared toward constructing solar photovoltaic (PV) plants to provide renewable energy solutions to households, agribusinesses, educational institutions, and solar manufacturing plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DFC and OPIC have also provided financing for four data-related projects for data centers and support for businesses and three ICT projects that financed cell phone tower constructions, telecom asset acquisitions, and the expansion of wireless businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPIC and DFC also focused their financial support in DOD sectors focused on critical technologies in Africa and Asia. Africa is the predominant recipients of OPIC and DFC financing, and India receives the most financial support overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zmPqrTp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considered by commitment level, direct loans were the most prevalent tool used to support critical technology sectors. That said, commitment level is only one method for measuring the potential impact of assistance. Other measures, such as direct equity investment and ownership stake rather than repayment requirement, may have an outsized influence relative to their comparatively small commitment level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;export-import-bank-of-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Export-Import Bank of the United States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXIM has been the U.S. export credit agency since 1934, helping U.S. exporters that work in challenging and risky markets obtain financing by covering the credit and country risks the private sector is unable or unwilling to accept. EXIM offers the following financing tools: protecting exporters against nonpayment risk by foreign customers, offering support for U.S. companies selling services overseas, backing exporters’ loans from private banks to finance materials and labor, and providing financing to foreign buyers for projects, transportation, and U.S. export sales financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank has several loan guarantee products. EXIM loan guarantees cover 100 percent of the loan principal and accrued interest and are available for medium-term (up to five years) and long-term (over seven years) repayment, which is usually determined by transaction size. Loan guarantees are also available for short-term loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXIM’s medium- and long-term loan guarantees offer competitive term financing from lenders when it is otherwise unavailable from commercial banks, with terms generally up to 10 years. These products provide financing for international buyers of U.S. capital goods and related services (not consumer goods), risk mitigation for a transaction with a particular buyer, more secure entry to emerging markets, longer repayment terms, flexible lender financing options backed by EXIM’s guarantee, and coverage for 100 percent of commercial and political risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXIM also offers working capital loan guarantees. This product provides financing to exporters to help with cash flow to fulfill sales orders and take on new business abroad. EXIM provides a 90 percent loan-backing guarantee to the lender, decreasing repayment risk and thereby increasing the lender’s willingness to extend a loan. With an expanded borrowing base, small business exporters can borrow more with the same collateral. Further, the guarantee can cover both multiple export sales and individual contracts. EXIM can guarantee both revolving and transaction-specific facilities, and there is no minimum or maximum transaction amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before approving certain transactions, EXIM considers the economic impact of a particular transaction and the environmental effects. EXIM also has a statutory mandate to support small business. Small business authorizations in FY 2022 totaled $1.537 billion, representing 29.3 percent of total authorizations. In FY 2022, 1,589 transactions were authorized for the direct benefit of small business exporters, which amounted to 88.3 percent of total transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXIM has to comply with congressional mandates requiring minimum awards distribution for the following programs: the Small Business Mandate, Sub-Saharan Africa Mandate, Environmentally Beneficial Goods and Services Mandate, and Program on China and Transformational Exports Mandate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding-1&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXIM is considered a self-financing agency, which means that it collects funds from credit program customers and uses these funds to offset, or pay back, EXIM’s appropriation to the Department of the Treasury. For FY 2022, EXIM authorized $5.242 billion in loan guarantees and insurance and no direct loan in support of an estimated $10.557 billion in U.S. export sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-1&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A five-member board of directors leads the bank. Members are presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed. The bank’s president and first vice president serve, respectively, as the board’s chair and vice chair. The board needs a quorum of at least three members to conduct business, such as to approve transactions above a certain threshold (now $25 million), make policies, and delegate authority. The 2019 reauthorization provided alternative procedures in the event of a quorum lapse. An Advisory Committee and a Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee support the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investments-1&quot;&gt;Investments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors assessed EXIM transactions from 2007 to 2023 that aligned most closely with DOD’s 14 critical technologies. An estimated 711 transactions used EXIM’s working capital and medium- to long-term guarantee products. In that time, EXIM approved $3,458,276,775 and disbursed $2,771,404,019. ICT-related NAICS codes relevant to FutureG (transformative 5G and future-generation wireless networking technologies), as well as present- and previous-generation communications technologies, were associated with the highest volume of assistance (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXIM uses a mix of insurance, loan guarantees, and direct loans, which is not included in this analysis (Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the EXIM assistance spending for critical technology sectors, $307 million faced cancellation before or after disbursement (Figure 7). This research did not reveal the causes behind the cancellations. In addition, EXIM recently launched the China and Transformational Exports Program (CTEP) to maintain the United States’ position as a leading exporter in several critical technology areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;small-business-administration&quot;&gt;Small Business Administration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-2&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SBA, established in 1953, is an independent federal agency that supports small enterprises through counsel, aid, and investment. The SBA has a range of policy tools to invest in small businesses. This analysis focuses on the agency’s 7(a) and 504 loan programs. These programs do not comprise the entirety of the SBA’s loan authorities; however, they capture the SBA’s long-term financial tools to support domestic business growth and innovation. Additional investment tools include the SBA’s Small Business Investment Companies, which is a privately owned investment company licensed by the SBA and backed by the agency that lends low-cost government capital to invest in U.S. small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SBA’s 7(a) loan guarantee program encourages lenders to provide loans to enterprises otherwise unable to receive capital on “reasonable terms and conditions.” The 7(a) program is the SBA’s primary loan program and houses several subprograms, which collectively guarantee loans that can be used toward acquiring short- and long-term working capital, refinancing debt, improving facilities, purchasing equipment, and covering paychecks in times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a small business applicant to be eligible for SBA’s 7(a) loan, it must be located in the United States, be a for-profit operating business, qualify within SBA’s size requirements, demonstrate a need for the desired credit, and have lender certification that financing is unavailable without SBA assistance. The SBA will then require the lender to consider the applicant’s ability to reasonably repay the loan based on the applicant’s history and potential for profitability. If the lender approves, the SBA will cover up to 90 percent of the loan’s value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBA’s 7(a) loan terms depend on the lending institution and the recipient. SBA 7(a) loans have a $3.75 million cap, and the interest rate varies based on the lender selecting a base rate that gradually changes based on the loan value and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding-2&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBA’s 7(a) program is funded through congressional appropriations and by fees and collections of its loan guarantees. In the rare event a loan recipient defaults or fails to repay on time, SBA will require additional allocations to support its programs. From 2014 to 2020, the SBA subsidized only $99 million of its loan guarantees — all of which occurred in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In FY 2023, the SBA’s 7(a) program received $35 billion to support its activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-2&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency’s appointed administrator governs the SBA’s 7(a) program on a statutory basis. However, the process is governed by the SBA’s Loan Guaranty Processing Center, which screens applications submitted by lenders through the Electronic Loan Processing/Servicing website, which is available through the SBA One interface. The center processes applications sent by lending institutions that do not have delegated authority to make 7(a) loans without prior governmental approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investments-2&quot;&gt;Investments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SBA 7(a) applicants and awardees align with several of DOD’s 14 critical technology areas. The following chart depicts the share capital guaranteed by the SBA 7(a) loans in critical technology areas categorized based on the NAICS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4CAoaVu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: SBA Financing to Critical Sectors by Year, FY 2010–FY 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: SBA FOIA datasets and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2010 to 2023, SBA’s computing allocations dominated the 7(a) program’s coverage, with approximately $3 billion in computing-related loans. These figures should not be taken to mean that computing-related loans are going solely toward scaling up advanced computing software highlighted by DOD. However, they demonstrate the SBA’s interest in these applicants and the organization’s efforts to incentivize capital to flow into these businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High technology and biotechnologies follow computing in terms of the SBA 7(a) program’s investments, although the difference between those two and computing remains stark. High-technology coverage throughout 2010–23 was approximately $830 million, and biotechnology was about $330 million. High technology captures a range of R&amp;amp;D activities including nanotechnologies, scientific instrument manufacturing, and laboratory-related obligations. Biotechnology covers a myriad of medicinal and pharmaceutical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to EXIM, computing is the largest beneficiary of SBA assistance in critical technology sectors. The second-largest category, high technology, includes a wide range of R&amp;amp;D and cannot easily be assigned to a single critical technology area (Figure 9). Lender programs, including general 504 lenders programs, certified lenders programs, and preferred lenders programs for 7a loans, were the most prominent source of SBA assistance for investments in critical technology sectors (Figure 10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, SBA was repaid in full. However, $1.6 billion of SBA assistance was cancelled, and $600 million was charged off during the covered period (Figure 11). Reasons for assistance cancellation were not identified in the course of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;department-of-energy&quot;&gt;Department of Energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title 17 Program and ATVM Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-3&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOE’s Title 17 Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Program was established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and has financed projects under different loan authorities. The EIR Program is under Section 1706 of Title 17 and was incorporated in a 2023 update to implement provisions of the IRA. EIR projects support reinvestment in communities throughout the United States where existing energy infrastructure has been challenged by market forces, resource depletion, age, technology advancements, or the broader energy transition. This infrastructure might include power plants, fossil fuel extraction sites, transmission systems, fossil fuel pipelines, refineries, or other energy facilities that have ceased to operate or that continue to operate but could benefit from improvements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EIR guarantees loans to projects that retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations, or projects that enable operating energy infrastructure to avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) provides loans to support the manufacture of eligible advanced technology vehicles and qualifying components, including newly authorized modes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. This program covers light-duty vehicles; medium- and heavy-duty vehicles; trains or locomotives; maritime vessels, including offshore wind support vessels; aircraft; and hyperloop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding-3&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA appropriated $5 billion through September 30, 2026, to carry out the EIR program with a limitation on commitments to guarantee loans with a total principal amount of less than $250 billion. The IRA removed the $25 billion cap on ATVM loan authority and appropriated $3 billion in credit subsidies to support these loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-3&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administration of the DOE EIR program is under the statutory purview of the secretary of energy. The secretary delegates this authority to the leadership of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office, which manages the ATVM program. The office has seven divisions: Loan Origination, Outreach and Business Development, Portfolio Management, Technical and Environmental, Risk Management, Management and Operations, and Legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investments-3&quot;&gt;Investments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major area of focus for DOE’s Title 17 programs is developing PV solar power in the United States (Figure 12). Currently, there are four Midwestern projects that the DOE guarantees either entirely or partially. The total value of these projects is approximately $16.9 billion (Figure 13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full or partial loan guarantees are the most frequent tool of DOE Title 17 assistance, although direct loans are the preferred mechanism for ATVM assistance (Figure 14). Active projects make up the bulk of DOE’s portfolio, which is unsurprising given the recently enabled lending as part of the IRA (Figure 15).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;IRA and CHIPS Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Joe Biden signed the IRA into law in August 2022, providing funding opportunities through various departments, including the Department of Commerce, to accelerate the U.S. energy transition. Most of the Department of Commerce’s funding will be allocated through grants, direct spending, contracts, cooperative agreements, and technical assistance to support coastal communities and resilience efforts as well as weather and climate forecasting. At the time of writing, it was unclear how the IRA, through the Department of Commerce, would support the climate-related areas in DOD’s 14 critical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act of 2022 provides financial incentives, including loans and funds, for the domestic manufacture of semiconductors and the conduct of related research and development. The CHIPS Act will allocate $280 billion over the next 10 years. The Department of Commerce is looking to crowd in capital to finance rebuilding the domestic semiconductor industry and will provide loans and loan guarantees. Their effort is not to fully fund the production of chips or the construction of an entire fabrication facility. The Department of Commerce designed a new process to call for and assess proposals and to award the loans and loan guarantees, basing this on lessons and observations from the private equity industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHIPS Act money comes with guardrails, particularly as the financial support will go toward industries critical to national security. Each funding recipient must enter into a “required agreement” with the Department of Commerce that governs the use of the CHIPS funding, putting in place certain restrictions. For instance, recipients or their affiliates will be prohibited from transactions in the semiconductor industry in countries of concern, including but not limited to China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, for 10 years. Joint research or technology licensing is also prohibited with these countries. The guardrails are outlined in the Final Rule, Transaction Prohibition, and Technology Prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic and international companies have undergone a process outlined by the Department of Commerce to apply for funds, which includes a letter of interest, requests for proposals, and a proposal review. The department has received more than 500 statements of interest and more than 100 preapplications and full applications since it began accepting them in March 2023. The department has made this an interactive process and essentially has no single criterion or project it is looking for; rather it is looking for proposals that are economically viable and that have a national security angle. The application process also includes an evaluation, preliminary term sheets, due diligence, and funding awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding-4&quot;&gt;Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the IRA, the Department of Commerce manages a $2.6 billion framework to invest in coastal resilience, $400 million specifically for tribal priorities and benefiting coastal and Great Lakes communities, and additional investments to improve weather and climate data and services. Through the CHIPS Act, it is expected to oversee $50 billion to revitalize the domestic semiconductor industry and reshore supply chains back to the United States, including $39 billion for manufacturing incentives and $11 billion for R&amp;amp;D programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-4&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will manage all of the climate-related work. The Department of Commerce’s newly created CHIPS Program Office oversees CHIPS Act funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investments-4&quot;&gt;Investments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the CHIPS Act, the Department of Commerce announced for the first time the signing of a nonbinding preliminary memorandum of terms (PMT) to a funding applicant on December 11, 2023. BAE Systems Electronic Systems is expected to receive $35 million in federal incentives to support the modernization of the company’s Microelectronics Center, a mature-node production facility in Nashua, New Hampshire. The project will replace aging tools and quadruple the production of chips necessary for critical defense programs, including the F-35 fighter jet program. The Department of Commerce announced the second PMT on February 19, 2024, to GlobalFoundries to provide $1.5 billion in direct funding to improve domestic supply chain resilience, strengthen competitiveness in current-generation and mature-node semiconductor production, and support economic and national security priorities, at time of drafting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cross-cutting-insights&quot;&gt;Cross-Cutting Insights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DOD’s efforts to develop and maintain technological advantage over its strategic rivals requires investments in technology, which have most frequently focused on direct funding of contracts. OSC’s mission is to expand the range of financing mechanisms that can be used to invest in cutting-edge technologies, with a particular focus on encouraging investment in DOD’s 14 critical technology areas. To do this, OSC aims to go beyond direct contract and grant funding to use a variety of financing tools employed by U.S. government agencies outside of DOD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a systematic look across the whole of U.S. government, the authors examined these funding mechanisms and how they have been used. An analysis of this research reveals the following insights, which may be of use to OSC as it seeks to crowd in capital for strategic impact:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mjpZShF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 16: Financing to Critical Technology Sectors by Status.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Agency datasets and CSIS analysis. DOE datasets FY 2008–FY 2023, EXIM dataset FY 2007–FY 2022, SBA datasets FY 1991–FY 2023, DFC dataset FY 2012–FY 2023 Q3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare to manage the challenge of perceived “failure” when investments do not yield returns.&lt;/strong&gt; The portfolio investment approach typical of venture capital, where some investments do not pay off, represents a cultural challenge. The pervasive culture of compliance, while crucial for ensuring that the government meets requirements and follows existing protocols, presents a challenge for the inherently risky nature of portfolio investments. In undertaking the portfolio investment approach typical of venture capital, DOD must accept healthy risk from the outset and prepare to champion the successes of certain investments while accepting that not all will yield desired returns. Given the urgency of fueling critical technologies investment, DOD should prepare to communicate the advantages of alternative funding approaches both externally and to its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 16, loan cancellations or reductions through charge-offs will happen, but “failure” seems to be the exception. The exact portion of loans that will be repaid is difficult to calculate. For the DOE Title 17 program, 81 percent of its loans by value are still active, and the EXIM bank does not differentiate between ongoing or repaid loans for the 91 percent of loans that have not been cancelled. With those caveats in mind, across programs 6 to 14 percent of loans (when summed together totaling $5.7 billion of $76.1 billion) were cancelled when weighted by face value. Even when considering other negative outcomes, such as a loan not being disbursed or the government only partially recovering the loan via a charge-off, only 6 to 21 percent of loans experienced negative outcomes. Although this analysis captures only a fraction of alternative financing — specifically, programs directly relevant to DOD’s 14 critical technologies — these ranges give a sense of the level of failure tolerance necessary when employing financial assistance and that the portfolio outcomes for all of the studied programs are positive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the role of market signaling.&lt;/strong&gt; It is not merely the magnitude of financing that will determine the success of DOD to crowd in private capital investments in DOD-relevant technologies. Rather, clear communication of DOD priorities and identification of private sector projects that meet DOD’s needs can attract attention from private capital investors, regardless of the size of investment. If DOD signals its interest in particular critical technologies projects and sources, this holds great potential to generate private capital investment. Therefore, DOD should consider concentrating its efforts on efficient investments in key private sector innovations and openly communicate these decisions rather than concern itself with the amount of capital required. In showing a clear indication of interest, regardless of magnitude, DOD can guide private capital investors in their understanding of DOD priorities and increase investor confidence in their potential return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop appropriate reporting systems to establish effective monitoring and evaluation of investments.&lt;/strong&gt; Current tracking tools are limited. The government-wide Federal Assistance Award Data System (FAADS) database includes useful information but does not capture key inputs or outcome variables — namely, the economic sector or loan outcome. DOD should carefully consider useful metrics it will employ to assess and manage its portfolio. By establishing these metrics early, DOD can prepare to collect the necessary data to evaluate program performance. DOE, DFC, and EXIM have developed and published key metrics that could serve as examples for DOD’s development of open-source tracking systems. Publishing key metrics on programmatic developments would both enhance transparency and ensure the department’s investments are systematically assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，3名國安法指定法官裁定黎3項控罪表證成立，黎選擇作供，押後至今天（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）續審。黎以英語作供，他稱在六四之後創辦《壹週刊》，認為作為商人有需要涉足資訊自由範疇，「因為你擁有愈多資訊，你便知道得愈多，那麼你便愈自由。」後來，黎因為擴展生意業務而成立《蘋果日報》。就其個人和《蘋果》的立場，黎稱反對任何形式的暴力，亦認為「港獨」是陰謀。對於張劍虹早前證供指《蘋果》在2014年「佔中」之後立場轉趨激進，黎智英則不同意，因這份報紙一向關注運動，只是因為2014年社運行動增多，所以他們要跟進事態發展，使報紙看起來較活躍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3罪表證成立-黎智英選擇親自作供&quot;&gt;3罪表證成立 黎智英選擇親自作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告依次為：黎智英（74歲）、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首被告黎智英由懲教人員押解往法院應訊。他身穿白色恤衫、淺綠色毛衣、卡其色西裝外套、戴上黑色粗框眼鏡，被帶入被告欄時向親友及旁聽人士揮手，又相手合十。黎的妻子、子女和天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機亦有到場旁聽，他們一同在家屬席就坐。等待開庭期間，黎一直與親友們相視而笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1ximYZ1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件於今年1月開審，控方先後轉召張劍虹、陳沛敏、楊清奇、李宇軒和陳梓華出庭以「從犯證人」身份作供。控方於6月舉證完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎的資深大律師彭耀鴻作中段陳詞，要求法庭裁定所有控罪表證不成立。惟3名國安法指定法官最終裁定黎3項控罪表證成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後黎透過辯方表示選擇親自作供，另擬傳召一名專家證人就社交軟件 Signal 作供，預料辯方案情需時約30個工作天。由於3名法官在8及9月均有其他案件要處理，未能立即聽取黎的證供。經商討後，最終押後至今日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件廣受大批本地及國際媒體關注，縱使今早轉涼及下雨，早上約8時許起，約40至50名傳媒代表已開始排隊輪候記者籌。另外，自昨日中午起，有市民冒雨在法院外排隊，輪候公眾旁聽籌，至今早隊伍約有100人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎供稱六四後感恐懼-成立壹週刊冀著力資訊自由&quot;&gt;黎供稱六四後感恐懼 成立《壹週刊》冀著力資訊自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在3名懲教人員的監督之下，步出被告欄，前往庭內的證人台就坐，期間一度望向公眾席。他先拿起聖經，以天主教形式宣誓，其後開始以英語作供。在作供期間，3名懲教人員全程坐在他背後看守。黎亦全程戴著耳機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方大律師關文渭的主問下，黎供稱，他原本擁有一間成衣公司「佐丹奴（Giordano）」，但是他在1989年把公司賣出，因為如果不這樣做的話，設在內地的分店便需要關閉。他稱，他在六四之後，開始成立傳媒公司、創辦《壹週刊》，因他感到恐懼，認為好像他那般的商人需涉足資訊自由的範疇，「因為你擁有愈多資訊，你便知道得愈多，那麼你便愈自由。」黎亦表示，他首次參與政治是關於六四。後來，黎因為擴展生意業務而成立《蘋果日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英反對暴力及港獨&quot;&gt;黎智英：反對暴力及港獨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到《蘋果》的核心價值是什麼，黎指《蘋果》的核心價值其實與香港人懷有的核心價值相同，包括法治、示威自由、言論自由、宗教自由和遊行自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否支持暴力，黎表示：「我一向都反對任何形式的暴力。」而《蘋果》的立場亦一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎繼而被問到對於「港獨」和「台獨」的立場，黎表示他一向認為提倡香港獨立是一個陰謀，因那些人務求使其他人掉入陷阱，亦同意「港獨」想法「太瘋狂」。黎稱他經常要求同事不要在報導中談及「港獨」，《蘋果》也不會容許鼓吹「港獨」的人士參與報章工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英蘋果與香港人擁有相同價值&quot;&gt;黎智英：《蘋果》與香港人擁有相同價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭向黎智英出示剪報，題為〈蘋果日報：我們屬於香港〉，在1995年6月20日刊登於《蘋果日報》報章，為創刊社論。內容提及，在資訊透明的今天，只要《蘋果》讀者支持普選，不管面對多大壓力，《蘋果》員工必定堅持下去。黎稱，這句子顯示《蘋果》與香港人擁有相同價值，並且站在一起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該文章亦稱《蘋果》不會容忍任何限制自由，黎指這代表到《蘋果》的原則。辯方問到，《蘋果》沒有提供任何員工培訓或指引，怎樣確保到他們的立場是與港人和《蘋果》一致呢？黎則相信員工都是香港人，很自然地會與《蘋果》站在一起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹早前稱佔中後蘋果轉趨激進-黎智英反駁一向關注運動&quot;&gt;張劍虹早前稱佔中後《蘋果》轉趨激進 黎智英反駁一向關注運動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及《蘋果》前社長張劍虹早前作供，稱《蘋果》在2014年「佔中」之前主要聚焦「狗仔隊」和娛樂新聞，但是2014年之後，「好似成為一間反政府、對抗中央嘅一個報紙。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英則不同意，因這份報紙一向關注爭取自由的運動，在2014年之前也有持續報導有關六四遊行的新聞，只是因為2014年社會運動事件增加，所以他們需要跟進事態發展，報導便增多，因而看起來好像較之前活躍。黎亦確認他在「佔中」期間曾被拘捕，該次是他第一次被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《蘋果》前主筆楊清奇早前作供時提到，彭斯（Mike Pence）於2018年10月發表演講時提及美國對華政策，黎當時認為演講內容意味「美國反枱」，因此楊覺得由那時候開始，「黎先生嘅政治立場就變得激進啲。」黎智英則表示，不懂得如何回應，因他與楊清奇甚少交談，也幾乎未曾在論壇版撰文，不知道楊對自己的印象從何而來，「如果說我激進，我一直以來都是激進。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及／或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，3名國安法指定法官裁定黎3項控罪表證成立，黎選擇作供，押後至今天（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）續審。黎首度親自作供，他表示自己從不是政黨成員，而視自己為一個商人和社運人士。3名同案被告張劍虹、陳沛敏和楊清奇曾以「從犯證人」身份作供，黎反駁他們的部份證供。黎稱他與張劍虹並不是朋友，從不談論私事，質疑張供稱的對話沒發生。此外，在《國安法》即將生效之前，黎曾透過訊息籲員工勿針對特朗普，他稱因不能一方面要求他援助香港，另一方面卻與他對著幹，但否認這是「編採指示」，反指是屬於提議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾捐2萬英鎊給香港監察-黎智英做有意義的事&quot;&gt;曾捐2萬英鎊給「香港監察」 黎智英：做有意義的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就兩項串謀勾結外國勢力罪，控方在開案陳詞時展示了一幅黎智英的「國際連繫圖」，顯示黎認識美國、英國、台灣等地的政治人物，當中更包括美國前總統特朗普、台灣前總統蔡英文和前港督彭定康等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英的代表大律師關文渭今向黎出示該圖表，黎智英是否認識該些人物。就圖中的英國線，其中一人是「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers），黎表示他與羅傑斯互相認識，對方在數年前被拒進入香港境內，有時別人會要求他刊登羅傑斯的文章。黎在英國的時候曾與他親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎曾轉帳一些錢2萬元英鎊給「香港監察」，黎解釋：「我認為我在做有意義的事，因他支持香港」，所以決定捐款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不敢稱呼彭定康為朋友&quot;&gt;黎智英：不敢稱呼彭定康為朋友&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至英國線另一人為「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（IPAC）創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford），惟黎表示：「我從未跟他討論過任何事」，包括政治事務。他稱，當裴倫德傳送文章給他時，他立即轉發文章給陳沛敏或羅偉光，「老實說，我從未閱讀該些文章。」至於文章涉及的 IPAC，黎稱：「我從不知道 IPAC」，又稱「我第一次聽聞 IPAC 的時候是在法庭上」，即李宇軒的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於前港督彭定康，黎說：「他稱呼我為朋友，但是我不敢稱呼他為朋友，因為他是前港督。」二人曾經親身見面，但是沒有直接聯絡，通常是透過陳方安生和羅傑斯聯絡，為免彭定康拒絕黎的要求時感到尷尬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認識蔡英文-對方視會面為公關會面&quot;&gt;黎認識蔡英文 對方視會面為「公關會面」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱他認識蔡英文時，她還未是總統，當時黎打算在創辦台灣《蘋果日報》。他通常透過江春男聯絡蔡，會談及台灣政策，例如黎告訴蔡關閉核電廠會是錯誤決定，對方亦會問及香港市民的普遍意見。黎形容，對於蔡而言，與他見面就如與傳媒之間的「公關會面」，這些討論都是無關痛癢，沒有實質內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/P4nOiQA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 蔡英文&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於江春男，黎指他是著名作家，就像蔡英文的「左右手」。江在陳水扁做總統的時代擔任國安會副秘書長，但黎認識他的時候，理解他已經沒有任何職位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，他曾將美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz 和退休軍官 Jack Keane，經江春男介紹給蔡英文，因為想讓台灣了解特朗普政府如何看待台灣議題，而台灣是唯一一個有民主的華人地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱不認識特朗普本人-未曾聯絡&quot;&gt;黎智英稱不認識特朗普本人 未曾聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就美國線而言，控方指稱黎智英與時任美國總統特朗普有聯繫。黎則表示：「我不覺得他認識我」，亦表示不認識特朗普本人，沒有直接或經其他人接觸過特朗普，也沒有收過任何來自特朗普的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聯繫圖亦包括時任美國副總統彭斯，惟黎稱他該次與彭斯見面，只是握手，然後再沒有其他交流。他稱2019年到訪華盛頓，是為了會見參眾兩院的議員，告訴他們香港發生什麼事，而黎事前並不知道將要會見彭斯，因行程是由美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 安排。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The arrest of @JimmyLaiApple in Hong Kong is deeply offensive &amp;amp; an affront to freedom loving people around the world.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到該次會面中，有否要求美國政府做任何事，黎則表示：「我不會夠膽要求副總統去做任何事情」，他只是告知彭斯香港發生的示威事件，並請求他為香港發聲、支持香港，而沒有叫他做任何事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任國務卿蓬佩奧，黎與他在2019年7月曾見面。黎稱與彭斯的情況一樣，他並沒有要求對方做任何事情，只籲他為香港發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西，黎稱李柱銘帶他去見她，實際上他不認識佩洛西，佩洛西也不認識他。在該次會面中，黎稱主要是李柱銘和佩洛西交談，而他只是聆聽，惟他不明白二人之間的對話內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱從不捐款給美國政治人物-只捐款給美國智庫和宗教組織&quot;&gt;黎智英稱從不捐款給美國政治人物 只捐款給美國智庫和宗教組織&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，美國國務院前資深顧問 Christian Whiton 是透過其私人助手 Mark Simon 介紹而認識，因他認識美國的議員，所以該次華盛頓之行便是靠他將黎介紹給議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於美國退休軍官 Jack Keane，黎則稱是在聚會中認識。美國前副國防部長 Paul Wolfowitz，則因為黎有意在緬甸投資生意，所以聘請他擔任投資顧問，因而認識。銀行紀錄顯示黎曾向 Paul Wolfowitz 支付顧問費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否向任何人提供金錢，以圖影響美國的政策。黎表示沒有，他從不捐款給美國政治人物，他只會捐款給美國智庫和宗教組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;日本議員菅野志櫻里被列為串謀者之一-黎智英從未聽過她名字不懂日文&quot;&gt;日本議員菅野志櫻里被列為串謀者之一 黎智英：從未聽過她名字、不懂日文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，在該「國際聯繫圖」中所述的人物，黎有否嘗試透過他們去影響外國對中國和香港的政策。黎表示從沒有。被問到有否請求任何人對抗中國和香港。黎亦回答從來沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒早前證供提及日本議員菅野志櫻里，控方亦將她列為本案的串謀者之一。惟黎今稱他從沒聽過她的名字，因為他不懂日文，連她是女性也不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;今、私の方では野党議員中心に呼びかけてます。政党や会派に縛られず、1人の日本の国会議員として、世界と連帯し、基本的人権の尊重と法の支配という普遍の価値を守ろう。#HongKong pic.twitter.com/aa7zaxAD1R — 菅野志桜里 (@ShioriYamao) May 27, 2020&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱透過mark-simon捐款給香港政黨&quot;&gt;黎稱透過Mark Simon捐款給香港政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關於黎的私人助手 Mark Simon，黎稱他是唯一一個替自己處理私人事務的人，聘用他超過20年。黎亦會透過 Mark Simon 進行股票交易、捐款給香港政黨，包括民主黨、公民黨、「長毛」梁國雄等，因此銀行紀錄顯示在2013至2020年期間，黎與 Mark Simon 有合共86次交易。惟他稱從沒捐款給香港以外的政黨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦表示，雖然他有捐款給美國智庫，但是每年只有2至5萬美元，認為是微不足道，更遑論影響美國的政策，「如果想透過那麼少的捐款而要求得到回報，便太瘋狂了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，他與 Mark Simon 甚少談論政治，只知道他是美國共和黨香港分部的成員，但不認為他與美國政府有連繫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英視自己為商人和社運人士&quot;&gt;黎智英：視自己為商人和社運人士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否任何政黨的成員，黎表示從來不是，「我視自己為一個商人和社運人士（activist）。」辯方追問為何黎認為自己是行動者，黎稱因為他參與示威和一些社會事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，黎確認他在2020年5月，即《國安法》生效之前約一個月，擔任集團主席，包括掌管編採範疇，因他想為整個公司負責任。黎其後解釋，「如果有任何證據顯示《蘋果》荼毒港人思想，我便需要承擔責任」，「《國安法》之後，如果《蘋果》發生了任何事，我希望我會是完全承擔責任的那一個人。」他表示自己是作為一個「領袖」去承擔責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英無意圖無能力荼毒港人思想&quot;&gt;黎智英：無意圖、無能力荼毒港人思想&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方案情指稱黎是「重光團隊」（Stand With Hong Kong）的「金主」，黎在庭上稱「我沒有任何政治主張，我與 SWHK 沒有任何聯繫」，如果他與 SWHK 有任何聯繫，那只限於提供貸款，使他們能夠在報章賣廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方開案陳詞又指《蘋果日報》荼毒讀者思想。但黎則表示他不知道「荼毒思想」是什麼意思，「我只是對於一些已然發生的事情作出評論」，他亦說：「單憑我寫的東西，我不認為我有能力去荼毒香港市民的思想。」黎同時否認有任何意圖去荼毒港人思想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹曾供稱不可向黎說不-黎我從來沒有說過他不可以說不&quot;&gt;張劍虹曾供稱不可向黎說「不」 黎：我從來沒有說過他不可以說「不」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹作供時指，黎是一個「不可以向他說不」的老闆。黎今在庭上反駁：「我不明白為何他沒有權利說不，我從來沒有說過他不可以說不。」黎續指：「我一直以來總是客氣，我從不下達命令，我總是問他會否做某些事，按照他的決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到，黎有沒有遇過任何情況，當他要求張劍虹做某些事時，張拒絕或沒有照做。黎則指張是行政總裁，所以他很少要求張做事，故記不起有否發生過上述情況；但是即使張沒有執行到他所交代的工作，他也不會知道，因他不會跟進進度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱總編輯換人並非他的決定&quot;&gt;黎智英稱總編輯換人並非他的決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏亦曾在作供期間形容黎是「比較強勢」的老闆。黎智英在庭上回應：「我認為，如果她將我的性格演繹為我的管理風格，她是正確」，他自言有很強的性格；但是如果說他強迫下屬執行工作的話，他並不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇則在作供時指黎若遇到員工「唔啱佢心意，好快就換人」，在楊任職《蘋果》23年期，他記得換了七至八次總編緝。黎則指，在過去二十多年來，如果總編輯有轉換，那不會是他的決定，他不會干預該些決定，而且他稱總編輯只換過三次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英林榮基赴台做頭條乃陳沛敏的決定&quot;&gt;黎智英：林榮基赴台做頭條乃陳沛敏的決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎智英與張劍虹之間的 WhatsApp 對話，黎指前政務司司長陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯是「大新聞」，並要求張將新聞做到「最大效果」，張回覆「老闆，早安，收到。謝謝」。黎同意以上訊息屬於編採指示，除了這次之外，只曾指示過張發起「一人一信救香港」行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提及黎在2019年4月向張發訊息：「林榮基因逃犯法例昨天到台灣避難，我們已有獨家照片和報導，現在欠他的訪問，不知台灣是否有人知他下落。謝謝。」黎則不認為這訊息屬於編採指示，因為當時張身處台灣，只是想打聽當地有沒有人知道林榮基的下落，只是一種方便的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林榮基赴台的新聞後來在2019年4月27日實體報紙的頭條。張劍虹曾供稱，這是因為他向陳沛敏轉達黎智英想以此新聞作為頭版；惟陳沛敏則表示「係我嘅決定」。黎智英今在庭上指這是陳沛敏的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英與張劍虹非朋友-從不談及私事&quot;&gt;黎智英：與張劍虹非朋友 從不談及私事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，張似乎是一個獲得黎信賴的同事，問黎與張劍虹是否朋友。黎隨即表示不是，「我們從不談及私事，我幾乎從沒與他單獨吃午飯」，即使一起吃午飯，也只會談論公事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳沛敏，黎智英說：「她是我的朋友」，二人也是同事關係，在公事以外有私交。而楊清奇，黎表示「我甚少與他見面」，形容雙方是「非常遙遠的關係」。辯方提到楊曾到黎的大宅吃飯，黎則指，有一次他邀請不同的寫手到他家，希望邀請他們撰文評論中國時事，而楊只是其中一名獲邀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹曾供稱，黎於2019年7月赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧和美國國家安全顧問 John Bolton，回港後與他談論該次會面，又形容黎「幾雀躍」。黎智英則在庭上反駁：「我從沒有跟張談及我的個人事務。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹亦供稱，黎曾告訴他直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」邀請到美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 做嘉賓，張表達憂慮，惟黎回應：「佢哋（中共）咁搞我，我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」黎今在庭上反駁：「我從沒有與張談及 Jack Keane。我從沒有與他討論我的私事。」黎指 Jack Keane 是他的好友，他是否邀請對方出席節目，與張毫無關係，「我不明白我為何要跟他（張）討論。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方案情指黎透過飯盒會下達編採指示-黎智英飯盒會關於業務發展&quot;&gt;控方案情指黎透過「飯盒會」下達編採指示 黎智英：飯盒會關於業務發展&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「飯盒會」，控方案情指稱黎透過召開「飯盒會」，向《蘋果》高層下達編採指示。黎今稱，「飯盒會」是關於將《蘋果》轉型至網上媒體，屬於「業務發展會議」，而且除了《蘋果》之外，他與其他部門每隔六星期亦會開一次「飯盒會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹的證供指稱黎智英的編採指示之一是提倡「和勇不分」。黎則表示，他記得自己曾撰文提及「和勇不分」，但是如果指稱他在「飯盒會」中提及「和勇不分」的話，「我會有懷疑，因為飯盒會是關於業務發展。」但他不能百份百肯定自己有否說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英籲員工勿針對特朗普-因不能一方面要求援助另一方面卻對著幹&quot;&gt;黎智英籲員工勿針對特朗普 因不能一方面要求援助另一方面卻對著幹&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月2日，黎智英向台灣《蘋果》時任社長陳裕鑫發訊息，籲：「請國際組同事不要跟紐約時報及CNN針對川普，我們蘋果卻要靠川普政府支持保命，這樣做不太好。」相同訊息轉發至張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎解釋，這與「一人一信救香港」的意念相似，他當時相信時任美國總統特朗普會出手阻止《國安法》在香港生效，「如果《國安法》生效的話，《蘋果日報》便會完蛋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，黎認為特朗普會做什麼來阻止《國安法》通過。黎起初稱「特朗普會知道他該怎樣做」，後來在追問下，黎表示他不知道，也不能夠知道，「可能是對中國發出呼籲，對習近平發出呼籲，什麼也好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎會否視上述訊息為「編採指示」。黎表示：「我不認為它是編採指示。」他又說：「我當時提議這樣做（針對川普）不太好，這不是一個指示。」黎亦解釋，如果他們一方面發起「一人一信救香港」，呼籲特朗普援助，另一方面卻與特朗普對著幹，便會自相矛盾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，一直以來他覺得《蘋果》的國際版取態沒有問題，但是直到2020年6月香港踏入關鍵時刻，需要要求特朗普阻止《國安法》。辯方問為何《國安法》會影響到《蘋果》。黎說：「因為在《國安法》之下，我們沒有辦法去營運一間獨立媒體。往後發生的事件亦證明了我是對的。」辯方隨即指往後發生的事件與本案控罪時段無關，這是一個刑事審訊而不是政治審訊，籲黎將案發時段以外的事件拋諸腦後。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎接著說：「如果《國安法》生效的話，將會是香港言論自由的終結。」《蘋果》能夠生存下去的機會渺芒，所以希望特朗普能做一些事阻止《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英twitter帳戶由李兆富管理-包括追蹤其他人&quot;&gt;黎智英：Twitter帳戶由李兆富管理 包括追蹤其他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方開案陳詞指稱，黎智英的 Twitter 帳戶追蹤53個帳戶，包括時任美國副總統彭斯、時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧、時任台灣總統蔡英文、SWHK 和羅傑斯等。黎則稱，Twitter 帳戶是由李兆富（筆名利世民）替他開設、發帖和管理，追蹤別人帳戶也是由李負責，「我不知道怎樣追蹤。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認獄中指示員工照原來咁做-因國安法已生效猶如叫他們自殺&quot;&gt;黎否認獄中指示員工「照原來咁做」 因國安法已生效猶如「叫他們自殺」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於2020年12月開始還柙。張劍虹供稱，他在探監期間向黎請示「《蘋果日報》點樣運作落去」，當時黎說：「唔使怕，繼續做，繼續做落去，照原來咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上反駁，事前他得悉兩名兒子當天會來探望他，可是張臨時說要加入，黎當時以為張有緊要事想問他，結果三人一同探訪，但是張卻沒有任何問題，只是說了一些不重要的事情，而探訪時間只有15分鐘，「沒有時間去講其他事了。」黎稱他當時失去耐性，「為何你奪走我兒子的時間？」他稱該次探訪中沒有下達任何指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱，他曾寫信給《蘋果》員工，籲他們不要冒險，可是如果他下達指示叫他們「唔使怕，繼續做，繼續做落去，照原來咁做」，換言之就是叫他們冒險，並不合理，可是他不記得實際上自己有否如此說。他表示，他可能有說過「唔使怕，繼續做」，但是不會是「照原來咁做」，因《國安法》已經生效，如果叫員工「照原來咁做」的話，「我是在叫他們自殺。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an emergent policy consensus within the US that the period from 2027 to the early 2030s represents one of acute danger for Taiwan. This view was captured by former Commander US Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Philip Davidson, who predicted that an invasion of Taiwan by China is possible by 2027, a view echoed by other senior figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the US must commit substantial forces to deterrence or defence in the Indo- Pacific, this will have significant second-order effects within Europe. By the end of this decade, the partial reconstitution of Russian forces is likely, as is the growth of Russian capacity with respect to capabilities, such as nuclear submarines, which have not been impacted by the conflict in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines which US capabilities will be most relevant in an Indo- Pacific contingency, as well as which capabilities among these are fungible – that is, of utility both in Europe and in a Taiwan contingency. Its purpose is to identify areas where gaps are most likely to emerge in Europe’s defensive posture as a consequence of the potential reallocation of US capabilities. Its major findings are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To a large extent, the question of how an invasion of Taiwan might impact deterrence in Europe depends on US military strategy in the Indo-Pacific. A denial-orientated strategy creates far fewer gaps in a two-theatre posture than one that requires extensive strikes on the Chinese mainland, and is also likely to be more feasible militarily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD) involves very different capabilities in the two regions, as the critical assets that China will need to defend its amphibious shipping will be defended by air and maritime platforms, rather than by ground-based transport erector launchers. Munitions such as the AARGM, which are optimised against elusive targets, can be allocated to European defence if policy allows for it and if European air forces are adequately prepared for SEAD, without undermining the US in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated air and missile defence represents an especially fungible capability, and one that will be heavily strained by a two-theatre scenario. This is, however, more true of systems that enable tactical ballistic missile defence (BMD) and defence against air-breathing threats than it is for upper tier systems that enable theatre-level BMD. Russia’s lack of capability in intermediate-range ballistic missiles or medium-range ballistic missiles, and the time it would take to develop and scale these, mean that the Russian and Chinese missile arsenals present different problem sets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Resilient C4ISR and the organisational capital to enable its employment are a concern across both theatres.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While land forces are a less fungible capability, many of the enablers on which they depend, in terms of airlift and sealift as well as air defences, may be drawn on in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over recent years, predictions have been made by several senior US figures, including the former US Commander Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Philip Davidson and CIA Director William Burns, that China is likely to either invade Taiwan by 2027 or, at a minimum, wishes to have the option of doing so. This prediction, the so-called “Davidson Window”, has been reinforced by analysis that suggests that the period between the mid-2020s and the early 2030s represents one of acute vulnerability for Taiwan. One of the major factors behind this assessment is the fact that US capabilities in several key areas will reach a nadir in the late 2020s as older aircraft, surface vessels and submarines are retired, with replacement rates resulting in capability gaps that will not be filled until well into the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could mean, as some have argued, that the US will lack the capacity by itself to deter a peer and a near-peer competitor (China and Russia) simultaneously. If true, this would have considerable second-order effects on the deterrence of Russia in Europe if Russia either coordinated action with China or acted opportunistically during a crisis in Asia. While it is difficult to forecast with any certainty Russian decision-making during a hypothetical conflict over Taiwan, and much depends on the course of Russia’s war in Ukraine, there would be at least one structural incentive for Moscow to attempt to reorder Europe’s political arrangements during a clash in the Indo-Pacific. Russia could enjoy a transient window of military advantage over European states that face critical shortfalls in areas such as integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) and munitions stockpiles – even though longer-term trends would suggest its prospects for competing militarily with NATO are dim. Declining powers that face a combination of short-term opportunity and long-term decline tend to be especially risk acceptant. But this does not mean that a crisis in East Asia will automatically have second-order effects in Europe, as this will be determined by many contingent factors. Nevertheless, there are grounds for an assessment of the minimal capabilities required to maintain conventional deterrence within Europe in a context of US resources being severely overstretched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of how likely the prospect of a war in East Asia in the late 2020s might be, identifying which capability gaps could emerge within the European theatre if there were such a war can help to assess both those areas where the dependence of NATO on US capabilities represents an immediate point of fragility in the Alliance’s defence posture, and which dependencies can be offset by Europe on a longer-term basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important because not all military capability is fungible – that is, of utility both in Europe and in a Taiwan contingency. Factors such as the geography of a theatre and the operational plans that underpin a deterrent posture in each theatre have considerable salience. For example, it is unclear whether armour and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) have as much utility in a Sino-American conflict – a primarily maritime theatre – as they do in Europe (although both capabilities have a role in each theatre). It is for this reason that leaders have historically often engaged in target- or component-specific balancing – attempting to offset the component of an opponent’s power deemed most threatening to them, rather than the full suite of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bears consideration for several reasons. First, although there has been much discussion of potential US overstretch in the event of a two-war scenario, there is room for a more detailed discussion regarding precisely in which areas the US would find itself most heavily strained. Second, individual combatant commands typically draw up regional plans which, although not isolated from a wider global context (especially since the adoption of the 2018 National Defense Strategy), are primarily informed by regional considerations. In a context where historical two-war planning assumptions had been replaced by one-major-war assumptions, the question of competition for resources, both among combatant commands and between the US’s NATO and other commitments, could be safely ignored. This is no longer the case. In this regard, open source academic work can contribute to an understanding of the shared dependencies of individual combatant commands, as planning for multiple theatres again becomes de rigueur. Third, while European members of NATO and organisations such as SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) do have access to US planning assumptions to inform NATO’s Concept for Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA) family of plans, the very complexity of such plans makes assessing regional requirements complex in its own right, and leaves minimal spare capacity for secondary assessments about how dynamics in the Indo-Pacific might impact Europe. As such, a discussion of the interrelationships between theatre-level strategies can be informed by a wider public discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Whitehall Report summarises the findings from several roundtables held by RUSI in London in December 2023 with subject matter experts from a number of allied countries, focusing on European deterrence. It also summarises the results from formal combat modelling using tools such as Monte Carlo simulations, and desk-based analysis of historical analogous case studies and operations. The report does not seek to assess the precise quantity of any individual capability required in either Europe or the Indo-Pacific (although plausible estimates are used throughout). Rather, the report focuses on the question of how fungible specific capabilities are, and as a result how likely competing demand signals for their deployment would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter I examines the requirement from the Indo-Pacific in order to identify which US capabilities will be most critical in the event of a Taiwan contingency. Chapter II details the impact of this demand signal on the Allied posture in Europe. Its purpose is to examine which of the capabilities most needed in the Pacific are also relevant to European deterrence, and where the absence of US capabilities in Europe is both most likely and most impactful in the event of an Indo-Pacific contingency. The report concludes with a summary of the areas in which capabilities are likely to be rapidly exhausted by a contingency spanning two theatres and where they can be rationally allocated across two theatres without generating overstretch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-what-determines-the-demand-signal-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;I. What Determines the Demand Signal in the Indo-Pacific?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter focuses on the contours of a future conflict over Taiwan. It seeks to identify the specific US military capabilities that will be in greatest demand in the Pacific should such a conflict occur. It also aims to establish a basis for comparing the resource demands of the European and Indo-Pacific theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of which US assets will be most heavily stretched by the occurrence of two simultaneous conflicts in the Indo-Pacific and Europe will be determined by several key variables. Among them are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The preferred Chinese strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The preferred US response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach taken by China’s leaders to achieve any eventual military resolution of the Taiwan Strait question will be a major determinant of the options available to US decision-makers and thus the demands placed on their resources. There are several options available to China regarding Taiwan: a full-scale invasion; a blockade; or a limited-aims seizure of a specific outlying island, such as Qemoy or Matsu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report restricts its focus to a full-scale invasion for two reasons. First, this is the scenario most frequently discussed in the context of the purported “Davidson Window”. Second, there are few (if any) cases of states achieving decisive effects through either a blockade or a limited aim. While the authors regard the focus on a full-scale invasion to be defensible, it does narrow the focus of the report. It should also be noted that the report focuses specifically on the conventional balance. The subject of how China’s growing nuclear arsenal will impact deterrence in both theatres will, however, be the focus of subsequent RUSI research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is the question of the US preferred response. While this cannot be ascertained with certainty, the feasibility of various options is easier to scope. It looks increasingly unlikely that the original aims of concepts such as AirSea Battle in 2010, which would have seen the US conduct strikes at scale against the Chinese mainland, are viable. Some estimates suggest that a strike campaign to both blind China’s C4ISR and disrupt its major bases could, for example, require up to 28,000 precision-guided munitions for initial strikes and could – based on campaigns such as Operation Desert Storm – involve the targeting of 40,000 aim points. Not only is the sustainability of such a campaign questionable in terms of munitions stocks alone, but the ability of the US Navy and US Air Force (USAF) to maintain the required operational tempo to achieve it is debatable, if one assumes that the risk from China’s long-range strike capabilities means that forces must operate from greater distances. The likely expansion of China’s nuclear arsenal, and the fact that at least some elements of this arsenal will share both bases and command-and-control (C2) structures, will act as constraints in any strike campaign against the mainland. Nuclear weapons do not necessarily make a nation’s territory inviolable, but they do have the effect of making an opponent’s targeting decisions slower and more deliberate – which runs contrary to the tempo of activity required by a strike campaign at large scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it is presumed that the most viable approach likely to be available to the US is achieving sea denial within the Taiwan Strait. Since the loss of a considerable part of its amphibious lift capability would necessarily condemn a Chinese invasion to failure, the US does not necessarily need to strike the mainland at scale to defeat an invasion. The cost in munitions and the escalatory risk inherent in sea denial are considerably more manageable. A denial campaign need not eschew strikes on the mainland, but these strikes would probably occur on a more limited scale and only when necessary to enable attacks on China’s amphibious assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the position of states such as Japan will be of considerable significance. While support in line with the obligations Japan accepted under the 1997 US–Japan defence guidelines is likely, deeper involvement by Japan would have considerable effects, given that the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) fields what is still the region’s largest force of destroyers (other than that of the US Navy), as well as 22 attack submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resource-demands-of-a-taiwan-invasion&quot;&gt;Resource Demands of a Taiwan Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Opening Stage of an Invasion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any Chinese assault on Taiwan would be preceded both by political indicators and by a joint firepower strike operation combining ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and fixed-wing aircraft in both suppressive and attack roles against airbases, surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems and command nodes on both Taiwan and, in all likelihood, US airbases such as Kadena in Japan. A People’s Liberation Army (PLA) joint firepower strike operation is closely modelled on USAF operations during the Gulf War and would probably comprise functionally similar elements, although it is likely that the initial deep penetration provided by the F-117 would instead be provided by short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) such as the DF-15, and hypersonic glide vehicles such as the DF-17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China’s Amphibious Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan could then develop in several ways. The PLA could opt for an assault on a relatively broad front involving all or most of the 14 or so beaches on Taiwan that can support a landing at battalion scale or larger. This would have the advantage of imposing uncertainty regarding where to concentrate defending Taiwanese troops, much as the choice of five landing beaches and elaborate preceding deception operations set the conditions for Operation Overlord. Taiwan’s beaches are relatively narrow, and the PLA’s amphibious doctrine calls for combined arms battalions (the basic unit of force of the People’s Liberation Army Ground Force (PLAGF) and the People’s Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps (PLANMC)) to occupy 2–4 km in the assault, making an attack on multiple axes likely given the constrained geography of each individual landing site. That said, it should be noted that even if comparable in success to the 1991 Gulf War, a PLA joint firepower operation would last for several weeks and take more than a week to achieve air superiority (based on the air campaign during Desert Storm), giving Taiwan’s defenders time to prepare approaches to the island with several hundred mines in a short timeframe (assuming that Taiwan’s minelayers and submarines are not destroyed in port early). The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) fields a robust force of more than 40 mine countermeasure vessels, but these ships would have limited organic defences against surviving Taiwanese anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM) batteries. This in turn could incentivise an invasion plan that focuses on a smaller subset of beaches requiring fewer Q-routes (safe routes through minefields), making it less susceptible to disruption if too many mine countermeasure vessels are sunk in any one channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the PLAN will in the immediate term face limitations in terms of dedicated amphibious lift capabilities. China has the capability to field nine Type 071 landing platform docks, which can carry 65 armoured vehicles, as well as a further four Type 075 landing helicopter docks (LHDs), which can support amphibious assault with assault craft launched from their well decks and can also carry vertical lift assets (and, in the future, vertical take-off and landing UAVs). In addition, the PLAN fields a larger number of older amphibious vessels, such as the Type 072A and the Type 072III, which can carry 250 troops and 10 armoured vehicles each. Collectively, the PLAN fields 49 landing ship tanks across the Eastern and Southern theatre commands, with 57 across the force. Given that the PLAN built four Type 075s between 2019 and 2024, it is likely that it could expand its fleet of LHDs to roughly double by the end of the decade. However, even accounting for a considerable expansion, the size of an initial assault wave would be limited, given that even the Type 075 LHD could in principle carry most (but not all) of a PLA combined arms battalion’s armour, vehicles and troops. A battalion’s organic capabilities must nevertheless be carried on multiple vessels, and so the landing of a single battalion is expected to occur in several waves. Even a larger future PLAN amphibious lift capability would, then, have limited excess capacity relative to the magnitude of its tasks, and the loss of a portion of the force would condemn an invasion to failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been pointed out that a focus on dedicated landing vessels may substantially undervalue the PLAN’s aggregate strength because it ignores China’s efforts to prepare its civilian shipping industry to support amphibious operations in the Taiwan Strait. When China’s dual-use civilian vessels are incorporated into an analysis, the PLAN’s aggregate freight capacity almost trebles to 1.1 million tons. Based on assumptions derived from previous amphibious operations, this would imply an aggregate capability to move around 12 combined arms brigades across the Taiwan Strait in a single wave – in effect, all the amphibious-capable brigades of the PLANMC and the PLAGF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, outstanding questions regarding the use of non-dedicated vessels for sealift, although the PLAN does appear to be testing their potential for assault roles in exercises. Among them is whether such vessels are more suited to functions for joint logistics rather than the shore, which still appears to be the primary role for which the PLAN is rehearsing. The possibility that civilian vessels could considerably expand China’s amphibious lift therefore cannot be excluded. On balance, however, the loss of a significant part of an already limited fleet of dedicated amphibious vessels should condemn an invasion to failure, as these vessels will be critical to the success of an initial assault wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Airborne Forces in an Island Landing Campaign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) could also play a role in any amphibious assault, but only if China’s joint firepower operation succeeds. The PLAAF’s Airborne Corps comprises six combined arms brigades and one special operations forces brigade, supported by a fleet of 31 Y-20 transport aircraft and 20 Russian-made IL-76 airlifters, and a larger number of light Y-9 aircraft. These airborne brigades and their constituent battalions are equipped with the ZBD-03 armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) and both the 122-mm PL-96 and the 107-mm PH-63 MLRS. An airborne brigade’s table of organisation and equipment is comparable to that of a PLA medium combined arms brigade. There are, however, considerable differences between individual brigades. The 127th, 128th and 131st Brigades, for example, appear to be light motorised units equipped with all-terrain vehicles and can be paradropped. In addition, the 130th Combined Arms Brigade is air-assault capable and supported by roughly 41 Z-8KA, Z-9WZ and Z-10 utility, transport and attack helicopters. The heavier brigades equipped with the ZBD-03 AFV would probably be moved by IL-76 or Y-20 and would thus require motorised and air-assault units to have secured access to an airfield. In addition, the PLAGF fields two air-assault brigades that have exercised in tandem with the PLAAF Airborne Corps since 2021. According to PLA textbook The Science of Campaigns, airborne forces can support preliminary operations, such as deception and decapitation, or can enable the operational dislocation of an opponent through landings in depth and assault operations, where they would be a first echelon force tasked with seizing beach-heads. The Science of Campaigns is, however, realistic about the limitations of airborne assault, noting that absolute air superiority is required to enable airborne assaults, and that they should be treated as an essentially discretionary activity to be supported by four waves of attack aircraft for every one wave of transport. In effect, for airborne units to land freely, the PLAN and PLAAF require the ability to operate freely over Taiwanese airspace to an extent that would allow the suppression of both pop-up SAM threats and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADs). If this is lacking, it will prove difficult to seize airfields long enough for the heavier elements of a force to move, as illustrated by the Russian Airborne Forces at Hostomel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Determinants of Success for Attacker and Defender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even accounting for civilian lift and airborne forces, a considerably larger PLA first wave would be small relative to the Taiwanese armed forces, which would field a 90,000-strong defending land force. The historical average force-on-force ratio (1941–2002) for successful amphibious assaults is 1:5.29. There are notable exceptions, including the fall of Crete (1940) and the assault on Saipan (1944). In each of these cases, the success of the assault was enabled primarily by absolute air superiority on the side of the attacker. It is thus not unreasonable to conclude that anything short of air supremacy is a defeat condition for a PLA amphibious assault. Moreover, the small size of the force relative to the defender means that even limited losses of amphibious vessels can condemn an invasion to failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the dominant consideration will be whether the PLAN and the PLAAF can both secure air supremacy around Taiwan (at least for a time) and protect amphibious vessels against non-aerial methods of attack (mines and submarines).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first determinant will be whether the PLA is able to create an effective joint engagement zone (JEZ) in and around the Taiwan Strait to minimise the effects of cruise missile attacks on its dedicated amphibious vessels, which will remain crucial to ultimate success, even if augmented with civilian shipping. The PLAN currently fields 33 theatre air-defence vessels, such as the Type 052D guided missile destroyer (DDG) and the Type 055, and could field up to 50 by the end of the decade, based on the construction rates achieved by China in recent years. Vessels such as the Type 052D are equipped with the Type 346A active electronically scanned array antenna (AESA) radar and can carry long-range SAMs such as the HHQ-9, as well as shorter-range 16-km HHQ-6 missiles. China’s Type 055 cruiser is also equipped with an AESA and can quad pack shorter-range HHQ-6 SAMs in some of its 112 vertical launching system cells. Vessels such as the Type 052D and the Type 055 would likely be deployed in surface action groups (SAGs) both in the Taiwan Strait and east of Taiwan to create a layered air-defence network. Of particular significance to the PLAN would be closing off channels such as the Bashi Channel and northern approaches to the Taiwan Strait, through which ASCMs can travel without prior deconfliction with Taiwan’s own air defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the PLAAF is likely to fly patrols over the Taiwan Strait. Since the mid-2000s, Chinese fighters such as the J-10, J-11 and J-16 have fielded the PL-12, an air-to-air missile (AAM) with a profile comparable to the AIM-120, which probably uses an imported seeker from the Russian R-77 AAM. This interceptor will probably be replaced by the PL-15, a longer-range missile with an onboard AESA radar comparable to the AIM-120C/D AAM. While not primarily built for cruise missile intercept in the vein of the Russian MIG-31, these aircraft can contribute to defensive counter-air missions in and around the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, many of China’s ground-based SAMs would have limited utility in protecting amphibious vessels. While the notional range of a system such as the HQ-9 SAM theoretically allows it to cover most of the Taiwan Strait, in practice constraining factors such as the limitations imposed on radar by the curvature of the Earth when tracking low altitude targets will come into play. Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) such as the KJ-2000 could be used to provide line of sight, but as illustrated by the Russian air campaign in Ukraine, AWACS can be vulnerable to electronic attack and, by virtue of being large high-flying aircraft, can also be intercepted at long distances by the long-range SAMs on US DDGs. Russia also struggles to cue ground-based air defence systems with its A-50 Mainstay AWACS due to the fact that data transfers are mediated by combined arms army headquarters, a problem that may also be inherent in PLA C2, in which a joint theatre command plays a central role. That said, Russian air defences in Ukraine have scored very long-range intercepts against low-flying aircraft cued by S-band radar, such as the Podolet-K1 radar, as well as by passive coherent location, and it is likely that Chinese ground-based SAMs can rely on their own onboard radar to conduct engagements based on less detailed feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is possible, it is unlikely to be a reliable mechanism for defeating low-flying ASCMs. As such, the utility of long-range SAMs such as HQ-9 and S-400 for maritime air defence is likely to be attenuated. Shorter-range systems, such as the 40-km HQ-16 SAM, are of even more limited utility, although these systems will play an important role in protecting amphibious vessels from being struck in port, either by Taiwanese systems such as the Hsiung Feng-II anti-ship missile system, or by US standoff munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could attempt to secure islands such as Penghu ahead of an assault on Taiwan and build them into air-defence bastions, although their limited space and mountainous geography, as well as their proximity to the mainland (and thus a range of attack vectors), are complicating factors. Notably, as recently as a decade ago the PLA doctrinally subdivided zones of responsibility for SAM fighter aircraft and vessels and emphasised SAM ambushes and point defence for ground-based air-defence systems. While this might have changed, the limitations of China’s capacity to integrate the different service level air-defence capabilities that drove this delineation may persist. Even if cued by a US-style cooperative engagement capability, the PLAAF ground-based air-defence systems would depend on maritime and air assets for cueing and could not play an independent role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a Chinese integrated air defence system (IADS) comprising primarily maritime and air elements performs robustly, the number of cruise missiles required to inflict crippling damage on an invading fleet will be substantial. For example, a 2009 RAND study calculated that roughly 52 out of a notional force of 100 PLA amphibious vessels, which China was assumed to have by 2020 (larger, it turns out, than the PLAN today possesses, but perhaps a realistic figure for 2027–30), would need to be sunk or mission killed to prevent the PLA from concentrating roughly 60,000 troops on Taiwan over several trips. The historical average hit rate for cruise missiles against defended targets is around 0.26, and it is likely that, at least for larger vessels, more than one ASCM will be required to achieve either a mission kill or a sinking. A success rate of 80% is also the peak rate achieved by the land-based Ukrainian IADS against missiles such as the Kalibr and the KH-101 cruise missile around Kyiv. Some studies suggest the effectiveness of an Aegis-like system against cruise missiles is probably higher, with vessels enjoying a single-shot probability of kill (SSPK) of 0.95, though this may not be realistic under combat conditions. Moreover, there are factors other than active defence that are relevant. For example, soft-kill measures against missile seekers with the aim of either jamming or spoofing them are likely to increase in effectiveness as a conflict progresses, since the PLAN will be exposed to the seeker frequencies of US missiles. The PLA will use maritime militia vessels as decoys to generate maritime clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing on US Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, even a strategy focused on the relatively modest goal of sea denial would see a significant section of US anti-surface warfare capabilities drawn to the region. It is not inconceivable that up to 1,000 ASCMs would be required by the US and Taiwan to cripple an invasion fleet. The US plans to export 400 Harpoon ASCMs to Taiwan and will field 450 long-range anti-ship missiles (LRASMs) by the end of the decade, along with older Harpoon ASCMs and joint air-to-surface standoff missiles (JASSMs), which potentially have anti-ship functionality. However, the utility of the JASSM as an anti-ship missile is open to debate, while stocks of Harpoon will be nearing the end of their service lives, resulting in the US facing a shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other anti-ship options are also possible, including the SM-6, the Naval Strike Missile (in service with the US Marine Corps) and Maritime Strike Tomahawk. This adds considerable capacity as, to use one example, 825 SM-6 missiles have been delivered to the US Navy to date. However, many of these systems are dual use (SM-6 is also an air-defence asset, while Tomahawk has a land-attack role), so their employment as anti-ship missiles involves trade-offs in an environment where US vessels will come under heavy attack from the PLA’s missile arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limiting Factors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch platforms and tempo of activity represent a particularly acute limiting factor, given the risks that platforms such as vessels and aircraft take if they operate within a Chinese anti-access area-denial system comprised of long-range strike assets such as the DF-17 hypersonic boost glide missile and the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (although the range of cruise missiles such as the LRASM mitigates these risks somewhat). The tempo at which successful strikes would need to be delivered would strain the US military, but this will be compounded if aircraft such as the F/A-18 (one of the platforms on which the LRASM is carried) have to take off from greater distances and rely on enablers such as tankers, against which the PLA is optimising fighter aircraft such as the J-20 to conduct long-range intercepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-ship missiles are not the only means of sinking vessels available to the US and Taiwan. Although the relatively shallow waters of the Taiwan Strait are not optimal for nuclear attack submarines (SSNs), attack submarines such as the Seawolf class are built to operate in shallow waters if necessary. Moreover, the layout of an air-defence screen for a Chinese landing force would probably require at least some Chinese surface combatants to operate in what PLA doctrine describes as a “forward-edge” defence role beyond the first island chain, in which SSNs are likely to be considerably more lethal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More modern Chinese ships, such as the Type 055, are equipped with credible sensor suites, including both hull-mounted and towed array sonar, as well as the capacity to host two Z-20F helicopters, and some Chinese scholars argue that the assumption that the PLAN’s surface vessels are vulnerable to submarines is incorrect. The PLAN also fields the region’s largest fleet of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) frigates, such as the Type 054A/B along with 76 Type 056 corvettes, which can be used as active emitters, given their relative expendability, although active sonar has its own limitations. China still maintains a relatively limited number of key assets, such as the Y-8Q maritime patrol aircraft (MPA), and the limited evidence of China exercising the coordinated use of ASW assets through synthetic training of MPA crews is showing a growing emphasis on realism. While the PLAN likely has excellent situational awareness in certain areas such as the South China Sea, where it maintains a robust network of sensors, beyond the first island chain it probably faces limitations. These include limited numbers of MPAs, a relative lack of high-endurance helicopters (although this gap is now being filled by the Z-18F) and noisy SSNs, which will be uncompetitive beyond the first island chain. Recent studies examining the difficulties Chinese submariners face on longer deployments also highlight a degree of institutional inexperience. There are, however, offsetting US challenges – namely the fact that, by 2027, the US submarine fleet is likely to reach a nadir in terms of the number of boats at its disposal (with the US Navy likely to field 48 boats at the end of the decade, despite a formal requirement for 66). This force will need to track and contain China’s own SSKs (diesel-electric submarines specialised for anti-submarine duties) and SSNs, in addition to performing offensive functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics and specific characteristics of a Sino-American competition below the waves cannot easily be addressed in detail – the key inputs are too sensitive to approach with open source analysis. However, the determinants of success for each side can more readily be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Determinants of US Subsea Success&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the US, the employment of SSNs would probably serve several purposes – deep strike, attacks on PLAN SAGs and controlling chokepoints through which the PLA’s SSKs and SSNs might seek transit, and direct attacks on an amphibious force. In addition, SSN operations in the South China Sea might represent a means of diverting Chinese resources. The key constraint that the US will face is that with the exception of deep strike and the elimination of an outer layer of SAGs, many of the missions that SSNs will perform may also require them to transit chokepoints such as the Bashi Channel, over which the PLA could plausibly have early air and naval control, while shallower transit routes will likely be mined by the PLAN’s own submarines. The constraint of geography does not necessarily mean that submarine activity will stop, but it can certainly be slowed if SSNs need to account for minefields and SQ-5 active sonobuoys, laid by both MPAs and Z-18 helicopters. While the ability of the PLAN to detect quiet SSNs is likely to be limited, it should be noted that combat modelling from the Cold War era suggests that in constrained and heavily mined waters the attrition rates of even a force that enjoys a considerable advantage in quietness will be difficult to sustain over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, even successful submarine campaigns have high attrition rates – for example, during the Second World War the US Navy lost 52 of the 248 submarines it deployed to the Pacific, in what is generally regarded as one of history’s most successful submarine campaigns. At least some attrition should be anticipated, irrespective of US advantages, which will lead to a demand for the reallocation of SSNs from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the ledger, the US Navy will need to bottle the PLAN’s fleet of SSKs and SSNs within the first island chain to protect its own surface forces in the Pacific from the PLAN’s 48 SSKs and six SSNs. While the Type 093 SSN is still a noisy platform relative to Western and Russian analogues, the PLAN’s SSKs are both quiet and, in the case of the newer Type 039C class, equipped with air-independent propulsion, which increases endurance. China faces constraints, including a requirement for its submarines to transit the same limited number of chokepoints to attack forces beyond the first island chain. However, if the US faces a requirement to track multiple contacts in a crisis escalating to conflict (during which submarines cannot be engaged at chokepoints) this will prove resource intensive. For example, three MPAs are required to maintain a single aircraft on station over a 12-hour period, and once an MPA makes contact with a submarine, tracking it often requires either a surface vessel or a submarine to be devoted to the task over an extended period – spreading resources thin in the early stages of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air Supremacy Over the Taiwan Strait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the air, the degree to which the US and its allies view air superiority over the Taiwan Strait as a prerequisite for operational success will be a major consideration. In theory, the PLA has a greater requirement for air supremacy than any US-led coalition. Since the PLA is unlikely to achieve a 3:1 numerical advantage on the ground early in an assault, airpower, both fixed wing and helicopters, will be a crucial force multiplier. This is noted in a number of Chinese publications on the subject of amphibious assault, which stress the importance of capabilities such as LHDs, which can launch both helicopters and vertical take-off and landing UAVs to augment fixed-wing aircraft. It is acknowledged, however, that the range of capabilities that can enable beyond-visual-range engagements will mean that control of the air will probably be temporally and spatially bounded. The PLAAF has been steadily improving its direct-attack capabilities over the past two decades. The J-10 series is equipped with the K/JDC01A targeting and laser designator pod to enable the use of precision-guided munitions, and China’s Flanker derivative, the J-16, is equipped with the YINGS-III pod, which is a rough analogue to the USAF’s Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod. In addition, helicopters of the PLAGF, such as the Z-10 and Z-19, can contribute to the suppression of shore-based defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this depends, however, on the ability of the PLAAF and the PLAN to achieve at least temporary air supremacy over the Taiwan Strait and any likely landing sites. The survival of Taiwan’s air defences as at least a “pop-up” threat, as well as the ability of the US Navy and USAF to mount offensive counter-air operations over the Strait would, in principle, be sufficient to deny the PLAAF the freedom of action needed to deliver a breakthrough, much in the way that Ukraine was able to deny the VKS (Russian Aerospace Forces) air superiority for the first two years of the war in Ukraine. This depends, however, on the ability of the US Navy and USAF to sustain a tempo of activity and level of attrition necessary to give the People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) and the PLAAF an incentive to limit their operations over the Strait, while themselves being forced to operate at greater ranges due to the land-based missile threat. In 2015, research conducted by RAND suggested that the likelihood of the US achieving either air superiority or a victory sufficient to drive the PLAAF from the Taiwan Strait would be constrained if the distance from which platforms would need to operate increased, as it necessarily would if the tempo of US air sorties was lowered by the requirement to keep aircraft carriers out of range of the DF-17 and DF-21D. This in turn might lead to the inference that an offensive counter-air campaign cannot be effective unless the sortie rates of the PLAAF and the PLANAF are also lowered, necessitating strikes on the Chinese mainland and an enabling suppression of enemy air defences (SEAD) effort. For example, capabilities such as cruise missile submarines (SSGNs) equipped with the US Navy’s new hypersonic glide vehicle might be used to create gaps in the Chinese IADS, which aircraft could temporarily exploit, provided that they receive real-time targeting data from offboard sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air Defence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if pervasive ISR can be delivered, the types of missiles likely to penetrate an IADS without robust enablement (such as the US hypersonic Dark Eagle) are likely to be scarce, relative to their targets. Limited SEAD using expensive munitions such as the Dark Eagle (which will be launched from Virginia-class SSGNs if cued by offboard sources) might open gaps in an IADS to enable the use of slower long-range standoff capabilities such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile or strategic bombers to suppress airbases. While disrupting air activity is likely to be important, any effort to achieve this on a consistent basis would require US aircraft to sortie even further than they would need to in the context of offensive/defensive counter-air (OCA/DCA) missions over Taiwan, as some elements of an air defence network would be inland. Moreover, the amount of payload required to cause irreparable damage to an airbase is considerable. For example, Shayrat Airbase in Homs, Syria was made functional again in just a day despite being hit with 58 cruise missiles. In this context, a SEAD and strike campaign to disrupt the 32 PLAAF airbases within 800 km of Taiwan would be functionally indistinguishable from AirSea Battle as originally envisioned, and thus as difficult to resource. An air and naval force that can conduct such a campaign can achieve the much more modest goal of OCA/DCA over Taiwan (which would probably condemn an invasion to failure) with relative ease, making strikes inland at large scale superfluous, given how critical air superiority is to the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments regarding the tempo of activity required to achieve a successful DCA effort can be contested if the object of the effort is presumed to be air denial. First, the figures that were deemed to determine success in previous analysis were based on air superiority, not denial per se, and thus set a high bar for the levels of attrition the US Navy and USAF need to inflict (and thus the number of sorties required). Successful air-denial campaigns such as North Vietnam’s defence of Hanoi during the Vietnam War and the Egyptian defence during the early days of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 inflicted considerably less attrition – roughly 4% per sortie in each case – before air operations were either temporarily deemed prohibitively difficult or had to be enabled in ways that reduced the overall tempo of activity to the point of operational ineffectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the impact of Taiwan’s own SAM network, comprised of systems such as Patriot and the TK-III, must also be considered. This network could certainly be crippled early in a conflict, particularly if its constituent sensors emitted to defend high-value targets against ballistic missiles, but elements could also be conserved to present a pop-up threat to aircraft near likely landing sites. The US Navy’s own SAGs would also likely be able to inflict attrition on PLA aircraft from beyond the first island chain. Although the effective range of SAM systems such as the SM-2 and SM-6 will be constrained by factors such as target altitude, they are likely to inflict attrition on PLA fast air, especially as the latter moves beyond the first island chain to engage tankers and AWACS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional reason for a focus on denial over the Taiwan Strait is that the ISR required to sustain attacks on the mainland cannot be assured, although steps are being taken to make it more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US operates a diverse list of ISR capabilities in the air and in space. In the air, both autonomous systems and crewed aircraft, such as the U-2, can provide rapidly deployable reconnaissance. In 2019, the USAF was reported to have “425 manned and unmanned aircraft of 14 different types” at its disposal for data collection, although not all of these will necessarily be survivable in a hostile IADS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast ISR infrastructures in space are constantly being diversified to meet the new realities of the space age – the emergence of commercial actors and the continuous threat against space systems. The US National Reconnaissance Office is responsible for spy satellites, and is already working on a more proliferated infrastructure, which may hint at the placement of satellites in different orbits to cover different purposes. While satellites in higher orbits (such as Medium Earth Orbit, from 2,000 km and above) can cover wider regions, satellites in lower orbits (low earth orbit (LEO), below 2,000 km) can provide more detailed and perhaps more tactically relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the availability of persistent ISR against elusive targets cannot be assumed. US dependence on space assets and pervasive ISR more broadly presents a potential weakness. The PLA is growing increasingly reliant on its own space weapons, including in the targeting realm. Moreover, many of the large, fixed-wing ISR assets on which the US’s way of war has depended thus far will not be survivable in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space Warfare Aspects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space systems – the satellite in orbit, the ground station on Earth and the signals in between – are all vulnerable to attack. In terms of disrupting ISR assets, satellites could be interfered with temporarily or permanently through laser dazzling or a cyber attack. At the extreme end of the spectrum, the satellite could be permanently damaged through a high-altitude nuclear explosion or a kinetic kill through either a co-orbital weapon or a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile. China’s capabilities in that realm are not entirely clear, partly because they have not yet been demonstrated in a war. According to Chinese reports, however, a successful laser blinding test of a Chinese satellite at 600 km altitude was carried out as early as 2005. It is unclear whether this technology has since been used against non-Chinese assets. China also has the capability to kinetically destroy satellites – at least in LEO. Permanent interference with systems – either through a close proximity manoeuvre, a kinetic kill or a nuclear detonation, is theoretically possible, and in the case of China, practically possible as well, although these operations have mixed tactical utility. As such, a complete denial of ISR in the Pacific should not be assumed. Even so, the pervasive ISR needed to track transport erector launchers (TELs), which can move at relatively short notice (typically 15 minutes after a launch), will be difficult to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of commercial assets might add some resilience to surveillance networks. The US Space Force has made it clear that it wants to work more closely with commercial providers. Even if the PLA managed to destroy several sovereign ISR satellites, the number of missiles required would create so much debris that Chinese space assets in that orbit would most likely be adversely affected as well. For example, in 2024 the US Space Force published a commercial space strategy outlining how collaboration with the commercial space sector was going to be integrated in the future. The Space Force had already begun experimenting with a so-called “Space Tactical Layer”, which would integrate commercial satellite images “to improve battlespace awareness and expand its beyond-line-of-sight targeting capability”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while the challenge of counter-space capabilities does not imply a complete denial of information, the level of low-latency ISR required to sustain a full-scale strike campaign against elusive targets is unlikely to be available. Strikes on the Chinese mainland will likely be a component of any US campaign, but their scale and tempo will probably be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the more modest aim of denying the PLAN and the PLAAF freedom of the skies is the primary operational aim, many of the challenges associated with tracking elusive targets inland and projecting power are less salient. Moreover, the tyranny of distance is less relevant if the US Navy and USAF are primarily operating either over the Taiwan Strait or as carriers of standoff missiles. To be clear, this report is not arguing that the US will necessarily achieve with ease the tempo of activity required to deny the PLA air superiority, merely that attacks on the mainland will not be determinative of their ability to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-implications-for-europe&quot;&gt;II. Implications for Europe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter focuses on how the resource demands placed on the US in a Taiwan Strait contingency might affect conventional deterrence in Europe. Per the NATO Strategic Concept and the DDA family of plans, the Alliance must prepare for war at large scale on its eastern flank. A low-probability, high-impact contingency, which might focus contingency planning, would be a full-scale Russian invasion of the Baltic states, which has been discussed in some detail. Moreover, while some might challenge the realism of the Baltic case, it is still useful as a means of stress-testing European capabilities and baselining requirements for high-end warfighting in the event of a commitment of US capabilities elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter does not seek to provide an exhaustive overview of every aspect of a potential clash between NATO and Russia, nor their specific dynamics. These details are highly contingent. Rather, its purpose is to examine how chosen US and Chinese strategies in the Indo-Pacific might have an impact upon specific sub-components of the aggregate military balance in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion covers several areas. First, it analyses the impact of an Indo-Pacific campaign on the capacity of NATO to support a SEAD campaign in Europe. This is a clear priority, given that airpower represents the Alliance’s most viable means of offsetting the challenge of Russian combat mass on the ground. With more than 2,000 fourth-generation combat aircraft across the Alliance (excluding the US), European NATO has, in principle, the capacity to inflict a level of attrition comparable to that achieved in 1991 in Iraq, where allied airpower inflicted 24% attrition on the Republican Guard before it made contact with coalition ground forces. This depends, however, on the ability to attrit a dense multilayered Russian IADS built to preclude precisely this eventuality, and the success or failure of a campaign in Europe will depend in no small measure on whether this is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the availability of air and missile defences is examined, for several reasons. One reason is that Russian military scholarship has over the past decades placed a considerable emphasis on “non-contact warfare” – the ability to see and strike in depth. Russia views long-range strike as vital, both to its efforts to limit the impact of NATO airpower through suppression on the ground and to its ability to force war termination on favourable terms by targeting critical national infrastructure (CNI). Moreover, the threat of ballistic missiles at key chokepoints, such as railheads and bridges, will be a limiting factor for the rapid deployment of ground forces, as well as for the tempo of air activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s submarine fleet will play several functions in any conflict, acting not only as part of any strike campaign, with its new Yasen-class SSGNs, but also as a threat to allied sea lines of communication and CNI. The ability of NATO to contain the Northern Fleet is thus the third priority area on which this chapter focuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the chapter examines the impact of an Indo-Pacific contingency on the land component of Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s (SACEUR) forces within the NATO area of responsibility, given the centrality of combat on the ground to deterring Russia, and since the land domain may be an area where trade-offs and resource constraints can most easily be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-differences-between-sead-across-regions&quot;&gt;Potential Differences Between SEAD Across Regions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree to which SEAD in each region is dependent on the same sets of enablers is, fundamentally, a function of the chosen US approach in the Indo-Pacific. This stems from the fact that, in the early stages of a conflict over Taiwan, the IADS protecting an invasion force will be primarily comprised of maritime theatre air-defence platforms such as the Type 055 and Type 052D, as well as aircraft. Although the ability of the PLAN and the PLAAF to form a single JEZ is disputed, it is reasonable to assume that the PLA will accomplish similar effects to the Russian army’s SAM systems and the aircraft of the VKS in Ukraine. While China fields an increasingly robust array of ground-based SAM systems, including the indigenous HQ-9 and the Russian S-400, the degree to which these systems could provide coverage to a PLAN force from the Chinese mainland is likely to be limited, for reasons discussed in Chapter I and briefly restated here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against low-flying targets such as cruise missiles, the radar horizon is still a factor that prevents missiles from being used at their theoretical maximum ranges. While capabilities such as AWACS can be used to cue ground-based SAM systems, the difficulties of doing so have been outlined in Chapter I. Additionally, these systems are large, difficult to hide and at the time of writing limited in number and likely to be targets for any US OCA campaign, as well as for strike assets built specifically to penetrate a Chinese IADS from standoff distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in turn means that SEAD in the Taiwan Strait is not primarily a function of finding and engaging elusive targets such as TELs. Rather, SEAD is largely synonymous with anti-surface warfare and OCA. If the picket of destroyers and cruisers protecting an invasion force suffers substantial losses and if PLA aircraft, including AWACS, cannot freely operate over the Strait, the amphibious vessels on which an invasion defends are much less defensible, with the probability of successful cruise missile strikes against them rising to 0.4–0.8. The challenge is not that targets are elusive, but rather that they are exceedingly well defended. Chinese analysts’ assumptions, for example, are that sinking a modern destroyer requires a combination of six ASCMs flying at different speeds and altitudes, as well as an anti-ship ballistic missile. Notably, these assessments are often based on overwhelming hard-kill systems and typically do not account for the fact that vessels have robust soft-kill mechanisms, including jamming and deployable digital radio frequency memory decoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, SEAD in the European context is primarily a function of the ability to suppress or destroy a layered network of elusive and mobile ground-based SAM systems. The outer layer of this network comprises shorter-range systems such as the SA-11 and the SA-15, with longer-range systems such as the SA-20/23 (S-300-PMU-2/S-300VM) and the SA-21 (S-400) positioned to the rear. Longer-range systems, by virtue of being able to emit, allow shorter-range systems to engage without turning on their own radar. Furthermore, systems such as the SA-22 Pantsir can act as shorter-range point defences against incoming munitions and UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description, while a simplification, captures an inherent challenge of contending with the Russian IADS. To safely and consistently engage long-range SAM systems in rear areas, a larger number of elusive targets that form the outer layer of the network must first be destroyed. However, the task of attacking those short- and medium-range systems at the front edge of the IADS is greatly complicated by the presence of the long-range systems that enable short-range systems to engage without emitting. The long-range ISR platforms that enable the mapping and targeting of SAM systems in an IADS, such as the E-3 AWACS and E-8 JSTARS (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System), are at risk of being engaged at extended distances by SAM systems such as the S-400. While missiles such as the 40N6 cannot be consistently cued at their maximum ranges (400 km) against low-flying aircraft (although they can intermittently conduct engagements at very long ranges), they can effectively engage larger targets at the extent of their range. Moreover, anti-radiation missiles designed for SEAD, such as the AGM-88 HARM, are both vulnerable to attrition by point defences and less effective when their target radars do not have to emit because they are receiving external cueing. As a consequence, they can be expended in unsustainable numbers. In the 1999 air war over Kosovo, for example, the Alliance expended 815 AGM-88 HARMs against a much weaker opponent. The resulting requirement is for munitions with both the low-radar cross-section needed to penetrate an IADS and the sophisticated seekers (typically either dual-mode or millimetric wave radar) needed to engage mobile targets when they have stopped emitting. Munitions in this category include the AARGM-ER and the SPEAR 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, then, SEAD in the Indo-Pacific need not draw on the same munitions and enablers as SEAD/DEAD in Europe. The latter will depend on allied fleets of fifth-generation aircraft (which are the only air capability that can be employed at acceptable risk against an IADS) being equipped with sufficient stocks of munitions such as the ARRGM-ER, built to track elusive TEL and radar (TELAR) and mobile radar systems. These munitions have limited utility against SAGs, given their smaller payloads and the comparatively short distances from which they must be launched. While the functionality of munitions such as the AARGM-ER against ships has in theory been proven, the payload of the missile does not correspond to those needed to either inflict a mission kill on or sink a major surface combatant. Top attack against a vessel’s radar might be considered, but even a low-radar cross-section missile is vulnerable to being engaged by the point defence systems on a ship if it travels relatively high to engage a radar. Moreover, the launch ranges of the AARGM-ER would require aircraft carrying them to fly in areas where they are not only at risk from destroyers themselves but are also likely to engage in air-to-air combat with the PLAN and the PLAAF. In this context, the AARGM-ER will compete for rail space with air-to-air interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement to support two SEAD campaigns need not necessarily impose an unacceptable munition strain on the US if it supports allies in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. However, this does not take into account the several other aspects of a credible SEAD capability currently lacking in European air forces, including the need to prioritise training for SEAD missions over other competencies. A purely materiel-focused deduction that could be drawn, however, is that the various gaps in European SEAD capability platforms and training represent a more acute issue than munitions, given the inherent differences in SEAD across the two theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several caveats worth noting. First, the above analysis is entirely premised on the assumption that sea denial, rather than overmatch, is the chosen US approach. In this context, the determinant of success is ultimately the ability to set the conditions for sinking enough amphibious vessels to make an invasion unviable, not to comprehensively defeat the PLA to force China’s leaders to negotiate. If it is deemed that war termination requires the ability to escalate against the Chinese mainland, for example because the PLA responds to failure by shifting to a blockade or a strategic bombardment, the same munitions and aircraft needed for SEAD in Europe will also be required in the Indo-Pacific. However, for the reasons outlined in Chapter I, it is deemed unlikely that this will be a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there will probably be ground-based SAM systems set up on islands such as the Pescadores if the PLA takes them, meaning that the suppression of systems such as the HQ-9 and the HQ-16 will not be entirely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A maritime SEAD campaign will draw on stocks of other capabilities such as ASCMs and submarines, among other things, all of which will be important in Europe. Although limited in size and complexity, Russian surface combatants can pose a threat at operational ranges from positions near their bastions, such as Kaliningrad, using 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missiles. While unlikely to be decisive, this could well result in a political demand to engage Russian surface combatants within well-defended bastions from which they launch cruise missiles that will draw on limited stocks of ASCMs, as well as capabilities such as SSKs and SSNs. While exact stocks of anti-ship missiles held by European states are unknown, several European navies have temporarily plugged the gap in this capability. Interestingly, one of the most pressing gaps that a US SEAD/DEAD campaign in the Pacific might create in Europe is a gap in surface lethality in the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iamd-a-capacity-challenge-across-the-board&quot;&gt;IAMD: A Capacity Challenge Across the Board&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IAMD represents a capability that is especially fungible and likely to be in high demand across the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic. Russian and Chinese concepts for future warfare envision long-range precision strike playing a prominent role, although Russia tends to accord a more prominent role to countervalue targeting than does China. Illustrative of the prominence of deep strike in Russian concepts of operations is the fact that Russia had by 2023 expended over 5,000 cruise and ballistic missiles in the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, Russia faces a larger target set with considerably more strategic depth. Unlike the Indo-Pacific, the European theatre has far more airfields from which NATO’s jets or aircraft can operate, making near-complete airbase suppression, as contemplated by the PLA in the Pacific, nearly impossible for Russia to achieve. Within 500 km of Russian-held territory, however, the threat is more acute, and will require the use of airfields in the west of SACEUR’s area of responsibility and thus increase the Alliance’s reliance on tanker aircraft. There are also individual points of failure within allied air forces. For example, Automatic Logistics Information System terminals, which enable the mission planning and logistical support on which the F-35 depends, are held at a limited number of airbases, many of which have undergone public and expensive conversions to host the F-35. Moreover, Russia’s doctrinal commitment to striking CNI as a means of forcing de-escalation would probably impose competition for resources between NATO as an alliance and those nations that must ultimately make voluntary contributions to its air defences. The logic of Alliance-level planning would incentivise the protection of military assets, which in turn would enable the prosecution of an effective war effort. But national political imperatives may dictate otherwise, creating a risk of competition for scarce IAMD assets. In the close battle, Russia can generate a dense multi-tiered threat comprising short-range ballistic missiles such as the 9M723, cruise missiles, loitering munitions and fixed-wing aircraft launching unguided glide bombs such as the FAB-500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the air threat is a challenge across both theatres, there are differences between the IAMD requirements that bear consideration. Russia does not field a credible intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), having cancelled the RS-26 in 2017, and it would struggle to increase IRBM production in less than a decade, given its production rates for more mature SRBMs. As such, beyond 500 km the Russian threat is effectively a cruise missile threat. This means that certain interceptor types, including exoatmospheric and high endoatmospheric interceptors, such as the SM-3IIA and systems such as THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), are far more relevant to the Indo-Pacific than they are to Europe – although, as will be discussed, longer-range ballistic missile defence (BMD) systems will be of use in Europe to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary BMD challenge facing Europe is SRBMs. Although the KH-47M2 Kinzhal can be used at operational depth, doing so risks the bomber or fighter aircraft carrying it. Russia is developing IRBMs, but the development cycle for missiles typically exceeds a decade, and further time elapses before they are fielded in numbers. In the first year of the war in Ukraine, Russia fired 700 Iskander SRBMs (135 in the first month), and in 2023 appeared to be producing cruise and ballistic missiles at a rate of 40 per month. The 9M723, which can dispense six radar decoys in its terminal phase, is a challenging SRBM to intercept, and the task is likely to require millimetric wave seekers such as the Ka-band seeker of the PAC-3 or the Aster-30 Block 1NT. This will create a considerable demand for hit-to-kill interceptors, although this demand will be bounded by the duration of a SEAD campaign, after which missile launchers can be more readily attacked before missile launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expenditure Rates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expenditure rates on interceptors are dependent on several factors, including shot doctrine and the rate at which launchers can be engaged before launch by aircraft and ground-based weapons, which is likely to increase as the IADS protecting them is diminished. For example, a two-shot doctrine (independently firing two interceptors for any given target) and a “shoot–look–shoot” doctrine, in which a second interceptor is only employed if the first fails, see 2 and 1.1 interceptors fired per target respectively to achieve a 0.99 probability of kill (Pk), while other studies suggest considerably more, with up to eight interceptors needed for certainty of kill with an SSPK of 0.5 (although this assumes a low SSPK, and very demanding criteria for success). Applied to the European theatre, more modest assumptions could still mean a requirement for anywhere between 770 and 1,400 hit-to-kill interceptors in the first month of a conflict if Russia expends Iskander at the rate it has in Ukraine. While the US current production rate for PAC-3 MSE interceptors is 500 per year, with an aspiration for 870, this capacity will be drawn on by a number of commitments, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, foreign military sales and the Indo-Pacific. In 2022, the US entire stock of PAC-3 MSE was 1,600 interceptors. However, over time the effects of a successful SEAD campaign should make launchers considerably vulnerable to pre-launch interception and would, moreover, undercut the ground campaign that ballistic missiles support. There is no automatic reason to assume a SEAD campaign will succeed, of course, but if it does not, the problem facing the Alliance is wider than the missile threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is considerable risk of capacity strains with respect to hit-to-kill interceptors. There are, however, differences between the European and Indo-Pacific theatres in this respect. Longer-range interceptors such as the SM-2 and the Aster-30 Block1NT can be relevant in each context, but to very different degrees. In Europe, there are no IRBM or medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) threats against which longer-range interceptors will be prerequisites. What long-range hit-to-kill interceptors could provide, however, is a means of considerably reducing the point defence burden. Even a marginally resourced first layer against SRBMs can considerably reduce the burden on point defences. This is partly a function of the fact that early interception can prevent the deployment of countermeasures and partly the fact that shot doctrines, which conserve interceptors, are more viable in a layered defensive system. As a notional example, the requirement for shorter-range defences can be reduced by 75% from the ability to engage half the incoming targets with an outer defensive layer, at a cost which is in aggregate lower than a single-layer system. What this means in practice is that the rate of expenditure of a European IAMD network against ballistic targets could be improved substantially by a relatively limited number of longer-range hit-to-kill interceptors, even if these interceptors had less than the 0.8 Pk typically required of air-defence systems. In the Pacific, capabilities such as the SM-3IIA will be a primary mode of defence against medium- and intermediate-range targets, against which point defences will have more constrained utility. The vessels that field them will also defend themselves against MRBMs, such as the DF-21D, over the course of a campaign. In effect, the need for a first layer of longer-range hit-to-kill interceptors in Europe may be more modest than in the Pacific, insofar as its role is reducing an otherwise unmanageable strain on shorter-range interceptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interceptor Platforms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These interceptors are often (but not always) held on maritime platforms, and the availability of such an outer layer would require destroyers and frigates to be equipped with requisite interceptors and postured forward in areas such as the Baltic Sea, at some risk to themselves. This also limits the reach of an outer air-defence layer away from coastal areas. Moreover, many of the destroyers that carry longer-range hit-to-kill interceptors are US vessels, such as the Arleigh Burke class. Several European navies, including the Royal Navy, Italy’s Marina Militare and France’s Marine Nationale, are investing in longer-range hit-to-kill systems such as the Aster-30 Block1NT, but the question of how much capacity will exist by 2027 is still open. In effect, capacity gaps in European tactical BMD can be filled without the procurement of a potentially unrealisable magazine of interceptors, but only if the likely absence of US Aegis destroyers and their interceptors can be offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, European states will need to find ways to deliver the number of interceptors required to achieve point defence against short-range ballistic targets. In principle, the initiative by Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and Spain to procure 1,000 PAC-2 GEM-T interceptors (which are not hit to kill but can be used against ballistic targets) and Germany’s procurement of up to 600 PAC-3 MSE interceptors would, if realised, meet the requirement against an initial ballistic missile salvo comparable to that seen in Ukraine (although only the PAC-3 is a hit-to-kill interceptor optimised for BMD). However, this would depend on sensors supporting tactical BMD having enough range to support a shoot–look–shoot approach (a challenge, since no European NATO member fields longer-range BMD radar such as the AN-TPY-2, which would allow lower-tier defences to focus on likely vectors of attack, enabling a more efficient shot doctrine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to BMD interceptors, which may be required to differing degrees (depending on their range), blast fragmentation interceptors are likely to be in considerably higher demand in both theatres. Both Russia and China maintain large cruise missile arsenals and, in the case of Russia, cruise missiles have been augmented with cheaper analogues, such as the Shahed-136, which are less capable but must still be engaged. Moreover, blast fragmentation interceptors are also expended against uncrewed aerial systems and loitering munitions. Interceptors such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM, which are common to both aircraft and ground-based air defence systems such as NASAMs, are likely to see heavy demands from both the Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic. Any US air activity in the Indo-Pacific, irrespective of whether it aims for the more modest goal of air denial, which this report argues to be optimal, or for more expansive aims, will necessarily use considerable numbers of blast fragmentation interceptors. For European states, aircraft – and in particular those aircraft that cannot be immediately committed to ground support missions – will be a crucial component of any air defence effort against cruise missiles and one-way attack munitions. In addition, air-to-air combat against the VKS is likely to be a feature of any European conflict, even if the VKS might be expected to operate in a conservative way within the safety of its own IADS. It then follows that, particularly where European systems rely on blast fragmentation interceptors made in the US, these missiles may become a scarce asset, in demand across both the European and Indo-Pacific theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counter-rocket, artillery and mortar (C-RAM) systems and V-SHORAD (very short-range air defence) systems will be in demand to differing degrees in both theatres. Given the likely importance of vertical lift to the PLA’s efforts to generate superior firepower over any beach-head, as well as the role of platforms such as the Ka-52 in supporting Russian efforts to contain allied armour, MANPADS such as Stinger are likely to be in relatively high demand in both theatres. In Ukraine, for example, the US Department of Defense has donated a third of its arsenal of Stinger missiles. The PLA, for its part, fields 270 Z-10 and Z-19 attack helicopters. The Z-10s are a rough (albeit lightly armoured) analogue to the US Apache and are equipped with 16 anti-tank guided missiles. Keeping these systems at bay without employing SAMs intended for more expensive targets will be of considerable importance. Unlike heavier systems, MANPADS can probably be moved to Taiwan rapidly and at scale in a crisis, as was the case in Ukraine. There are a number of European producers of MANPADS, and reliance on US capabilities that may be moved to Taiwan would not be a bottleneck in itself. However, the ability to scale production and secure critical inputs would require both industrial capacity and the ability to ensure that different Western producers are not competing for the same components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C-RAM has, historically, been more important in the context of Europe than in Asia, given the centrality of fires to the Russian way of war – which saw, for example, the Russian armed forces expend up to 38,000 artillery rounds a day in the second year of the war in Ukraine. By contrast, the relatively limited fires capabilities of the PLA’s amphibious assault forces would likely see them relying on air and naval support to generate firepower. A PLAGF combined arms brigade, for example, contains a single artillery battalion, compared with the three in a Russian Motor Rifle Brigade. The three PLA group armies across Taiwan also field an artillery brigade each, equipped with 300-mm PHL-03 and PHC-191 MLRS systems that can target Taiwan’s west coast from the mainland. Even so, the sheer weight of land-based artillery fire in the initial period of an invasion of Taiwan is likely to be dwarfed by the volumes of fire expended in the European theatre. Certainly, some C-RAM systems, such as Phalanx, have utility as a means of defending installations against UAVs, but in general UAVs can be engaged by cheaper means, such as anti-aircraft artillery fire. As such, mobile and survivable C-RAM remains more relevant to the European theatre than to the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;asw-a-major-capability-gap&quot;&gt;ASW: A Major Capability Gap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allied approach to ASW in Europe is to a substantial degree dependent on US assets. First, the tracking of a single contact typically requires the coordination of several systems, including MPAs, frigates and SSNs which must, respectively, localise and then tail a contact. It typically takes three MPAs to maintain one MPA on station at any given time over a 12-hour period. Currently, European MPA fleets are relatively small – at the time of writing, the UK fields five P-8 Poseidon aircraft and Norway a further eight, while France and Germany field 11 upgraded Atlantique aircraft and P-8As respectively. Portugal also fields a fleet of older P-3 Orion aircraft. This is a limited but not completely insufficient number of platforms for manning a chokepoint such as the Greenland–Iceland–UK (GIUK) Gap, particularly in terms of the relative overmatch that the Alliance enjoys in theatres such as the Baltic Sea, where Russia currently operates a very limited submarine force, comprising a single Kilo class (although SSKs from other fleets could be moved to the Baltic in a crisis). A more significant issue will be the availability of key systems stocks such as multi-static sonobuoys, given the substantial dependence on US systems. A barrier in the GIUK Gap, for example, would need to be seeded with 15,000 DIFAR and DICASS sonobuoys, which would be reseeded every eight hours (although newer MAC sonobuoys have greater coverage, reducing the number required by half).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a contact is made by, for example, an MPA, a submarine is typically tracked over long distances by another SSN. The limited size of allied SSN fleets will make this a challenge in the absence of US assets, which is likely if the US Navy faces a trough in submarine capacity in the 2030s. While it enjoys considerable advantages in comparison with the PLAN’s much noisier nuclear submarines, the US Navy’s SSN will not necessarily have major advantages over quieter SSKs, such as the Type 039C, in littoral waters of areas such as the South China Sea, where advantages such as endurance are of less significance. It is likely that clearing the South China Sea of Chinese submarines and surface vessels will be crucial to ensuring that US surface assets operating in the western Pacific do not do so at unacceptable risk from PLAN platforms operating on interior lines. In this instance, the US Navy could opt to simply cover chokepoints such as the Bashi Channel and the island of Mindanao and bottle in Chinese assets (a less resource-intensive task). But if the PLAAF seizes local air superiority sufficient to allow China’s own MPAs to operate over these chokepoints (at least for a time), this will probably involve both risks and losses. It should be noted that even historically successful submarine campaigns have involved high loss rates. For example, the US Navy lost 20% of its submarine fleet in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War, despite enjoying considerable advantages over the Imperial Japanese Navy. It is thus not inconceivable that the Pacific, which since 2015 has drawn 60% of the US’s SSNs, will demand an even larger part of the SSN force in a conflict. The position of the JMSDF, which operates a fleet of 10 quiet Soryu-class SSKs (among other vessels), will be an important factor in determining precisely how acute the demand for US submarines is in the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the Russian Northern Fleet currently possesses 14 SSNs and SSGNs, of which a relatively large number can be surged in a conflict. By 2030, Russia aspires to field six Yasen-class submarines across its Northern and Pacific fleets. This increase, if achieved, will potentially be offset by the retirement of older Victor III- and Sierra-class submarines still in service, and will not necessarily represent a quantitative increase in fleet capacity. Qualitatively, however, this would entail a step change in the threat facing NATO, given that the Yasen is comparable in quietness to newer Western submarines and capable of launching supersonic and hypersonic missiles such as the 3M22 Zircon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Potential Shortfalls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming a partial or complete absence of US capacity, NATO would probably face considerable shortfalls in several areas, including stockpiles to enable MPA operations and available SSNs to tail Russian contacts. Collectively, the UK and France field 16 SSNs, which is more than Russia’s Northern Fleet, but a focus on persistent deployment rather than surge capacity means that the part of this force that can be made available at short notice is more limited than for a comparably sized Russian force. This could change, particularly because Russia appears intent on maintaining persistent deployments of SSGNs in the Western hemisphere (which will absorb at least four Yasen-class SSNs to keep one on station at any time and have an impact on readiness). However, not maintaining surge capacity would represent a break with Russian and Soviet practice, and some effort to do so should be assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western SSNs are required for additional functions such as deep strike and forward operations at sea in otherwise denied maritime spaces. In the absence of a significant number of US SSNs in theatre, then, the requirement of tailing the part of its SSN fleet that Russia does choose to surge in a crisis could create a shortfall in available SSNs, which could impact both strike operations at depth and ASW operations. Moreover, it is not clear that there will be enough SSNs to meet the task of tailing alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This latter challenge can be offset in several ways. SSNs do not have to be tailed by other SSNs, and both surface vessels and SSKs can also play this role. The former, however, operate at considerable risk against SSGNs, given their own often relatively limited air defences, while the latter have limited endurance and speed relative to their quarry. Once NATO is covering an ASW barrier in the GIUK Gap this may matter less – this barrier is likely to be covered by a large number of vessels, as many European states field ASW frigates. However, in a crisis leading to conflict before a Maritime Component Command can be stood up, the difficulty of tailing contacts without engaging them could dislocate naval forces in the theatre. This, in turn, could create the space for other maritime threats, such as the use of special-purpose submarines such as the X-Ray and the Paltus to disrupt critical maritime infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Russian threats in the maritime domain are ancillary to those on land. The Russian navy exists to support the army, and if European capability gaps in other areas are filled, the maritime domain may have less significance. Nonetheless, the Alliance’s ability to contain subsurface threats will partially determine Russian assessments of the aggregate balance of forces, and gaps in this area will prove particularly acute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-land-component-the-capabilities-are-available-but-not-the-enablers&quot;&gt;The Land Component: The Capabilities are Available, But Not the Enablers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, land power should be the most non-fungible US strategic capability in a two-war scenario. While there is certainly a land component to any conceivable Indo-Pacific conflict, the conditions for success or failure are likely to be set at sea and in the air. Since any Chinese approach to Taiwan must presume air and naval superiority, given the low likelihood of the PLA achieving local preponderance at its beach-heads, if Chinese forces do land on Taiwan and achieve a breakout it will be because they were enabled by these two factors. If this is the case, there is little evidence that additional support to a Taiwan ground component could be flowed into the island. Equally, if the conditions for substantial US ground forces to flow into Taiwan can be set in the air and at sea, this would be synonymous with the failure of a Chinese invasion in any case, as any disembarked force would necessarily be cut off from the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not because land forces are irrelevant in a Taiwan contingency. Considerable historical data suggests that a well-entrenched land component can hold an invading force in an island assault under conditions of numerical inferiority and inferiority in the air and at sea, and that attackers often require a more than 3:1 preponderance in land forces. On Okinawa in April 1945, for example, entrenched Japanese forces held for three months against a US force that outnumbered them 5:1, with the US Tenth Army expending 2.4 million shells in the battle. It can thus certainly be argued that the ability of the Taiwan land component to both contest an initial beach-head and protract a conflict sets the conditions for effective denial in the air and at sea by buying time for US forces. Many of the capabilities relevant to a land war in Europe, such as guided MLRS, V-SHORAD and tube artillery, would certainly be relevant in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the success of any land battle would be largely predicated on the assets already in Taiwan when a conflict broke out. Assuming the PLAN and the PLAAF are able to achieve a level of air superiority sufficient to enable an outnumbered assault force to break out of its beach-heads (the only context in which a protracted land battle can occur), this would preclude any additional land forces from being surged into the theatre, as some have argued they might be. For example, the US Navy can, in principle, support the insertion of heavy armour into Taiwan with its ship-to-shore connector, but with a 25-nautical-mile radius, doing so under conditions of adversary air superiority would entail amphibious vessels taking unacceptable levels of risk for the insertion of relatively small amounts of armour. Access to ports, which can be utilised by strategic sealift assets, would also be unlikely under these circumstances. It might be argued that, in due course, a successful US effort to roll back the PLAN and the PLAAF could enable land forces to be flowed into pockets of the theatre still held by Taiwan’s forces, to enable the PLAGF to be progressively rolled back on the island – in a manner comparable to the US Army and Republic of Korea army’s defence and breakout from the Pusan Perimeter in September 1940. However, if the PLA does secure a level of air superiority sufficient to prevent its forces from being stopped either at its beach-heads or in the littoral and to allow the subsequent seizure of a port to allow the flow of non-amphibious units, there will be little time for reinforcement. In amphibious assaults over the course of the last century, when a force that did not enjoy numerical preponderance at the outset of the assault succeeded, it typicall did so in less than a month. This broadly reflects the fact that if the numerically inferior force could not be defeated at its beach-heads, it was enabled to succeed by a level of air and naval superiority that caused the defence to collapse rapidly. The only exception to this was the Battle of Iwo Jima, which lasted for a month but in which air and naval power did not play a decisive role in routing the defence. Even if Chinese forces took a month to seize a major Taiwan seaport to enable the flow of follow-on forces, it would probably be longer than this before the US could safely surge land forces into the theatre. In effect, then, if the PLA’s air superiority is sufficient to prevent a numerically inferior force from being beaten on the beaches, a Taiwan defence will collapse before the conditions for reinforcements to enter the theatre can be set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that the PLA will necessarily secure the level of air and sea superiority needed to enable a successful invasion. Rather, the argument is that the crux of any defence of Taiwan will be denying it this superiority. If this is achieved, it is likely that Taiwan’s forces can mount a successful forward defence of likely landing sites on the island, making a protracted defence and the subsequent flow of US forces superfluous. If not, the battle will likely end before either of these things can be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does, in principle, mean that assets such as MLRS equipped with cluster munitions and land-centric capabilities such as heavy armour would be likely to be free for the European theatre, where they have far greater relevance against a primarily ground-based Russian threat, in tandem with the forces already under V Corps in Poland. The scope and scale of this threat will depend on a number of factors, among which are the question of whether Russia can free its forces from their existing commitments in Ukraine, and whether the Russian military can achieve its aspiration to stand up two new military districts and 14 new divisions, in accordance with the plans laid out by former defence minister Sergei Shoigu. This will prove challenging, as Russia has expended much of its stock of Soviet-era equipment and has, since 2008, shuttered many of the training academies for its officer corps as part of former defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov’s reforms. Nevertheless, the pace of Russian reconstitution in many areas makes the availability of a Russian ground force comparable to the one that invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022 plausible enough to bear consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific land capabilities, such as deep-strike missiles like the PrSM and the ATACMS, may have greater cross-theatre relevance, as they can be used to strike vessels in port or even to contribute to counter-airbase missions. However, while the possession of these missiles by Taiwan at the outset of a conflict may be relevant, it is unlikely that the US will be able to ship additional missiles to Taiwan under contested conditions, and most ground-based fires, with the exception of the US Army’s intermediate-range hypersonics, largely lack the reach to strike China from anywhere else in the first island chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major bottlenecks in the deployment of the US Army to Europe would probably be in the areas of air defence and logistical support. Since the US Army is responsible for air defence as a function of the Key West Agreement, it would likely see its air-defence capabilities entirely consumed by a Pacific war. Any US Army deployment to Europe would thus depend on the availability of adequate European air defences (without which ground forces could not deploy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US strategic sealift would necessarily be strained by a Pacific deployment, and some of this capability will be provided by the US Army. At the time of writing, there is limited European capacity to provide strategic sealift, as the movement of US forces across the Atlantic has largely been a US activity. NATO maintains a sealift consortium, to which 11 countries contribute 15 vessels, but this represents a limited capability. Airlift may represent another means of providing inter-theatre mobility to US forces, as during the Cold War, although this will likely only partially mitigate bottlenecks in mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, while many components of US land power may in principle remain available for use in Europe – if policy allows – even in the face of an Indo-Pacific contingency, this depends to a considerable degree on the ability of European states to fill gaps in key enablers that allow a ground force to both cross the Atlantic and remain safe against a range of air and missile threats while in theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-manageable-but-growing-cracks&quot;&gt;Conclusions: Manageable But Growing Cracks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report suggest that while there will undoubtedly be resource constraints within Europe during a decade of acute risk in the Pacific, these constraints should be parsed, given that not all assets are fungible. This is not to suggest that major capability gaps do not exist within European militaries, nor that they must not be closed. But a more granular analysis of these gaps can help identify immediate priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain areas, the analysis for this report produced counterintuitive findings. In particular, despite airpower and air-defence assets being in high demand across the European and Indo-Pacific theatres, the munition and interceptor types required were not in all instances pulled in two directions by conflicting demand signals. In particular, SEAD munitions such as the AARGM-ER may have limited relevance to a Pacific campaign. This largely stems from the fact that strikes against the Chinese mainland at a scale that might alter the balance of power over Taiwan are not only increasingly unviable, but also superfluous, insofar as mutual air denial over Taiwan and the ability to target destroyers and cruisers, as well as the amphibious vessels they protect in and around the island, are potentially sufficient to enable the failure of a Chinese invasion. If, as some have argued, the US prioritises resourcing allied efforts as part of its deterrent, resourcing European SEAD efforts (which are currently constrained less by platforms than by munitions) is achievable by the US without undermining an Indo-Pacific campaign. As discussed in Chapter II, meaningful European gaps also exist in areas other than munitions – but material gaps may prove easiest to fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air and missile defence is, similarly, a constrained capability, although some constraints are more acute than others. Available IAMD systems and capacity in terms of both hit-to-kill interceptors and blast fragmentation warheads are available to a limited degree in Europe. Unlike in the Pacific, however, the Russian ballistic threat is limited to a part of the theatre, and will be attenuated over time as a SEAD campaign takes effect. Moreover, capacity limitations can be mitigated through the more effective layering of defences against SRBMs. In the Pacific, by contrast, BMD is likely to be a persistent resource demand. Stocks of blast fragmentation interceptors needed for both air-to-air and cruise missile defence will be a resource heavily strained by a Pacific contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the maritime domain, surface lethality and ASW emerge as major European capability gaps, which is perhaps unsurprising given the maritime dimensions of the Pacific contingency to which US assets would be drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the US Army capabilities most relevant to the land domain do not necessarily have great relevance to an Indo-Pacific contingency, many of the enablers needed to move these assets to make US capabilities operational would probably need to be provided by European states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, the task of preparing for the Davidson Window in Europe should be seen as one of filling specific gaps in capacity as rapidly as possible, while others can be covered on a longer-term basis. To be sure, it is desirable for a number of reasons that European states mobilise the capacity to replicate the full spectrum of capabilities and enablers for which they currently rely on the US. Assuming that not all these capabilities can be delivered in a decade, however, there are specific areas to which resources should be targeted on an immediate basis. This report has sought to shed light on which areas might represent vulnerabilities. These areas should be targeted with urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

They also have the potential to transform the UK approach to major development, production and support programmes – if government is willing to change how it approaches project financing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 8 November, the UK government announced its continued commitment to the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). The announcement was likely a relief to Japan and Italy, the UK’s treaty partners in the programme. GCAP – and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) programme of which it is a part – promises to take UK combat air and industrial capability into the sixth generation of combat jet platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;government-military-and-industry-as-one-team&quot;&gt;Government, Military and Industry as One Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCAP from its inception involved a government-industry team rather than the traditional adversarial model. The GCAP announcement at the Farnborough air show in 2018 presented a team of the MoD and the RAF alongside four core companies. BAE Systems, Rolls Royce, Leonardo and MBDA – to generate a new aircraft and its weapons. This was a broader and earlier grouping than had been used in the 1980s with Eurofighter Typhoon, and a strong contrast even with recent naval practice in which the Navy first works out its requirement and only then goes to industry to find the best supplier. As Vice Admiral Paul Marshall told the House of Commons Defence Committee in 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we have a programme or project in the concept phase, that is done by the Navy Command Headquarters development team. They take the concept and work out the requirements that the Navy needs to meet the threats of the future. Once those requirements are set, what normally happens is that it is passed to a delivery team to get on with the business of full design and implementation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two lines of logic underpin the MoD’s new approach in Team Tempest. The first logic was that one purpose of the strategy was sustaining and developing UK industrial capability in the combat air domain. This capability primarily lay in four companies that had survived decades of industrial consolidation. The second logic was that the approach offered the prospect of better integrating and exploiting the expertise of government and industry: the MoD with its understanding of future threats and their nature, and industry with its knowledge of technology, engineering and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We acknowledge that government-industry partnering in defence is not entirely new. But even the Carrier Alliance had been preceded by a formal competition between BAE Systems and Thales. The nearest thing to the partnering approach to what was first called Tempest may be the relationship between the government, Rolls Royce and other firms in the Submarine Delivery Agency on submarine nuclear reactors. Thus, the expansion of this approach beyond the immediate industrial concerns around the nuclear deterrent is new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-industry-funding-for-early-stage-work&quot;&gt;Securing Industry Funding for Early-Stage Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting key partners could be seen as encouraging corporate complacency, but this risk was mitigated by the readiness of the firms to invest significant sums of their own money in the early work without formal assurance of development, let alone production. The companies have not formally revealed their individual spending, but in total it has been around £800 million, compared to the government’s contribution of around £2 billion. The need to recover this funding, along with recognition that production will be shared across the three partners and that exports will be essential to sustain industrial capability long-term, is a major incentive for companies to avoid slacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dedication of corporate funding was feasible given more than 13 years of firm government signalling of an intention to maintain the national combat air industrial capability. This had been part of the Labour government’s Defence Industrial Strategy of 2005, which led to the Taranis uncrewed stealthy vehicle and the exploration of collaboration on an aircraft with France. The Conservatives’ 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We will invest in the next generation of combat aircraft technology, in partnership with our defence aerospace industry and our closest allies. We are working with the US to build and support the F35 Lightning. We will work with France to develop our Unmanned Combat Air System programme, and collaborate on complex weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These words emerged publicly as the Future Combat Air Systems Technology Initiative and launched the commitment to joint MoD and private sector investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GCAP is conceived both as an initially defined project in its own right (a crewed aircraft) and as a platform that will be designed to evolve and spirally develop over time&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Team Tempest model in the Combat Air Strategy emerged after years of discussions on how best to sustain UK industrial capabilities in the broad field of combat air. It was far from being a spur of the moment choice, and reflected an MoD recognition that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The UK’s ability to choose how we deliver our future requirements (including maintenance and upgrade of current systems) is dependent on maintaining access to a dynamic and innovative industrial base.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;novel-collaborative-decision-making-structures&quot;&gt;Novel Collaborative Decision-Making Structures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has participated in many collaborative aircraft projects, but a negative feature of even Typhoon was the limited authority of the government and corporate structures that were supposed to manage and deliver the project. Subsequently decision-making was often slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With GCAP, the emphasis is on empowered structures and streamlined decision-making processes. The three governments were able to agree quickly on a treaty-based GCAP International Government Organisation with the legal and political powers needed to be able to manage the project from the customer side. Its commercial delivery structure – bringing together the top-level industrial players – is understood to be largely settled, with a formal announcement expected by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of these bodies to make choices quickly without having to send everything back to national capitals and company headquarters will be exposed only during the operation of the project, but certainly the intention in 2024 is that the joint executive bodies should be able to proceed at pace in order to keep the project on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is a new collaborative partner for the UK, but GCAP is a key element in a strengthening of UK–Japan security relations that dates back to at least 2013. UK Typhoons exercised with Japanese counterparts in 2016, and Theresa May visited Japan as prime minister in 2017. All this was accompanied by company-to-company discussions among the key players. Thus, when the formal announcement of an Italy–Japan–UK aircraft programme was made in 2022, many political, military and industrial preparations had already been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;development-for-the-unknown-spiral-development-in-action&quot;&gt;Development for the Unknown: Spiral Development in Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further feature of GCAP is its conception as an initially defined project in its own right (a crewed aircraft), and also a platform that will be designed to evolve and spirally develop over time. There will thus be no single declaration of Full Operational Capability because the final “full” stage of the platform is unknown. Moreover, that platform is to be part of a wider and only partially defined evolving system of equipment and capabilities under the FCAS umbrella. Thus, the aim for 2035 is for a minimum viable product that can deal effectively with threats in the 2035–2040 timeframe, but which will be capable of regular, perhaps even continuous improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of industrial motivation, spiral development offers an appealing base for the export potential of GCAP. All the companies are aware that the long-term sustainment of their combat air capabilities will not be satisfied by demand from the three core countries alone: exports will be necessary, and the UK government is clear that exporting needs to be a key element of its defence industrial strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing innovative about thinking of an aircraft as part of a wider system: the Spitfires and Hurricanes that were so effective in the Battle of Britain owed much of their effectiveness to the radar, communication and ground-based fighter control direction that made up the air defence system of the time. Moreover, the idea of “spiral development” is pretty much the same as the concept of “incremental acquisition” that was prominent in defence procurement earlier in the millennium. However, that idea was little implemented, in part because of customer reluctance to compromise on requirements when access to funding for future improvements was uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key consideration for how effectively spiral development can operate will be the availability of early funding to build in the key enablers of advances, not least strength, space and electric power in the platform as well the ease of upgrading software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;significantly-enhancing-the-use-of-digital-engineering&quot;&gt;Significantly Enhancing the Use of Digital Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a key enabler of affordability and speed of delivery will be digital engineering (DE). While largely a technology matter, DE also has organisational implications, not least in the form of company and governmental relationships with the Military Aviation Authority (MAA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practice of designing aircraft in a computerised, digital environment is not new. All modern civil and military equipment is designed first on a computer using engineers’ expertise to inform how different elements will interact. Digital simulations enable a digital-twin aircraft to be operated by humans in a simulated “cockpit” and environment. Tests with a real system then evaluate how this simulation data corresponds with reality. However, as the documentary film about the competition for the F-35 contract between Lockheed Martin and Boeing illustrates, while these tests often confirmed the simulation data, some unexpected faults emerged. This was over 25 years ago. As time has passed, the computing capacity of simulations has dramatically improved, and so has the data base for generating high fidelity environments in benign and contested scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This development in data quality and quantity and processing speed is especially important in the combat air sector because of the time and costs taken up by real-world testing and flying. The US’s transparency on many defence matters enables a sense of the scale of what “testing” has involved to date. This is apparent in a 2018 statement by Vice Admiral Mat Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Since the first flight of AA-1 in 2006, the developmental flight test program has operated for more than 11 years mishap-free, conducting more than 9,200 sorties, accumulating over 17,000 flight hours, and executing more than 65,000 test points to verify the design, durability, software, sensors, weapons capability and performance for all three F-35 variants.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average sortie lasted less than two hours. Over the 11 years, more than 16 sorties were flown a week. These numbers give some sense of both the time and money that could be saved if development could be done largely online rather than in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision associated with DE is that a large amount of testing will be done online at great speed and low cost. Computers can operate “flights” on a 24-hours a day basis if need be. Sub-system testing, which is usually less expensive, can be done both online and on the ground. But the role of flight testing should be massively reduced, generating significant savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All defence systems must have an approved Safety Case. In the case of aircraft, arrangements need the approval of the MoD’s safety authorities including the MAA. This suggests that safety and certification people should be involved throughout development, as opposed to being asked for cooperation late in the day (as was the case, for example, with the Ajax armoured vehicle programme).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major impact of advanced DE is that it will enable numerous engineers to work on different aspects of the system simultaneously as simulation data on the mutually dependent components is shared, analysed and acted upon at much greater speed. As one key programme manager confirmed to us, this process – from simulation data to design alternations that result from it and from implementation to a model to re-run a simulation – would have taken months in the last significant UK combat air programme. Today, it can be done overnight, as the simulation alternates designs automatically to improve. In the case of GCAP, there is the prospect of a long working day for the humans involved, as those ending their day in Japan can be succeeded by staff in Italy and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development is far from the only area where DE could be a key enabler. The potential reach of DE is extraordinary. BAE Systems is already invested in digital manufacturing, robotic assembly, and training support for those doing skilled manual work. Additive manufacturing is a sub-element in DE, as are computer-controlled machine tools. It could thus cut manufacturing time and increase product reliability. In-service modification and spiral development would be quicker and easier with DE. Building data-collecting sensors into systems would support longer usage rates for platforms and enable condition-based maintenance rather than time- or usage-based maintenance. Many modern civil aircraft engines are already fitted with such sensors (linked to computers analysing their results). These mean that engine companies can take on profitable availability contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Advanced digital engineering will enable numerous engineers to work on different aspects of a system simultaneously as data on the mutually dependent components is shared, analysed and acted upon at much greater speed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DE is the clear direction of travel for much of manufacturing. For GCAP, expanding the boundaries of DE is key to holding costs down and delivering an aircraft for 2035: it could and should be rewarding but also inevitably risky. Significantly, it is a field which US defence companies, not least Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are actively exploring. Because of the hundreds of sub-contractors that will need to be captured within the GCAP DE tent, the expertise they acquire can be applied on other manufacturing projects, both military and civil. Subject to respect for companies’ intellectual property, the government could work to diffuse GCAP-origin DE experiences to other industrial sectors beyond aerospace. This could enable progress, especially in productivity growth, under the government’s industrial ambitions as laid out in its Green Paper of October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this will require resources and skill. For instance, a highly secure information infrastructure that enables DE is pivotal. Clearly, information on GCAP’s digital twin and its performance in a countless number of combat scenarios will be highly prized, with state and perhaps corporate bodies focused on accessing it. A key to its GCAP capability is keeping that information safe. This has significant implications for the organisations that handle this data, including security clearances, establishing processes, and having the necessary IT infrastructure to handle data securely and at great speed. Skill is also an important factor. Government and industry alike will need to muster the necessary talent to maintain and develop DE capabilities. GCAP is conceptualised as an open-platform system that seeks to enable seamless integration of mission-specific FCAS capabilities from a multitude of suppliers. These suppliers must also be able to recruit the people required for the new digital working environment that they cannot grow themselves. Thus, government and industrial primes will need to produce a skill spill-over to make the FCAS system work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this has consequences for the financial approach to GCAP. Historically, major defence development programmes start cheap and then build up. The DE element of GCAP means that significant initial costs of computing, staff recruitment and training and model development have to be incurred. Investment in a highly secure information storage, processing and communication system is needed early. What this means in UK terms is that Treasury approval for higher than usual early costs is needed. It is a matter of approving a “spend to save” strategy, which clearly involves risk. But DE could then play a pivotal role in materialising the cost reduction and increases in speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five areas of innovation in GCAP should be seen holistically as a transformational approach to defence acquisition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government-industry partnering from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing access to significant industrial cost contributions for the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bringing in a novel collaborative partner and setting up customer and industry delivery structures to facilitate timely decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting from a minimum viable capability while envisaging spiral development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pushing the boundaries of digital engineering to reduce the time and cost of development and production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will require persistent teamworking across government departments, among multiple businesses and between government and the private sector. But each offers the prospect of lowering costs and flattening the tendency towards increased inter-generational aircraft costs first pointed out by Norman Augustine more than 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case for this approach rests on the simple observation that different things should be bought in different ways. There is no doubt that GCAP will require a mindset change from those in Defence Equipment &amp;amp; Support whose instinct is that the only way to secure value is through competitive tendering, passing as much risk as possible to the private supplier, and relying primarily on contracted commitments to assure delivery. Also, for teaming to be effective, there will be a need for government technical expertise to be available, not least on the design and meaning of digital and real-world tests. To be specific, the GCAP approach is particularly relevant for projects in which national operational independence is valued and there is little or no scope for sustained competition within the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elements of this approach give real hope for effective cost control: incentivising industry by securing early significant company investments, focusing government and industrial delivery structures on pace regarding decisions, defining a realistic but militarily adequate requirement from the outset and, perhaps above all, investing in DE to speed development, reduce risks and lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successive UK governments have shown that they can talk the talk on defence industrial matters, and their defence industrial partners have expressed confidence in their potential. Maintaining the momentum of GCAP will require all concerned to show that they can also walk the walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;李予信冀大眾關注案件-藉判詞思考社會走向&quot;&gt;李予信冀大眾關注案件 藉判詞思考社會走向&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/v6WRMZD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派47人案今日將會進行判刑，亦是香港首宗顛覆國家政權罪案件，大批市民通宵排隊。同為被告之一、早前獲判無罪的李予信凌晨5點前到達隊伍，他認除了此案，現在都有不同案件發生，關乎社會開放度、新聞、集結及參政等自由，希望大眾關心：「我覺得呢啲案件嘅判決同結論好需要大家深思、表達感受，思考指向緊社會未來發展去乜嘢方向」。他希望大家好好細讀判詞對社會的影響：「呢個係我好渴望大家一齊去諗嘅一樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;批評排隊黨濫用制度&quot;&gt;批評「排隊黨」濫用制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;司法機構公布，將安排一共404張公眾人士入庭籌，其中正庭僅設5席，其餘399個旁聽席分布在其他延伸庭。傳媒在正庭及延伸庭則獲分配共71個座位。李予信表示從新聞得知排隊情況及正庭位置很少，抵達時間與過往相若，他又認為「排隊黨」的情況若屬實將十分不理想，「完全abuse（濫用）緊公眾席呢個制度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到自己近況，他表示「都係咁」：「我覺得呢幾年都係處於比較平和啲、嚴謹啲嘅狀態，冇乜大起伏，我都係做緊自己要做嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他表示排隊期間會看書，分享最近在看藝術治療的書籍，關於創傷處理和韌性建立，覺得社會經歷集體創傷，值得思考如何建立生活動力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PrsR87F.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;冀在囚者好好活下去&quot;&gt;冀在囚者好好活下去&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李卓人妻子鄧燕娥及姨仔鄧燕梨亦在隊伍之中，他們表示來支持吳敏兒等全部被告，鄧燕娥表示對一個多星期前曾探訪吳，引述她對判決結果「隨遇而安」。鄧表示大約一個月探望她一次，形容她大部分時間很堅強。鄧燕娥希望各被告無論如何都要堅強，「無論結果點都要好好活下去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jUvIInb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 張文龍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前葵青區議會副主席張文龍表示認識大部分被告，他希望對被告說「出面有好多人等緊同佢哋一齊食飯，一齊重聚。」他表示知道近幾星期不少被告精神狀態差，希望他們努力面對。他直言擔心「前輩級」被告，聽過他們對生活、經濟上的憂慮，不過相信他們這幾年找到方法面對。他表示上月尾探望過譚凱邦，「見到佢身體都ok」，不過一直受些皮膚問題困擾，臨近宣判心情有點緊張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前區議員評估刑期唔樂觀&quot;&gt;前區議員評估刑期「唔樂觀」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前荃灣區議員陳劍琴凌晨5時許到場，她特別關注被告張可森、岑敖暉、王百羽、劉澤鋒、譚凱邦、朱凱廸，並想跟他們說「頂住呀」，但認為刑期「唔樂觀」，因此案不關乎被告的政治光譜如何，僅李予信及劉偉聰脫罪，律政司亦向劉偉聰提出上訴。她上周曾探訪多名被告，形容他們狀態「都精神嘅」，但指部分被告臨近判刑日子「心情越差，狀態唔好」，亦有部分被告認為「終於可以有一個確實嘅日子」，因過去數年牆內外的人無止境地等待，「起碼心裡面有嗰譜」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3LLKHaW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 葉寶琳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因為612基金案曾被國安處拘捕的葉寶琳亦在隊伍之中，她表示和很多被告都是認識多年的朋友：「無論點都好，我哋都應該陪住佢哋同埋等佢哋出嚟。」她表示最近有探望部份被告，形容「佢哋好多都係好堅強，好平安，都鼓勵咗我哋牆外嘅人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;清晨逾200人排隊旁聽-有公眾指罵大媽為排隊黨&quot;&gt;清晨逾200人排隊旁聽 有公眾指罵大媽為「排隊黨」&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Z7KydzH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案在今早10時判刑，司法機構共設404個公眾席，惟僅5人可進入正庭，餘下公眾需在延伸區域看電視直播。有公眾三日前起到法院外輪候，惟隊伍首13位的大部份人均戴上口罩，亦未回應記者，被其他旁聽人士質疑為「排隊黨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NsPc55m.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vN3mscl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(05:45) 有數批戴口罩中年女士前來排隊，每批約5至7人。及後每相隔數分鐘，陸續再有中年人士成群結隊前來排隊。截至早上7時，西九裁判法院門外已超過200人排隊輪候旁聽。期間，多名旁聽人士以粗口指罵其中一名女子，斥她是「雞頭」，負責安排人「收錢」排隊。記者向她詢問排隊原因、旁聽的案件等，她未有回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fvKrS6q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方稱因應行動關係，介乎深旺道及荔枝角道的一段東京街及附近的通州街，交通會比較繁忙。警方呼籲市民在今天早上繁忙時間，避免駕車前往該區範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JvJHOy3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MdONJD0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(07:59) 警方今早分別將雷玉蓮、社民連曾健成、黃浩銘及周嘉發從隊伍中帶走，到封鎖區或封鎖線內截查搜袋，四人其後放行。周嘉發袋中的紙張被翻閱，他表示社民連之前在47人案做過簡單抗議，預料警方擔心再有示威。他表示今天到場是為了向社民連被告梁國雄、岑子杰等被告聊表心意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VIxe1PB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(09:11) 多國領事在隊伍之中。美國領事代表指美國希望北京和港府停止檢控政治犯，因為他們做的事情是其他市民希望做的，表達意見和表達參與政治的渴望，及捍衛人權。他表示領事每次都會旁聽，表示欣賞港府維持公開審訊，認為旁聽是重要的。歐盟領事則表示來表達對案件的關心，表示公開透明審訊十分重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LBtNfkJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(09:15) 天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機在前立法會議員何秀蘭陪同下到達西九龍裁判法院。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(09:30) 早上9時許，市民趙女士身穿自己設計的黑色T恤，上面印有「香港」、「47」及金句字眼。她表示共印製了47件，望派發給被告家屬。她被警方截查、登記個人資料後獲放行。趙女士指警方拍攝了衣服設計，以及詢問她帶同多件衣服的原因，她回應稱是安慰。趙女士又引述警方指，進入法庭或要有所配合，又提醒她不要展示有政治訊息的衣服或標語。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(09:50)在10時開庭前，被告之一的鄒家成透過社交媒體發文指，活着需要希望，沒有希望根本難以堅持，並強調活在不安的環境，我們更要心存希望。他又指，對於刑期絕不樂觀，但自己看見希望，「因為即使重獲自由之日仍相當遙遠，我們總算看到終點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Yq4rTNr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(09:56) 案中被告之一被告呂智恆的養母Elsa，她與友人步入法院後，折返門外並舉起紙牌，紙牌上寫有「神同在，God is with you」，警員隨即要求她收起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fBW1m7T.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民間人權陣線陳皓桓今早9時到場排隊，前面已有數百人排隊，他表示雖然職員已經截龍，但仍會繼續在場以示支持及同行。對於判刑，他感到悲觀，因為看不到輕判的跡象，不過對於被告、家屬和朋友而言，對算是一種「解脫」，因為被告已經被囚禁3年8個月，「完全唔知判到幾時，幾時出返嚟，終於知道有個日子，無論幾多年，起碼知道日子」。至於案件的意義，他認為政府和法庭應思考判案對全球港人、以至社會政治經濟有多大影響，特別是60萬曾參與初選投票的港人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iSGEAZM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今早才到達的漫畫家尊子說，料未能進入正庭旁聽，但仍希望看看現場氣氛和朋友。他指眾被告雖身處獄中，但消息很靈通，「知道出面嘅人好support佢哋，我見到嘅（被告）都（狀態）OK，都好清楚目前香港情況、世界嘅情況，唔需要大家擔心。」他又笑說「唔夠膽估、唔想估」被告刑期，僅希望案件有「冇咁壞嘅結果」，亦希望大家關注此「大案」之餘，亦會關注其他案件，例如蘋果案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YBkrSe8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(10:18) 警方向在場人士表示，因為法院已派出所有旁聽籌，呼籲市民自行離開。民主黨前主席劉慧卿未能成功入庭，她表示十分遺憾，但認為其黨友會理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(10:34) 法庭宣判各人刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/94Q8Rzk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(11:45) 初選47人案今早於西九龍裁判法院判刑，明早同一地點將續審蘋果案，壹傳媒集團創辦人黎智英將出庭自辯。在今早約11時45分，即初選47人案散庭後不久，已有約40人在法院門外排隊等候旁聽，當中包括亦有排隊旁聽47人案的「女長毛」雷玉蓮、曾涉違《維護國家安全條例》煽動罪的李盈姿及社民連成員曾健成。另外，現場已有疑似數名「排隊黨」，當記者問及審訊案件，他們均知悉正輪候黎智英案件，但當進一步問及黎的控罪是甚麼，他們則搖頭，不作回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;戴耀廷囚10年-其餘44人囚4年2個月至7年9個月&quot;&gt;戴耀廷囚10年 其餘44人囚4年2個月至7年9個月&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1v6LDqA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，其中31人認罪，16人不認罪受審，除李予信及劉偉聰之外，餘下14人皆被裁定罪成。45人今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）判刑。被指為組織者的戴耀廷認罪，判囚10年。其餘44人判囚4年2個月至7年9個月。刑期最重的為不認罪的鄒家成，判囚7年9個月。散庭後，黃之鋒被帶回囚室期間，高呼：「我愛香港，拜拜！」何桂藍得悉刑期後，向旁聽席舉起姆指手勢。有家屬在聞判期間哭泣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;約10時許，女被告先被懲教帶入庭內，何桂藍身穿粉紅色外套、白色上衣。男被告其後被帶入欄內，其中馮達浚與袁嘉蔚均穿上紅色利物浦球衣；張可森則向親友作出「OK」手勢。曾以「從犯證人」身份作供的區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟，則被約6至7名懲教人員重重包圍，與其他被告分隔開來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，3名國安法指定法官表示判詞一共有82頁，不會在庭上讀出，只會宣布各人刑期。稍後會在司法機構網頁上載完整判刑理由。簡短書面判刑結果則派發給在場被告、控辯雙方律師團隊和傳媒。當何桂藍得悉自己刑期後，向親友擺出「好」手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記者於正庭內所見，旁聽席的第一及二行均預留給法律團隊人士，第三及四行則是記者席，而第五及六行才是預留給被告家屬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪的31人包括：戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見、岑子杰、毛孟靜、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉、朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆、岑敖暉、王百羽、伍健偉及林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不認罪16人包括：鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林、李予信、余慧明及吳政亨。其中劉偉聰和李予信被裁定罪名不成立。律政司隨即針對劉偉聰的無罪裁決上訴，並在回覆傳媒查詢時確認沒有就李予信提出上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主派初選於2020年7月舉行，事後政府宣布立法會選舉延後一年。55名組織及參與初選者於2021年1月6日被捕，同年3月1日被落案起訴，指他們在2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，以無差別否決預算案等非法手段，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件2023年2月6日正式開審，由指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，是《國安法》後最大規模的案件，亦是「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪首案。審期原定90天，但最終橫跨十個月、歷時118天。認罪的區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟和林景楠4人以「從犯證人」身分為控方作供，另12名被告親自作供或傳召辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要或罪行重大」可處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加」可判監3至10年；「其他參加」則判監3年以下、拘役或管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，其中31人認罪，16人不認罪受審，除李予信及劉偉聰之外，餘下14人皆被裁定罪成。45人今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）判刑。法官指，案中4名組織者包括戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢及鍾錦麟，屬罪行中的「首要分子」級別，法例指明最低刑期為10年監禁。法官指，首3人的量刑起點為15年監禁。法官提到，戴耀廷在本案中是「幕後主腦（mastermind behind）」。至於任「從犯證人」區諾軒及趙家賢，則因認罪並作供協助控方，各獲一半減刑。法官另接納趙家賢或被戴耀廷誤導了計劃的合法性，額外減刑3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官指戴耀廷是幕後主腦屬首要分子以15年為起點&quot;&gt;法官指戴耀廷是「幕後主腦」屬首要分子以15年為起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被指為組織者的戴耀廷判囚10年，法官指，戴並非僅僅是35+計劃的發起人，更是初選的組織者，屬於「幕後主腦（mastermind behind）」，其文章引起民主派的注意。因此法官將戴納入「首要分子」級別。法官不同意戴稱沒有打算將「攬炒十步曲」作為政治行動的藍圖，因他在數月內發表一系列相關文章，因此不難追蹤其漸進的思想。法官認為，實質上戴提倡了一場革命。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦指，雖然戴未必是初選或立法會選舉的候選人，但他為有意行使計劃下否決權的人，提供不可或缺的平台。戴為了成功，亦同意吳政亨的「三投三不投」計劃。戴在初選後並未停止參與計劃，當區諾軒退出時，戴只是表示自己需要暫時休息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在評估戴的罪責時，法官只會考慮2020年7月1日之前的事實作為背景。法官指，「首要分子」的最低刑期為10年監禁，最高刑期為終身監禁。法官考慮戴的角色後，認為適當的量刑起點是15年監禁。唯一求情因素是戴及早認罪，因此獲三分一減刑，判囚10年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦提到，兩名主要組織者對計劃的成功抱有樂觀態度。組織者花費大量時間及金錢舉行記者會、協調會議及選舉論壇，同時亦發起眾籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官指區諾軒不及戴耀廷激進-另指其證供關鍵&quot;&gt;法官指區諾軒不及戴耀廷激進 另指其證供關鍵&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同被指為組織者、在案中擔任「從犯證人」的區諾軒，法官指他作為組織者之一，其證供屬「關鍵（crucial）」，在合併所有證供後，能夠有系統及邏輯地向法庭提供事件的全貌。在罪責方面，法官認為區作為組織者，其參與程度與戴耀廷大致相同。區在計劃開始階段已參與其中，儘管他不像戴般「激進（radical）」，但量刑起點同為15年監禁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官考慮到區作為控方證人，他所提供的證據的重要性，故給予一半減刑。另外，區得知香港及中國的官員對計劃「示警」後，區隨即退出計劃；區亦嘗試游說趙家賢退出計劃。法官亦考慮到，區對法律的無知，以及他過去對公共服務有貢獻，最後因應上述因素，決定再給予5%減刑，總刑期為6年9個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官接納趙家賢被戴耀廷誤導計劃合法性&quot;&gt;法官接納趙家賢被戴耀廷誤導計劃合法性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被指為組織者、在案中擔任「從犯證人」的趙家賢，他在交付階段及時認罪，並為控方提供證據。法官指，趙的證供獲法庭接納，亦協助法庭達成裁決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官不同意趙在串謀中只屬於「積極參加者」，反而認為他是「首要分子」，因他作為組織者之一。考慮到趙的重要角色及參與程度，法官以15年為量刑起點。法官亦有考慮計劃的非暴力性質。法官指趙及時認罪並協助控方，因此給予一半減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官接納趙可能被戴耀廷誤導，故認為計劃合法性，因此減刑3個月。惟法官拒絕接納辯方指，計劃客觀上沒有可能實行，因政府可以及時阻止這個公開的計劃。法官量刑時，已考慮被告無法控制的原因，令計劃無法進一步繼續及成功。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官最後考慮到被告親友、其選區太古城街坊為趙所撰的求情信，以及趙過往的公共服務。法官認為趙致力在港推廣調解，亦積極擔任區議員，因此同意他有良好品格，再給予3個月減刑，總刑期為7年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官指其參與程度不及戴耀廷等3人&quot;&gt;法官指其參與程度不及戴耀廷等3人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為「從犯證人」的鍾錦麟，法官不同意辯方指他屬「積極參加者」，反而認為屬「首要分子」，因他為組織者之一，但參與程度不如戴、區及趙。法官決定以12年監禁為量刑起點。由於鍾認罪及協助控方，因此給予45%減刑。他另因對法律的無知及過往參與公共服務，獲減刑3個月，總刑期為6年1個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要或罪行重大」可處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加」可判監3至10年；「其他參加」則判監3年以下、拘役或管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，其中31人認罪，16人不認罪受審，除李予信及劉偉聰，其餘14人罪成，45人今（19日）判刑。法官指，若計劃最終完全實行的話，其不良後果深遠，嚴重程度比得上推翻香港特區政府。法官亦指，初選參選人在計劃中有重要角色，他們支持計劃亦積極參與，若沒有他們根本無法進行，因此所有參選人均被法官納入「積極參加者」級別。根據法例，「積極參加者」可處3至10年監禁。本案15名「抗爭派」中，發起「墨落無悔」聲明的3人，包括鄒家成、梁晃維及張可森，為量刑最重，法官以8年監禁為量刑起點，並指他們協助計劃成功。其他被告則以7年監禁為起點。由於鄒家成受審後定罪，沒有認罪減刑，只因誤解法律減3個月，故他為眾被告中刑期最重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以下為抗爭派15人的判刑理由及刑期：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;鄒家成&quot;&gt;鄒家成&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9Kr4AvR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image27&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成為案中刑期最重的被告。法官指，他為新界西參選人，現正就七一暴動案服刑61個月及15天。鄒雖然並非計劃組織者或「首要分子」，但他為「墨落無悔」聲明的發起人。法官認為，「墨落無悔」或許不會為計劃增添太多作用，不過鄒盡力綑綁參與者以確保成功。法官強調，「墨落無悔」聲明確實是令本案更嚴重的因素。法官採納8年監禁為量刑起點，因他對法律無知扣減3個月，但他受審後定罪，沒有其他減刑，總刑期為7年9個月，與暴動案分期執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;梁晃維&quot;&gt;梁晃維&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cmvhUM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，港島區的梁晃維是「墨落無悔」聲明的起草人之一，他亦有出席港島區協調會議、選舉論壇及抗爭派記者會。法官考慮到梁草擬聲明，屬於較積極主動角色，因此以8年監禁為量刑起點。法官因他認罪減刑三分一，再因誤解計劃合法性，給予3個月減刑；另考慮他參與公共服務，減刑2個月，總刑期為4年11個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;張可森&quot;&gt;張可森&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rU2F2EM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參選新界西的張可森，法官指他與梁晃維及鄒家成一同發起「墨落無悔」聲明，他亦出席本土抗爭派的記者會。惟法官接納張並非組織者，亦不是計劃的發起人，因此將他納入「積極參加者」，但他所比起一般參與者做得更多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，「墨落無悔」聲明是綑綁參與者以免違背計劃，張與其他發起人承諾確保計劃成功。他為這個重大的計劃提供協助。法官決定以8年監禁為量刑起點，認罪扣減三分一，再因對法律無知及參與公共服務，分別減刑3個月及2個月，總刑期為4年11個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官提到，從張的求情信可見，他展現了真誠的悔意，相信懲教署未來會在評估是否批准提早釋放的時候，將這點納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;何桂藍&quot;&gt;何桂藍&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/riWyMLz.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image30&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為新界東選區的何桂藍，她曾任職記者，罪成後沒有任何求情陳詞。法官考慮其角色後，以7年監禁為量刑起點。她受審後定罪及無求情，故沒有減刑，判囚7年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;余慧明&quot;&gt;余慧明&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5ObZoao.png&quot; alt=&quot;image31&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就衞生服務界的余慧明，她被捕前為註冊護士，於醫管局任職。法官指，雖然余是計劃的「遲來者（latercomer）」，沒有參與協調會議或選舉論壇，但不會因此降低量刑起點。法官解釋，因《國安法》實施前的行為只是作為背景，再加上余在初選後仍然活躍發聲。法官認為，余在本案中為「積極參加者」，以7年監禁為量刑起點，因她可能誤解法律減刑3個月。但她受審後定罪，以及沒有其他減刑因素，總刑期為6年9個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;伍健偉&quot;&gt;伍健偉&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Lhyu8h2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為新界西選區的伍健偉，他在求情信中提及不會為自己相信的價值而道歉，除了認罪之外沒有其他求情原因。法官採納7年監禁為量刑起點，因應他遲認罪，即開審當天才認罪，給予20%扣減，總刑期為5年7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;黃之鋒&quot;&gt;黃之鋒&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ktNPPyf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image33&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參選九龍東的黃之鋒，法官接納他屬「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。法官以7年監禁為量刑起點，因認罪獲三分一扣減。但由於黃沒有提及自己誤解法律，因此不會獲這方面的扣減。另外，黃過往有多項刑事紀錄，因此不會被視為良好品格，在無其他減刑下，他共囚4年8個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;岑敖暉&quot;&gt;岑敖暉&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/31B2ghA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image34&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於超區的岑敖暉，法官指他為「積極參加者」，並以7年監禁為量刑起點。法官指他及時認罪及有悔意，給予三分一減刑；另因其妻子及同事在求情信提及他參與公共服務，額外減刑2個月，總刑期為4年半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官提到，檢視岑的求情文件之後，接受岑有真誠悔意，現已改過自新，相信懲教等當局評估是否提早釋放時，會考慮到這方面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;朱凱廸&quot;&gt;朱凱廸&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yMLbLb0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於參選新界西的朱凱廸，法官採納7年監禁為量刑起點，因他認罪扣減三分一，再因他對法律無知減刑3個月。但由於他過往有兩項刑事紀錄，因此不會考慮其過往服務再給予減刑，他的總刑期為4年5個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;馮達浚&quot;&gt;馮達浚&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WnUKE8d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image36&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參選九龍西的馮達浚，法官指他為「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。法官以7年監禁為量刑起點，因他認罪給予三分一減刑，以及因他對法律無知減刑3個月，總刑期為4年5個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;劉頴匡&quot;&gt;劉頴匡&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/spsY9Rd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image37&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為新界東選區的劉頴匡，他現正就七一立法會暴動案服刑54個月及20天。法官在本案中將他納入為「積極參加者」，並以7年監禁為量刑起點，認罪扣減三分一，再因對法律的無知減刑3個月，總刑期為4年5個月。法官認為本案與暴動案沒有直接關係，因此刑期不會同期執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官提到，劉的朋友和前僱主對他高度評價，劉在庭上陳詞時具說服力，他願意承擔責任，表達了悔意，承諾不會再犯。法官相信懲教等當局會留意到他的轉變，在評估是否提早釋放時納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;黃子悅&quot;&gt;黃子悅&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wkgEVmZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image38&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為新界西選區的黃子悅，現正就一宗暴動案服刑37個月。法官指她為「積極參加者」，以7年監禁為量刑起點，認罪扣減三分一，再因對法律無知減刑3個月。法官表示，本案與暴動案並無關聯，因此不會同期執行，總刑期為4年5個月。黃在求情信中解釋她過往患上的情緒病患，並表示會為自己所作所為承受後果。法官表示，相信懲教當局在考慮是否提早釋放時會考慮以上因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;袁嘉蔚&quot;&gt;袁嘉蔚&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2qLqI2E.png&quot; alt=&quot;image39&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指港島區的袁嘉蔚有參與協調會議、選舉論壇及抗爭派記者會，亦簽署「墨落無悔」聲明。法官以7年監禁為量刑起點，考慮到她及時認罪，因此給予三分一減刑；另因她可能誤解計劃合法性，額外給予3個月減刑。法官亦指，袁由2020年1月起從事公共服務，因此獲2個月減刑，總刑期為4年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;李嘉達&quot;&gt;李嘉達&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4sXwpoW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image40&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參與九龍東的李嘉達，法官指他屬於「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。法官以7年監禁為量刑起點，因認罪減刑三分一，再因對法律無知及過往任區議員的貢獻，分別減刑3個月及2個月，總刑期為4年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;王百羽&quot;&gt;王百羽&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yfH3H1c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image41&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就超區的王百羽，法官指他為「積極參加者」，並以7年監禁為量刑起點。他認罪可獲減刑三分一，並因他可能誤解法律而減刑3個月，再因他參與公共服務及獲親友求情，減刑兩個月，總刑期為4年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官提到，與岑敖暉的情況相似，接受王現已改過自新，相信懲教等當局評估是否提早釋放時，會考慮到這方面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;林景楠任證人囚5年2個月-官無就作供減刑對控方毫無幫助&quot;&gt;林景楠任證人囚5年2個月 官無就作供減刑：對控方毫無幫助&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L1fBhXX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image42&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，其中31人認罪，16人不認罪受審，除李予信及劉偉聰，其餘14人罪成，45人今（19日）判刑。被告林景楠在開審前認罪，並作為控方證人，他要求法庭考慮判社會服務令。惟法官拒絕，並指其證供對控方案情毫無幫助（added nothing to the prosecution case），並難以在裁決理由書中引用。法官最終沒有就他作供給予減刑，只因他派發防疫物資等減刑，他被判囚5年2個月。在非抗爭派中，楊岳橋的量刑起點最高，為8年監禁。法官指在公民黨參加35+計劃期間，楊擔當領導及積極角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以下為非抗爭派被告的判刑理由及刑期：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;楊岳橋&quot;&gt;楊岳橋&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7v7wixJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西選區的楊岳橋，法官指無法接受辯方提出，法庭量刑時應考慮楊屬於較低的範疇。考慮到楊在公民黨的地位，法官毫不懷疑公民黨參與計劃期間，楊擔當領導及積極角色。因此法官以8年監禁為起點，因此就他認罪及被捕後與警方合作，給予三分一減刑。另考慮到他長期為公共服務，給予3個月減刑，總刑期為5年1個月。法官補充，得悉楊的母親身體轉差及後去世，但沒有額外減刑。法官最後提到，相信其重犯機會低，並且相信懲教署能夠在考慮是否提早釋放時能將此因素納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;吳政亨&quot;&gt;吳政亨&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/twrPVFb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image44&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，吳政亨既非組織者亦非候選人。當他發起「三投三不投」計劃時，他尚未是35+計劃的一份子。吳與戴耀廷接觸及溝通後，才成為35+計劃的一份子，而其他參與者並未知道吳的身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官留意到，在《國安法》實施後，吳仍繼續擁護「攬炒」思想，即破壞政府的職能，以讓政府遵守五大訴求。另外，吳還願意繼續推動計劃，並向他人施壓，確保初選獲勝的人才可以參選立法會。吳更在《蘋果日報》刊登廣告，敦促初選落敗者不要參選立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，吳屬於「積極參加者」，並以7年半監禁作為起點。法官考慮到，吳並非追求個人利益，而計劃亦不涉暴力。法官接納吳可能受戴耀廷誤導計劃合法性，因此給予3個月減刑。由於吳不認罪，亦沒有其他扣減，因此判囚7年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;林景楠&quot;&gt;林景楠&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wZZWte9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image45&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞提到，林現年36歲，職業為一名商人，已婚並育有3名子女。辯方求情時主張林應被歸類為「其他參與者」，因他曾向警方錄取2份「無損權益口供」。辯方亦要求法庭考慮判處社會服務令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官認為林所干犯的控罪性質非常嚴重，社服令並非恰當刑罰，而他錄取的2份口供對本案幫助不大，因當中只談及林自己在計劃中的參與；他在庭上的證供亦對控方案情毫無幫助（added nothing to the prosecution case），並難以在裁決理由書中引用，因此法官拒絕替他索取社服令報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;考慮到林的參與程度，法官採用監禁7年為量刑起點，由於他在開審前才認罪，所以只能獲得20%扣減；再考慮到他對法律無知而犯案、在疫情期間提供防護性裝具，因此分別減刑3個月及2個月，最終刑期為5年2個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;鄭達鴻&quot;&gt;鄭達鴻&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hIxHyyS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image46&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為港島選區的鄭達鴻，法官指他有出席協調會議及選舉論壇，因此以7年監禁為量刑起點。由於他尚未成為合資格的律師，亦無法律經驗，故法官接納鄭受他人誤導以為計劃合法，給予3個月減刑。另因他長期公共服務減刑3個月，總刑期為6年半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;徐子見&quot;&gt;徐子見&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QxCLvpj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image47&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為港島選區的徐子見，法官指他是該選區唯一沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明的人，但他曾出席協調會議及選舉論壇。法官決定以7年監禁為量刑起點，認罪扣減三分一，再因可能誤解法律及長期公共服務，各減刑3個月。雖然徐患有骨刺、慢性胰臟炎及糖尿病等，但不代表他無法在獄中獲得適當的治療，因此不會因其健康狀況給予額外減刑。他的總刑期為4年2個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;楊雪盈&quot;&gt;楊雪盈&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KDdSfvl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image48&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同為港島選區的楊雪盈，法官指她有出席協調會議及選舉論壇，以7年監禁為量刑起點。她因誤解法律獲減刑3個月，而且作為區議員參與公共服務、在本地文化上的貢獻，再獲減刑3個月。由於她受審後定罪再無其他減刑，總刑期為6年半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;彭卓棋&quot;&gt;彭卓棋&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nsjYpny.png&quot; alt=&quot;image49&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為港島選區的彭卓棋，他曾建立「香港青年創業聯盟」，協助青年到大灣區創業。法官在本案中以7年監禁為量刑起點，因他可能誤解法律減刑3個月。另外，法官留意到「香港基本法基金會」主席葉國華為彭撰寫求情信，指他被起訴後參與向中小學生推廣《基本法》、《國安法》及「一國兩制」原則。因此，法官就其義工服務給予3個月減刑，總刑期為6年半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為九龍西選區的岑子杰，法官指他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。因此以7年監禁為起點，認罪扣減三分一，再因誤解法律及公共服務，分別減刑3個月及2個月，總刑期為4年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;毛孟靜&quot;&gt;毛孟靜&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ebBoy8U.png&quot; alt=&quot;image51&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為九龍西選區的毛孟靜，法官指她為「積極參加者」，她亦同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。因此以7年監禁為起點，認罪扣減三分一，再因誤解法律及公共服務，分別減刑3個月及3個月，總刑期為4年2個月。法官提到，雖然她求情指丈夫身體情況變差，但這並不構成減刑因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;何啟明&quot;&gt;何啟明&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XPFRcW5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image52&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為九龍西選區的何啟明，法官指他屬「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。因此以7年監禁為起點，並因誤解法律及公共服務，分別減刑3個月及2個月，總刑期為6年7個月。他受審後罪成沒有其他減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GJxVx3m.png&quot; alt=&quot;image53&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為九龍西選區的黃碧雲，辯方求情指其政治取態屬溫和務實，而她在串謀中亦沒有任何計劃或直接角色，因此應該將她列入「其他參加者」。惟法庭認為其角色屬「積極參加者」，她同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。法官以7年監禁為起點，因誤解法律及公共服務，分別減刑3個月及3個月，總刑期為6年半。她受審後定罪沒有其他減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為九龍西選區的劉澤鋒，辯方指他在初選落敗後，已沒有參與計劃，他亦沒有任何政治影響力。法官認為他屬於「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。因此以7年監禁為起點，並因認罪減刑三分一、誤解法律減刑3個月，總刑期為4年5個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為九龍東選區的譚文豪，法官認為他屬於「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。因此以7年監禁為起點，因認罪減刑三分一，再因誤解法律及公共服務，分別減刑3個月及3個月，總刑期為4年2個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;譚得志&quot;&gt;譚得志&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/10K6wVl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image56&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為九龍東選區的譚得志，法官認為他屬於「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。因此以7年監禁為起點，認罪減刑三分一。辯方指譚就另一煽動案的言論，與初選有關，故兩案應該一同審理。法官考慮到譚已服畢該案刑期，因此減刑3個月，以反映兩案整體性，總刑期為4年5個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;胡志偉&quot;&gt;胡志偉&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同為九龍東選區的胡志偉，法官認為他屬於「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。因此以7年監禁為起點，認罪減刑三分一，並因誤解法律減刑3個月，總刑期為4年5個月。法官不同意辯方指，胡在其他案件因良好品格獲減刑，代表他在本案中同樣可以。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;施德來&quot;&gt;施德來&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c87R9DS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image58&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於九龍東選區的施德來，法官認為他屬於「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。法官以7年監禁為起點，考慮到他誤解法律及公共服務，分別減刑3個月及2個月，但受審後定罪無其他扣減，總刑期為6年7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;尹兆堅&quot;&gt;尹兆堅&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nc4uPvW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image59&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;新界西選區的尹兆堅，法官指他屬於「積極參加者」，他同意一旦成功在立法會當選，將會無差別否決財政預算案。法官以7年監禁為起點，認罪扣減三分一，總刑期為4年8個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;郭家麒&quot;&gt;郭家麒&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Q5p72K8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image60&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;考慮到郭的參與程度，法官採用監禁7年為起點，因及時認罪及配合警方調查而扣減三分一刑期，再考慮他誤解法律而扣減3個月，亦因其長期服務社會而額外扣減3個月，此外看不到任何進一步減刑理由，因此判囚4年2個月。法官特別提到，相信郭的重犯機會低，並且相信懲教署能夠在考慮是否提早釋放時能將此因素納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;吳敏兒&quot;&gt;吳敏兒&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cvSrMoX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image61&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為新界西選區的吳敏兒，辯方指她參與程度低，沒有出席協調會議或記者會，只是出席選舉論壇，加上她落敗後已沒有參與其中。法官以7年監禁為起點，認罪扣減三分一，亦因對法律誤解減刑3個月，總刑期為4年5個月。法官提到，吳在手寫求情信中表示自己犯了很嚴重的法律，相信懲教署日後考慮提早釋放的機會時，會將她的歉意納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;譚凱邦&quot;&gt;譚凱邦&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rEUI6YJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image62&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為新界西選區的譚凱邦，他指自己患上皮膚問題，有時需要入院治療。但法官認為並不會造成額外的困難，因此不能證明進一步減刑是合理。法官以7年監禁為起點，認罪扣減三分一，亦因對法律誤解減刑3個月，以及其對環境及動物的社區工作減刑兩個月，總刑期為4年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;陳志全&quot;&gt;陳志全&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BD1OhgQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image63&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西選區的陳志全，辯方指他並無親身出席協調會議或記者會，在選舉論壇中亦很少發言。法官以7年監禁為量刑起點，就對法律誤解及公共服務各減刑3個月，總刑期為6年半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;林卓廷&quot;&gt;林卓廷&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KPosNGJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image64&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西選區的林卓廷，辯方指其參與度低，並無出席協調會議及簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，亦無提及要否決財政預算案。法官以7年為監禁量刑起點，因他對法律誤解減刑3個月，但因受審後定罪無減刑，總刑期為6年9個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;范國威&quot;&gt;范國威&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YF5UXjt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image65&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西選區的范國威，辯方指他沒有參加計劃或組織角色，應該被納入「其他參加者」。辯方亦求情指，范的父親已離世，亦有家人身患重病。范撰寫求情信表明後悔，法官指希望懲教署考慮給予減刑時，留意到其態度。法官以7年監禁為起點，認罪扣減三分一，再因他對法律誤解及公共服務，各減刑3個月，總刑期為4年2個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;呂智恆&quot;&gt;呂智恆&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/blxlBDn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image66&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西選區的呂智恆，辯方指他參與程度少，應該被列入「其他參加者」級別。他亦因對政治的天真而參與計劃，當時希望政府能夠改善社會問題。辯方亦指，呂在定罪後沒有辦法再任職社工，他現已感後悔。法官肯定他有真誠悔意，相信懲教署考慮減刑時會注意到。法官認為，呂屬於「積極參加者」，並以7年監禁為起點，認罪扣減三分一，另因對法律誤解及公共服務，各減刑3個月及2個月，總刑期為4年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;梁國雄&quot;&gt;梁國雄&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OfZp7Wb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image67&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新界西選區的梁國雄，辯方認為他屬於「其他參加者」，因沒有重大參與度。法官不同意辯方指，梁有良好品格，因他過往有刑事紀錄。法官以7年監禁為量刑起點，因他誤解法律減刑3個月，他受審後定罪沒有其他扣減，共囚6年9個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;柯耀林&quot;&gt;柯耀林&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nF4jvHg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image68&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後就新界西選區的柯耀林，辯方指他應該屬於「其他參加者」，因他在計劃中的行為和平，在選舉論壇的發言有限，其影響力也有限。法官以7年監禁為起點，就誤解法律及公共服務各減刑3個月及2個月，他受審後定罪沒有其他減刑，總刑期為6年7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;官不接受被告稱涉案計劃註定失敗-61萬投票市民不如此認為&quot;&gt;官：不接受被告稱涉案計劃註定失敗 61萬投票市民不如此認為&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TbwhmAY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image69&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，其中31人認罪，16人不認罪受審，除李予信及劉偉聰之外，餘下14人皆被裁定罪成。45人今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）判刑。3名國安法指定法官頒下書面判刑理由，當中回應辯方求情時提出的法律爭議，考慮到本案控罪是「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，法官認為《國安法》第22條的刑罰分級制雖有參考價值，但是並不完全適用。辯方另提到涉案計劃註定失敗，惟法官則認為不應猜測，但是可以肯定的是所有參與者均用盡努力希望令涉案計劃成功，當時亦從未有人提及計劃不可能實現，而61萬名有份投票的市民亦不認為是如此。法官指初選的競選者是涉案計劃之中的重要人物，沒有他們，涉案計劃便不可能開始，他們支持及積極參與在這計劃之中，因此應被歸類為「積極參與者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷等部份被告質疑刑罰分級制不適用-官裁不應硬性地套用&quot;&gt;戴耀廷等部份被告質疑刑罰分級制不適用 官裁不應硬性地套用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加」可判監3至10年；「其他參加」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官在判刑理由中先處理法律爭議，在求情階段，部份被告質疑刑罰分級制不適用於本案，其中代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明、代表袁嘉蔚和馮達浚的資深大律師祁志等，爭議被告被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，是以串謀罪、而非《國安法》罪行定罪，故此刑期分級制不適用。控方則指，經1983年的修例，立法原意是容許法庭針對「企圖」、「串謀」和「煽惑」罪行的刑罰，與實質作出的罪行相等，因此本案的「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪刑罰應跟從《國安法》第22條的刑罰分級制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過判詞指，《刑事罪行條例》第159C條指「串謀」罪行的最高刑罰，與實質罪行的最高刑罰相同，當中只提及「最高刑罰」。經考慮案例，以及本案控罪是「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，法官認為《國安法》第22條的刑罰分級制雖有參考價值，但是並不完全適用（should not be strictly applicable）在本案，因第159C條的用字清晰不含糊，只提及「最高刑罰」。然而法官強調，無論如何，這並不會窒礙法庭考慮立法機關怎樣看罪行的嚴重性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方曾經引用今年3月才立法的《維護國安條例》，當中第109(a)條指「如任何人被裁定串謀犯任何《香港國安法》所訂罪行(國安法罪行)，則《香港國安法》下關於該項國安法罪行的罰則的條文，亦適用於該項串謀犯罪的罰則」，要求法庭考慮串謀干犯國安罪行的刑罰分級制立法原意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，法官指《維護國安條例》是一個在本港立法機構制訂的本地法，惟《香港國安法》屬於全國性法律、在北京全國人大代表大會立法，兩者的立法機構層次不同，邏輯上難以將本地法律用來確認全國性法律的立法原意。再者，《維護國安條例》立法時，已明確表明條文沒有追溯力，因此法官認為控方所引用的《維護國安條例》第109(a)條對本案幫助不大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告求情稱計劃註定失敗-官所有參與者均用盡努力希望成功&quot;&gt;被告求情稱計劃註定失敗 官：所有參與者均用盡努力希望成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方求情亦提到，「干預、阻撓、削弱特區政府功能」的後果，非常視乎涉案計劃是否能夠實現；他們力陳，即使初選勝出者沒有被「DQ」、立法會選舉沒有因疫情而延期，涉案計劃也註定失敗，因計劃參與者未能確保爭奪到足夠議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/55lPYhx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image70&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月31日，政府宣布押後2021年立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，法官認為，涉案計劃最終會否成功，並不由法庭自行作出猜測，但是可以肯定的是所有參與者均用盡努力希望令涉案計劃成功。從證據可見，兩名主要組織者均對於計劃感到樂觀，他們動用大量時間和金錢來舉行記者會、協調會議和選舉論壇，又委託民調機構、眾籌計劃等。一些獨立人士招募義工來協助計劃。各初選競選者組成選舉團隊、認真設計和構思選舉單張；他們亦收集選舉提名、提交選舉按金，以上種種行動均顯示所有初選參與者都希望能夠成功舉行到初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，對於萬一有人被取消資格，他們亦有詳細討論「Plan B」制度，顯示他們考慮及討論過所有可能發生的情況。除了參與初選的人之外，沒有參與初選、但發起「三投三不投」的被告吳政亨，則投放大量金錢賣廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官61萬名投票市民亦不認為計劃絕對不能實現&quot;&gt;官：61萬名投票市民亦不認為計劃絕對不能實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，若非疫情緣故導致2021年的立法會選舉延期，涉案計劃並不是註定失敗。當初選投票日在7月11及12日舉行時，從沒有人提及過這計劃純綷「學術操作」（no more than an academic exercise），或者說計劃絕對不能實現，「61萬名普通市民亦不認為是如此。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，正如每宗涉及顛覆國家政權案件般，若要計劃成功，組織者和參與者均有一些困難需要克服，因此法官拒絕接納「計劃註定失敗」的說法，以及不會判處較輕刑罰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接受部份被告被戴耀廷誤導而相信初選不違法&quot;&gt;官接受部份被告被戴耀廷誤導而相信初選不違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;部份被告聲稱，基於戴耀廷多次重申初選不違法，所以他們當時真誠誤信涉案謀劃為合法。法官表示，就部份被告而言，接受他們有上述說法；但是就戴耀廷和楊岳橋而言，法官不接受他們基於對法律無知而犯案，因二人是律師，加上二人堅決地執行涉案計劃。法官又指，涉案計劃在他們眼中是合法與否，並無關宏旨，他們的而且確曾向其他人推銷涉案計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/t2fPuG8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image71&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊岳橋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，戴耀廷主張極端的「攬炒十步曲」，雖然他在求情信中聲稱從來無意以該十步曲作為其政治行動藍圖，但是該文章的確作出該主張。不論如何，戴在數個月以來持續發表文章，其進取思想有跡可尋。實質上，戴是提倡了一場革命。法官另指，楊岳橋在公民黨記者會中使用強烈措辭，可見他亦非常進取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官需考慮國安法前言行-以考慮串謀嚴重性及各人角色&quot;&gt;官：需考慮《國安法》前言行 以考慮串謀嚴重性及各人角色&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷的代表大律師曾力陳，法庭量刑時不應考慮被告在《國安法》生效之前的言行，因當時並不違法。法官表示，接受被告當初協議所作的事並不違法，直至《國安法》生效之後才變成違法，可是他們繼續留在該協議之中，並繼續參與涉案計劃。雖然控罪時期從2020年7月1日才開始，但是法庭不會完全不考慮7月1日之前發生的事情，因為需要評估涉案串謀的嚴重性和廣泛性，以及各人在計劃中的角色。不過法官強調，被告不會因為《國安法》生效之前的言行而受罰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初選的競選者應被歸類為積極參與者&quot;&gt;初選的競選者應被歸類為「積極參與者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;部份被告求情時稱，本案涉及的《國安法》第22(3)條（嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞中央政權機關或者香港特區政權機關依法履行職能），嚴重性比第22(1)、(2)、(3)條為低，包括「推翻、破壞中國憲法所確立的中國根本制度」、「推翻中央或特區政權」和「攻擊、破壞香港特區政權機關履職場所及其設施」。惟法官不接納此說法，因罪行的嚴重性取決於很多因素，包括計劃規模、執行方式和手段、涉及人數、潛在損害和實際後果等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案而言，法官指初選的競選者是涉案計劃之中的重要人物，沒有他們，涉案計劃便不可能開始，他們支持及積極參與在這計劃之中，因此應被歸類為「積極參與者」。若計劃持續執行直到結尾，所帶來的負面後果可以很深遠，比顛覆特區政權有過之而無不及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，其中31人認罪，16人不認罪受審，除李予信及劉偉聰，其餘14人罪成，45人被判囚4年2個月至10年。法官在判詞提到，其中11名被告展現真誠悔意，相信當局未來評估是否批准提早釋放時，會納入考慮。代表岑子杰的辯方提到，在《維護國家安全條例》生效後，《監獄規則》有所修改，因此岑並未能獲得減刑。惟法官指，減刑是由懲教署署長決定，而非法庭考慮之列。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查報導，《維護國家安全條例》於今年3月生效，並對《監管釋囚條例》及《監獄規則》作出修訂，列明若囚犯是被裁定犯危害國家安全的罪行而服刑，除非懲教署署長信納提早釋放或減刑不會不利國家安全，否則不得將囚犯的個案轉介予監管釋囚委員會考慮，或不得獲減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案今早判刑，不認罪的前記者何桂藍被判囚7年。何在判刑後於Facebook專頁以中、英文發文，回顧自己由2019年反修例運動至接受審訊時的所思所想。她形容，自己所參與的2020年的民主派初選是「香港最後一次自由公正的選舉」，而她選擇不認罪，是為了捍衛61萬港人的政治表態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又說，痛苦很難，甚至不可能分擔，但意志則可以真正穿透牆內外；她相信無人可以定義「香港係咩」，但人人都可以拓闊「香港可以係咩」：「我嘅選擇同行動就係我對『香港可以係咩』嘅回答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在初選中參選新界東選區的何桂藍曾任職記者，在初選案中受審後被裁定罪成。法官在判辭形容，何是「擁有最激進政見的參與者之一」，何參選是望將香港現行制度「連根拔起」、反對「一國兩制」，無疑意圖令特區陷入完全停頓並「破局」。何沒有任何求情陳詞，法官考慮其角色後，以7年監禁為量刑起點，並因她是受審後定罪及無求情，故沒有減刑，判囚7年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何初選是香港最後一次自由公平的選舉-惟案件令人放棄民主希望&quot;&gt;何：初選是香港「最後一次自由公平的選舉」 惟案件令人放棄民主希望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在文中，何桂藍先用英文回顧自己對2019年反修例運動的印象。何說，她記得人們參與反修例運動，是因為目睹了不公和壓迫，從而生起無法阻擋的衝動去表態及抗爭，並渴望與彼此建立聯繫。於是，港人汲取過去的失敗，花額外的努力進行溝通，小心翼翼不讓謠言從內部撕裂運動；而當社會制度一層接一層的崩潰，「我們超越恐懼，成為真正的公民社會，每個人都在實踐公民身份的真正含義。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她續說，但當政權剝奪人們抗議的權利，「我哋」轉向另一條道路爭取回應，亦即選舉。她形容，自己參加的2020年的民主派初選，是香港「最後一次自由公平的選舉」；她因此被起訴，但選擇不認罪，是為了捍衛61萬投票港人的政治表態。她形容，本案是香港的轉捩點，「港人被恐嚇至沉默，被迫放棄民主的希望」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，控方的指控不單是在「歪曲事實」，更在迫使被告否定過去的經歷，令團結、共同體、連繫、誠實的對話等等成為「烏托邦的夢想」，而非真實存在的事物。但她選擇對抗，以證明這些聯繫是已經實現並繼續存在；她過去的見證和經歷的事，構成和定義了她的身份，她要定義自己是誰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何歷史係自由有意志嘅人書寫&quot;&gt;何：歷史係自由有意志嘅人書寫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍在文章後段轉用中文，講述她對痛苦和自由的理解。她認為，痛苦很難，甚至不可能分擔，但意志則可以真正穿透牆內外。她又指，苦難令「我哋」的共同體出現，但無法成長，因此每個個體都要思考「自己本身想點」，選擇和承擔自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她說，「歷史唔係由贏者書寫，而係自由有意志嘅人書寫」，又指無人可以定義「香港係咩」，但人人都可以拓闊「香港可以係咩」：「係，會遇到好多限制同阻力，但正正係喺同現實碰撞先會知自己咩料，透過反覆嘅自我懷疑，先會淬煉出真正嘅執著。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;專訪吳政亨我以傻為榮&quot;&gt;專訪吳政亨：我以「傻」為榮&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oyXqNUW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image87&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】歷時三年半，這宗《國安法》實施後最大規模的案件終於判刑。最初被指為案件「重要份子」之一的「三投三不投」發起人吳政亨，被判囚7年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.」判刑前一周，在荔枝角收押所待了逾三年半的吳政亨一臉淡定，兩三句交待近況後，反問起探訪者的日常。印象之中，這幾年間他一直如此，甚少顯露負面情緒，也從未抱怨鐵窗內的生活。最大的變化，是瘦了差不多15公斤，幸好獄中規律的生活也令他健康狀況好轉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;過去三年，《獨媒》與這名在政圈中「完完全全的無名氏」保持聯絡，了解他的成長經歷、政治啟蒙、獄中生活等等。吳政亨提到，自己在1997年前已隨家人移民澳洲，成年後才回到香港工作，並因2014年雨傘運動而對這地方改觀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UUd5EhP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image88&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨從獄中寄出的部分信件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;入獄之後，他一度自學法律，並且選擇不認罪。可曾覺得自己有點「傻」？吳反問「傻」的定義：「對我嚟講，『傻』只係代表『唔計到盡』同埋『唔自私』。係呢個定義之下，我認我係『傻』，我亦為自己嘅『傻』而覺得光榮。某程度上，我亦希望呢個世界多啲呢種『傻』人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他明言，至今從未為自己的抉擇而後悔：「我真心相信呢件係正確嘅事，係我想做嘅事，亦係我需要做嘅事。當一個人真心地有呢種信念時，其實要堅持並不困難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（編按：吳政亨在初選案中選擇不認罪，今年5月被裁定罪成。法官稱，留意到在《國安法》實施後，吳仍繼續擁護「攬炒」思想，即破壞政府的職能，以讓政府遵守五大訴求；另外，吳還願意繼續推動計劃，並向他人施壓，確保初選獲勝的人才可以參選立法會。吳更在《蘋果日報》刊登廣告，敦促初選落敗者不要參選立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，吳屬於「積極參加者」，並以7年半監禁作為起點。法官考慮到，吳並非追求個人利益，而計劃亦不涉暴力。法官接納吳可能受戴耀廷誤導計劃合法性，因此給予3個月減刑。由於吳不認罪，亦沒有其他扣減，因此判囚7年3個月。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1997年前移民澳洲-視香港為功利社會&quot;&gt;1997年前：移民澳洲 視香港為功利社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;入獄那年，吳政亨42歲，現在是46歲。在2021年1月6日被捕之前，並沒有太多人聽過他的名字，皆因他並非初選參加者，亦沒有政黨背景，僅僅因為曾發起「三投三不投」，在新聞報道中出現過一兩次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據吳自述，他在香港出生，本身從事金融業。他既是香港公民，亦持澳洲國籍——1992年，他讀完中二後便隨家人移民澳洲，離開的原因和許多香港人一樣，因為三年前在中國發生的那一件大事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;年少的吳政亨享受澳洲的生活方式，也不太留戀香港。他說不喜歡香港那種「功利」的感覺，無論是事業、才能、讀書、揀偶，一切都仿佛是以錢作為量度標準。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;強調自己討厭「功利」的吳政亨，畢業後卻投身進金融行業。他解釋，自己讀書時主修數學和精算，結果被一份對沖基金交易員（Hudge Fund Trader）的招聘廣告吸引住目光：「所要嘅能力同興趣，好似為我度身訂造咁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他形容，這份工作就如「職業賭徒」，也忙碌得足以佔據他每日的24小時。2008年，他因工作需要而回到香港，而當時對香港的印象仍然是「功利」——直到2014年，這個印象才徹底扭轉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2014年金鐘的眼淚&quot;&gt;2014年：金鐘的眼淚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨說，2014年不完全是自己的政治啟蒙。在這之前，他會思考政治、會思考對與錯，會思考公民的權利和義務；不過，他甚少與至親以外的人談論政見，亦曾經以為香港人對政治不感興趣，因而覺得「搵錢更實際」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2014年9月28日，吳政亨在金鐘流下許多眼淚。他說當下才發現：「原來一直以來，膚淺而功利嘅係我自己，唔係香港人。」後來一段日子，他下班後總會步行到金鐘，為自修室裡的學生補習數學，週末則會去「瞓馬路」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如今的他承認，自己當時對社會運動的想法實在過於理想化。在「拆大台」、示威者衝擊立法會玻璃、退聯等連串事件發生之前，他還未意識到「和理非」和「勇武」、「泛民」和「本土」之間的紛爭，比想像中嚴重。打從這一個時間點起，他覺得自己需要、也可以「做一啲嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019年連登仔李伯盧&quot;&gt;2019年：「連登仔」李伯盧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;傘運之後，社運氣氛一度沉寂，直至2019年反修例運動爆發，香港翻天覆地改變。於是，吳政亨以網名「李伯盧」，在網上討論區連登開設帳戶——他笑言自己走在時代末端：「但如果有人以『連登仔』稱呼我嘅話，我會覺得係一個榮耀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「李伯盧」取自英文單詞 liberal 的音譯。一年多之間，他發了超過80個帖文，主題多圍繞當下的社運和政治事件；2020年民主派初選期間，「李伯盧」亦發起「三不投」的倡議，呼籲選民參與聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所謂的「三不投」是指：不投反對初選的人、不投不參與初選的人和不投在初選落選的人。這亦是被指控干犯「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪的主因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨坦承，當時並沒想過自己會因此而被捕——「但如果我被捕，只可能係因為《國安法》。因為我係奉公守法嘅一個人，一直做嘅嘢都係依法而行。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BywlF5c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image92&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2021年顛覆認知後的反思&quot;&gt;2021年：顛覆認知後的反思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021年1月6日，吳政亨和其餘52人被指因組織或參與民主派初選，涉嫌違反《港區國安法》被捕。他形容，當日清晨到其處所進行拘捕的國安處人員顯得隆重其事，甚至對於他登上警車後，仍沒有他被捕的新聞出現而感到驚奇。不過吳政亨當時心想：「傳媒報漏咗我呢啲二打六，有乜咁出奇？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;兩天後他才知道，自己是案件中被歸納為組織及策劃的五名「重要份子」之一。如果不是整件事如此切身，他大概會忍唔住笑出聲——「唔 L 係呀嘛？」但當下他除了爆粗，已不知道該說甚麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳政亨形容，這件事顛覆了他對許多事情的認知，令他不得不重新再作思考。以家人為例，以前他們擔心他的安危、勸他保護好自己時，吳總是不太理會，認為他們過度憂慮；但被捕之後，他開始反思：會否家人才是旁觀者清？他有否自私地無視了家人的感受？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他沒有定論。還柙初期，來探望吳政亨的朋友不算太多，倒是家人反覆前來探望，令他覺得不好意思。他肯定自己做的許多事情，都不是家人所希望的：「但咁代唔代表，佢哋有權去阻止我做呢？我又唔覺得佢哋有權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「我愛我家人，我亦相信佢哋愛我。但我哋未必係以對方想要嘅方式去愛。而拒絕對方想要嘅方式去愛，算唔算自私呢？我答唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;還柙前拍攝香港風景-入獄後發佈改詞作品&quot;&gt;還柙前拍攝香港風景 入獄後發佈改詞作品&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年2月28日，包括吳政亨在內的47名被捕者被正式落案起訴，罪名是「串謀顛覆國家政權」。經過一連四天馬拉松式聆訊，他和大多數被告的保釋申請均被拒絕，須即時還柙。後來吳政亨再申請保釋覆核亦遭拒絕，直至判刑日，他在荔枝角收押所還柙逾1,350天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被捕後至還柙前的一段日子，吳政亨如常地生活，只是多了到香港不同地方拍攝風景。他開始研究攝影，想趁尚有自由，留下多些紀錄和紀念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他還在網上發佈了以被捕一事為靈感的改詞作品《初選被拉的岑敖暉與關尚義》。原本是隨便寫寫，沒想到許多人因此誤以為他喜歡研究歌詞，寫信給他時紛紛附上各式各樣的歌詞——吳附上一個滴汗的笑哈哈公仔，「澄清」他其實較喜歡自己作詞，也因為怕在潛意識裡抄襲了他人風格，故從不敢太仔細研究別人的作品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在澳洲生活時，他曾為自己的樂隊和獨立歌手寫詞，亦有為當地教會寫原創音樂劇，後來因為工作太忙碌，才逐漸放下這項興趣。不過在還柙期間，他先後透過關注組發佈兩曲，包括《聖誕應該快樂》和《上杉達也》。兩首歌均由吳的牆外朋友作曲，再以「0243」填詞法將旋律交給吳，讓他在未能「聽」到旋律的情況下填詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;獄中讀小說自學法律-做運動改善健康&quot;&gt;獄中讀小說自學法律 做運動改善健康&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了填（作）詞，吳政亨還有數不清的興趣。從睇波打高爾夫球滑雪，到唱歌辯論捉棋都喜歡，不過他最喜歡的是思考。曾有人寄了一道號稱「史上最難邏輯題」給他，讓他和囚友花上好幾天，才成功解謎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而他入獄後「解鎖」的新興趣，是讀小說和做運動。還柙期間，他在獄中沒有工作，每天不斷看書和思考（貼切啲其實是「發吽哣」）。從前，他較常看工具書或實用性書籍，但入獄後看多了小說，陳浩基、沈從文、朱少麟、Michael Lewis⋯⋯「可能是因為看書時可以抽離一下現實，不用面對眼前的四堵牆。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了小說，他也讀歷史、法律、哲學、漫畫等等。之所以會讀法律書，是因為吳政亨在入獄初期一度想過自辯。沒法律底子的他托律師朋友送入基礎書籍和案例文件，從零開始學習。可法律畢竟是一門專業，那段時間一問起他的學習情況，他就鄒眉說要看漫畫「減壓」，最終還是選擇了聘請律師應付審訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於運動方面，因為獄中可做的事有限，吳像許多囚友般開始健身。除了在放風時段踢毽或跑步，他也會做掌上壓和仰臥起坐等訓練，成功減去近15公斤。獄中生活規律，他的健康狀況亦有好轉。入獄之前，他的血液內肝酵素經常超標，但在獄中體檢時已經回復正常。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初期探訪者不多-榮幸與政治犯以朋友相稱&quot;&gt;初期探訪者不多 榮幸與「政治犯」以朋友相稱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;獄中生活規律，吳政亨每日的作息都是重複的：早上7時起床，然後放風、食早餐，拜山（親友探訪），食午餐，發呆，食晚餐，踢竇，檢查緊急鐘，晚上10時關燈睡覺。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在期望管理下，他不覺得鐵窗生活真的很苦，「人生嘅嘢，好又係咁過，唔好又係咁過」。但唯一一次他顯得有點失落，是提起沒太多朋友到收押所探訪他的時候。他坦言，本來身邊政見不同的朋友就比政見相同的多，而入獄之後，來探訪他的人也不多——大概是想避免和他有接觸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;入獄初期，吳亦曾在親友探訪時段時發脾氣：「但後來發現，當一啲當時本來已唔情唔願嘅人，終於唔再勉強或装扮，真正離開我嘅生命之後，我嘅心情反而平復咗落嚟。」時至今日，他自認為情緒比入獄前想像的好，並形容在獄中最大的得著，是認識許多新朋友，包括同案或其他政治案件的被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;不原諒從犯證人-拒認罪因堅信自己無犯法&quot;&gt;不原諒從犯證人 拒認罪因堅信自己無犯法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這段時間讓吳政亨最傷心、最難以接受，是知道有同案被告任控方證人的時候。他說無法原諒他們：「我亦自信我有資格去講呢句『唔原諒』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（編按：除了戴耀廷，案中其餘三名組織者，區諾軒、趙家賢及鍾錦麟均選擇擔任「從犯證人」。法官指，區的證供屬「關鍵（crucial）」，趙的證供亦協助法庭達成裁決，三人最終各獲減免45%至50%刑期。）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在初選案中，吳選擇不認罪。他透過關注組發表文章，講述自己在認罪與不認罪之間的考慮和猶疑；他說要考慮的因素太多，包括勝算、刑期、社會關注、個人生理及心理質素等；但他亦因為「絕對不認為」自己犯了罪，因此「我恐懼，但我不退」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關於堅持的動力，他沒有確實答案。「如果你問我，我係唔係自細都係一個事事都好堅持嘅人，我可以講你知，一定唔係。細個讀書，有興趣啲科我會考得好好，但無興趣嘅科我可以考到不知所謂。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「如果要我估，點解自己會堅持到，我認為係因為我做呢個決定，係經過深思熟慮嘅：唔係意氣用事，唔係為勢所逼，亦唔係為攞一時嘅鎂光燈。可以好肯定講，我無後悔過，亦相信我永遠唔會後悔律政司所指控我所做過嘅行為。我真誠相信，我所做嘅嘢無犯法。我正在盡全力希望喺法庭內證明呢一點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;毋用過份悲觀 無人能預知未來&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「有沒有後悔」這道問題，我久不久就會問他一遍，生怕他的答案會隨時間改變。不過，他的說法始終如一。至於是否值得，他反問：「我自己覺得值得唔夠咩？點解要理人點睇？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在初選案裁決前，過去幾年所有涉及《國安法》的案件，定罪率是100%。再加上認罪可扣減三份一刑期的前提下，選擇不認罪、拒絕否定過去的自己，是否有點「傻」？喜歡辯論的吳政亨，首先反問「傻」的定義：「首先我假設『傻』係『理智』嘅相反啦。但我發覺，太多人講嘅所謂『理智』，其實同『自私』差别唔大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「對我嚟講，『傻』只係代表『唔計到盡』同埋『唔自私』。係呢個定義之下，我認我係『傻』，我亦為自己嘅『傻』而覺得光榮。某程度上，我亦希望呢個世界多啲呢種『傻』人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身處獄中的人總是在猜想未來。誰能夠保釋？誰最早出獄？最長的刑期有多長？⋯⋯至2024年11月19日，歷時近四年的初選案終有判刑結果。法官以7年半為量刑起點，以誤解法律為由減刑3個月，判處吳政亨監禁7年3個月。若扣減還柙日子，吳料會在2028年出獄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他日離開狹窄的囚室，他希望見到一個怎樣的香港？吳政亨的答法很「李伯盧」。他保持著一種對未來開放的「liberal」想法，並盼大家不要過份悲觀：「好多人傾向假定現況會不斷永續，老士啲講句，變幻才是永恆。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今早判刑，被定罪的45人刑期由50個月至120個月不等。一眾被告家屬及親友難掩悲痛，其中「長毛」梁國雄判囚81個月，其太太、社民連主席陳寶瑩在近11時在警方護送下離開法庭，她表示「呢個係冤獄，一日都唔應該坐」，並一度哽咽，又認為只要所做的事是合情合法合理，都不應被恐懼嚇怕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳寶瑩在法庭外被警方包圍下高呼：「想講都冇得講，呢個係冤獄嚟！」她之後在較空曠地方向記者表示，對判刑早有準備，沒有驚喜及驚嚇，但認為「呢個係冤獄，一日都唔應該坐」，強調他們的做法是合情合理，反問何罪之有。她之後一度哽咽，被問及會否上訴，她表示要與律師商量。對於判刑如何影響日後爭取民主，陳寶瑩就指大家都明白現時表達不同意見都要預備付出代價，但相信只要所做的事是合情合法合理，都不應被恐懼嚇怕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪的劉頴匡被判囚4年5個月，其女友黃于喬Emilia向記者表示，刑期符合預期之內，因此心情平靜，沒有特別失落或驚訝。兩人曾經預計過更嚴重的刑期。黃表示，劉終於獲得刑期的答案，不用再感焦慮，認為他會感到「relieved（解脫）」：「而家判咗佢個心會定少少。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於會否上訴，黃表示要待探訪時與劉商討。黃亦表示，「2021年至到而家好似上演咗一場大戲」，她認為現時「只係戲嘅中段，終點而家睇唔到，有生之年可能都睇唔到」，但她會繼續盡力支援劉，亦會好好生活等待對方出獄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民間人權陣線召集人陳皓桓在判刑後表示，無論判刑是4年抑或10年，對曾參與初選投票和2019年反修例運動的人而言，都是一種打壓，因為所有被告均在行使《基本法》賦予的權利，法庭早前裁定有罪，所有人「唯有接受呢件事」。他又表示律政司以往一直認為這類案件判刑「唔夠多」，他希望律政司不上訴，盡快讓事件解決，亦令關押已久的被告「盡快出返嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機未回應記者提問，僅在登車離開前與陳皓桓相擁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她今早入庭時曾舉起寫有「神同在，God is with you」的紙牌，警員隨即要求她收起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂智恆養母Elsa昨日在進入法庭後，曾舉起寫有「神同在，God is with you」的紙牌，警員隨即要求她收起。在宣布判刑後，Elsa再次在法院正門舉起寫上「義人得生 惡人必亡」的紙牌，多名警員即上前收起紙牌，並帶他登上警車。期間她緊捉車門激動哭喊：「佢係好人嚟㗎！點解要坐監呀！全部都係好人嚟㗎！」警員見狀即大聲要求她停止，並強行關上車門。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方表示，昨日（19日）在長沙灣通州街一法院執勤期間，一名女子在通州街公眾地方手持一塊標語招貼，擾亂公眾秩序。經初步調查後，該名60歲本地女子涉嫌「在公眾地方行為不檢」被捕，案件交由深水埗警區重案組第一隊跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方又強調，市民表達訴求時，必須遵守法律，並在符合國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序，以及不會損害他人的權利和自由的前提下，和平有序地表達意見。如有任何違法行為，警方必會果斷執法，以維持公共秩序及保障公共安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案中，45名罪成的被告昨日（19日）判刑，其中前社民連立法會議員梁國雄（長毛）被判監6年9個月（81個月）。昨晚社民連專頁刊出他去信太太、現社民連主席陳寶瑩，指其厄運是「由於政治逼害的牢獄」，並未因過往的言行悔疚，爭取民主並沒有錯。長毛亦感激太太過去三年的奔波照顧，望能在自由的天地相聚相愛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;社民連專頁昨刊出長毛致太太陳寶瑩家書，信中先感激對方三年來的探訪照顧，為其事情奔波。他指望能與陳寶瑩於自由的天地相聚相愛，一同遊歷彼此嚮往的地方，感嘆若非隔著鐵窗說「我愛你」「那該多好！」遺憾未能一如以往般「無拘無束相愛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他在信中指「現在的厄運，是由於政治逼害的牢獄」，對因過往的言行而繫獄並無悔疚。梁國雄指從七十年代開始參與政治運動及社會抗爭，出於的是一種改變社會不公義不合理的願望。他重申爭取民主及實現社會主義「並沒有錯」。最後梁國雄望太太保重，各人平安。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁國雄在審訊中選擇不作供，法庭在裁定其罪成的理由中指，雖然梁未有出席任何協調會議，但有派代表出席，相信他會關注。此外，社民連曾發表爭取全面否決權的立場書，梁國雄亦有轉發帖文，指不論民主派議席是否過半，皆應否決預算案爭取政府回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;陳文敏指量刑貼近國安法三級制-料律政司上訴難度大&quot;&gt;陳文敏指量刑貼近國安法三級制 料律政司上訴難度大&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7SzWSjX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image112&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案昨日判刑，量刑孰輕孰重引起不同討論。港大法律學院前客座教授陳文敏今早在商台節目表示，即使法院不採用《國安法》量刑三級制，但仍然有做參考，法官「巧妙」將刑期貼近框架。他認為即使律政司指法庭錯用法律原則，但對量刑結果「完全無分別」，上訴會變成純技術討論。若果純粹認為刑罰「不足夠」而提出上訴，他相信難度很高，律政司必須證明判刑「嚴重不足」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;保安局局長昨日在判刑數小時後見記者，提到法庭判刑是「重判」，而整體已合適地反映罪行嚴重性。不過他同時留有「尾巴」，稱會在研究判詞後，考慮是否對個別被告的刑期提出上訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱法官量刑巧妙&quot;&gt;稱法官量刑「巧妙」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;到底上訴空間有多大？港大法律學院前客座教授陳文敏在商台《在晴朗的一天出發》表示，今次判刑焦點落在三名法官沒有套用《國安法》量刑三級制，法庭「做咗少少改動」，接納辯方陳詞指「串謀」並非國安法罪行而是普通刑法罪行，三級制不完全適用。不過他指出法庭並無完全摒棄不考慮，而是作為量刑起點的參考，只是沒有硬性跟足，量刑結果接近三級制。他形容法官的做法是「好巧妙」，「就算話佢錯，結果都係無分別」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;15年起點-即使減至7年絕對唔輕&quot;&gt;15年起點 即使減至7年「絕對唔輕」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不跟從三級制，最大分別是判刑沒有下限的框架，對於部份「首要份子」的最終刑期為7年，效果上低於框架下限的10年。陳文敏指出在這方面，法庭亦「好小心」，數名「首要份子」的刑期起點均為15年，再按個別情況扣減，例如轉做控方證人。他認為判刑結果「四平八穩」，因為「首要份子」的刑期「唔會多唔會少」，其他被告的刑期亦無一低於3年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳文敏認為律政司的上訴理據幾乎只得一個，就是提出法院錯用量刑原則，「唔應該用普通法，應該用國安法」。他表示即使成立，「有咩分別呢？結果完全無分別」，律政司的上訴或者變為純技術討論，當然律政司亦可以提出作為日後案件案例，但對47人案的判刑實際影響不大。若果律政司純粹以「刑罰不足夠」提出上訴，陳文敏認為「難度好高」，因為要證明判刑「嚴重不足」，他強調15年刑期起點即使減至7年，亦「絕對唔輕」，而認罪減刑也是過往案例容許的因素，相信上訴難度相當高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官或同情部分被告-惟對懲教署無約束力&quot;&gt;法官或同情部分被告 惟對懲教署無約束力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外法官昨日在判詞特別提出11名被告有真誠悔意，希望當局日後作酌情考慮。陳文敏認為反映法官對部分被告較多同情，不過很明顯權力不在法院，法官不能作出考慮亦不能作出干涉。他指出法官的想法對懲教署無約束力，只能做參考，更何況相關提早釋放的決定，似乎是由國安委決定的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;多國發聲明關注-外交部無端指責干涉中國內政&quot;&gt;多國發聲明關注 外交部：無端指責、干涉中國內政&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DZzt7dX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image113&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選案昨日判刑，世界各國領袖亦聚首進行G20峰會，各國對案件的取態備受關注。美國國務院凌晨發表聲明，強烈譴責事件，並形容判刑是「不公（unjust）」和「嚴苛（harsh）」，促請立即無條件釋放45名被告。國務院將會對多名官員施加簽證限制，但未有透露確實對象。英國透過副國務大臣衛倩婷發聲明批評判刑，而首相施紀賢昨日在G20峰會與習近平會見並握手，當施紀賢被記者問會否譴責判刑，他兩度拒絕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;港府昨傍晚在同一份聲明一次過反駁，指留意到近日美西方國家、反華組織、反華政客、外國媒體等就包括初選案在內的不同案件，作出惡意攻擊和抹黑。發言人又指，港府堅決嚴厲打擊危害國家安全的行為和活動，必須時刻警惕危害國家安全風險，「不能好了傷口便忘了痛，更不可容許傷口再被挖開，讓香港再受難忘的痛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cecc促撤經貿辦禮待&quot;&gt;CECC促撤經貿辦禮待&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;美國國務院在聲明表示法庭對初選案的判刑嚴苛，將會侵蝕外界對香港司法制度的信心，以及傷害香港的國際聲譽。美方會繼續監察港區國安法實施情況，並呼籲北京和港府停止利用國安法噤聲民間政見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;美國國會及行政當局中國委員會（CECC）昨日在聲明敦促拜登政府實施多項制裁，特別指出這場政治檢控發生的同時，為數不少的美國商界行政總裁正與香港官員享受美酒佳餚，被游說在港做更多投資。CECC表示，香港經貿辦一直在壓制本地和海外異見擔當角色，例如協助中國政府向美國做政府宣傳，委員會促進國會通過撤銷香港駐美經貿辦特權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;英國未指違反中英聯合聲明&quot;&gt;英國未指違反《中英聯合聲明》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於英國方面，首相施紀賢拒絕譴責判刑，英政府由負責亞太事務的英國副國務大臣 Catherine West（衛倩婷）發聲明，中國在香港施加《國安法》，侵蝕了香港人的權利和自由，而判刑清楚表明，香港當局利用《國安法》，刑事化異議聲音的行為。聲明又指，英國將始終支持香港人民，所有國家都應履行國際義務，以保護這些基本權利。聲明的字眼溫和，未有如保守黨執政期間，不時批評中方和港府行為違反《中英聯合聲明》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選案被告之一吳政亨是澳洲公民，澳洲外長黃英賢（Penny Wong）發聲明指，對澳洲公民吳政亨和案中其他成員的判決表示深切關注，並會繼續關注吳政亨的福祉，同時已向中國及香港政府表達對國安法廣泛運用，並牽涉澳洲公民表達強烈反對。澳洲政府又呼籲中國停止對表達自由、集會自由、媒體及公民社會的壓逼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;外交部無端指責干涉中國內政&quot;&gt;外交部：無端指責、干涉中國內政&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;中國外交部則在昨日例行記者會反駁，香港是法治社會，有法必依、違法必究，是基本原則，任何人都不能打著民主的旗號從事違法活動，並企圖逃脫法律制裁。發言人林劍表示，個別西方國家一面無視中國的司法程序、維護自身國家安全的事實，單方面對香港法院公正實施《國安法》無端指責。中央政府堅定支持香港特區維護國家安全，依法懲治各類危害國家安全的活動，堅決反對個別西方國家藉有關司法個案，干涉中國內政，抹黑和破壞香港法治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】「47人案」昨日（19日）判刑，美國政府今日（20日）凌晨發表聲明譴責判刑針對香港民主領袖，要求港府無條件釋放所有政治犯，並宣佈對《港區國安法》的相關官員實施新一輪的簽證限制。民建聯副主席、立法會議員周浩鼎和陳學鋒連同十餘名民建聯成員今日下午到美國領事館門外示威，譴責美國干預中國內政，又高叫口號抗議，示威持續約15分鐘，在場有警員戒備。陳學鋒表示準備了請願信，惟領事館未有代表接信，請願信最終放在領事館門前地上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民建聯一行13人今日下午到美國領事館外示威，他們展開印有「強烈譴責美國 抹黑香港法治 干涉中國內政」的橫幅，又舉起「Enough is enough！Say NO to US interference」、「司法不容外國踐踏」等標語。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 左起：陳學鋒、周浩鼎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳學鋒和周浩鼎分別以中文和英文讀出譴責聲明。陳學鋒表示，民建聯強烈譴責美方對「47人案」所發表的聲明和制裁，認為美方此舉無疑是公然干預中國內政和抹黑香港司法體系。他強調，香港法院一直以公平公正的原則審理案件，《基本法》及《香港人權法案》保障所有被告有公平接受審訊的權利，指法庭判刑時是嚴格根據證據、法律規定及原則。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於「47人案」的判刑，陳學鋒稱危害國家安全在任何國家都屬重罪，昨日的判刑是彰顯「法治公義」，向社會傳遞明確信號，警惕市民，任何試圖破壞國家安全的行為，都會受到法律的嚴懲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱香港進入新時代-冀西方勿戴有色眼鏡&quot;&gt;稱香港進入「新時代」 冀西方勿戴有色眼鏡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不少西方國家在《港區國安法》實施後，因認為國安法損害香港民主、法治和自治，對香港進行制裁。陳學鋒反駁有關說法，並以「西方一些反華勢力不停詆毀香港的司法制度」形容相關情況，又反指包括美國在內的部份西方國家對於國安案件的審判標準更為嚴格。他認為西方國家經常「無端指責」港區國安法，並再三強調任何國家以政治力量干預香港司法程序都是破壞法治的行為，應該予以譴責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;發言末段，陳學鋒讚揚香港在國安法和23條立法後形成了「雙法雙機制」，香港亦進入了「良政善治」的「新時代」。他冀西方國家不要以「有色眼鏡」看待香港事務，呼籲以公平公正態度與香港合作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) represent a key focus of ongoing U.S. government efforts to “choke off” China’s access to leading-edge semiconductors. The United States, along with allies such as the Netherlands and Japan, is a global leader in production and R&amp;amp;D for chipmaking tools. By imposing uniquely broad and unilateral controls on U.S. toolmakers’ access to the Chinese market, however, the U.S. government has turbocharged Chinese efforts to wean off all U.S. SME due to growing concerns about the reliability and trustworthiness of U.S. companies. In this way, expanding U.S. trade restrictions are facilitating the “design-out” of U.S. toolmakers in Chinese semiconductor supply chains in favor of domestic and third-country (i.e., non-U.S. and non-Chinese) companies. This growing trend in China’s market, the world’s largest for semiconductor manufacturing, threatens the long-term leadership of the United States in SME by diverting revenue (and R&amp;amp;D investment) away from U.S. industry. As a result, current U.S. export controls risk jeopardizing the economic and national security of the United States by hindering U.S. companies’ market share and accelerating China’s relative technological gains. This report, the second in a series on U.S. semiconductor export controls, outlines the importance of SME to chip markets, key types of tools being designed-out, and the rapid growth of Chinese toolmakers. It also evaluates how toolmakers based in third countries have leveraged U.S. unilateral controls to win new business with Chinese customers. The report argues that the United States should limit further unilateral controls on SME sales and consider new incentives for allies to create multilateral export regimes, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts of current controls on U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With geopolitical competition intensifying, U.S. economic security policy has undergone significant changes. Primarily, the United States has expanded economic security measures to take new defensive actions around critical and emerging technologies (CETs). Such efforts center on denying China access to key foundational technologies — particularly advanced semiconductors that support dual-use applications such as artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administrations of Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden have expanded economic security measures regarding China’s access to CETs. Export controls are an increasingly common tool in U.S. economic security efforts, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has called them a “new strategic asset in the U.S. and allied toolkit.” Under the Biden administration, the federal government has implemented two major rounds of semiconductor export controls, one in October 2022 and a second in October 2023. Additional controls may be forthcoming as the United States aims to use trade restrictions to deny China access to leading-edge semiconductors, thus limiting China’s ability to develop military and dual-use technologies such as advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of such a strategy to economic and national security are obvious. They include maintaining technological superiority for modern military capabilities and intelligence gathering. Washington sees clear, legitimate risks associated with the proliferation of highly advanced semiconductors among its adversaries. A sensible U.S. export control policy focused on preserving technological superiority is a measured response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls, however, are a double-edged sword. When a nation decides to implement controls, it effectively restricts its companies’ market share. If controls negatively affect a nation’s technological champions, policymakers may inadvertently compromise their country’s status as a long-term technology leader. The loss in sales decreases these tech champions’ revenue and, in some cases, redirects it to foreign competitors, potentially reducing future investments in innovation for key U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Washington sees clear, legitimate risks associated with the proliferation of highly advanced semiconductors among its adversaries. A sensible U.S. export control policy focused on preserving technological superiority is a measured response.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the relative costs imposed on China’s technological progression and the corresponding benefits to U.S. national security outweigh the costs to U.S. industry and innovation, then Washington may well view these impacts as a necessary price. However, China’s semiconductor ecosystem — through its own strategies and through government support — has managed to undermine the effectiveness of many of the controls meant to keep Chinese firms behind their Western counterparts. For one, Chinese companies have found ways to access U.S. technology by circumventing controls. These efforts have been widely written about and include using overseas shell companies to purchase controlled products, as well as leveraging domestic technology trading networks to redirect technology via firms that are exempt from controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond circumvention efforts, U.S. export controls have helped facilitate a farther-reaching unintended consequence: China has set its domestic semiconductor ecosystem on a path toward removing U.S. technology altogether. Chinese government and commercial actors have deployed two key long-term strategies to create ex-U.S. supply chains for semiconductor technologies across the value chain. These strategies, which represent the focus of this series of papers by the CSIS Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business, include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design-out: supplanting existing U.S. and allied semiconductor technologies with comparable technologies, from either&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. Chinese firms; or&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;b. third-country (non-U.S. and non-Chinese) firms&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design-around: developing new technologies that do away with an entire category of controlled technology in the semiconductor supply chain&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-out-and-design-around&quot;&gt;Design-Out and Design-Around&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business’s introductory report in this series, which covers advanced packaging, China is rapidly accelerating the design-out of U.S. technologies from semiconductor supply chains in response to existing — and in anticipation of future — U.S. export controls. It has pursued this goal, in part, by increasingly adopting domestic firms’ technologies. China’s semiconductor industry has rapidly pivoted toward made-in-China technology over the last few years, facilitated by expanded government investment and other incentives, as well as preferential procurement practices by Chinese semiconductor companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also evidence of increased Chinese adoption of third-country suppliers within semiconductor supply chains. For instance, competitors from Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Israel, and South Korea have increasingly leveraged China’s chip market as a growth engine, winning new Chinese customers and increasing existing customers’ wallet share as the impacts of U.S. export controls constrain the competitiveness of U.S. companies. This third-country design-out threat potentially shifts semiconductor industry leadership toward foreign competitors, some of whom offer China the very technologies U.S. companies are barred from selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China is looking to design around U.S. export controls — in other words, innovate to achieve advanced semiconductor capabilities using approaches not modeled on U.S. technologies. Importantly, this trend means China is beginning to innovate rather than copy foreign technology in the chip industry. As discussed in the packaging report, a shift away from a “fast-follower” approach toward a more innovative approach would represent a key change in U.S.-China technological competition — one that potentially threatens long-term U.S. innovation leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be one thing if China’s design-out and design-around strategies affected only leading-edge semiconductor technologies, which are the primary targets of U.S. export controls. However, China’s pivot away from U.S. technology has affected not only the leading edge but also foundational, or “trailing-edge,” semiconductor technologies. Chinese and third-country firms want to avoid dealing with the high regulatory and financial burdens of U.S. export controls, which are complex, stricter than other nations’ in coverage and enforcement, and fast evolving. As a result, Chinese and foreign companies selling to the Chinese market are newly incentivized to avoid using U.S. technology where possible. Additionally, the ambiguity of the controls means that firms may opt to overcomply with export regulations and avoid selling or purchasing U.S. technologies — even if the products technically fall outside of the controls — for fear of dealing with costly litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, for its part, looks to press forward with stricter controls. This threat of stricter controls, in turn, encourages China to design out and design around other U.S. technologies to hedge against future regulations. In this way, tightening unilateral U.S. export controls is having a ripple effect across the Chinese — and global — semiconductor ecosystem, threatening to undermine U.S. leadership and leverage in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on China’s design-out and design-around strategies related to semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) — the machines critical to making chips. China’s access to such equipment has become increasingly important to its national semiconductor ambitions as expanding U.S. and allied export controls limit Chinese access to leading global chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Samsung, and Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SME is a strong example of the design-out issue. Chinese companies are increasingly replacing U.S. producers one-to-one in Chinese semiconductor manufacturing facilities, or fabs. As procurement practices in Chinese fabs shift toward an anywhere-but-the-United-States approach, SME sales are also shifting toward third-country toolmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SME is a strong example of the design-out issue. Chinese companies are increasingly replacing U.S. producers one-to-one in Chinese semiconductor manufacturing facilities, or fabs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States would benefit economically and strategically from continuing to sell some SME technology to China. These benefits do not apply to technologies that are highly specific to advanced dual-use technology and cannot be acquired elsewhere or rapidly developed domestically. For example, ASML’s sales of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography provide a choke point for Chinese technological advancement into fabrication processes like 3 nanometers (nm) and is a prime example of the power of export controls. But for less niche and non-sole-sourced tools, unilateral and broad export controls risk U.S. technology champions losing out on revenue while China maintains its access to the same technology, either via industry indigenization efforts or shifting purchases to third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper explores why SME is important to semiconductor technological innovation, what types of U.S. SME are facing design-out and design-around risks, and what implications those risks carry for U.S. economic and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-is-semiconductor-manufacturing-equipment-important&quot;&gt;Why Is Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment Important?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making semiconductors is impossible without a wide array of specialized, highly advanced machinery. Each manufacturing plant, or fab, contains an average of 1,200 multi-million-dollar tools — all of which are critical to chip production. This group of tools transforms a thin piece of crystalline silicon or other semiconducting material into a fabricated wafer containing billions — if not trillions — of nanometric transistors precisely etched onto a tiny surface area (often just 300 millimeters). Capital expenditures (CapEx) on SME constitute an estimated 75 percent of total CapEx on fab construction, and some tools reach the size of a double-decker bus, costing upward of $150 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor fabrication, both for leading-edge process nodes and mature chip technologies, is one of the most complex manufacturing processes on the planet — in large part due to the machinery required. For instance, ASML’s EUV lithography devices have been called “the most complicated machine humans have built.” As a result, advancements in SME technology have historically represented a key driver of semiconductor industry innovation. High-quality SME is also critical to the economics of scaled production, as any imprecision in a finished chip’s structure or composition can affect performance and reduce a fab’s production yield. All this means that a fab’s access to tools is a leading determinant of how competitive its technology is on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SME is often divided into front-end equipment used in wafer fabrication and processing, such as lithography, etch, deposition, and cleaning, and back-end equipment used for assembly, packaging, dicing, bonding, and testing. Because the advanced packaging brief covers assembly and packaging equipment, this brief focuses on fabrication and test equipment in evaluating design-out and design-around risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four types of SME across front-end and back-end equipment are under significant threat of design-out: (1) deposition, (2) etching, (3) process control, and (4) testing. While discussions of the semiconductor supply chain often group testing with assembly and packaging, the authors include testing within SME here for two reasons: First, testing plays a key role in front-end wafer fabrication (as well as in back-end processes like assembly and packaging), as it takes place continually throughout the production life cycle. Second, the design-out and design-around dynamics of testing equipment are more like those of chipmaking tools rather than those of assembly or packaging technologies. As in the areas of etching, deposition, and process control, the United States is home to leading competitors in testing equipment, which are facing design-out risks from foreign manufacturers. For these reasons, testing is included as part of SME in this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section introduces each category of SME as well as the key U.S. and global players associated with it. The primary takeaway is that U.S. manufacturers, alongside competitors primarily from U.S.-allied countries such as Japan and the Netherlands, have historically held leading shares of global equipment markets — particularly for chipmaking technologies at the leading edge. This leadership underscores the high stakes of any shift in global market share because of U.S. export controls. U.S. companies have much revenue and technological leadership to lose to new Chinese companies — as well as Dutch, Japanese, Israeli, German, and other foreign firms, many of which are well positioned in equipment markets to grab a share of the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deposition&quot;&gt;Deposition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deposition process involves specialized tools depositing thin films of conducting, isolating, or semiconducting materials on the wafer. Deposition takes place throughout the fabrication stage and often occurs in multiple sequential iterations along with processes such as photolithography and etching. It plays a key role in enabling miniaturization in semiconductors, as it can create protective barriers to prevent atomic-level interference. Deposition can also help strengthen or weaken an electric field and connect transistors with other devices and power sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various types of deposition used in wafer fabrication. U.S. companies such as Lam, Applied Materials, Plasma-Therm, and Veeco are key players across most types of deposition tools. The two areas discussed in depth here are epitaxy and atomic layer deposition, given their potential for design-out by Chinese supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epitaxy — also known as “epi” — involves depositing a near-perfect crystalline layer directly on top of the wafer substrate. Epitaxy growth typically occurs during the beginning of the wafer fabrication process, following wafer polishing and preceding the sequences of lithography, etching, and other deposition processes. Adding an epitaxial layer helps fabs better control doping wafers with impurities and can introduce a different material than that used in wafer “bulk” materials. As a result, epitaxy facilitates more effective electron transmission, a key goal in advanced chipmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epitaxy innovation plays an important role in the ongoing evolution of both chip fabrication and advanced packaging. Epitaxy is important to nonclassical wafer substrates (i.e., nonsilicon) such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), and silicon carbide (SiC), which play a key role in critical technologies such as aerospace and defense applications and electric vehicles. An emerging technology within the field of epitaxy is remote epitaxy. Remote epitaxy is the growth of a thin epitaxial layer that is aligned — but not in contact — with the substrate. This technique has a plethora of applications in advanced packaging, particularly three-dimensional (3D) packaging designs, in which multiple chips are stacked to enhance bandwidth while reducing power consumption and footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The epitaxy equipment market includes tools used for metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, high-temperature chemical vapor deposition, and molecular beam epitaxy. Leading suppliers are based in Germany, the United States, and Japan — as well as China. Key companies in terms of 2020 market share include Germany’s Aixtron, the United States’ Veeco, China’s Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc., China (AMEC), and Japan’s Tokyo Electron (TEL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an advanced type of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) that adds layers consisting of a single atom of thickness onto a wafer. It is key to leading-edge chip designs due to the importance of controlling layer thickness and composition in fabricating advanced chips, whose features are small enough that the industry is running up against the physical limits of miniaturization. There are two key types of ALD: thermal ALD and plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD). Whereas the former relies solely on chemical precursors to deposit the atomic layer, PEALD uses plasma to provide reaction energy for the process, enabling greater control over film characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netherlands-based ASM is the leader in ALD, particularly PEALD, holding above 50 percent of the market, according to investor materials. Additional key suppliers include Japan’s Kokusai, TEL, and Optorun, as well as the United States’ Lam Research. As of 2020, China’s Naura had a “negligible” share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;etching&quot;&gt;Etching&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The etching process involves carving a precise pattern onto the wafer by selectively removing layers of material using either liquid or gas chemicals. Etching takes the pattern created during photolithography — during which a light selectively removes parts of a photoresist coating based on a photomask design — and applies this pattern permanently to the material layer below. Etching occurs multiple times in fabrication and creates a complex pattern of cavities where the thin film layer has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of etching tools: dry and wet. Dry etching tools use gases to engrave the wafer and are necessary to create the circuitry on leading-edge chips. Atomic layer etching tools are particularly important for advanced process node production due to their greater control and precision. Wet etching, which uses liquid chemicals to engrave the wafer, is less common than dry etching for advanced process nodes due to the challenges of creating complex structures. However, it is cheaper and less risky, making it commonly used to clean wafers. Because etching also plays a key role in mature chip technologies, both dry and wet etching tools are critical to semiconductor manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Japan are the world’s leading suppliers of etching equipment, followed by China and South Korea. Lam Research, Applied Materials, and KLA all have strong shares in global dry and wet etching markets. Japan’s TEL, Hitachi, and Screen are other notable players. South Korea-based SEMES represents a growing wet etching player. Finally, in China, AMEC, Naura, and Kingsemi are notable small providers of etching tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;process-control&quot;&gt;Process Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process control refers to using monitoring tools in semiconductor manufacturing to ensure quality control. It takes place concurrently with other stages of fabrication and involves metrics like the purity of wafer materials, transistor dimensions, and chip conductivity. As chip dimensions get smaller, variations at the molecular level represent a larger share of an integrated circuit’s dimensions, making process control increasingly important in fabrication. Ongoing industry shifts, like the switch from single patterning to multiple patterning and from planar to 3D transistors, mean that variations increasingly come from the material quality or the deposition process, calling for more advanced control tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process control is important to both advanced and mature node production, as it has a key impact on yield. Wafer production yield, or the percentage of individual chips (dies) per wafer that make it through the final probe testing stage, is a critical metric for fabs due to their high per-unit operating costs. Process control technology helps enable a higher yield, thus improving profitability by minimizing wasted output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key types of semiconductor process control technologies include photomask inspection and repair tools, process monitoring equipment, wafer inspection equipment, and wafer-level inspection packaging tools. U.S. companies hold strong market share across all key types of tools. Notable U.S. players include Applied Materials, KLA, Keithley Instruments, Keysight Technologies, Onto Innovation, Nanotronics, and Thermo Fisher. Japan and Germany are home to most leading competitors, such as Lasertec, Rigaku, and Screen in Japan and Zeiss and Bruker in Germany. Chinese players are smaller and include Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), Jingce, and Raintree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While various players compete across the entire process control ecosystem, individual markets are often highly concentrated among a few players. For instance, the market for wafer-level packaging inspection tools is dominated by one U.S. and one Israeli firm. As a result, the impact of export controls on a single company’s positioning can have a significant effect on global market shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;testing&quot;&gt;Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor testing occurs at multiple stages during fabrication and packaging, helping ensure defective chips do not make it into final packages. Chips go through up to six stages of testing: (1) wafer acceptance, (2) wafer sort, (3) wafer-level burn-in, (4) package test, (5) burn-in test, and (6) testing at the system level. Testing equipment has taken on increased importance and industry value as the cost of testing devices and the potential losses associated with manufacturing defective dice have risen in response to advances in chip design and applications such as advanced graphics processing units, which are commonly used to train AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key types of semiconductor testing tools include burn-in test equipment, handlers and probes, linear and discrete testing tools, and system-on-a-chip testing equipment. Japanese and U.S. firms hold leading market shares in different parts of the industry. Notable Japanese companies include Advantest, Tesec, and Accretech. U.S. players include Teradyne, National Instruments, and Cohu. South Korean firms such as UniTest and DI Corporation are also key participants. Chinese capabilities have historically been more limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-ear-impacts-us-and-foreign-toolmakers&quot;&gt;How the EAR Impacts U.S. and Foreign Toolmakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commerce Department’s October 7, 2022, rules, implemented under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), require licensing of U.S. equipment and persons involved in certain types of chip manufacturing. Affected technologies include equipment used in the production of “logic chips with non-planar transistor architectures . . . of 16nm or 14nm, or below; DRAM memory chips of 18nm half-pitch or less; [and] NAND flash memory chips with 128 layers or more.” The regulation’s October 2023 updates tighten controls to include some older technologies, such as immersion deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Products newly subject to the EAR include both items in the United States and “all U.S. origin items wherever located.” This inclusion means that U.S.-based multinational companies producing SME (not to mention other semiconductor technologies) cannot avoid the controls when selling to China, even when relying on factories abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies based outside the United States, determining whether the EAR applies is more complex. Foreign-made items may be subject to the EAR in two ways: (1) falling under a U.S. foreign direct product rule (FDPR) or (2) exceeding the de minimis threshold of “controlled” U.S.-origin content. Ostensibly, both rules apply the U.S. controls extraterritorially, leveraging the frequent presence of U.S. technology in third-country products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-direct-product-rules&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Foreign Direct Product Rules&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FDPRs apply the EAR to foreign-made items if they are the “direct product” of certain types of U.S.-origin equipment, software, or other technology, and are destined for designated countries. Specifically, FDPRs empower the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to require licenses for exports of certain foreign-made products if listed U.S. technology was directly used to produce them or produce key parts of the plants that were used to manufacture the products, such as a tool or a piece of software — even if a controlled U.S. component or system does not appear in the product.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Three FDPRs limit Chinese access to semiconductor technologies: the Entity List (EL), Advanced Computing, and Supercomputer FDPRs. These FDPRs differ in terms of the products, companies, and countries that they cover. The EL FDPR, introduced in May 2020 by the Trump administration, applies U.S. export controls to products destined for hundreds of Chinese (and other foreign) companies and their subsidiaries. These restrictions vary based on the products involved as well as the type of EL classification applicable to the purchaser company. Their reach has continued to grow as the U.S. Department of Commerce has added Chinese firms to the EL. The Advanced Computing FDPR applies the EAR to a narrower range of products meeting certain performance parameters and based on the destination country rather than the destination company. Originally aimed at China, the Advanced Computing FDPR has expanded the list of destination countries to include the countries China likely uses to avoid controls, such as Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Finally, the Supercomputer FDPR applies a country and end-use scope to encompass any items subject to the EAR that are used to produce supercomputers, which are defined based on compute capacity and system dimensions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDPRs and de minimis rules aim to limit the ability of third-country suppliers (who face less strict export controls from their governments) to replace U.S. suppliers in Chinese markets. However, their current efficacy in this regard is questionable. Multiple U.S. SME companies told CSIS that these restrictions are not stopping foreign toolmakers from replacing them in Chinese fabs, a complaint that has also been raised to U.S. officials. While public evidence supporting this trend remains limited, a New York Federal Reserve study from April 2024 on the impacts of U.S. semiconductor export controls showed that non-U.S. firms that sell to Chinese semiconductor companies experienced “higher revenues and profitability . . . following the inclusion of the Chinese targets in the U.S. export control lists.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;de-minimis-rules&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;De Minimis Rules&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;De minimis rules apply the EAR based on the inclusion of U.S.-origin controlled inputs in foreign-exported goods destined for specific countries. Notably, unlike the FDPRs, use of de minimis rules requires that the exported goods directly contain products produced in the United States that fall under the EAR. This differs from the FDPR’s broader threshold of goods being the “direct product” of certain U.S.-origin technologies or inputs (that do not need to be included in the actual goods being shipped). In cases where the shipment of the U.S. inputs to the final country destination by themselves (i.e., when not incorporated into a final product) would require a license, a de minimis calculation is necessary for the foreign export of the product that contains the inputs. Depending on the type of product and country destination, different de minimis thresholds — or the minimum percentage of U.S.-origin controlled items as a share of “fair market value” at which the EAR applies (typically 10 or 25 percent) — are relevant to the specific good. If the good exceeds the relevant de minimis threshold, an export waiver is required, pursuant to the EAR. For some products (e.g., certain lithography tools), a zero percent de minimis threshold applies, meaning that inclusion of any U.S.-origin controlled input automatically applies the EAR.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the United States has been relatively hesitant to apply the FDPR to foreign exports of semiconductor technology due to the rule’s negative perception among U.S. allies. Allied governments and companies have sharply criticized the FDPR as an overreach of U.S. export control authority. During recent discussions in which the United States threatened to expand application of the FDPR, foreign governments reportedly said they would not cooperate with enforcement of this application, potentially threatening FDPR expansion. Although the U.S. government is reportedly preparing an expansion to the FDPR and EL that would increase restrictions on foreign exports, a Reuters report indicated that category A:5 countries — which include Japan, the Netherlands, and South Korea — would be exempt from the expanded FDPR. The exclusion of countries home to leading toolmakers like ASML and Tokyo Electron belies the U.S. government’s continued hesitation to use the FDPR on key allies in the semiconductor supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enforcement of extraterritorial applications of the EAR is also a challenge. For semiconductor controls, enforcement challenges are exacerbated by needing to know the node process for which the technology is used, in order to determine whether the extraterritorial rules apply. As an example, SME used in the production of “advanced-node integrated circuits” does not have a de minimis level in terms of U.S. content, whereas SME for less mature chipmaking does. For shipments of finished chips, the node process is self-evident, based on the exported product itself. However, for SME and other inputs, the type of process node manufactured using the product may be less transparent to suppliers. For instance, the same types of etch equipment may be used in a wide range of process nodes, a practice known in the industry as “CapEx recycling.” Therefore, suppliers could unintentionally sell some tools used for advanced nodes to Chinese customers, as these customers can lie about the process node they are using the tools for. Additionally, the burden falls on the company to determine whether the foreign-made item is subject to the EAR, further challenging enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the New York Federal Reserve study described an increase in revenues for third-country firms despite including firms ostensibly subject to the extraterritorial restrictions (via FDPR or de minimis) in its data set. The authors admitted that this had the potential to bias “estimates towards finding a decline in revenues by non-U.S. firms that sell to Chinese targets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that the United States is applying the EAR less restrictively to third-country firms than U.S. firms, even where the FDPR or de minimis restrictions are meant to apply — another indication of potential challenges facing enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when fully enforced, FDPR and de minimis requirements are potentially avoidable by removing U.S. technologies from supply chains. Industry participants reported to CSIS that the EAR is incentivizing foreign toolmakers to minimize the use of U.S. technologies, services, and personnel in supply chains to avoid restricted trade with China. For example, one individual noted that a Japanese toolmaker was removing U.S. components from its supply chains and publicizing its products as outside U.S. EAR authority — a practice the individual suggested was widespread across SME markets globally. Reports of these supply chain shifts suggest that, at least for some third-country toolmakers, reliance on U.S. technology is low enough to make avoiding the existing FDPR and de minimis thresholds possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Netherlands and Japan adopted their own export controls following U.S. diplomatic efforts. However, these restrictions remain less stringent than U.S. controls in terms of end use and servicing personnel, giving Japanese and Dutch companies greater ability to sell to Chinese customers and provide on-the-ground support. Additionally, other key supplier countries such as South Korea, Israel, and Germany have not adopted similar export controls. Under the existing set of international export controls, foreign toolmakers continue to face significantly weaker restrictions on access to the Chinese market than U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final risk of the current EAR in terms of creating unequal market access for U.S. and foreign companies is overcompliance. As one public commentator argued to BIS,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The October 7 IFR is so complex that only a small group of people with significant experience in the EAR and semiconductors can fully understand the rulemaking . . . Many small and medium enterprises, or even large foreign multinationals, not highly versed in these details will either not know if they are following the rule, or out of an abundance of caution, “over-comply” by restricting legitimate exports and trade not otherwise subject to these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the October 2023 update simplifies calculations and identifies flags to help companies determine compliance, challenges remain in terms of understanding the breadth of the restrictions, which are highly technical and continually evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the EAR’s complexity and ambiguity risk encouraging U.S. toolmakers to pull back from Chinese markets — even in places where they are not legally required to do so. For instance, the previously mentioned New York Federal Reserve study also showed that U.S. firms were more likely to terminate relations with Chinese customers following the export controls, even with those not directly targeted by the controls, and less likely to form new Chinese customer relationships — potentially due to concerns about unintentionally violating restrictions. This risk of overcompliance also makes it more likely that third-country companies will design out U.S. companies, facilities, and personnel, even in areas not covered by export controls, to ensure they avoid the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-firms-designing-out-us-firms-in-sme&quot;&gt;Chinese Firms Designing Out U.S. Firms in SME&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. economic and national security policy has become more stringent, Chinese businesses and policymakers have accelerated the semiconductor industry’s shift away from U.S. inputs. China’s SME industry historically has failed to achieve technological parity with foreign toolmakers due to factors such as the smaller size of its companies and, as a result, its reduced capacity to invest in research and development (R&amp;amp;D). Instead of buying domestic, leading Chinese chipmakers such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, and Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) have sought out the most advanced chipmaking technology available — which is often of U.S. origin. For instance, Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research all held large market shares in Chinese chip markets as of 2022. That same year, China’s SME localization rate (the share of tools produced domestically) was 21 percent. A 2021 report by Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology estimated a localization rate of just 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, strong evidence suggests that China’s procurement approach has shifted since late 2022, with the removal of U.S. technology emerging as a primary industry objective. In 2023, China’s SME localization rate nearly doubled year over year to reach 40 percent. A South China Morning Post article recently reported that the “unwritten rule” for Chinese fabs was 70 percent self-sufficiency (made in China) in SME and that firms were achieving “significant progress” for key types of chipmaking equipment, with the exceptions of lithography, ion implantation, and inspection and metrology (parts of process control).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design-out trend results from increasing top-down pressure from government officials and growing bottom-up commercial incentives for Chinese companies to minimize exposure to present — and future — U.S. regulatory actions. In the SME space, China’s semiconductor industry is pursuing design-out through two main approaches: (1) increased procurement from and investment in Chinese toolmakers and (2) replacement of U.S. SME technology with products from third-country firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An April 2024 quote in the Financial Times by a YMTC investor neatly summarizes China’s general design-out strategy for SME:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If Chinese companies have equipment that can be used, [YMTC] will use it. If not, it will see if countries other than the US can sell to it. . . . If that doesn’t work, YMTC will develop it together with the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-out-via-chinese-toolmakers&quot;&gt;Design-Out via Chinese Toolmakers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, the export controls from October 7, 2022, accelerated a joint government-industry effort to build a domestic semiconductor supply chain for chipmaking equipment. De-Americanizing Chinese semiconductor supply chains has been a Chinese objective for decades. However, Chinese firms frequently ignored this top-down policy goal and sourced large shares of chipmaking equipment from abroad, including from U.S.-based companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s April 2018 imposition of sanctions and export controls on ZTE represented a major turning point in pushing China to take steps toward reducing U.S. reliance, particularly for semiconductors. These efforts went into overdrive following the October 7 export controls, which created immediate existential challenges for the Chinese semiconductor industry’s access to key technologies. As a result, the controls catalyzed a coordinated response by both government and private sector entities. Central, provincial, and local government entities — as well as chipmaking firms such as Huawei, SMIC, YMTC, Hua Hong, and others — have rapidly expanded efforts to replace U.S. chipmaking technology with technology from Chinese suppliers. Nowhere in the industry has this shift been clearer than in SME.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top-down government efforts focus on putting pressure on domestic chipmakers to procure Chinese SME. For instance, some companies told CSIS that Chinese customers are facing mandates from government officials to buy most chipmaking equipment from an approved “white list” of domestic companies. These sourcing goals can overrule traditional business performance metrics such as yield, benefitting Chinese toolmakers even in cases where quality is lower relative to U.S. firms. China is also investing heavily in SME production and innovation, including via the $47.5 billion third phase of its so-called Big Fund and by increasing industry involvement in state-backed research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a bottom-up commercial level, Chinese fabs increasingly see advantages to using Chinese chipmaking tools wherever possible. Chinese firms have diversified supply chains away from U.S. and other foreign suppliers to mitigate risks associated with current export controls — as well as the threat of future controls. For instance, leading foundries such as YMTC are increasingly collaborating with leading Chinese toolmakers to access replacement parts and help Chinese companies quickly develop SME technology. Chinese private investors are also increasingly investing in semiconductor companies, including toolmakers, attracted by public investment and the growing preference for Chinese suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on publicly available data and interviews with industry participants, the CSIS Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business identified evidence of the design-out phenomenon taking place in at least four types of SME: (1) deposition, (2) etching, (3) process control, and (4) testing. These areas receive less attention than EUV lithography but nonetheless represent key technologies in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Notably, it is tougher to establish “choke points” using U.S. export controls for these areas than, for example, lithography tools and advanced metrology tools, meaning there are fewer obstacles to Chinese and third-country companies replacing U.S. technologies in Chinese fabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two chipmaking equipment companies in particular — Naura Technology Group and AMEC — have been the largest beneficiaries of increased investment and innovation in Chinese SME supply chains. These companies represent the best evidence of the design-out of U.S. companies via Chinese suppliers. Other key players include lithography developer SMEE, etching and glue developer Kingsemi, and test equipment provider Jingce. Chinese SME firms increasingly include smaller start-ups taking advantage of new openings in the domestic market, such as Shanghai-based Crystal Growth and Energy Equipment, which went public in early 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 summarizes key players in the Chinese SME space, their product focus areas, and historical global leaders based in the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gY3bR1A.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing revenues of Chinese toolmakers offer key evidence of the design-out phenomenon. The Chinese consultancy CINNO Research released a 2023 analysis showing that the revenues of China’s 10 largest SME companies increased by 39 percent in the first half of the year compared to the previous period in 2022. AMEC, for its part, saw a 32 percent rise in sales in 2023. Company executives identified strong demand from domestic firms as a key driver of growth. In August 2023, AMEC’s chairman and CEO announced his firm had developed a road map to replace foreign-produced tools with domestic alternatives. Naura saw its 2023 revenues increase by around 50 percent year over year. As with AMEC, reports attribute Naura’s rapid growth to China’s desire to remove U.S. inputs from the domestic semiconductor fabrication market. AMEC and Naura are no exception — a wide variety of Chinese toolmakers have seen explosive domestic sales growth in the two years since the U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also evidence of Chinese toolmakers winning market share away from U.S. companies, indicating that growing Chinese revenues are not just the result of top-line Chinese market growth. Historically, Chinese toolmakers could secure only a small share of key equipment markets, even within China. From January to August 2023, however, local manufacturers won 47 percent of all machinery equipment tenders from Chinese foundries, according to an analysis by Huatai Securities. An August 2023 article by the South China Morning Post reported that AMEC’s share of one type of etching equipment is expected to hit 60 percent “in the near future,” increasing from 24 percent in October 2022 — attributed to the fact that “once-dominant US chip equipment maker Lam Research saw its mainland sales drop sharply.” Notably, many U.S. toolmakers are still seeing increasing sales to China due to surging industry growth. However, companies told CSIS that this growth is significantly below what it would otherwise be in the absence of design-out practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the observable increases in revenue and market share, reporting suggests that the Chinese semiconductor industry is publicly showing great enthusiasm for locally produced semiconductor tools and components. In March 2024, SEMICON China, a major semiconductor industry conference held in Shanghai, saw increased participation of domestic tool manufacturers and the notable absence of rival U.S. firms. Reuters also reported that several domestic Chinese semiconductor equipment companies leaned into marketing strategies encouraging Chinese fabs to buy local at SEMICON: “More [Chinese] manufacturing facilities are willing to use materials prescribed by Chinese firms, a trend that has certainly been accelerated by U.S. sanctions.” The report mentions that while Chinese domestic firms may produce semiconductor manufacturing tools and components of slightly lesser quality, China is quickly catching up to its foreign counterparts. Furthermore, Chinese semiconductor products are sold at significantly cheaper prices than those of rival firms in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-out-via-third-country-toolmakers&quot;&gt;Design-Out via Third-Country Toolmakers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been significant reporting on Chinese tools replacing U.S. tools in the Chinese market. However, less attention has been paid thus far to the other strategy enabling China’s design-out: the increased substitution of tools from third countries — or countries other than the United States and China — in place of U.S. technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese buyers are increasingly apt to buy from domestic toolmakers, China is still a large buyer of foreign-made tools. Foreign SME helps fulfill technological capabilities not yet developed in China’s market and provides a helpful blueprint for Chinese firms developing new tools. Since early 2023, Chinese fabs have gone on a shopping spree, amassing tools from both domestic and foreign suppliers. The most recent data, as of the first quarter of 2024, suggest that Chinese buying represents an unprecedented 45 percent of revenue for major Western toolmakers, nearly double the share of revenue recorded a year prior (see Figures 1 and 2). Some of this revenue is going to U.S. toolmakers. According to fiscal year 2023 financials, China still represents the largest geographic share of sales for Applied Materials, KLA, and Lam Research. In fact, the dramatic investment boom in China’s semiconductor industry and practices like equipment stocking in case of future restrictions have helped some U.S. toolmakers grow in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is evidence that China is increasingly redirecting business away from U.S. firms to non-U.S. foreign companies as part of its design-out strategy. CSIS Scholl Chair conversations with SME industry participants revealed reports that Chinese customers are increasingly selecting third-country toolmakers — such as firms based in Japan, Israel, South Korea, Germany, the Netherlands, and Taiwan — over U.S. companies in procurement decisions. Specifically, several U.S. toolmakers told CSIS they rapidly lost share to third-country suppliers in Chinese foundries subsequent to the export regulations, which is unsurprising in the context of explicit rhetoric by Chinese companies indicating a growing preference for third-country purchases. As the previously mentioned YMTC investor noted, the second option after sourcing from China is “countries other than the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is increasingly redirecting business away from U.S. firms to non-U.S. foreign companies as part of its design-out strategy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend, in part, reflects the unique limits the EAR places on U.S. firms compared to foreign companies. As previously discussed, companies can sell chipmaking equipment that U.S. companies — whose products are by definition “U.S. origin items” — cannot. Although the United States worked trilaterally in early 2023 to convince the Netherlands and Japan to adopt new controls on advanced chipmaking technologies, these rules do not equate to U.S. controls. Dutch and Japanese restrictions are less stringent than the EL (a regulatory concept they lack a close equivalent to) and do not list China as a country of concern, creating substantial coverage gaps. Additionally, Dutch and Japanese companies can keep personnel on site in China. This servicing ability provides a source of revenue and is a comparative advantage in SME, as toolmakers typically deploy teams of servicers within customers’ fabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for technologies the EAR does not encompass, there are reports that Chinese fabs are selecting third-country suppliers over their U.S. competitors. This trend may owe, in part, to U.S. companies overcomplying for fear of unintentionally violating export controls. In the United States, companies such as Applied Materials have faced criminal investigations for alleged violations of export controls, so it is unsurprising that other firms (particularly smaller businesses) would want to avoid these risks, even at risk of overcompliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Chinese firms have started seeing U.S. suppliers as higher-risk options compared to third-country suppliers. Tightening U.S. export controls has created a perception in Chinese markets that U.S. suppliers are not a reliable long-term procurement solution. Chinese fabs are concerned both about the repercussions of violating existing controls — either knowingly or unknowingly — and mitigating exposure to stricter U.S. export controls in the future. This view encourages Chinese fabs to turn to third-country toolmakers — at least until domestic supply develops sufficiently to avoid buying foreign technology altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift has both contributed to and been accelerated by growing efforts by third-country suppliers to win business away from U.S. competitors in Chinese markets — sometimes leveraging the U.S. export restrictions as a competitive advantage. In certain cases, industry participants described instances of foreign suppliers explicitly advertising their non-U.S. inputs (an indication they were not subject to the EAR) to attract new Chinese buyers or highlighting regulatory risks as reasons to select them over their U.S. competitors. For instance, some third-country firms raised concerns about future U.S. restrictions as reasons for Chinese businesses to choose them over U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry events like SEMICON China 2024 also demonstrate the new competitiveness of third-country firms. Whereas U.S. firms were absent, other foreign sellers were not. Japanese tool firms, according to a report, kept a strong presence at SEMICON. Per the same report, Chinese demand for certain Japanese products is still strong, as Japanese companies have been rewarded with increased orders from Chinese firms, especially for noncontrolled products enabling leading-edge production. This sales increase is apparent in Japanese trade data. Japanese exports of SME and related tools to China reached $3.32 billion in the first quarter of 2024, an 82 percent year-over-year increase. There have even been reports that Japanese industry groups are arranging trips for Chinese chipmakers to explore “core opportunities in Japan’s semiconductor equipment and materials industry,” with a focus on getting around U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While CSIS has identified some preliminary evidence of third-country design-out taking place, there remains a shortage of publicly available data to estimate the extent of the phenomenon — specifically, detailed data from U.S. and third-country toolmakers on market share losses and gains in China. Some industry participants noted that U.S. and foreign companies hesitate to describe design-out trends due to concerns about investor perceptions. Even so, the trend represents the important and largely overlooked impact of increasingly broad and unilateral U.S. export controls that target China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinese-firms-designing-around-us-firms-in-sme&quot;&gt;Chinese Firms Designing Around U.S. Firms in SME&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SME has fewer examples of the design-around strategy — or innovating Chinese technologies to circumvent the need for U.S. technologies — compared to advanced packaging. This is, in large part, because the United States and allied countries have a strong lead over China in manufacturing chipmaking tools, making it harder for Chinese companies to develop innovations that sidestep or “leapfrog” U.S. capabilities in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, one Chinese SME innovation bears mentioning in the context of design-around strategies. Increasingly, China is adopting new strategies to use older lithography equipment to achieve the same capabilities as EUV lithography, which represents a key chokepoint for Chinese lead-edge chip manufacturing. EUV machines — exclusively produced by the Dutch company ASML — are considered essential to the production of advanced chips, and exports to China have been highly limited since the Dutch government imposed restrictions on EUV shipments in 2019. However, in March 2024, Huawei and its chipmaking partner SiCarrier patented a technology known as self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP), which may allow them to produce the same chips as ASML’s EUV machines in a novel way. By using older DUV lithography equipment and additional etching to increase transistor density, China reportedly has the necessary capabilities for 5nm fabrication, an advancement beyond the 7nm process that SMIC provided for the Mate 60 Pro smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts believe China still needs EUV machines in the long run to reach 3nm capabilities — the leading edge in commercial production, as of this report, as pairing DUV with technologies like SAQP may represent a technological cul-de-sac in terms of achieving transistor density beyond 5nm. As a result, China is also investing heavily in attempts to develop EUV lithography domestically via efforts by companies such as Naura and Huawei. These attempts to develop EUV represent an additional example of Chinese toolmakers designing out U.S. and allies’ technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-impacts-of-sme-controls&quot;&gt;Security Impacts of SME Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of U.S. export controls on the SME industry will shape the future of U.S.-China strategic competition in semiconductors. Chipmaking tools are not only a key driver of advanced semiconductor capabilities but also an industry area where the United States currently leads in market share and innovation. According to 2022 estimates by the Semiconductor Industry Association and Boston Consulting Group, U.S. value-added activity made up 47 percent of the global SME market, along with 26 percent for Japan, 18 percent for the European Union, 3 percent for South Korea, and only 3 percent for China. China is the largest importer of U.S. chipmaking tools in the world and is far from self-reliant. It is reasonable that the United States would seek to use its leverage in SME to ensure leadership over its leading strategic competitor in a key dual-use technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, current export controls could undermine the innovation leadership of the U.S. SME companies that created this leverage in the first place. The Trump and Biden administrations’ efforts to control advanced chip capabilities have catalyzed a transformative shift away from U.S. technology in China but have failed to stop access to many controlled technologies due to widely documented smuggling efforts such as transshipments via third countries and domestic technology trading networks. Moreover, policymakers have not reckoned with the fact that China’s domestic semiconductor ecosystem is already making large strides toward replicating technologies previously supplied by U.S. toolmakers — aside from a few technological chokepoints, most notably EUV lithography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese — and to a lesser but still important extent third-country — toolmakers are poised to be the primary beneficiaries of China’s ongoing shift away from U.S. chipmaking equipment. The primary losers of this transition therefore are U.S. toolmakers, who increasingly find themselves excluded from parts of the world’s leading SME market. Importantly, the extent of this exclusion from Chinese markets is broader than that imposed by the export controls themselves due to multifaceted, interrelated trends such as Chinese companies hedging against future U.S. regulatory actions and overall declining trust in U.S. suppliers in Chinese markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the financial impacts of export controls on U.S. toolmakers are already visible. The best available evidence of this trend is the previously mentioned April 2024 New York Federal Reserve study, which stated that export control announcements were associated with negative impacts on market capitalization and revenues for affected U.S. companies. Specifically, export controls preceded a 2.5 percent abnormal decline in stock price and an 8.6 percent decline in revenue. Negative impacts on market capitalization have also taken place following the launch of criminal investigations related to export control violations. Shares of Applied Materials fell by as much as 8.3 percent following a November 2023 report that the company faces a criminal investigation regarding tools sold to SMIC. Shares of KLA and Lam Research also fell during the probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top-line growth of the Chinese market should not obscure the potential impacts of design-out on long-term U.S. SME revenues. Some U.S. toolmakers have seen growing sales to China because overall Chinese fab spending has soared in the last two years. This short-term sales growth belies the underlying dynamic: market share is increasingly shifting toward Chinese and third-country competitors even as the market as a whole grows. This trend will likely expand as Chinese firms like Naura and AMEC broaden their toolmaking capabilities. While the Chinese SME market “pie” is getting larger, the U.S. share is shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decline in market share means the ultimate losers in the current export regime are U.S. economic and national security. SME markets are capital intensive and have fast-paced product development cycles, much like their foundry and integrated device manufacturer customers in the chip fabrication world. These features mean that market leadership historically has been concentrated among a small group of multinationals who are able to invest large sums in research and development and globalized manufacturing footprints. Lost revenues and market share can therefore have significant long-term effects on the ability of toolmakers to remain competitive in the future. When U.S. SME companies are increasingly sidelined in Chinese acquisition of chipmaking technology, these same companies lose access to R&amp;amp;D dollars to support future innovation leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diminishing share in the Chinese market for U.S. toolmakers also means the U.S. government loses data on Chinese fab investment and technological capabilities. Historically, U.S. companies selling to China have offered a source of insight into China’s semiconductor industry, particularly in terms of understanding the microelectronics capabilities available to Chinese defense and dual-use technologies. However, diverted market share to Chinese and third-country firms risks undermining this source of intelligence. The surprise release of Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro in 2023 provides just one example of how Chinese semiconductor advancements increasingly take place under the radar of U.S. intelligence. The risk of design-around innovation represents a particularly pressing concern, as increased Chinese innovation could result in novel technology advancements occurring without advanced U.S. awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imposing these export controls has clear costs for U.S. economic and national security. It is therefore worth considering ways the United States can achieve the benefits of export controls while minimizing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ongoing effort to reduce dependency on U.S. SME marks a significant change to previous Chinese industrial policy targets. Although China is still far from self-sufficient in chipmaking tools, its new trajectory represents an important step toward long-term semiconductor industry decoupling goals. Increasingly broad and unilateral export controls are creating strong political and economic incentives for Chinese fabs to design out and around U.S. firms’ technology, with important long-term implications for U.S.-China technology competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend is unlikely to reverse entirely, even if the United States relaxes export controls. China has demonstrated progress in developing SME capabilities and is likely to continue down this path. While Chinese indigenization achievements to date have focused on mature processes, future progress at the leading edge is increasingly likely for Chinese toolmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these changes, the United States can refine its export control regime to better balance national security and economic interests. A crucial step is to better understand how and where existing controls hurt U.S. companies. Conducting a survey of U.S. toolmakers through the Department of Commerce could provide valuable insights into market share shifts and competitive dynamics in global chip markets related to U.S. export controls. The survey could gather metrics like the share of Chinese tenders won by U.S. toolmakers relative to Chinese and third-country suppliers. It could also address the extent to which U.S. mature tools are being designed out, beyond the leading-edge tools that the controls target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past semiconductor industry feedback on Department of Commerce surveys has been mixed, with concerns about confidentiality and business sensitivity. Therefore, the Department of Commerce must carefully communicate any new data collection efforts to ensure transparency and highlight the benefits for U.S. companies in shaping future export policies. If the survey provides evidence that current U.S. export controls have significant adverse impacts on U.S. toolmakers, the next step would be to consider how to mitigate these impacts. The current approach, which results in U.S. companies losing market share to Chinese and third-country competitors, is unsustainable — particularly considering how Chinese circumvention efforts arguably undercut the controls’ national security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key limitation of the existing controls is the failure of the United States to implement them multilaterally. Talks of a full trilateral agreement with the Netherlands and Japan reportedly broke down over inclusion of technologies such as memory and mature logic chips in controls on chipmaking equipment. Any unilateral U.S. export control decision would fuel a growing view in Chinese markets that U.S. semiconductor companies are uniquely risky partners for Chinese companies — even relative to firms based in U.S. allies such as Japan and the Netherlands. The more the United States moves without allied support to control Chinese technology, the more it risks making its firms uncompetitive with allies’ firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must determine how to position its national security partners — not just Japan and the Netherlands but also South Korea, Germany, Israel, Taiwan, and potentially others — on more equal footing in terms of limiting trade of semiconductor manufacturing technologies with China. This strategy could involve a combination of the following three approaches:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand the application of FDPR and de minimis requirements within the U.S. controls to more effectively stop import substitution by third countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apply increased economic or geopolitical pressure on allied countries to expand their own export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reduce the bounds of U.S. export controls to bring them back in line with multilateral agreements (e.g., the Wassenaar Arrangement).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third option, by itself, seems highly unlikely. Any loosening of U.S. trade restrictions appears prohibitively challenging given bipartisan anxieties about China, particularly during an election year. The approach also could fail to stem Chinese companies’ redirection of market share to third countries, as rolling back U.S. controls may not be enough to undo the loss of trust in U.S. firms within Chinese chip markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is focused on the first two options: (1) expanding the extraterritorial reach of the U.S. EAR and (2) convincing U.S. allies to implement more closely aligned controls. Expanding the FDPR and de minimis restrictions could limit sales of third-country technologies, but doing so risks further upsetting allies and accelerating efforts to remove U.S. technology and labor from third-country supply chains. This trade-off limits the effectiveness of U.S. plans to add to FDPRs. The Biden administration is reportedly planning to expand the FDPR’s product scope and add 120 new Chinese companies to the EL, effectively widening the EL FDPR’s destination coverage. But, as previously mentioned, the rule is not expected to apply to category A:5 countries, which include the Netherlands, Japan, and South Korea, undercutting its effectiveness in limiting third-country exports of key chipmaking tools. While an expanded FDPR would affect other countries and territories involved in chip supply chains, such as Israel, Singapore, and Taiwan, the impact on SME markets would likely be limited to specific niches or stages of fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option — greater multilateralization — is more promising. However, U.S. allies still have strong incentives not to impose restrictions that are comparable with the U.S. controls, as toolmakers are significant and influential economic actors in countries like the Netherlands, Japan, and South Korea. To get around these obstacles, U.S. regulators should consider an expanded menu of carrots and sticks. The current strategy of appealing to shared national security concerns has clearly been unsuccessful. Allied governments have reportedly been unconvinced by justifications for the controls in terms of China’s People’s Liberation Army capabilities, in part because of very different perceptions among key partners (e.g., the European Union) of the extent to which China poses (or does not pose) a national security threat. Some form of mutual benefit, such as via shared intelligence or economic opportunities, might therefore be necessary to convince allies to cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what incentives are on offer, the United States likely must loosen some restrictions to achieve multilateralization. These reductions could focus on contentious areas such as memory chip production and nodes like 14nm and 16nm, which the semiconductor industry rarely considers “advanced.” A narrower approach could better ground national security arguments for multilateralization, which resonate with allies for some technologies (e.g., tools for fabricating 7nm logic chips) more than others (e.g., tools for fabricating 128-layer NAND flash memory chips).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loosening restrictions to enable greater multilateralization could be paired with efforts to improve enforcement of existing controls and stem circumvention efforts, which continue to blunt the controls’ effectiveness at slowing China’s technology development. Combining these efforts provides one way to apply continued pressure on China’s chip industry (and reduce domestic political pushback) while mitigating some of the controls’ negative economic repercussions via greater cooperation with allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States, even if it does not pursue a loosening of the existing controls, could return to a strategic mindset of the “sliding scale” approach in designing future export control policy. This shift could help signal to the Chinese market that the United States is not pursuing full-scale decoupling of its technology ecosystem from China’s and that it remains interested in doing business in technologies outside of the leading edge. This shift may be even more useful in convincing U.S. allies that U.S. companies will not be further restricted unilaterally and unpredictably from access to China’s markets, helping secure their role as trusted and reliable participants in globalized technology supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although U.S. toolmakers are key players in today’s semiconductor markets, U.S. leadership did not develop in a vacuum and is not guaranteed indefinitely. China remains a critical and growing market for semiconductor fabrication, so export restrictions may have far-reaching adverse impacts on U.S. SME companies. If there is one recurring theme in writing policy related to semiconductors, it is that details matter. The U.S. government must take care to design future semiconductor export controls in ways deeply attuned to the nuances of semiconductor competitive dynamics, where one small change often has powerful ripple effects across global supply chains. Export controls must not jeopardize the complex web of factors underlying U.S. market leadership in semiconductors. Otherwise, the controls risk undermining the advantages the United States has in its important technology competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，自2021年3月首度提堂，今年5月裁定45人罪成，將於明日（19日）迎來判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這宗《國安法》實施後最大規模的案件，涵蓋一眾政治光譜和世代各異的議員、律師、社運人士、政治素人，當中32人還柙至今超過3年8個月。有辯方大狀在庭上力陳，案中被告是法官「永遠不會在被告欄見到的人」，他們是社會的領袖，懷着良好意願參選，非為私利，只是《國安法》後突然變成非法，原本爭取權力監察政權，一夜之間變成了顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;過去3年8個月，有人在獄中喪親，亦有人結婚、生子，望能盡快與家人團聚。公民黨、職工盟等已解散，多人表明不再從政，不少被告亦失去專業資格，在獄中進修，盼以另一種方式，繼續服務社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;面對最高終身監禁的刑罰，有人選擇不求情，有人則反思過去，為昔日言行道歉。有人堅持不為信念道歉，表明無悔、毋怨，及對香港的抱負、民主的期許：「即使今日我為爭取民主而身陷囹圄，但我仍然相信，這個『為人民服務的民選政府』終有一天必將降臨香港」；「我堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權」；「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝」；「只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負」；「或許我唯一犯下的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各人尚餘多久重獲自由還未知曉，在案件判刑之際，《獨媒》為讀者整合各人求情、陳情的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;45名罪成被告量刑立場&quot;&gt;45名罪成被告量刑立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l9ckHNI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加」可判監3至10年；「其他參加」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;到底各被告被歸類為哪個級別，是今次判刑焦點，不過有辯方質疑分級制根本不適用。代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明、代表袁嘉蔚和馮達浚的資深大律師祁志等，均爭議被告被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，是以串謀罪、而非《國安法》罪行定罪，刑期分級制不適用，有待法官裁定。有辯方另爭議，法庭量刑時，不應考慮被告《國安法》前的言行，不過法官已表明拒絕接納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，有辯方大狀指本案不涉武力手段、亦不涉推翻中國根本制度等，是顛覆罪行中最輕微，不應視為「罪行重大」；又指法庭不應採納過高的量刑起點，否則便沒有空間處理其他更嚴重的罪行，例如造成人命傷亡、企圖綁架議員等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於減刑因素，包括及時認罪可獲三分一扣減（不過呂世瑜案確立認罪扣減不得超過刑期下限，有被告或未能獲全數扣減），另4名從犯證人區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、林景楠亦指其證供對控方有幫助，可獲更多扣減，甚至可按《國安法》第33條揭發他人犯罪、自動放棄犯罪等而降低刑罰等級。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，多名辯方律師求情時均提到，涉案謀劃存有不確定性、甚至不可能實現，法庭不應基於假設性後果判刑；而被告在案發後逾半年始被捕，更可見謀劃無對國安造成危害。有辯方亦強調，計劃公開進行，各人當時真誠誤信謀劃為合法，基於對法律無知才犯案。另有部分被告曾涉其他集結案、甚至暴動案服刑，辯方望法官考慮整體量刑而減刑，避免壓毀性刑罰；多人亦望法庭考慮他們對社會的貢獻，但法官明言，部分已於以往案件考慮，不能循環再用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;我們的孩子我們的大人&quot;&gt;「我們的孩子，我們的大人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當被告欄內坐滿律師、議員、社工、大學教師，不少辯方律師在陳詞時，均力陳本案被告並非一般罪犯。代表袁嘉蔚和馮達浚的資深大律師祁志，指本案不少被告出身中產或勞工階層，努力令自己變得更好，他們是「我們的同事，我們的孩子，我們的大人，我們的人民，並非一般罪犯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FtQL3bN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;
▲ 袁嘉蔚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又說，本案是這個司法管轄區從未聽聞，案中被告是法官「永遠不會在被告欄見到的人」，他們被指以非法手段求變，實是望透過選票進入議會，「這些人告訴法庭他們是出於良好動機而犯案，這是其他判刑所不會聽到」。他又說，當搶劫犯運用暴力手段偷竊，販毒者從他人痛苦賺取利益，危駕者為他人帶來巨大傷害，但法庭從逾百日的審訊和聆訊，會得知本案被告均是民主社會、或相對民主社會的領袖，他們真誠相信多元主義，望以和平手段服務社會，是有學識、表達和思考能力高的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又說，馮達浚成長於有多元辯論和選舉文化的香港，當時提出反對不僅合法，也是人們生活和政治的基石，通識教育亦是教育制度重要一環，年輕人被訓練問問題，也被鼓勵思考和辯論，但《國安法》後，這樣的情況結束，「爭取權力監察政權，一夜之間變成了顛覆」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jHz3iDM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image26&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成和呂智恆的大律師陳世傑也說，本案被告是好人，只是不幸在錯誤的地點和時間出現，他們來自不同界別，包括醫生、律師、社工等等，懷着良好意願參選、非為私利，但《國安法》後突然全變成非法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ki5tIRT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image27&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續說，各人並非真正意義上的罪犯，望法庭能法外開恩，「在這宗案，寬容是有必要的」；又指接受違反《國安法》須判處阻嚇性刑罰，但本案阻嚇性效果已是眾所周知，眾被告心靈受創，「我們現在需要的，是法庭判處『療癒式刑罰』」，令被告和社會可從創傷中復原。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;被指組織者5人&quot;&gt;被指組織者（5人）&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷倡以3年為起點&quot;&gt;戴耀廷倡以3年為起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;回到被告自身，各人候審或還柙逾3年半，各選擇不同方式面對判刑。有人表示深切反省，為昔日行為道歉；有人指其證供對法庭有用，求減刑更多；有人重述參選初衷，表示不知違法。除此以外，有人表明無悔、無怨；亦有人選擇不求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;45名罪成被告中，5名被指為組織者。控方曾表明，「35+計劃」組織者不屬「首要分子」是有違常理。不過代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明認為，戴是「其他參加者」，法庭應採納3年為量刑起點，考慮及時認罪等扣減至2年。他指有人或認為建議「太有野心甚至大膽」，但考慮相關法律原則和戴的個人情況，刑期屬合適，指戴在《國安法》前的行為合法，而《國安法》生效後角色有限，涉案「非法手段」為無差別否決預算案，但戴不會參選立法會和投票，也無法控制或指示其他人這樣做，並非「首要分子」。不過法官拒絕接納戴《國安法》前行為與罪責無關、及他在《國安法》後只有很少或沒有角色，反問若戴為「其他參加者」，那誰是「首要分子」和「積極參加者」？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rhiMhYf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另呈上港大法律學院講座教授陳弘毅、港大法律學院講座首席講師張達明、蘇穎智牧師及戴耀廷本人撰寫的求情信，讚揚戴對港大和社會的貢獻，又力陳「非暴力」是他一生堅信的信念，他真誠誤信否決預算案沒有違法，甚至「誤導了自己」，而他做犯案非為個人利益，而是出於畢生對法治和民主的堅定決心，望運用憲制權力爭取普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒等3從犯證人求減刑一半&quot;&gt;區諾軒等3從犯證人求減刑一半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另3名組織者區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟，均是從犯證人，曾於庭上作供，辯方望獲得額外扣減。代表區諾軒的大律師陳慕賢指，區在《國安法》後曾嘗試與當局溝通，其後退出初選，並成功游說趙家賢退出，望法庭考慮他協助控方案情，減刑一半。法官李運騰曾問會否要求更多扣減，區諾軒在位上以雙臂做交叉手勢；法官再問辯方是否指區是「超級金手指」，辯方稱沒相關指示，區遂用力點頭，雙手抱拳。法官李運騰也一度指，辯方或說「沒有區諾軒的證供，控方基本上不會有他們的案情」，被告欄即傳來「yes」，不過區諾軒向法官和鄒家成雙手打交叉，又與鄒隔空交談，並不住搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民主動力召集人趙家賢，其代表大律師利琛，則指趙盡所能協助控方，可獲「超級金手指」的66%減刑。法官表明不同意，指要承受個人風險作供才算「超級金手指」，辯方遂改要求減刑40%至55%。辯方又指，趙於2020年5月才獲邀加入初選，7月已退出，僅負責行政和執行工作，加上為控方提供有用資訊，可採納「積極參加者」較高量刑起點，再按《國安法》第33條減刑。不過法官質疑，有證供指趙較早階段已加入初選，辯方同意。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 趙家賢、區諾軒&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於前民主動力副召集人鍾錦麟，大律師陳慕賢同要求減刑一半。法官明言，鍾的證供沒有區諾軒的那麼有用，辯方回應是因鍾的參與程度有限，鍾已盡所能協助控方，亦加強了控方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jMoCqFo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image31&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨一直堅信自由民主&quot;&gt;吳政亨：一直堅信自由民主&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於發起「三投三不投」聯署的吳政亨，大律師石書銘表示，雖然控方指他為組織者之一，但隨證供披露，可見他不僅不是組織者，甚至不是積極參加者，他是自行發起「三投三不投」，過程中除戴耀廷外無與其他被告溝通，角色僅屬輔助。辯方又指，吳從未提倡否決預算案，只關注初選及爭取35+，亦真誠相信戴稱否決預算案不違法，他無參與協調會議、沒有參選更不會投票否決，屬於「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出吳政亨的求情信，吳提到1978年在香港出生，13歲隨父母移民澳洲，「一直堅信自由民主原則」，認為社會分歧需通過文明民主方式處理，而由於「權力使人腐敗，絕對權力則使人絕對腐敗」，他相信公平公正選舉最能有效防止權力成為暴政，亦因此支持香港民主運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yzuBIaY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image32&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳續指，一直對民主陣營持續內鬥痛心，認為處理的最佳方法是初選，因此對初選「無限嚮往」。雖然他在政治世界是局外人，但他相信自己有權利甚至義務為實現這夢想盡一分力，遂發起「三投三不投」聯署。吳自言在整個初選中一直是「局外人」，故對控方指控他是組織者「感到非常驚訝」，並強調由始至終「我支持初選從來都僅是為了初選本身」，他從無要求參選人承諾否決預算案，甚至不認為可取，因害怕引起民主陣營爭議，威脅初選的實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;參與者抗爭派15人&quot;&gt;參與者——抗爭派（15人）&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其餘40名罪成的初選參與者，亦來自不同世代、不同光譜。當中15人曾出席抗爭派記者會或發抗爭派聲明，自稱為「抗爭派」。他們大多均歸類自己為「積極參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍無求情黃之鋒無寫求情信&quot;&gt;何桂藍無求情、黃之鋒無寫求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中何桂藍沒有求情陳詞，黃之鋒亦沒有親自撰寫求情信。代表黃的大律師李國威，僅呈上黃母、牧師和老師的求情信，指黃望在服刑後放下過去，改過自新。法官指那是其他人代表黃說的話，辯方同意黃無撰寫求情信，指這是其選擇，而黃希望在本案後重新開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維締造更美好香港是終生抱負&quot;&gt;梁晃維：締造更美好香港是終生抱負&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;發起「墨落無悔」聲明的梁晃維、鄒家成、張可森3人，代表梁晃維的資深大律師彭耀鴻指，梁是「積極參加者」，但「墨落無悔」於《國安法》生效前發布，只是重申已達成的共識，法庭不應考慮。法官質疑聲明其後沒有撤回，辯方回應梁並非公然違法，而是對法律無知；又指本案顛覆非常獨特，被告犯案非為個人私利，而是出於良好動機，望以合法手段令特首回應民意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，梁還柙3年進行反省，承認案發時部分言行不成熟，望就此道歉，亦明白作出違法行為須承擔責任。庭上讀出他親撰的求情信節錄，梁提及生於九七一代如「被詛咒的孩子」，每個人生新階段都會遇上香港的重大事件，如沙士、雨傘運動、反修例運動和疫情，深感命運與香港緊緊相連。梁又說，香港自2019年面對困境，許多人感到迷失，「但我從來沒有對香港或香港人失去信心」，「憑我們對這片土地的熱愛，以及前人所承傳下來的精神，我相信香港能繼續逆風而行，克服當前挑戰和未知困難。只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成縱身陷囹圄仍信民選政府終降臨香港&quot;&gt;鄒家成：縱身陷囹圄仍信民選政府終降臨香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒家成，大律師陳世傑同指他屬「積極參加者」，指他在案中非關鍵人物、可有可無，對計劃無真正幫助；他雖發起「墨落無悔」，但聲明屬多餘。鄒家成又呈上求情信，提到15歲時首次參與七一遊行，深深為人們對公義的追求及對弱勢的關懷所震撼，成為他關心社會、積極參與公民事務的契機。2014年雨傘運動，鄒不時到場支持，指運動令他相信透過公民參與，有改變社會、推動公義的能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他參政望為民發聲，實現真正民主化，由始至終「我根本無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身原來已構成危害國安」。《國安法》生效後他一度想退選，但自覺身為政治人物肩負對人民的責任而繼續，「我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去」。鄒指他初心始終不變，依然相信民主與公羲、關懷弱者，依然希望香港變得更好，亦始終深信民住的價值：「即使今日我為爭取民主而身陷囹圄，但我仍然相信，這個『為人民服務的民選政府』終有一天必將降臨香港。」鄒又說，獄中數年他努力讀書、修身修心，雖不知何時重獲自由，但盼出獄時能自豪說：「這些年我都沒有枉過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張可森以家庭為中心愛妻育兒&quot;&gt;張可森：以家庭為中心、愛妻育兒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張可森，其大律師伍頴珊指他屬「積極參加者」，他現正修讀中大文化研究博士學位，還柙期間父親離世、兒子出生，張對未能與妻子和兒子相處感到悲痛後悔。張亦親撰求情信，提及在獄中的30歲生日得以冷靜思過，如今他明白案中計劃一旦實行到底所衍生的嚴重性，並深刻反省，認為審議預算案是立法會議員的責任，關乎廣大市民生活，不應作為政治工具，亦不應藉此危害國安。張明白到當下的情況及懲處，是必須學會承擔的後果，盼能盡快完成博士學位，不負家人期盼：「當事情告一段落後，我將會以家庭作為人生中心，投入全副精神照顧高堂，並且一如我妻愛我般愛我妻，與她協力養育兒子成人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉譴責過去言行盼回家與妻共度時光&quot;&gt;岑敖暉：譴責過去言行、盼回家與妻共度時光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同提到反省和後悔的，包括參選超級區議會的岑敖暉。其求情信提到自還柙起自願進行單獨囚禁，經反思後，發現他過去參與政治背後的原因並非看起來那樣光采，他過去被憤怒充滿，有時更演變成仇恨或怨恨，驅使他作出某些政治行為、修辭和言論。岑說，妻子的愛令他慢慢意識到憤怒或仇恨，絕不能將他帶去任何美好、有建設性或充滿愛的地方，他明白以否決預算案作為政治手段，不僅嚴重破壞、干擾和阻撓人們生活及政府機關履行職能，亦會危害國安，離他當初的政治願景更遠。他譴責自己過去的言行，亦對還柙後無法再服務公眾、令他們失望，深深後悔和抱歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑指，與妻子分隔逾3年，但愛意無隨時間流逝而減退，反而日益深厚和強烈，「我現時內心每一刻最大的願望，就是回到我們一起建立的家，與她共度所有時光，這是我這個魯莽和愚蠢的人，對她無條件的愛和支持所能做的回報」。他又指，明白犯下嚴重罪行，長期監禁是無可避免，願接受其過錯帶來的所有後果，只望刑期不會剝奪他改過和向家人彌補過錯的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王百羽獄中瘦20公斤-感激家人不離不棄&quot;&gt;王百羽獄中瘦20公斤 感激家人不離不棄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同參選超區的王百羽，求情信則感激家人不離不棄，形容他們是「天下間最好的父母」、「家人是我最珍視的寶物」，又指疫情期間未能親自照料，只能獨自擔心卻無能為力，令他很大反思，「我非常渴望能早日回家、擁抱家人，好好地盡孝道，孝順父母。」辯方讀出求情信和談及其家人時，王百羽雙眼通紅，數度以手和紙巾拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師黃俊嘉又指，王來自勞動階層，是家中第一名入讀大學的成員，父母對他非常自豪。他畢業於科大計算機科學及工程學系，從事資訊科技工作，2019年當選元朗區議員，會議出席率100%，並因繁重工作壓力巨大，患有高血壓，需服藥控制，王對因本案而無法服務居民感到深深抱歉。辯方指王還柙3年，體重減了20公斤，望獲釋後繼續以其專業服務社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉頴匡如知參選入獄不會參加&quot;&gt;劉頴匡：如知參選入獄不會參加&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沒有律師代表的劉頴匡，則指他參選目的是望進入立會，為像他一樣以暴動罪被捕的示威者發聲，否決預算案對他來說並非重點、也不重要，他亦曾表明不相信35+是可能。劉庭上讀出女友黃于喬撰寫的求情信，黃指以劉的天資和才能，本能走一條「正常」的路，但他選擇從政，非為一己私利，而是出於對社會關懷、對民主化追求、望為港貢獻，不料因本案身陷囹圄，「人生最黃金時期」於獄中渡過。黃指與劉相識十年，當中3年多隔着監獄高牆，而她仍每日風雨不改探望，正因不認為他是「作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙」的罪犯，而是值得她繼續關心和付出的人。黃又指，劉過去未曾妄想顛覆國家，而無論現在或將來，他亦不再是當初天真的少年，不再妄想能投身政治改變社會、不會再沾邊任何可能被定性為危害國安的行為，只盼盡快重獲自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉亦呈上親撰的求情信，提到被教導成為一個關心和參與社會的好公民，並盡力做好自己的角色，但最後卻入獄。他指自2013投身社區服務，相信透過基層服務和倡議可令心愛的城市變得更好。劉自言認罪是因他承認知悉並同意戴耀廷提出的議程，但此議程從非他競選的重點，而他真誠相信初選不違法，如果知道參加初選會入獄，「我不會參加，而是選擇其他方式令社會變得更好」。劉最後指，他現時30歲，服刑不僅是懲罰他，亦是懲罰他所愛的人，對一直照顧自己的女友感到愧疚。他明白除政治外有很多其他方式貢獻社會，望能盡快履行作為男友和香港公民的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍健偉稱無悔長夜終盡黎明將至民主終將再次得勝&quot;&gt;伍健偉稱無悔：長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有被告表明無悔，亦為五大訴求作出辯護，不過被法官打斷指屬政治演說。沒有律師代表、自行陳詞的前天水連線元朗區議員伍健偉，&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inmediahk.net/node/社運/【初選47人案】伍健偉親自陳情確認無悔意-選擇留港兌現承諾-與港人齊上齊落&quot;&gt;提到「35+計劃」是在陽光底下進行、眾所周知的計劃&lt;/a&gt;，要達致進入立法會無差別否決財政預算案，單靠47個被告無可能完成，而是需要廣大香港市民的授權，當時61萬市民冒法律風險投票，作為代議士有責任保護市民。伍又說，「五大訴求」合情合理、無被法庭裁定違法，政府是「不為」而非「不能」，惟法官打斷指並非表達政見場合。（&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inmediahk.net/node/社運/【初選47人案】伍健偉陳情全文：長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝&quot;&gt;伍健偉求情信全文&lt;/a&gt;）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續說，暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音，案發時街頭激烈衝突已持續長時間，他不希望有人受傷、被捕，甚至犧牲生命，因此參與初選，認為有義務繼承他們信念。他被捕前無打算離開香港，願為過去所有言行負責，但他不會為與選民所共享的信念和價值道歉，不可辜負人民信任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，伍健偉是否沒有悔意？伍答「無錯」，指作為政治人物，期許自己要有承擔、竭盡所能，留守到最後一刻，「所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落」。伍指未來打算放低政治人物身分，但仍望盡力留在香港貢獻社會，並引前終審法官包致金指：「There is no reason to leave if things are good, and if things are bad, there are more reasons to stay.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍又說，港人只要抱持自救互助精神，理性思考，行公義、好憐憫、存謙卑的心，記錄過去真相，活在真實的當下，為未來做好真誠的準備，香港未來將重拾光明，香港人的理想定會實現。他最後說，絕對權力必帶來絕對腐敗，「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。」法官陳慶偉最後指，由於伍較遲認罪和沒有悔意，減刑折扣明顯會較他人少，伍表示完全明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明仍信投票改秩序無錯唯一錯誤或太愛香港&quot;&gt;余慧明：仍信投票改秩序無錯、唯一錯誤或「太愛香港」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選衞生服務界的余慧明，求情信提及一切源自2019年反修例運動，當時100萬港人和平上街反修例，聲音卻不獲聆聽，引致激烈的街頭抗爭。余指不欲再看到示威者再犧牲和被捕，加上政府未能預防新冠疫情爆發，故望參選立法會，增加議價能力，改變死局，但此舉被指控為顛覆國家政權，是其他民主國家聞所未聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續說，法庭裁決提到「五大訴求」是空中樓閣，但當中包括落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選，反問「如果政府視落實《基本法》23條是憲制責任，難道落實雙普選不是一樣嗎？」，又指「即使到現在，我仍然認為透過在立法會投票，改變既定秩序並沒有錯，或許我唯一犯下的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。」法官陳慶偉聞言亦打斷，指這並非求情信，是政治演說，着辯方不要在其法庭發表，又指看不到任何悔意。辯方一度指，本案涉及政治，如被告對所做的表達悔意，或被人質疑他們信念是否真誠，法官陳慶偉則說：那就不要求情，你不用求情，那沒有問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表余慧明的大律師石書銘亦陳詞指，余是年輕、有同情心的理想主義者，她大學時以醫療服務為志業，先後成為註冊護士和深切治療部護士，再轉到醫管局總部工作，望令更多病人受惠。石指，余組織工會和參選僅為服務公眾，她一直倡以非暴力和合法手段向政府施壓，惟本案後很大機會不能再任護士，已付出代價。而余所屬的衞生服務界與其他區不同，沒有協調會議和論壇、亦無討論35+後要做什麼，余基本上獨自行事，屬「積極參加者」較低級別或「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;袁嘉蔚獄中成婚馮達浚向泛民等道歉&quot;&gt;袁嘉蔚獄中成婚、馮達浚向泛民等道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於袁嘉蔚，其代表資深大律師祁志指她是年輕的理想主義者，一生為人善良、樂於助人，對社會有抱負，任田灣區議員；而她的人生因被還柙而改寫，如今正在更生的路上，最近更在獄中成婚，望及早服刑完畢組織家庭。祁志又指，袁參選是望取得合法權力，《國安法》生效後不久已被DQ，參與程度低，亦真誠相信行為是合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志同代表馮達浚，形容他是理想主義者，畢業自拔萃男書院，受雨傘運動觸動服務社區，2019年參選區議員失敗，但繼續懷有理想為社區工作付出所有，他不是街頭抗爭者、也不暴力，只是一個熱心和幼稚的年輕人。馮亦撰求情信，指自己還柙3年已反省和改變，現時已不在意特首會否下台，並望向他曾經非常不禮貌對待的泛民、他的團隊、家人等道歉，對困擾社會感到後悔。馮亦獲浸大新聞系前高級講師呂秉權等撰求情信，指他對干犯《國安法》感後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李嘉達難再任社工黃子悅真誠誤信合法&quot;&gt;李嘉達難再任社工、黃子悅真誠誤信合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就前觀塘區議員李嘉達，大律師陳德昌認為他屬「積極參加者」較低級別，望以3年至6年半為量刑起點。陳指李在內地出生，3歲時來港定居，在工人階層家庭成長，港大社工系畢業後成註冊社工，並進修表達藝術治療碩士學位。2019年，李目睹年青人感無力沮喪，遂決定成為區議員，望影響更多人；當選後望投身更大政治舞台改變現況，遂參與初選，事後回看屬錯誤。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oo7lNrX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image37&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李嘉達&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方呈上41封來自李本人、女友、家人、老師、服務對象等求情信，指李還柙逾3年已付上代價，其女友曾提議結婚，但他望對方等待自己出獄，以辦正式婚禮，還柙期間其祖母亦離世。而李被定罪後難再任社工，但有非政府機構願在李獲釋後聘請他。陳德昌最後提到，當天與李會面時，李提及自兩年前認罪後，一直未有離開過赤柱監獄，他當天往法院途上，看到外面樹木翠綠、陽光燦爛、天空蔚藍，一切令人提起精神。陳德昌指感到驚訝，因自己不時會到赤柱，卻從沒留意，並指李已改變，他表明會離開政治，邁向人生新階段，繼續服務社會。李庭上聞言一度流下眼淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就黃子悅，大律師潘志明指她是本案最年輕的被告，雖在理大暴動案保釋期間犯本案，但兩案時間相近，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則，部分刑期分期執行，又指她真誠誤信計劃合法，非刻意犯法，屬「積極參加者」。至於朱凱廸，辯方指採納書面陳詞，沒有補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋作為大律師犯法感難堪後悔未拒參與&quot;&gt;楊岳橋：作為大律師犯法感難堪、後悔未拒參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;抗爭派以外，多名被告均是傳統民主派，曾參與政治和公共服務多年，亦獲不少前高官、議員等撰寫求情信。不少人表明，日後不會再從政。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨共5人被控，當中李予信罪脫，鄭達鴻罪成，楊岳橋等3人則認罪。就時任黨魁楊岳橋，資深大律師蔡維邦指他90年代舉家移民加拿大，在當地大學畢業後，因熱愛中國文化歷史，在北京修讀法學碩士，2009年成為大律師，2016年當選立法會議員。蔡指從立法會投票紀錄可見，楊並非主張阻撓議會運作或立場激進的議員，而他被捕不久已退出公民黨，並籲公民黨解散。蔡又提到，楊早於2021年9月表達認罪意向，並在警方邀請下提供證人口供，顯示他完全的悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/B7BdLRF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image39&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊岳橋&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又親撰求情信，稱作為一名大律師，為自己干犯刑事罪行感到難堪，並指從政原望令香港變得更好，但案發時受社會氣氛和政治理念相似的政治人物影響，他對反政府盲目和天真的熱情，令當時政治情況惡化。楊稱對未有拒絕參與否決預算案的謀劃感後悔，亦對其行為導致部分黨友參與此無望及錯誤的計劃，為他們及家人帶來巨大焦慮，感到非常抱歉，直言犯案是完全愚蠢和錯誤，他明白須接受懲罰。楊指日後不會再涉足公共事務，望法庭考慮他曾以其微小方式貢獻社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方認為，楊的量刑起點應為「積極參加者」3至10年刑期的中間。法官質疑為何不是最高級別，辯方回應，公民黨記者會在《國安法》生效前舉行，而雖然楊當時為黨魁，但他年資較淺，只是黨的發言人，不是黨內主要推手，惟法官表明不會接受這方面陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;譚文豪向社會各界及中央政府真誠道歉&quot;&gt;譚文豪：向社會各界及中央政府真誠道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於譚文豪，資深大律師何沛謙同指他屬「積極參加者」，望法庭考慮他對香港的貢獻和真誠悔意而減刑。辯方求情指，譚出身草根，靠努力成為民航機師，2016年放棄機師工作從政，並非為個人名利或榮譽，也從沒有意圖成為激進政客，只想回饋社會，令香港成為更好的地方；譚過去亦曾多次贊成政府撥款，更獲政府官員私信感謝。辯方又指，譚辭任立法會議員和退黨後，已完全離開政壇，他還柙逾3年，望能建立新生活，望彌補與龍鳳胎子女、妻子和母親相處的時間。譚開設的茶餐廳於疫情結業，他正修讀會計和企業管理課程，望裝備自己尋找新職涯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，譚及早認罪，並於2021年下半年自願錄口供，提及如果知道會犯法，「我係絕對唔會參加呢個初選」，辯方強調他當時不知道「紅線」在哪裡，並非公然違法。庭上又讀出譚親撰的求情信，提及望向法庭表達，「我對過去的言行深感悔疚，希望公開向香港社會各界以及中央政府真誠道歉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭家麒獲張超雄等撰求情信-指主張和平曾阻示威者衝擊&quot;&gt;郭家麒獲張超雄等撰求情信 指主張和平曾阻示威者衝擊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就郭家麒，資深大律師蔡維邦同指他是最早一批認罪被告，他有原則、願意奉獻、具同理心，無考慮「攬炒」亦不支持港獨，望以「積極參加者」較低程度為量刑起點。郭獲前運輸及房屋局副局長邱誠武、前立法會議員石禮謙及張超雄撰求情信，張指郭主張和平，2019年七一曾在立法會玻璃門前阻止示威者衝擊大樓，因而受傷，8月環球時報記者付國豪在機場被示威者綑綁和襲擊時，郭亦到場阻止。郭亦親撰求情信，提及出身草根，八十年代成為醫生，在學時目睹工人受傷，成立香港工人健康中心，奉獻空餘時間促進弱勢福祉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，郭自1994年至2007年任中西區區議員，2004年當選立法會議員，曾獲委任為醫管局成員；而他在公民黨解散前已退黨，出獄後望繼續行醫，退出政治，沒有重犯機會，望法庭考慮他犯案完全與性格不符。不過法官不認同，質疑本案串謀持續多月，郭必然對參選作詳細考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄭達鴻僅跟黨立場&quot;&gt;辯方指鄭達鴻僅跟黨立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻是唯一一名並非立法會議員的公民黨罪成被告，資深大律師潘熙認為他屬「其他參加者」，指他角色相對輕微，只是跟從黨的立場，而他報名參選後被DQ，其後宣布退黨、自願停用社交媒體，亦無再參與政治事務，他誤信初選合法才犯案。潘熙又指，鄭曾任8年區議員，一直希望成為立法會議員，他參與涉案謀劃並非為個人私利，而是望服務公眾及改善基層生活，望法庭考慮他參與公共服務多年而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;胡志偉尹兆堅獲前高官張炳良羅致光等撰求情信&quot;&gt;胡志偉、尹兆堅獲前高官張炳良、羅致光等撰求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主黨則有4人被控，其中胡志偉和尹兆堅認罪，黃碧雲及林卓廷均被裁定罪成。就時任民主黨主席胡志偉，大律師郭子丰表示，胡最多只是「積極參加者」的較低級別，無證據他組織涉案謀劃，只是透過參與論壇、街站等作和應，而他於論壇曾反問難道「起醫院、起學校我哋都要反對咩」，顯示他當時對「攬炒」和無差別否決財案有保留。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，胡參與公共政治事務逾30年，獲前運房局局長張炳良、副局長邱誠武及前勞福局局長羅致光3人撰寫求情信，指胡溫和、理性、務實，以人民和社會的最大利益為先，他亦曾獲政府頒授榮譽勳章及委任加入中央政策組等，顯示政府視他為可靠的人。辯方指，根據胡的背景、品格和多年政治信念，他並非蓄意危害國安的激進政治人物，案發時真誠誤信運用否決權屬合法；又指謀劃成功的機會極微，因民主黨議員對預算案如何投票無最終決定權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JW6ZXqa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image41&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於尹兆堅，大律師莫彥婷指他無出席選舉論壇、無簽署「墨落無悔」，他投身公共服務近20年，1994年成為註冊社工，2004年起四度當選區議員，2016年當選立法會議員，曾成功爭取殘疾人士2元乘車優惠和長者生活津貼等。而尹是出色的廚師，出獄後打算於國際人權組織「世界中央廚房」任職。尹另獲前勞工及福利局局長蕭偉強、羅致光，及前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良撰求情信，指他熱心勢助弱勢，可信有禮、和平理性，就勞工福利政等策有良好交流。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林卓廷黃碧雲屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方指林卓廷、黃碧雲屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林卓廷和黃碧雲則同由大律師沈士文代表，沈指二人沒有出席任何協調會議、無簽署「墨落無悔」、政綱無提否決預算案，參與程度低，屬「其他參加者」。他並指，二人定罪是因胡志偉的言論，以及從林卓廷搜出的論壇筆記，及黃碧雲在選舉論壇的發言。但針對後者，沈指她是在論壇被激進派「逼到牆角」，受壓下才提及否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就兩人背景，沈指林卓廷是傳統民主黨黨員，從不激進，而民主黨支持一國兩制和香港回歸中國，亦常與政府合作。林曾任區議員和立法會議員，推動「反圍標」運動，獲受助居民撰求情信，投票紀錄也顯示他非常勤奮，贊成多於反對。林亦獲民主黨前主席何俊仁、劉慧卿等撰求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黃碧雲是加州大學洛杉磯分校政治科學博士，曾於理大任多年講師，2012起任九西立法會議員，2020年立會選舉延期後無被DQ，但自願辭職，無再參與政治。前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良等為黃撰寫求情信，指她屬2019年「對抗式政治」的受害者，犯案與本性不符；又指2010年政改方案獲黃支持下通過，顯示她溫和務實，望香港循序漸進實現民主化，她在撥款議案亦與政府合作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁國雄雖成階下囚但毋怨堅信人民大於國家&quot;&gt;梁國雄：雖成階下囚但毋怨、堅信人民大於國家&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於社民連，岑子杰認罪，梁國雄則被裁罪成。就梁國雄，資深大律師潘熙採納書面陳詞，社民連則在Facebook發布梁國雄的陳情書，梁提到自70年代起參與政治運動和社會抗爭，是出於改變社會不公的願望，他從沒放棄爭取民主自由、實現社會主義，「一路走來近50年，黑髮變白頭，長毛成短毛，自由人淪為階下囚，我都是秉持這個理念行事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁指參與35+初選是因多年切身體驗，必須在立法會中與志同道合者取得過半數議席，才有足夠壓力令政府推行惠及民生的社會政策，而「五大訴求」中實行雙普選更是其身體力行多年的目標。梁又指，認為議員否決預算案乃《基本法》訂明的憲制權力，行政長官面臨下台的憲制危機，必須經歷兩次立法會選舉的民意授權，議員兩次行使否決權是民意依歸，只是彰顯200萬遊行市民民意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁最後指，「權力歸於人民」是他終生信守的理念，從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾，「今天我雖然成為階下囚，但我毋怨。我堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權，惟願港人莫失莫忘，爭取民主，守護公義！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑子杰獲區諾軒撰求情信&quot;&gt;岑子杰獲區諾軒撰求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就岑子杰，大律師郭憬憲認為其罪責屬最輕，並讀出區諾軒撰寫的求情信，提及望法庭考慮岑的政治取向輕判，指岑是九西協調會議上反對無差別否決預算案的關鍵人物，對於阻止無差別否決成為該區共識具決定性作用。區又形容岑是非暴力的人，在2019年組織公眾活動時與警方合作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方倡譚得志為其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方倡譚得志為「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於人民力量，時任主席陳志全，大律師馬維騉指他沒有出席初選記者會，也無參與協調會議，屬「積極參加者」較低程度。他又指，陳獲其妹妹、配偶及前政府官員撰求情信，望法庭考慮他是一名勤奮盡責的立法會議員，積極替性小眾利益發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就時任副主席快必譚得志，大律師梁寶琳主張他是「其他參加者」，指他雖有簽署「墨落無悔」，但擺街站、參與論壇，呼籲投票等是一般選舉會做的事；又強調初選是開放予所有人參加的民主選舉，譚主動參與不構成他屬「積極參加」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bzvRD70.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全、譚得志&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，譚擁有基督教研究和神學兩個碩士學位，曾任電台主持逾20年，而他被捕後已退出人民力量，在初選亦只排名第四，再沒有機會重返政壇，他還柙逾3年已付上代價；作為基督徒的他，現在每天都讀《懺悔錄》，嘗試學習和懺悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來已退出民協何啟明盼專注教會事奉&quot;&gt;施德來已退出民協、何啟明盼專注教會事奉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於民協，就時任主席施德來，大律師黃廷光指他是註冊社工，育有一名9歲兒子，2008年加入民協，2016年當選黃大仙區議員及成為民協主席，不同政府部門曾發信表揚他的貢獻，而他本案後已辭任主席和退出民協，亦無法再任社工，抱負破滅。辯方指他於獄中報讀都大心理學課程，望裝備自己，服刑完畢後以其他崗位貢獻社會，屬「積極參加者」的中至低級別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於時任副主席何啟明，大律師阮偉明望判監3年以下。他指何出身草根，為虔誠基督徒，以基督精神幫助貧窮和有需要人士，他2015年加入民協，被捕後持續服務社區，包括跟進保育深水埗主教山配水庫。何過去數年在神學院修讀基督教研究碩士課程，本案後打算遠離政治，專注教會事奉。辯方又呈上何父母、兄弟、女友、前民協主席馮檢基等求情信，馮指對何服務弱勢社群的熱情和投入印象深刻。阮偉明望法庭接納，何本質上是一個好人，他出於良好動機、具高尚目的而犯案，望成為立法會議員，令香港成為更好的地方，現已對行為深切反省。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳敏兒犯案是人生最大錯誤與政治劃清界線&quot;&gt;吳敏兒：犯案是人生最大錯誤、與政治劃清界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前職工盟主席吳敏兒，資深大律師李志喜指她在初選落敗，是新界西其中一個最不成功的候選人，而她落敗後繼續工會工作，協助工人渡過疫情，與政治劃清界線，職工盟亦已解散，不會重犯，望法庭考慮她為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又親撰求情信，提到曾擔任空中服務員，成立英航香港機艙服務員工會，並於2016年當選職工盟主席，夢想有更好的勞工法律保障工人權益。吳自言參選僅望推動社會進步，令工人能分享經濟成果，從沒意圖顛覆國家，她被捕始知干犯《國安法》，對此感到震驚，形容犯案是「人生最大的錯誤」，就此真誠致歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;范國威獲黃宏發撰求情信譚凱邦不再倡環保議題&quot;&gt;范國威獲黃宏發撰求情信、譚凱邦不再倡環保議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;新民主同盟的范國威，大律師吳靄儀指范在美國修讀藝術，對政治感興趣，自2000年起擔任21年西貢區議員，並曾任立法會議員6年。范獲西貢區議會前主席吳仕福、前立法局主席黃宏發及多名街坊撰求情信，讚揚他務實無私，對地區民生很大貢獻。其女兒亦形容他為「每個女生所能渴求的最好的父親」。辯方指范望將本案一切抛諸腦後，與家人相處，望視他為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同屬新民主同盟、並創辦「環保觸覺」的譚凱邦，大律師馬維騉指，譚曾任兩屆馬灣區議員，他一直視環保議題為首要議程，參與初選目的並非顛覆政府，而是望進入議會，為環保發聲，並獲前天文台台長林超英等撰求情信，肯定他對環保議題的付出。辯方又指，譚在初選屬「陪跑」，於新西初選得票最低，望考慮他參與程度低，屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，譚還柙期間修讀建築管理課程，決心不會重返政治，包括不再倡環保議題，以免牽涉政治；又指譚還柙期間受感染，手腳皮膚潰爛，望法庭能基於人道原因酌情減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;毛孟靜望與丈夫度時光&quot;&gt;毛孟靜望與丈夫度時光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就前區政聯盟召集人柯耀林，大律師葉海琅指他參與公共服務多年，自2003年起三度當選區議員，2008年亦獲政府表揚就公共服務的貢獻。而他非常溫和保守，參與程度較其他被告為低，初選得票率低，不足1%，涉案屬「不幸」，獲不同政治光譜的區議員撰寫求情信。不過法官質疑，柯曾簽署「墨落無悔」、出席選舉論壇、派發選舉單張、聘請選舉經理，難言參與較他人少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，另有不隸屬於傳統民主黨派的被告。就前灣仔區議會主席楊雪盈，代表大律師張耀良指她屬「其他參加者」，辯方呈上32封求情信，包括前南區區議會副主席司馬文、香港戲劇協會會長馮祿德、藝術發展局前委員張秉權等，望顯示楊服務社區、熱心文藝和動保等多個面向，司馬文亦形容楊為溫和民主派。楊又親撰求情信，自言出身基層，醉心文藝，為社會貢獻是一生夢寐以求的事；而她一直無黨無派，參選單純望將議題和初心帶去立法會跟進，誤信初選無牴觸《國安法》才參加，誤墮法網「實在愚蠢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jYHPEao.png&quot; alt=&quot;image48&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指楊毫不激進，有良好動機，參選只望令社區變得更好，望法庭以「新角度」審視其案情。惟法官陳慶偉質疑，辯方是否指楊不應被定罪、沒有悔意，又指辯方似是上訴而非求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於前東區區議員徐子見，辯方同指屬「其他參加者」，指他為政治素人，無任何政治聯繫，亦從無表達激進政治理念，罪責最低。辯方指徐患有慢性病，育有一名26歲兒子，他最近離婚，父親亦於他還柙期間離世。多名街坊撰寫求情信，提到徐曾免費維修電器、免費剪髮、鼓勵長者接種疫苗等，是身體力行的人；徐亦親撰求情信稱明白罪行嚴重性，望對受影響的人深切道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就前南區區議員彭卓棋，大律師盧敏儀指他基於對新法無知而犯案，而彭案發時僅25至26歲，無政治聯繫，誤信通知民主動力移除政綱，已足以確保不違法。辯方又指，彭具持續的愛國聯繫、熱心服務國家，曾推廣年輕人到大灣區創業，自2022年5月又受僱於「香港基本法基金會」，維護國安和推廣《基本法》，犯案是與其良好品格相違。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官拒絕接納彭曾撤回政綱，並質疑彭初選時以極端激進言辭反對政府和國家，被捕後改為到推廣基本法的組織工作，「除了指他事實上是一名機會主義者，如何能看出其行為是一致？」，又指辯方陳詞形容彭為「機會主義者」，這或是他另一次投機，彭是「一個偽裝成愛國者的機會主義者」。辯方引述認識彭多年的朋友、老師等求情信，指可反映他的性格，不過法官再質疑，辯方求情明顯與法庭裁決及彭在初選的形象不同，明言難以接納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參選新東的社工呂智恆，大律師陳世傑指，呂角色次要，從無意圖推翻政權、只是企圖阻礙運作，對法律無知而犯案，望接納為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度；又指他十分善良，是具天真理念的政治新人，望法庭判刑時展示憐憫，令呂盡快重投社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂親撰求情信，提及幾經挫折實現夢想志向成為社工，但因本案而失去社工資格。呂提到他出身單親家庭，童年在不同人家寄居、曾被迫做童工和失學，至中四被領養，獲養母無私的愛和包容，後成為社工。2019年發生反修例引起的民主運動，他心痛多人輕生、失蹤，深感這代青年絕望感遠超他童年所受痛苦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂指，他參加初選為了由人民授權行使否決權，「以非常無奈和間接的方式罷免特首，希望當權者回應民意」；他當時無知地相信議員行使否決權是合法，現已明白否決對政權帶來衝擊和影響運作是錯誤想法，感到後悔抱歉。呂指保釋後數年經常失眠和感到巨大壓力，倒數入獄的日子參與教會事奉、做義工，回收麵包分給露宿者、單親家庭等，又為基層兒童義務補習。他不敢低估刑期，但會心存盼望，期望未來報答親恩和服務弱勢社群。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於唯一一名任從犯證人的參與者被告，阿布泰國生活百貨創辦人林景楠，大律師范凱傑指他遲參選，亦不曾出席協調會議和初選記者會、沒有簽「墨落無悔」，屬「其他參加者」，又指林錄取口供和成為控方證人，其證供有用，可獲50%減刑。不過法官質疑，證供主要談及林本人的參與，他雖提到出席沈旭暉主持的協調會議，但沈並非本案共謀者、亦無因此被捕；法庭在裁決時也完全無依賴林的證供。辯方亦望為林索取社會服務令報告，惟法官明言是不現實、不合理，拒絕辯方要求，並指林於開審當天才認罪，只能減刑20%。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上讀出林景楠親撰的求情信節錄，林提到候審時通過接觸不同觀點的資訊，明白當初參選是「非常幼稚及愚蠢」的行為，「中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀」；又指透過深切反省，意識到自己要為2019年起的社會撕裂負不少責任，因他是「黃色經濟圈領頭者」。林又引述國家主席習近平七一講話，指「香港不能亂也亂不起」，林指深切反思後發現很多港人包括自己，「一直受到很多海外勢力或網絡傳媒的渲染，間接成為反中亂港的一分子」，因此他主動聯絡國安處認罪，因認罪才是最真誠的認錯。他感謝控方讓他成為證人，「讓我可以把我的所知所聞一一供出」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最後真誠向中央政府、特區政府，尤其香港海關和警隊及所有受他影響的市民真誠道歉，望法庭讓他履行作為父親的責任，陪伴三個孩子成長，及予他機會，重新投入中港泰三地，用實際行動抓住香港由治及興的機會，說好香港和國家故事，促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件將於明日（19日）判刑，辯方的求情陳詞是否被法官採納仍是未知數，但各人在庭上的發言、所撰的求情信，已留下歷史的印記。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community now find that their reach exceeds their grasp in terms of their ability to shape the regional order in the South Caucasus. Both remain regionally influential, but their leverage to drive developments is eroding as the South Caucasus is affected by multipolar international politics. The rise of multipolarity is being promoted by the increasing role of a broad set of external actors – most of all Turkey, Iran and China – engaging in the South Caucasus, and by strengthening links between the region and Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia, links that are supplementing the region’s established ties to the US, Europe and Russia. In this context, there is increased local agency in relation to external partnerships (reinforced by a turn to illiberal domestic politics), and waning attraction both to Russian and Euro-Atlantic integration projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these changes, Russia has lost its position of pre-eminence, which rested primarily on tying together its security interests with the region’s protracted conflicts. Over the past 30 years, Moscow has leveraged these conflicts to give it a central geopolitical role, which it has used to promote a regional status quo to its advantage and to create a Gordian knot of interwoven obstacles and interests to hinder efforts at Euro-Atlantic integration. The war in Ukraine has played a part in undercutting Moscow’s position in the South Caucasus, but Russia’s long-term relative decline as new actors have entered the region, power shifts within the South Caucasus itself (notably the rise of Azerbaijan), and changing Russian regional interests are the main factors challenging Moscow’s established role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is now seeking to adapt to the new regional situation. It is attempting to establish its role as the leading, but no longer exclusive, external actor in the South Caucasus by reconfiguring its position. This involves a rebalancing of bilateral relations, broadening its range of policy tools (notably in the areas of transport and communications) from a previous reliance on security, and being ready to countenance an expanded presence for other external actors, notably regional powers – principally Iran, Turkey and, increasingly, China – while remaining opposed to the US and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a Euro-Atlantic security commitment capable of challenging Russia in the South Caucasus, the policies of enlargement (eventual NATO and EU membership) have lost traction. The Euro-Atlantic community now risks being marginalised in an increasingly competitive regional environment. If it is to undercut Russia’s effort to build a new position – to retie the Caucasian knot – and retain a significant regional role, it will need to develop approaches capable of responding to and shaping the new South Caucasus geopolitics and geo-economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is facing a key moment in its post-Soviet position in the South Caucasus (Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia). Since the mid-2000s, geopolitical competition between Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community has emerged as a defining issue shaping the regional order. Using security policy – including direct military action – as its primary tool, Russia was able to establish itself both as the main arbiter in conflict resolution and central to the balance of power in the South Caucasus. On this basis, Russia was able to limit NATO and EU enlargement policies, while at the same time seeking to advance its own integration project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Political and Military Map of the South Caucasus.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Labrang/Wikimedia. Edited by RUSI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the South Caucasus became an internally and externally fragmented region (see Figure 1). Countries were divided domestically and regionally by protracted conflicts – Nagorno-Karabakh was contested between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and conflicts emerged over the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia also developed differing foreign and security policy trajectories and built diverse allegiances. Azerbaijan adopted policies of balancing and neutrality, Georgia aspired to join the EU and NATO, and Armenia became Russia’s ally within the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Russia has sought to manipulate and deepen these divisions to give itself a central regional role. In recent years, as President Vladimir Putin has developed a more assertive policy of rebuilding Russia as a “great power”, the South Caucasus has become integral to the Kremlin’s wider ambitions of dominating the Black Sea, and projecting power into the Middle East and the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre-eminence that Russia has established in the South Caucasus over the past three decades is now being eroded by far-reaching shifts in the international regional and domestic environments. These changes have the potential to create a new regional order. A variety of international actors – China, Iran, Israel, the Gulf states and India, among others – has entered the region, offering new diplomatic and political, trade and investment, and security relations, and providing alternatives to both Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community. The governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia have sought to widen their space for political action by developing foreign policies to engage with new international actors and to escape from the geopolitical competition between Russia and the West. Together, these developments have diminished the significance of Russia’s security leverage, notably in respect to the contest over Nagorno-Karabakh as Azerbaijan and Armenia seek to finalise a peace agreement, and shifted the South Caucasus towards alternative agendas for trade, connectivity and strengthening multipolarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the challenge to Russia’s established position in the South Caucasus as the region undergoes significant change, and analyses Moscow’s effort to craft a new regional approach. The findings of the paper are drawn from three principal sources. A review of secondary literature on regional developments in the South Caucasus was supplemented by a workshop conducted in Tbilisi, Georgia, in April 2024 that brought together leading experts on regional issues. In addition, interviews were conducted, in confidence, with officials from the US, the EU and the UK in Washington, DC, Brussels, London, Tbilisi and Yerevan between February and May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has three chapters. Chapter I examines how in the post-Soviet decades Russia established itself as the leading external actor in the South Caucasus. Chapter II analyses how Russia’s regional position is being challenged, notably by the wars over Ukraine and Nagorno-Karabakh, the appearance of new international actors in the South Caucasus, and by the shift of regional governments to pursuing foreign policies of multi-alignment, made possible by multipolarity, and often in conjunction with increasingly illiberal domestic politics. Chapter III considers the implications of these changes for Russia’s regional position and sets out how Moscow has sought to respond to these shifts to retain a leading role. The paper concludes with the implications of the changes in Russia’s position and the wider shifts in the South Caucasus for the policies of the Euro-Atlantic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russias-south-caucasus-strategy&quot;&gt;I. Russia’s South Caucasus Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Caucasus has historically played a key role in Moscow’s broader strategic thinking. The conquest of the North and South Caucasus was central to Russian imperial ambitions and involved a prolonged and ultimately triumphant struggle for control over the region with the Ottoman and Persian empires between the 18th and 20th centuries. The defeat of the Ottomans was at the heart of the wider Russian plan to establish dominance in the Black Sea region, including extending state boundaries through the territories of contemporary Ukraine, and expanding influence into the Balkans, as well as through the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategic goal of expanding control over the Caucasus was a stepping-stone for Russia to extend its reach into the Middle East and the Mediterranean, notably as it sought naval access to the world’s oceans beyond the limits of its northern ports. During the Soviet era (1922–91), Moscow applied a similar strategic logic to the region, while also seeing the South Caucasus as a buffer zone to the conflicts of the Middle East and, during the Cold War, the threat posed by NATO to the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;post-soviet-south-caucasus-engagement&quot;&gt;Post-Soviet South Caucasus Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the emergence of the independent states of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, Russia initially shifted away from viewing the South Caucasus as integral to its security policy. The new Russian leadership under President Boris Yeltsin focused instead on a Euro-Atlantic vector in its external ties, while its neighbours were a much lower priority. A series of civil wars in the South Caucasus – over Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan – involved elements of Russia’s security forces and led Moscow to develop a new security engagement in the region around the deployment of Russian-led “peacekeeping operations”. These missions served to freeze the violence, rather than resolve the conflicts, and opened the way for Moscow to manage, as well as manipulate, the conflicts in subsequent years, including the opportunity to influence regional issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the mid-1990s, growing violent instability in the North Caucasus, notably in Chechnya, drew Russia into a more southern-oriented security and military posture, and promoted a refocus of its foreign and security policy onto the immediate neighbourhood. Notwithstanding the withdrawal of some Russian military facilities from the South Caucasus in the 1990s and early 2000s, notably from Georgia and Azerbaijan, Moscow retained a border guard and military presence in Armenia. This positioning reflected the long-term view in Moscow of the South Caucasus as a buffer to instability from the south and a means to balance Turkey’s regional aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing threat of Islamist terrorism in Russia’s North Caucasus and the launch of the second Chechen war by Putin in 1999 led Russia to strengthen further its military and security focus on both the North and South Caucasus. It was, however, the emergence of growing Euro-Atlantic engagement in the region that led Russia increasingly to instrumentalise protracted conflicts as leverage in an emerging geopolitical struggle with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Putin’s initial period as Russia’s president (2000–08), and in particular during his second term (2004–08), Russia moved away from cooperative security approaches to regional conflict management, notably through the OSCE, to giving primacy to its own bilateral engagements. Moscow sought to balance betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, including through the supply of weapons to both sides. Russian repositioning around Georgia’s protracted conflicts accelerated following the November 2003 Rose Revolution that brought to power in Tbilisi a government seeking closer ties to NATO and the EU. Increasingly, Moscow backed the separatist leaderships of the two breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in opposition to Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-and-euro-atlantic-regional-competition&quot;&gt;Russia and Euro-Atlantic Regional Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The August 2008 Russia–Georgia war, following the April NATO Bucharest Summit Declaration that Georgia (and Ukraine) would join the Alliance in the future, marked the onset of full-scale geopolitical confrontation in the South Caucasus. Russia’s use of military force was designed to demonstrate that it was unwilling to countenance Euro-Atlantic integration in territories it considered its backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return of Putin as president in 2012 marked a new phase of Russian policy towards the South Caucasus. The region became fully integrated into Putin’s growing great power ambitions for Russia, and the confrontation with the Euro-Atlantic community. Russia’s military action against Georgia in 2008 directly challenged the Euro-Atlantic community by suggesting that it would need to be ready for war with Russia if it sought to advance membership in European organisations for countries in the South Caucasus. Through this positioning, Putin aimed to maintain a regional status quo favourable to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s security position has been its trump card in the South Caucasus, Moscow has developed other interlinked policy approaches, both to coerce and attract the region. As geopolitical competition with the Euro-Atlantic community strengthened after 2008, Russia increasingly sought to integrate the South Caucasus more closely as part of its efforts to create a “sphere of privileged interests” across the territory of the former Soviet Union. Russia aimed to counter Euro-Atlantic integration efforts through its own integration agenda, focused on the EAEU and the CSTO. Ultimately, only Armenia agreed to join the EAEU – it was already a member of the CSTO – when Russia leveraged Armenia’s security dependence to pressure it to reject an EU association agreement in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s policy mix has been tailored to the countries of the region. With Georgia, the Kremlin has used a stick-and-carrot approach. Initially, Moscow relied on economic coercion and disinformation, while leveraging the protracted conflicts (including periodically raising the prospect of annexing South Ossetia), and the threat of further coercive and even military action against Tbilisi following the 2008 war. With the adoption by the Georgian government of a policy to normalise relations with Russia from 2012, and in particular as the ruling Georgian Dream Party has grown increasingly authoritarian in its domestic policies, leading to a deterioration of ties with the Euro-Atlantic community, Moscow has offered visa liberalisation, the resumption of direct flights between the two countries, increased tourism and the importance of a trade relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Armenia, Moscow has employed a different approach. It has provided security guarantees through Armenia’s CSTO membership and the presence of Russian military and border guard facilities. Moscow has also offered Armenia favourable economic terms. It has sought to advance Russian investment in the energy and other sectors, while membership of the EAEU has provided Armenia with access to a large market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Azerbaijan, Russia has been ready to accommodate flexibility as long as Baku has eschewed seeking NATO or EU membership, while at the same time pledging good neighbourly relations. This has been achieved through the conclusion of a series of partnership agreements over the past two decades (notably the partnership agreement in February 2022), and building cooperation in key economic areas, critically energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, Russia has sought to use its pre-eminent security position, supported by other policies, to limit the three South Caucasian republics’ options for external economic and security ties. The aim of these approaches has been to isolate the South Caucasus strategically while tying it ever closer to Russia. Entangling the conflicts of the South Caucasus with Russian security interests has created a Gordian knot for the Euro-Atlantic community in the region which, in the absence of a readiness to challenge Russia directly for fear of escalation to military confrontation and even war, has been unable to advance substantially its integration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-as-a-great-power-and-the-south-caucasus&quot;&gt;Russia as a Great Power and the South Caucasus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As competition with the Euro-Atlantic community intensified, the South Caucasus became part of Russia’s broader ambition to project its power around and across the Black Sea. In a return to Russia’s grand strategy towards the South Caucasus, Moscow’s regional engagement was linked to the wider goal of projecting power into the Black Sea region and beyond, into the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, as Russia became involved in the conflicts in Syria and Libya. After the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and its intervention in eastern Ukraine, the military and security dimensions of the South Caucasus were strengthened through enhancing the network of Russian military bases in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Armenia (see Figure 1), and promoting the integration of these facilities with the regional network of Russian military facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-growing-dominance-of-the-south-caucasus&quot;&gt;Russia’s Growing Dominance of the South Caucasus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 2020s, Russia appeared to have largely achieved dominance in the South Caucasus. Moscow’s approach to the region had effectively halted Euro-Atlantic integration while gradually strengthening its own position. In 2020, when Azerbaijan launched the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Russia aimed to advance its regional role with the introduction of “peacekeepers” into the conflict, something it had sought for over 20 years. These developments led to interpretations that Russia was consolidating its regional pre-eminence. In fact, the South Caucasus was already experiencing a set of interrelated shifts that have together undermined the regional position that Russia built up in the post-Soviet period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-russia-challenged-in-the-south-caucasus&quot;&gt;II. Russia Challenged in the South Caucasus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the foundations of Moscow’s dominant regional position, built in the context of geopolitical and geo-economic competition with the Euro-Atlantic community, have been challenged by three interlinked developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War (2020 and 2023) created a new regional balance of force and the emergence of economic and connectivity opportunities that have undercut security agendas. Second, a set of external actors has entered the region, providing alternatives to Moscow, Brussels and Washington, and tying the South Caucasus more closely to the Middle East, central Eurasia and Asia. Third, Russia’s war in Ukraine initially led to a questioning of Moscow’s ability to project security and military force in the region, while the prolonged nature of the war has reinforced hedging strategies by countries in the region unsure of who will ultimately be victorious. Together, these developments are promoting foreign and security policies of multi-alignment in the South Caucasus, as regional governments seek to develop multiple external partners to balance and hedge against the dominance of Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-second-nagorno-karabakh-war&quot;&gt;The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant development within the South Caucasus region has been Azerbaijan’s military actions in 2020 and 2023 to take back territory occupied by Armenia following the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–94), and ultimately to reclaim control over the Nagorno-Karabakh region itself. As a result, Azerbaijan has emerged as the regional agenda setter and has attracted Russia’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Armenia, there has been a deterioration in the Armenia–Russia alliance as a result of Russia’s failure to restrain Azerbaijan in 2020 and the inability – and possibly unwillingness – of Russian “peacekeepers” to prevent the seizure of the whole of Nagorno-Karabakh in 2023. This led to the flight of the ethnic Armenian population amid claims of ethnic cleansing – along with a perception that Moscow is more interested in developing a close relationship with Baku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armenia has signalled publicly that it is ready to shift away from its reliance on Russian security guarantees and seek closer relations with others, notably the US and the EU (especially France). Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has indicated that Armenia has suspended its participation in the CSTO – having previously indicated that it would leave the organisation – although he has not closed the door to a future relationship, and Russian border guards have been removed from Yerevan airport. With the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict resolved by military force, Russia is no longer able to leverage its role as a mediator, while the prospect of a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, potentially also leading to Armenia–Turkey normalisation, will further reduce Moscow’s ability to leverage its security role. With the war in Ukraine also redefining Russian regional interests, Moscow has begun to reshape its approach to the South Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emerging-international-actors-in-the-south-caucasus&quot;&gt;Emerging International Actors in the South Caucasus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the period since 2008 has been marked by geopolitical competition between Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community in the South Caucasus, states within the region are increasingly reaching out to a wider network of partners to help them to manage geopolitical competition and expand economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing influence of Turkey has relied to a significant degree on its strategic alliance with Azerbaijan and the coordinated approach that the two countries have taken to Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as well as energy projects. Since 1992, they have forged close military, diplomatic and economic ties. Turkey has notably provided Azerbaijan with important military capacities and training. This relationship was central to the 2020 Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, in which Turkish military technologies played an important role, but even more significant was the ability of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to balance diplomatic efforts by Putin to shape the outcomes of the conflict to Russia’s advantage. Since then, Turkey and Azerbaijan have coordinated efforts to position the South Caucasus as the gateway to the Middle Corridor, which links Europe through the Caspian region to Central Asia and western parts of China, and to accelerate work on this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Azerbaijan is Turkey’s key regional ally, Turkey has been exploring deeper ties with Georgia, reflecting the country’s key transit role for energy, transport and trade. Turkey identifies relations with Georgia as a “strategic partnership”, supports its territorial integrity and does not recognise claims by Abkhazia and South Ossetia for independence. Turkey is Georgia’s leading trade partner, ahead of Russia and China, and Ankara views Georgia as a critical partner in its plans for the development and expansion of the Middle Corridor. Turkey has also sought to develop its security ties to Georgia, including as part of a trilateral format with Azerbaijan, and has been a supporter of closer ties between NATO and Georgia. Turkey’s role has also been important as part of a broader strengthening in relations between the South Caucasus and Middle Eastern countries that has included rising trade and deepening diplomatic ties, notably with Saudi Arabia, but also with Iraq and Jordan (as well as Iran and Israel).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran does not have the levels of regional influence achieved by Russia and Turkey, in part reflecting its strategic view of the South Caucasus as a buffer region. Tehran’s approach has been focused on preventing overspill from the region into Iran. It hopes to balance the influence of regional rivals (Turkey and Russia) and ensure that the South Caucasus does not become a base of operations for states seen as hostile to Tehran (principally the US and Israel). As the third regional neighbouring state it has, nonetheless, built ties with Armenia, while managing a complex and occasionally confrontational relationship with Azerbaijan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the South Caucasus has begun to open to greater connectivity, gaining access to Iran’s trade and transport routes has risen in importance. Tehran has developed a more forward-leaning foreign policy towards the South Caucasus and has sought to improve its relationship with Azerbaijan and adopt a more balanced approach to the countries in the region. This has led to an emergent closer relationship with Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with Russia and Turkey, Iran shares an interest in limiting the role of the Euro-Atlantic community in the South Caucasus, and Tehran has supported efforts to advance the “3 + 3” South Caucasus Regional Cooperation Platform format, aimed at bringing together Iran, Turkey, Russia and the South Caucasus countries. Iran has also recognised the strategic importance of efforts to shape a new regional transportation network as part of a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Crucially, Tehran has opposed efforts to open the so-called Zangezur Corridor, the proposed transport link between Azerbaijan and its exclave Nakhchivan across the southern Armenian region of Syunik, fearing it would impede its trade links northwards and strengthen Turkey’s regional position, even when this has led to friction with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite strains in the Iran–Russia relationship, there has been a strategic convergence between Tehran and Moscow as a result of the Ukraine war, which is being formalised through a proposed partnership treaty that will include regional security issues, alongside a free-trade agreement to link the EAEU to Iran. Iran’s evolving engagement in the South Caucasus, and notably its cooperation with Russia in the area of transport, form an important element of the growing alignment between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Israel and the Gulf States&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Turkey, Israel has been Azerbaijan’s most important external partner in military, investment and diplomatic support. Azerbaijan has looked to Israel to provide it with key military capabilities, as well as technologies to advance its ambitions to move its economy away from reliance on hydrocarbon production. Azerbaijan has become a significant energy supplier to Israel. Israel has, on the other hand, had modest relations with Georgia and Armenia, and its engagement in the South Caucasus has served primarily to reinforce Baku’s international options and capabilities, rather than to play a regional role. At the same time, Iran’s concern about a potential Israeli security presence in Azerbaijan has fed into Tehran’s broader foreign and military approach to the South Caucasus, notably into an effort to weaken Baku through support for Armenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on their established links to Azerbaijan, Gulf states are increasingly looking to the South Caucasus for investment and trade opportunities, particularly in the energy and transportation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;China and Central Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s presence in the South Caucasus has been growing through trade and tourism, as well as infrastructure projects. The new international interest in transport corridors through the South Caucasus, in part created by the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, has increased China’s engagement in the region as it seeks to develop “the Great Silk Road” as part of its global Belt and Road Initiative. The award to a Chinese-led consortium of a contract to build the Anaklia deepwater port in Georgia is a particular focus for Beijing as part of its effort to build transport infrastructure connecting China’s economy to European markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pull of China in relation to economic and trade issues is also drawing the countries of the South Caucasus to the east in their external relations, as efforts to develop the Middle Corridor accelerate. While the central approach of China in the South Caucasus appears to be geo-economic, its growing interest in Georgia has been linked to the erosion of democratic practices through rising elite corruption, while also being seen to reinforce the broader regional shift of foreign policy – away from the Euro-Atlantic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cement its developing regional role, China has sought to conclude “strategic agreements” with Georgia and Azerbaijan. Baku has made the most significant shift to the east, even raising the prospect of joining regional formats, and President Ilham Aliyev has attended the Central Asia head of state consultative meetings, as well as forging bilateral and minilateral ties with countries across that region. The transport connectivity agenda is, however, exerting a pull on all the South Caucasus countries, pushing them to develop ties linking the Black and Caspian Sea regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;India and Pakistan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India and Pakistan are relatively minor international actors in the region, but India has been increasing its arms sales, notably becoming a primary supplier to Armenia, while Pakistan has concluded defence agreements with Azerbaijan. Pakistan has sought to track India’s growing regional ties as an extension of their bilateral rivalry. Relations with the South Caucasus also reflect India’s long-term plans to build new trade and transport routes from South Asia across Eurasia to Europe, linking the region to the Gulf and the Indian Ocean. These new ties are becoming the basis for competing groupings, with India seeking to cooperate with Iran and Armenia, and Pakistan looking to partner with Turkey and Azerbaijan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-south-caucasus-as-a-multipolar-region&quot;&gt;The South Caucasus as a Multipolar Region&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of a multitude of international actors in the South Caucasus is changing the region’s international environment. While Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community remain key reference points, reflecting their continuing regional strategic weight, new actors are offering additional security, economic and transport relationships. Minilateral formats are emerging to reflect new partnerships and blending of interests, and some South Caucasus states are looking to participate in larger multilateral formats, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the BRICS (Azerbaijan announced its application to join in August 2024), and the Organization of Turkic States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries in the region, this approach to external ties is driven by two main interests. First, governments are pursuing balancing approaches to serve as counterweights to external integration projects that seek to curtail the position and interests of domestic elites, whether it is via Russia’s efforts to shape pro-Moscow regimes or the Euro-Atlantic community’s democracy, human rights and rule of law agenda challenging illiberal and kleptocratic regimes. Second, the broadening of external contacts has enabled countries in the South Caucasus to increase their leverage, and notably to hedge their dominant bilateral ties to Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community, in order to improve their bargaining position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of this dimension of regional politics is, however, also a source for new instability in the region, with countries now linked to various disputes and competition beyond the South Caucasus, for example the tensions between Turkey and Israel over Gaza and Lebanon have unsettled their ties to Azerbaijan. It is also difficult for external actors to develop a stable approach to the region, as the regional governments are able to switch external partners and play them against each other to secure better offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Russia’s War in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 created shock waves across the South Caucasus. Initially, Russia pulled forces from the region to reinforce its struggling troops in Ukraine. As Moscow faced difficulties in overcoming Ukrainian forces, questions were raised in the region about the effectiveness of Russia as a military and security actor. The war also increased external pressure on the governments in the South Caucasus to take sides in the conflict, including through observing Western sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia, concerned about the Russian threat to its own territories, distanced itself from Kyiv and refused to apply sanctions. Azerbaijan sought to maintain its policy of balancing, providing limited support to Ukraine, agreeing to supply extra gas volumes to Europe as it sought to diversify its energy markets, and emphasised its crucial geographic position at the heart of the Middle Corridor as an alternative to Russian transit routes. At the same time, Baku sought to maintain its strategic relationship with Moscow. Armenia, given its reliance on Moscow and questions about the effectiveness of Russian forces and the ability of Russia’s defence industry to supply weapons, began to recalibrate its security partnership with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Ukraine war has continued, the impact of the conflict on the South Caucasus has shifted. With considerable uncertainty about the outcome of the war, all three South Caucasus states have sought to avoid being too overtly tied to one side and have pursued different balancing options. There is also concern that if Russia is victorious in Ukraine, it may then look to strengthen its control over the South Caucasus as the next step in efforts to expand Russia’s regional power, and so the prudent approach is to avoid taking sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Ukraine war has reshaped Russia’s own interests in the South Caucasus. As a result of the war and Western sanctions, the South Caucasus has become critical to Russia’s efforts to reorient trade and communications away from Europe. This has led Moscow to rebalance its regional relations, with Baku becoming central to Russia’s regional transportation plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-russias-repositioning-in-the-south-caucasus&quot;&gt;III. Russia’s Repositioning in the South Caucasus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with the current shifts across the region, Russia has sought to craft a new balance of policies so that it can reposition itself and remain at the heart of the South Caucasus regional order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-policy&quot;&gt;Security Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the emergence of new policy tools, Moscow continues to use security issues to shape the region towards its interests. The ongoing occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and their steady integration into Russia remains a defining point in Moscow’s regional position. As the relationship between Georgia and the Euro-Atlantic community has frayed, as Tbilisi has adopted increasingly anti-democratic domestic policies and continued to develop ties with Russia, Moscow has rebalanced its approach from threat to inducement around the protracted Abkhaz and South Ossetian conflict. Before the Georgian elections on 26 October 2024 Moscow hinted that it would be ready to help Tbilisi “normalise” relations with the two breakaway regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the fact that the Euro-Atlantic community has not been prepared to challenge Russian military occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia directly signals to the wider region the limit of EU/NATO regional commitment. While Russia’s policy towards Georgia remains a clear indication that Moscow will not countenance Euro-Atlantic integration in the region, its ability to bind the wider region through security ties has, however, corroded, notably with the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the subsequent shift by Armenia towards a broader range of security partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its defeat in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenia has signalled strong dissatisfaction with the Russian security guarantee, and there has been an escalation of negative rhetoric regarding Moscow’s role. Yerevan has taken steps on the margins of its security relationship with Moscow to underline its discontent, opened to a wider range of external relationships, including with the Euro-Atlantic community, and begun to rebuild its military through partnerships with Europe, India and the US. While Armenia may be able to “navigate a path away from Russia” through diversifying its security partnerships, there are real limits on how far Armenia can push, at least in the medium term. It has become clear since 2020 that Russian security protection does not extend to actions by Azerbaijan. However, ultimately, only Moscow is willing to give security guarantees to Armenia when it believes it remains vulnerable to other external threats, notably from Turkey, and there continues to be security interdependence between Russia and Armenia. Moscow may also be ready to threaten more direct responses to Armenia if it veers far from Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azerbaijan has sought to diminish Russia’s security leverage, notably through a commitment over several decades to building ties to other military partners (Turkey and Israel). But an equally important element of managing the Russian security threat has been Baku’s decision to eschew EU and NATO integration – a decision taken to a significant degree in light of the lesson of the 2008 Russo-Georgian War that the Euro-Atlantic community is not ready to challenge Russia militarily in the region. To underline that it does not seek to break away completely from Russia, Azerbaijan has sought to identify a positive agenda of alternative policy areas for cooperation with Russia where it can shape a partnership in its interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transport-and-communications&quot;&gt;Transport and Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s most important policy shift regarding the changing political and economic dynamics of the South Caucasus is the new emphasis given to the region as a zone for trade and communications (see Figure 2). The breakdown of ties with the Euro-Atlantic community, the imposition of sanctions and the closing of some markets has effectively forced Russia to reorient its economic policy on a north–south axis, away from the previous east–west axis. Moscow’s efforts to reorient its external economic relations, as part of the wider shift in its foreign and security relations brought about by the Ukraine war, are already having significant results, as trade along a north–south axis, notably with Iran and India, has increased substantially in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the key project for Russia is the International North–South Transit Corridor (INSTC), a series of rail, ship and road routes connecting Russia to Iran and its Gulf ports and beyond, to South and East Asia. The most promising route goes through Azerbaijan, the only country that borders both Russia and Iran, and which already has a railway connecting Russia and Iran. While the INSTC has been on the drawing board since 2005, it has gained new impetus since the war in Ukraine and Western efforts to isolate Russia economically. In May 2023, Russia and Iran agreed to complete, by 2027, the construction of a railway from the Iran–Azerbaijan border, at Astara, to Rasht in northern Iran, which represents the last missing rail link to connect St Petersburg to the Gulf. Realisation of the INSTC is a strategic goal for Moscow, supported by Iran and India, but Russia is likely to be the main funder of any new infrastructure, in view of its pressing need to bypass Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on connectivity in the South Caucasus is giving Russia a new direction for its security policy. Russia is aiming to assert a security role in the South Caucasus transport network to unblock the regional transport network on its terms and, thereby, provide Moscow with important regional leverage. For this reason, the Zangezur Corridor has become a particular focus for Russian diplomacy and a key interest in the wider Armenia–Azerbaijan peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing provisions on Russian security personnel managing the land corridor in the 2020 Armenia–Azerbaijan ceasefire agreement brokered by Moscow, the Kremlin insists on its presence along the corridor. If it were able to exert influence on the region’s transport networks, Moscow would gain new leverage over the countries of the South Caucasus, including Georgia, which currently is the main axis for north–south trade. Russia has sought to channel negotiations on transport links into the 2021 tripartite commission on this issue that it convenes with Armenia and Azerbaijan, and into key bilateral formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pivot-to-azerbaijan-monitoring-georgia&quot;&gt;Pivot to Azerbaijan, Monitoring Georgia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third key component of Moscow’s evolving policy towards the South Caucasus is a deepened partnership with Baku. Azerbaijan has emerged as the leading regional state as a result of its military successes against Armenia, its ability to build a latticework of external partners, and its balancing policy towards Russia. Indeed, Azerbaijan is now essential for Russia in terms of energy exports and its transport links to Iran. The Kremlin has stressed that Azerbaijan is a “stable” partner in the region, and has spoken of the bilateral relationship in warm terms as having an “alliance” character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azerbaijan has been able to use its newfound regional leverage to bypass Russia’s efforts to manipulate regional conflicts – ignoring Russia’s demands over Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers, and sidelining Moscow’s role in mediating the Armenia–Azerbaijan relationship – all while maintaining a degree of support for Ukraine. But Baku has lined up behind Russia on Moscow’s interests where they largely align with those of Azerbaijan. Together with Russia, Azerbaijan has been critical of Armenia’s efforts to reach out to the Euro-Atlantic community, and it has opposed the deployment of an EU border-monitoring mission to the region. Azerbaijan is also publicly supporting Russia’s position on transport corridors across Armenia, even if there are suspicions that Baku would also be keen to leave Russia out of the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Azerbaijan is now Russia’s main regional partner, Moscow is paying close attention to contemporary developments within Georgia. Since the Rose Revolution, Georgia has been the anchor of the Euro-Atlantic community’s regional engagement, and in 2023, the EU granted Tbilisi candidate status. However, despite movement on some bureaucratic processes, the integration of Georgia into the Euro-Atlantic community has been effectively frozen following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, reflecting the reluctance of the US and its European allies to challenge directly Moscow’s security commitment to Abkhazia and South Ossetia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the Georgian Dream political party – established and led by the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili – entered government in Tbilisi in 2012, Georgia has followed a twin-track policy of seeking to advance NATO and EU memberships while also pursuing a policy of gradual normalisation with Moscow. With Euro-Atlantic integration unable to make real progress and with the turn to increasingly authoritarian domestic politics in Georgia in recent years, the relationship between Tbilisi, Washington and Brussels has deteriorated significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the normalisation process with Russia has continued, even in the difficult context of the war in Ukraine. While there is little evidence that Russia has driven the breakdown in ties between Georgia and the Euro-Atlantic community, Moscow has opportunistically sought to benefit. The Georgian government has also given the impression that it is ready to move closer to Moscow if the US and Europe continue to set democracy and human rights conditions that are unacceptable to Georgian Dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the October 2024 parliamentary elections were seen as a critical test of Georgia’s future. With Georgian Dream claiming victory in the disputed elections, relations with the Euro-Atlantic community appear set to deteriorate further. Following the election, the US and European countries called for an investigation into how it was conducted and, in particular, the steps taken ahead of the vote by the ruling party to ensure its victory. US President Joe Biden publicly raised concerns about the decline of democracy in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, having offered ahead of the election to facilitate Georgia’s territorial disputes as a means to promote support for Georgian Dream, Moscow will need to demonstrate that it can deliver progress on a new relationship between Georgia and the two breakaway regions that will satisfy Tbilisi. Given Moscow’s strategic investment in the nominal independence of these regions, the prospects of significant shifts over the status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are, however, slim, likely placing an important check on how far Russia–Georgia rapprochement can advance. The Georgian government may well move closer to Russia to test Moscow’s offer, but is likely to continue to pursue multi-alignment in its foreign and security policies rather than joining Russia’s regional organisations such as the CSTO or the EAEU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-and-trade-relations&quot;&gt;Economic and Trade Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an economic actor, Russia remains vital for the countries of the South Caucasus. Indeed, sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine have strengthened interdependence between Russia (and, via the EAEU, Belarus and Central Asia) and the countries of the region. The Ukraine war is having far-reaching impacts on the geo-economics of the South Caucasus, with the region’s role as an energy and trade corridor becoming even more significant, notably for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia serves as an example for Moscow of how – despite the political tensions between the two governments over the occupied territories – economic cooperation has a positive impact on relations. Indeed, trade with Russia has continued to be strong in recent years. Since 2021, Georgia’s economic dependence on Russia has increased, with some sectors reliant on the Russian market. For example, in 2023, wine exports to Russia increased 5% on the previous year, with the Russian market taking 65% of Georgian wine exports, the highest level since 2013. Although there is widespread Georgian public distrust and even hostility to Russia, views on closer economic relations are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Armenia, despite the political rhetoric about souring ties, economic relations continue to flourish, with a notable rise in exports following the onset of the Ukraine war – widely seen as a result of Armenia (alongside Georgia) becoming a route to Russia for goods that avoided sanctions. Russia is Armenia’s largest trading partner, with an overall foreign trade volume in 2023 of more than 35% and notably 49.6% of Armenia’s imports coming from Russia. In 2022, the volume of trade between Armenia and Russia nearly doubled, a trend that continued through 2023 and the first months of 2024. In 2023, Russia’s over 35% share of the country’s foreign trade contrasted with the EU’s 13%. Russian companies also have considerable investments in Armenia, notably owning key parts of the energy sector and the railways, and make a substantial contribution through taxes to the national budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Azerbaijan, which has sought to diversity its economic as well as security policy, economic ties with Russia are following a similar trajectory to its neighbours. In 2023, trade between Azerbaijan and Moscow was reported to have risen by 17.5%. Bilateral energy trade has also developed in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cooperation-with-regional-powers&quot;&gt;Cooperation with Regional Powers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would appear that Russia has implicitly accepted that it can no longer maintain primacy in the South Caucasus and that other, notably regional, powers will have roles. The Russian regionalisation policy aims at intensifying dialogue, coordination and interaction with the main regional powers engaged in the South Caucasus. Moscow has, however, tried to maintain a regional leadership position through seeking to manage informal cooperation – and competition – with Turkey and Iran. Iran has become a key ally for Russia on the international stage and both countries share an interest in developing closer ties and north–south trade links. On 25 December 2023, the EAEU signed a free-trade agreement with Iran that will eliminate customs duties on almost 90% of goods, thereby linking Russia’s regional economic integration initiative to its efforts to build a wider bloc of friendly countries beyond the post-Soviet space. While Turkey and Russia cooperate and compete in various theatres (often articulated through tactical alliances), including in the South Caucasus, they share an interest in establishing a new regional strategic equilibrium around a potential peace settlement of the Armenia–Azerbaijan confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutionally, Russia supports the 3 + 3 South Caucasus Regional Cooperation Platform format, which sets the stage for the direct participation of Iran and Turkey in determining the future of the region – although Georgia has, to date, boycotted the grouping. Speaking at the October 2024 meeting of the 3 + 3 format, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated that Armenia and Azerbaijan should use the platform to negotiate their peace agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-armeniaazerbaijan-peace-settlement&quot;&gt;The Armenia–Azerbaijan Peace Settlement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resolution of the bitter Armenia–Azerbaijan relationship through a peace agreement and subsequent process of normalisation stands at the centre of the potential transformation of the South Caucasus. Agreement between Baku and Yerevan would open the region for investment in transport, trade, energy and communications projects, unlock closed borders, and create some of the conditions for Armenia–Turkey normalisation. The nature of an agreement would also have a profound impact on the balance of power within the South Caucasus. For these reasons, the negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan have become a focus of external actors, with Russia, the EU (notably France and Germany) and the US jockeying for influence and a role in the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Azerbaijan’s victory in its two military campaigns in 2020 and 2023 to reclaim the occupied territories and the Nagorno-Karabakh region, Russia’s previous leverage around the protracted conflict collapsed as the OSCE Minsk Group process (the diplomatic mechanism established in 1992 to facilitate negotiations to end the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh under the co-chairmanship of the US, Russia and France) was marginalised, Moscow’s leverage as the leading arms supplier to both sides evaporated, and Baku sought to move negotiations between different formats and ultimately to push successfully for direct bilateral Armenia–Azerbaijan contacts as the way forward to exclude third parties (principally Russia, the US and the EU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the departure of Russian “peacekeepers” from Nagorno-Karabakh in April 2024, as well as pressure on the Russian relationship with Armenia, Moscow’s ability to use security to shape developments on the ground has been undermined. Instead, it has sought to reposition itself diplomatically to shape developments so that an eventual peace agreement would also serve Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s goals have been to ensure that Russia has a central role in any agreements about the future shape and management of land transport and communications infrastructure in the South Caucasus, that the Euro-Atlantic community is marginalised, and that the region’s immediate neighbours (Russia, Turkey and Iran) emerge as the key regional arbiters – with Moscow in the lead role. Russia has sought to insert itself into the key issue of a transport corridor across Armenia and to ensure that the INSTC, which is vital to its ability to build economic and trade links to the south, goes ahead. Moscow views a role in these areas as critical to ensuring its regional influence, notably in the Armenia–Azerbaijan relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Azerbaijan has become central to Russia’s efforts to advance this agenda – notably as the transatlantic community has increasingly aligned to support Armenia, leading to growing tensions with Baku. In August 2024, the visit of Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu to Baku underlined how the variety of Russian regional interests are now being channelled through the bilateral relationship. In a meeting with President Aliyev, Shoigu highlighted the intersection of the peace negotiations, the development of the INSTC and the future agenda of the 3 + 3 format to manage the stabilisation of the South Caucasus, with efforts to prevent Western “meddling” in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-russia-retying-the-caucasian-knot&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Russia Retying the Caucasian Knot?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the past two hundred years, Russia has pursued relatively stable strategic goals in relation to the South Caucasus region. At the core, Russia has focused on binding the region to itself, as a buffer zone against external encroachment. In more expansionist foreign policy phases, such as since the turn of the 21st century under Putin, the region has been seen as integral to ambitions to extend Russia’s influence and control in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions, as well as the Middle East. At such times, the territories and peoples of the South Caucasus have also often been viewed by Moscow as part of a wider Russian world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the South Caucasus undergoing a transformation, notably as result of geopolitical and geo-economic trends towards multipolarity, Russia’s regional role is displaying elements of continuity, but is increasingly characterised by change. Much of the analysis of the region sees Russia as experiencing a “managed decline” or loss of hegemony because of this process of change. The analysis in this paper, however, points to a different conclusion. Moscow is attempting to refashion its position through a renewed regional approach – seeking to retie the Caucasian knot to ensure a continuing central role for Russia in the South Caucasus, retain close links to countries in the region, and marginalise the Euro-Atlantic community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, geopolitical competition with the Euro-Atlantic community in the region has been the key challenge to Russia’s ability to achieve its longstanding strategic goals. In this struggle, the Kremlin has deployed security policy as Russia’s trump card. Up until 2020, it was customary to assume that Russia’s goal in the South Caucasus was to use its security advantage to preserve a favourable status quo. Moscow’s current policy towards the region reflects a shift in some respects from this approach and indicates a changed significance of the South Caucasus in Russia’s strategic calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow has recognised that the changes in the international politics of the South Caucasus towards multipolarity have provided opportunities for the countries in the region to pursue policies of multi-alignment. This has meant that Russia can no longer approach the region as though it remains part of the post-Soviet space where it has an exclusive role, and some of its past policy levers have lost traction – notably in respect to the Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict. At the same time, the breakdown of ties with Europe and the US has forced Moscow to seek to reorient its foreign and economic ties south and east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia now looks on the South Caucasus not just as a buffer against the Euro-Atlantic community and a means to strengthen its power projection ambitions in the Black Sea and the Middle East, but also as a vital link to Iran, as well as the location of potential southern routes to access markets and build political and security ties across Eurasia. Russia is therefore rebalancing and realigning its policies to continue to be a central regional player in the South Caucasus, even if this requires a shift from its previous reliance on security policy and the ambition to exclude other external powers from the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow is today willing to accommodate and even cooperate with other international actors, notably Iran, China and even Turkey, in the South Caucasus, and it has also adapted by developing new and varied bilateral ties with the three South Caucasian states to shape the regional agenda, particularly on economic and transport issues. However, the Kremlin remains focused on blocking Euro-Atlantic integration efforts in the region, and is willing to work with other regional powers to advance this goal. Indeed, Moscow is now looking to develop its new approach in the South Caucasus as part of a larger Eurasian security initiative, driven, together with China, Iran and other partners, as a counter-West bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow is also experiencing real challenges in forging a new approach to the South Caucasus. It is having to contend with an increasingly complex region in which not only is there a diversity of other, often competitive, external actors, but also the governments of the region have a new degree of agency in developing their foreign relationships. As a result, Moscow is facing resistance to its efforts to insert itself within the central issues that could reshape the regional order, notably the Armenia–Azerbaijan peace agreement and the associated initiatives to open the region’s transport network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with the prospect of being marginalised from the peace process, Putin made a rare state visit to Baku in August 2024 to promote Moscow’s regional role. The visit was marked by positive words, photo opportunities and commitments to cooperation (notably on the INSTC). Putin appeared, however, unable to reverse the steps that have seen Russia pushed out from its former regional role. Critically, since the early 1990s, Russia – together with the US and Europe – has been at the centre of diplomatic efforts to resolve the Armenia–Azerbaijan conflict. Since 2020 and the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, Baku has, however, managed to exclude major third parties from discussions, even turning to Kazakhstan to host peace negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his visit to Baku, Putin indicated, with a degree of desperation, that he would “be happy” to serve as a regional peacemaker, but neither Baku nor Yerevan has responded positively. At the same time, the decision of Armenia and Azerbaijan to exclude the issue of the Zangezur Corridor from discussions on a peace agreement struck a direct blow to Moscow’s efforts to reinsert itself between the two countries, leading to further, unsuccessful Russian diplomatic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s South Caucasus policies are thus at a key moment. Moscow has recognised the importance of the shifts taking place in the region and is taking action to try to ensure that it remains a key regional player. Despite the advantages that Russia has as a consequence of history and geography and the country’s strong security policies, it is nevertheless facing a struggle to reposition itself in the South Caucasus. There is a real prospect that the Kremlin’s efforts to forge a renewed regional role may prove unsuccessful, and Moscow may emerge from the process of realignment a significantly reduced regional force. The high-level political engagement in the region, notably signalled by Putin’s visit to Baku, suggests, however, that the Kremlin is prepared to commit significant political capital to ensure that Russia remains a leading regional actor, and to show that Moscow is not ready to accept a diminished role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-the-euro-atlantic-community&quot;&gt;Implications for the Euro-Atlantic Community&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing geopolitics of the South Caucasus and Russia’s shifting regional approach pose a challenge for the Euro-Atlantic community. Over the past two decades, the prospect of eventual EU and NATO integration has been the main policy framework to build support and attract regional states. The approach marries values – in support of human rights, rule of law and democratisation – with a geopolitical approach to counter Russia and its integration offer, notably through access to European markets and financial assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2008, Moscow has, however, been able to thwart Euro-Atlantic integration through its dominance of regional security politics. Unwilling to challenge Russia’s security trump card, the Euro-Atlantic community has officially followed an open-door policy for NATO and EU membership for Georgia, and maintained a readiness to advance ties to Azerbaijan and Armenia if there is an opportunity. In reality, the EU and NATO tracks have effectively been stalled, even in the case of Georgia, which has been at the forefront of building ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With shifts in the international politics of the South Caucasus, a policy built on “strategic patience” is well past its expiry date. The changes that have affected the South Caucasus have shifted the region from being an exclusively European security region, as it was in the decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, to one increasingly linked to the Middle East, South Asia and China. The countries of the South Caucasus now have alternative partners to the Euro-Atlantic community (and Russia), notably for trade, infrastructure investment and business, but also for the supply of weapons and for diplomatic ties. While these ties may lack the potential of Euro-Atlantic integration, they offer immediate and tangible gains, especially in comparison to the promise of a bright future of EU and NATO membership that never seems to quite arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The links to other external actors generally also come without the formal conditionality attached by the Euro-Atlantic community. The development of multipolarity has, in this way, reinforced the ability of local elites to advance illiberalism. As a result, Russian-style authoritarian politics has taken hold in Georgia and is consolidated in Azerbaijan, while democratisation remains fragile and vulnerable in Armenia. With this shift, the idea that the region will become part of the Euro-Atlantic community through eventual EU and NATO membership looks unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents a dilemma for the Euro-Atlantic community: either continue to criticise non-democratic governments and risk them shifting orientation to Russia and others, or try to retain engagement but then face working with regimes that do not reflect Western values. In either option, Euro-Atlantic integration will struggle to advance. In recent years, Georgia has represented this challenge most starkly. The adoption of increasingly antidemocratic practices by Georgian Dream, the ruling party, and the cultivation of a diversity of external ties have seen a withdrawal of Euro-Atlantic security and economic support. After decades of effort to advance Tbilisi as the key Euro-Atlantic partner in the South Caucasus, Georgia was largely absent from the Washington NATO Summit Communique in 2024. An EU report on Georgia’s progress towards membership that appeared immediately after the October 2024 election appeared to indicate that the membership process was effectively frozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Euro-Atlantic position has weakened in Georgia, there has been an effort to pivot to Armenia, including supplying security assistance and even military equipment. This will add little to Armenia’s overall defence and deterrence, but the shift risks being seen as taking sides within the region, further accelerating the militarisation of the South Caucasus and contributing to the emergence of a new round of internal divisions just as the prospects of a new regional settlement are emerging. In any case, Armenia’s prospects for Euro-Atlantic integration will be constrained by the same developments that have affected the other countries of the region – Russia’s readiness to use its range of policies, and centrally its willingness to use security and military tools, to prevent Euro-Atlantic enlargement, and the appearance of attractive alternative international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks for the Euro-Atlantic community of failing to find an effective means of engagement in the region are highlighted by Azerbaijan. Having turned away from Euro-Atlantic integration, Baku has been able to consolidate its authoritarian political order and reclaim the occupied territories and Nagorno-Karabakh, employing approaches that have led to ethnic cleansing. Euro-Atlantic actors appear largely powerless regarding either development. Indeed, Europe has been keen to develop closer energy and transport links to Azerbaijan, even as Baku has followed this domestic and foreign policy course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Euro-Atlantic community must now look at the emerging regional realities and craft a regional policy capable of influencing contemporary developments. Given the broader confrontation with Russia, weakening Moscow’s presence in the South Caucasus and disrupting its efforts to rebuild a new regional position for itself should be at the heart of a regional strategy for the Euro-Atlantic community. A key emphasis should be on countering Moscow’s efforts to position itself in the regional trade and communications infrastructure to support its war effort and reinforce its strategic partnership with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of Western policy should be on strengthening the sovereignty and independence of regional states and their ability to balance Russia through multi-alignment (in which context the Euro-Atlantic community can remain a leading partner), and to undermine Russia’s efforts to control them or to shepherd them into regional and international formats (such as the 3 + 3 and the BRICS) that exclude Europe and the US. This approach should also include supporting and investing in projects such as the Middle Corridor that will help economic diversification and promote external investment, while seeking to constrain projects that strengthen the Russia–Iran north–south axis and enable Moscow to reshape regional trade and transport around its own agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the Armenia–Azerbaijan peace process, including measures to build trust and confidence to overcome the legacy of conflict, will be critical, as this agreement is central to opening the region. To play such a role, the Euro-Atlantic community will need to be more effective in balancing its approaches with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Rebuilding a political relationship with Baku, which is increasingly the regional agenda-setter, to go beyond energy cooperation will be a necessary step to balance Moscow–Baku ties. If peace can be achieved, there will also be opportunities to advance regional cooperation among the South Caucasus countries, which Russia has effectively undercut to date, and which can help to balance Moscow’s policies by strengthening regional balancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While domestic political forces more favourable to the West may re-emerge in the countries of the South Caucasus, the geopolitical and geo-economic context in the region militates against the Euro-Atlantic integration model regaining traction, with its interdependent security, normative and economic elements. Russia has begun to adapt its approach to the South Caucasus as the region undergoes change, and so must the West. Support for democracy and human rights should be pursued, where realistic, but its prioritisation will need to be balanced with the geopolitical imperative of building relationships to counter Russia and its major allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing coordination with Turkey on regional issues should be a priority. Ankara is continuing to strengthen its South Caucasus interests and engagement as part of a broader strategy reaching to Central Asia and across the Black Sea. An opening of the South Caucasus would inevitably see an even greater Turkish presence. As a NATO member, Turkey is uniquely placed to strengthen regional security that aligns with the wider interests of the Euro-Atlantic community, if common cause can be promoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a readiness to adapt, the Euro-Atlantic community is likely to face a growing regional marginalisation and the prospect that Russia will be able to reposition itself, while the countries of the South Caucasus are likely to be drawn increasingly into regional and international groupings that exclude the US and Europe. To challenge Russia effectively and to rebuild regional influence, the Euro-Atlantic community will need to recalibrate its policies and move beyond approaches that have lost the ability to shape regional developments effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will involve difficult trade-offs, including working with non-democratic regimes. It will also mean being ready to acknowledge that the South Caucasus is unlikely to be part of a wider Europe, and so should be approached through the sort of foreign and security policy frameworks that are applied to other such parts of the world, rather than through integration. While such a shift will be challenging, Russia is at a uniquely vulnerable moment in the South Caucasus as the region undergoes far-reaching change. Although Russia is already active in repairing its position, the Euro-Atlantic community nevertheless has an opportunity to help facilitate a regional realignment that could substantially constrain Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

To help address for this threat, the Project on Nuclear Issues invited a group of experts to develop competing strategies for responding to strategic deterrence failure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;heather-williams-reja-younis-and-lachlan-mackenzie&quot;&gt;Heather Williams, Reja Younis, and Lachlan MacKenzie&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing risk that the United States and its allies could face scenarios in which one or more adversaries might resort to nuclear weapons use in a regional conflict. This risk is especially evident in Russian strategic theory and doctrine, which envisions regional deterrence as complementing global deterrence. Some Russian military experts see the potential use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons for “de-escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions favorable to the Russian Federation,” or “a demonstration to the enemy of resolve to defend [Russia’s] interests by escalating the use of nuclear weapons (tactical) and forcing him to forego further aggression by the threat of use of strategic nuclear weapons.” Statements by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un indicate that the country’s nuclear arsenal is also intended for deterrence in a regional conflict, such as a potential decapitation strike. Moreover, China has been rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal for both military reasons and to gain geopolitical leverage, as argued by Tong Zhao, such as upholding its “core interests” in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to these growing risks of regional crisis escalation with potential for nuclear use, U.S. decisionmakers are revisiting the concept of intra-war deterrence, which is about influencing enemy actions during an ongoing conflict. The risks of deterrence failure have been a focal point in the testimony of recent U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM) commanders, including Admiral Charles Richard, who noted in 2020 that STRATCOM conducted analysis into the risks of strategic deterrence failure, and General Anthony Cotton, who said, “We must be ready if deterrence fails” in testimony in February 2024. Intra-war deterrence operates on the premise that in an active conflict, threats can be leveraged to shape an adversary’s actions and set boundaries on the intensity and nature of military engagement. This concept underpinned much Cold War strategic thinking. One fundamental challenge of intra-war deterrence is how to balance deterrence objectives with war-fighting objectives. As W. Andrew Terrill writes regarding the mismatch of these objectives, “a state pursuing such [an intra-war] policy is waging war against another nation while seeking to prevent its opponent from responding with all of the weapons that it possesses. Such a task is . . . challenging since both sides usually seek to use as much of their capabilities as possible to optimize their chances of victory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist in this thinking and to develop actionable insights for the U.S. policy and strategy communities, the Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) invited a group of experts to develop competing strategies for responding to strategic deterrence failure. This study revives a concept and approach that the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) developed a decade ago to review U.S. nuclear strategy and posture for 2025–2050. The project’s current contributors were each asked to respond to a scenario involving near-simultaneous battlefield nuclear use by Russia and China. The strategies focused on four specific themes: strategic objectives, assurance to allies, military responses, and non-kinetic responses. The strategies demonstrate agreement on key issues, such as the importance of deterring conventional aggression and the relevance of non-kinetic responses to adversary nuclear use. But the strategies also highlight important areas of disagreement about the relative importance and feasibility of assuring allies, at least relative to other strategic objectives; the advisability of a nuclear versus conventional response to deterrence failure; and what “winning” in a strategic deterrence failure scenario would look like. While many people may disagree with these positions, PONI welcomes a diverse range of views, which can help foster a robust debate. CSIS does not take an institutional view, and the views presented here are those of the individual contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After providing an overview of the authors’ competing strategies, this chapter presents the project’s guiding assumptions and analytic framework. This introductory analysis then distills three principles for intra-war deterrence: establishing (or maintaining) regional deterrence, restoring assurance, and planning precrisis for intra-war deterrence. These principles capture areas of consensus among the strategies while also engaging with areas of disagreement in order to identify which policy options are best suited for the current strategic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competing-strategies-for-intra-war-deterrence&quot;&gt;Competing Strategies for Intra-War Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a foundation for Project Atom’s analysis, PONI provided the authors a scenario that features concurrent nuclear aggression from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia. The scenario, set in 2027, is predicated on the following assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin remain the leaders of the PRC and Russia, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PRC and Russia have not relinquished their territorial claims — that is, the PRC continues to pursue “reunification” with Taiwan, and Russia maintains its claims on annexed Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine continues as a stalemate. Western aid for Ukraine continues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western sanctions damage the Russian economy and drive continued economic cooperation between Russia and the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia manages to partially rebuild its conventional military despite low GDP growth, related financial challenges, and ongoing fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PRC GDP growth stabilizes between 3 and 4 percent, compared to the United States’ approximately 2 percent. The two economies remain deeply intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies proceed with their planned defense modernization and preparedness efforts. The United States forward deploys additional forces to Europe and the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By March 2027 in this scenario, Taiwan’s domestic political landscape has shifted decisively against reunification. In response to pro-independence statements from Taiwanese presidential candidates, PRC officials begin to publicly discuss using military force to achieve reunification. In the ensuing weeks, the U.S. intelligence community observes the beginnings of a PRC military buildup in Fujian Province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as this buildup, Xi and Putin host a summit at which Putin voices support for the PRC’s position on Taiwan. The two leaders announce joint naval drills in the Pacific to coincide with Russian conventional and nuclear exercises near Russia’s Western borders in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for what they consider an imminent threat, the United States and its allies signal that “wars of conquest will be punished” and bolster their defensive postures through expanded forward deployments and elevated readiness levels in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. In the weeks preceding the joint PRC-Russian exercise, a Ukrainian offensive makes significant gains and threatens Russian control of Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 14, the joint PRC-Russian naval exercise begins in the Western Pacific. The following day, the PRC begins missile strikes on Taiwan in preparation for a full-scale invasion. On May 16, Russia conducts conventional missile strikes against Polish transportation infrastructure. Xi and Putin release statements justifying their own actions and supporting the other’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO promptly invokes Article 5, and the United States and its allies begin highly successful conventional campaigns against the PRC and Russia. In the Indo-Pacific, U.S. and allied forces interdict PRC landing craft before they reach Taiwan. Heavy People’s Liberation Army (PLA) casualties prompt limited anti-mobilization protests across China. In Europe, Polish and Lithuanian forces push into Kaliningrad Oblast and threaten to seize Kaliningrad City. NATO states begin to deploy forces to Ukraine, while Ukrainian forces advance with NATO assistance and prepare for an invasion of Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 2, Russia strikes Polish transportation infrastructure and NATO forces threatening Kaliningrad with low-yield (&amp;lt; 10 kt) nuclear weapons, inflicting approximately 1,000 casualties (including some Americans). Putin warns NATO of “total annihilation” if it does not cease its “aggression.” On June 3, the PRC conducts a 50 kt nuclear strike on a U.S. naval base in the Philippines, resulting in 15,000 casualties. Xi Jinping warns that “Anyone aiding the splitists in Taiwan . . . will face the wrath of a people determined to rejuvenate their nation at any cost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comparing-strategies-for-intra-war-deterrence&quot;&gt;Comparing Strategies for Intra-War Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PONI team provided experts with four framing assumptions and respective guiding questions as an analytical framework, which are discussed later in this introduction. This report contains five chapters, each of which constitutes a distinct strategy for intra-war deterrence. A comparison of the strategies across the analytical framework is provided in Tables 1–4; discussion of the framing assumptions then follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;framing-assumptions&quot;&gt;Framing Assumptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption #1:&lt;/strong&gt; In the event that strategic deterrence fails and an adversary has used a single or multiple nuclear weapons, the United States will be forced to confront competing priorities to uphold security commitments to allies, manage further escalation, and resolve the conflict on terms favorable to the United States. The adversaries may assume they have more at stake in a regional crisis than the United States and thereby question U.S. resolve. This raises the following questions with regard to U.S. strategic objectives in the event of strategic deterrence failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In what ways, if any, did the United States fail to demonstrate resolve and commitment to its strategic objectives in the lead-up to nuclear use? Why did deterrence fail? Could anything have been done to prevent strategic deterrence failure?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the United States’ core objectives in this scenario, and how should the United States prioritize its strategic objectives? Is one area of operations more important than another in this scenario?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What does “winning” look like? How would the United States know if deterrence has been “restored”?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying and prioritizing strategic objectives will be critical following adversary nuclear use, and this will require understanding why deterrence failed. Authors reached different conclusions on this point. Ford, on one hand, concludes that deterrence failed because of adversary perceptions about U.S. credibility that had built up over years. He argues that there may have been nothing that U.S. policymakers could have done to deter adversary aggression in the immediate run-up to the crisis. Panda, on the other hand, points to the swift defeat of adversary conventional forces as a primary driver of escalation, adding that the adversary may believe that limited nuclear use can deter the United States from further involvement. Weaver suggests that the United States may have failed to credibly signal its resolve to defend its allies and partners but acknowledges that deterrence failure may have alternatively stemmed from adversary miscalculations about their abilities to fight and win conventional conflicts against the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the authors agree about the importance of avoiding full-scale nuclear war following deterrence failure, they disagree about the relevance and prioritization of other strategic objectives. Sisson, for example, identifies only two U.S. strategic objectives: preventing general nuclear war and preventing further nuclear detonations of any type in any location. Similarly, Panda writes that “no objective should be greater for the president of the United States than ensuring that the survival of the country is not threatened by the prospect of uncontrollable escalation into a general nuclear war.” Ford and Gibbons also both list avoiding nuclear war as the primary U.S. objective but identify a range of secondary strategic objectives, including denying the adversary battlefield victory, denying the adversary any advantage specifically from having used nuclear weaponry, and maintaining alliance relationships. Conversely, Weaver lists four strategic objectives: (1) restoring the territorial status quo ante; (2) restoring nuclear deterrence; (3) avoiding general nuclear war; and (4) denying the adversary any benefit from nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ASSURING ALLIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption #2:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States will remain committed to allies’ security and their vital national interests in the event of strategic deterrence failure. For example, if NATO Article 5 is invoked, the United States will respond. Therefore, at least one U.S. objective (from above) will be continuing to assure and demonstrate credibility and resolve to allies. Partners, however, remain in a somewhat ambiguous position in the event of direct military attacks or nuclear strikes. This raises the following questions with regard to allies and partners in the event of strategic deterrence failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the risks — and their likelihoods and potential consequences — of allies questioning U.S. credibility in the event of strategic deterrence failure?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What will be allies’ security concerns in the event of strategic deterrence failure? What role might certain allies and partners play in a response?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How can the United States signal resolve to allies in the event of strategic deterrence failure? How does this differ from signaling resolve to non-treaty partners?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on their differing assessments about the most pressing U.S. strategic objectives, the authors disagree about the importance and feasibility of assuring allies following adversary nuclear use. Panda argues that, given that any U.S. president is likely to prioritize protecting the U.S. homeland above all, severe damage to U.S. credibility is a forgone conclusion in the event of strategic deterrence failure. He writes that the United States would face “insurmountable” assurance and credibility challenges following nuclear use and that “it is highly likely that following strategic deterrence failure, allied perceptions of the credibility of the United States would suffer drastically.” Sisson suggests that the defense of Ukraine and Taiwan should be a primary U.S. war aim but maintains that avoiding further nuclear use of any type should be the United States’ first objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford, Gibbons, and Weaver, on the other hand, argue that assuring allies should be one of the United States’ primary strategic objectives. Ford and Gibbons both suggest that a nuclear response to deterrence failure is not necessary to reassure allies. Ford writes that the United States is not obligated to use any specific weapons in defense of its allies, as long as it does effectively defend them against aggression. He also argues that that, on the facts of the scenario, “continuing to prosecute a successful conventional campaign” and deny the adversary any benefits from nuclear weapons use “should represent an optimal answer from U.S. allies’ perspectives.” Weaver offers that the U.S. response that deters further aggression while avoiding uncontrollable escalation will be the optimal response from an allied perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MILITARY RESPONSE OPTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption #3:&lt;/strong&gt; The president will consider a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic response options in the event of strategic deterrence failure. Options might include the use — or explicit threatened use — of nuclear weapons, naval deployments, or boots on the ground. This raises the following questions with regard to military response options in the event of deterrence failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would be the president’s military options in the event of strategic deterrence failure? Which of these options would you recommend to the president?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the risks associated with a military response?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the signaling objectives of military response options? How will these options contribute to conflict termination on terms favorable to the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the event of strategic deterrence failure, how strictly should the United States observe the law of armed conflict (i.e., principles of proportionality and discrimination)? How much should it influence the strategy?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the authors agree on the need for some form of military response to adversary nuclear use, their proposed responses differ significantly. Panda, Ford, and Gibbons each recommend conventional responses to adversary nuclear use. Gibbons and Panda endorse conventional strikes against the adversaries’ forces that were directly responsible for nuclear strikes against U.S. partners and allies. Though he argues that the United States needs to be prepared to use nuclear weapons if the adversaries were to use them again, Ford suggests that U.S. and allied forces should “fight through” adversary nuclear use here and continue their already successful conventional campaigns with slight changes in posture to better prepare for the possibility of further adversary nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaver is the only author to propose a nuclear response. He concludes that a conventional response would be problematic for several reasons, including that it may simply encourage adversaries to escalate further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sisson proposes the most restrained response to adversary nuclear use. She suggests that, to avoid further escalation, U.S. and allied forces should cease offensive military operations and look instead to hold the line against further adversary aggression and rely on non-kinetic options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NON-KINETIC RESPONSE OPTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption #4:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. political and military leadership would consider non-kinetic response options across the diplomacy-information-military-economics (DIME) spectrum. Many of these capabilities might overlap across domains, and the authors were given discretion to decide what are military versus diplomatic, information, economic, or other non-kinetic response options. Possibilities such as economic sanctions, building international pressure, or information operations would likely be part of the U.S. response to a strategic deterrence failure. This raises the following questions with regard to non-kinetic response options in the event of deterrence failure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What would be the president’s non-kinetic options in the event of strategic deterrence failure? Which of these options would you recommend to the president?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the risks associated with a non-kinetic response?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are signaling objectives of non-kinetic response options? How will these options contribute to conflict termination on terms favorable to the United States?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors generally agreed about the importance of non-kinetic measures in responding to adversary nuclear use. One area of commonality was the importance of non-kinetic deterrence efforts prior to nuclear use during the crisis. Most suggested some form of information warfare or targeted messaging to accompany their proposed military responses, as well as non-kinetic military measures and economic retaliation. Weaver, for example, proposes information operations to maximize international backlash to adversary nuclear use and convince the Russian and Chinese people that their governments’ actions risk large-scale nuclear war, as well as measures to impose economic costs on Russia and China. Ford, Gibbons, Sisson, and Panda each suggest cyberattacks against adversary forces, as well as economic retaliation. Moreover, Gibbons, Sisson, and Panda advocate for diplomatic messaging to the international community to build a coalition condemning Russian and Chinese nuclear use. Panda proposes intelligence declassification as a tool to counter adversaries’ information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;three-principles-for-intra-war-deterrence-in-a-two-peer-environment&quot;&gt;Three Principles for Intra-War Deterrence in a Two-Peer Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the expert papers, the PONI team identified three broad principles for thinking about and planning for intra-war deterrence in a two-peer environment. At the outset, however, it is worth observing that intra-war deterrence is highly context dependent, and many of the recommendations of these papers might not be applicable to other intra-war deterrence scenarios, to include whether to respond with nuclear or conventional weapons and how to assure allies. The stakes will depend on the context. In the scenario provided here, what is at stake is allies’ sovereignty and security and U.S. global leadership, but these must be balanced with the stakes of escalation, which could include further humanitarian consequences depending on whether conventional or nuclear weapons are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTRA-WAR DETERRENCE REQUIRES REGIONAL DETERRENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these scenarios, America’s adversaries are acting on the belief that they have more at stake in the region than the United States. Ford describes the strategic challenge: “Both of these failures [are] likely derived from assumptions in Moscow and Beijing, not that Western leaders lacked the capacity to respond effectively, but that they lacked the will . . . . It is the primary task of intra-war deterrence here to convince them that this, too, was a misapprehension.” As demonstrated by all of the papers in this volume, the United States will need a diverse and flexible tool kit, to include regional nuclear capabilities and conceal/reveal capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While only one of the papers calls for the United States to respond with nuclear weapons, nearly all of the authors acknowledge the importance of the United States having a breadth of nuclear response options. For Panda, this is largely tied to assuring allies because “it is highly likely that following strategic deterrence failure, allied perceptions of the credibility of the United States would suffer drastically unless Washington opted for nuclear use in kind,” although he expresses concerns with risks of escalation. For Ford, amid a conventional response, “U.S. nuclear weapon storage vaults at relevant European airfields should also be readied for potential operations, and any existing plans for weapon dispersal to additional airfields that do not involve actual DCA attack assets should be implemented.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other points make a case for the United States to improve its regional deterrence posture through increased regional capabilities and flexible options in order to prepare for a proportionate nuclear response in a limited-use scenario. U.S. policymakers should strive to diversify U.S. nuclear forces through investments in new regional capabilities so that the president will have a broader range of credible options, particularly if an adversary threatens limited nuclear attacks. The capabilities should be survivable, lower yield, and responsive and effective across a spectrum of targets. Strategic deterrence is, and should remain, the primary mission of the U.S. nuclear force, and the triad is essential to the success of that mission. These capabilities will play a deterrence function not only during a crisis but also beforehand, as argued by Weaver:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the effect of selecting a nonnuclear response to adversary nuclear escalation is to convince the adversary that the United States is so concerned about uncontrolled escalation that it fears responding in kind, then a U.S. nonnuclear response could actually increase the risk of eventual uncontrolled escalation. This may seem counterintuitive, but if a U.S. nonnuclear response to adversary limited nuclear use results in encouraging further adversary nuclear escalation, then the U.S. nuclear responses that may eventually be required to achieve U.S. objectives are likely to be larger in scale and more provocative in their effects. This could well make uncontrolled escalation more likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option for re-establishing deterrence would be relying on conceal/reveal capabilities, such as demonstrating a previously unknown capability amid a crisis to inspire the adversary to exert caution. As described by Weaver, “There is a potential role here for the calculated revelation of capabilities the adversary was previously unaware of that have potentially decisive military effects (‘You didn’t tell me they could do that. What else don’t I know?’).” Conceal/reveal capabilities could also offer U.S. decisionmakers more flexibility in a crisis, as well as having a powerful deterrence impact when needed most to de-escalate a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTORING DETERRENCE REQUIRES RESTORING ASSURANCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As multiple authors identify, a strategic deterrence failure could inspire a crisis of confidence among U.S. allies and partners. While some of the papers in this volume call for reconsidering U.S. security commitments to allies in a crisis, this would be a mistake for both short- and long-term reasons. Amid the ongoing conflict, the United States would need allies to fight through a scenario such as the one outlined in one or both theaters. While Ford argues that the Indo-Pacific theater is the more important of the two, he notes that “a Western loss in the European theater” would still be “a disaster.” For him, “[j]ust as the United States prioritized defending Europe from the Nazis in World War II without backing off against Japan in the Pacific, even if the United States must now prioritize East Asia in certain ways, it should not abandon Europe.” Ford, for example, points to the importance of European allies in leading on conventional fighting and re-establishing deterrence in one theater while the United States focuses on the Indo-Pacific. For Weaver, “If U.S. responses to initial Russian or Chinese escalation make clear that the United States is willing to engage in a competition in dire risk-taking, and that Russia and China must also fear potential uncontrolled escalation, allies are likely to be reassured in the near term.” Over the long term, alliance structures would be an essential component for any eventual peace settlement and post-conflict international order, assuming a U.S. objective is to maintain global leadership, as argued in nearly all of these papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibbons points to an additional value of maintaining and assuring allies: they can play a crucial role in generating international condemnation aimed at deterring further nuclear use by the adversaries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Allies and partners have a significant role to play in the messaging following nuclear use. They must unite in loudly and publicly condemning the nuclear attacks and should do so repeatedly. They should communicate that using nuclear weapons in these scenarios was unacceptable and neither nation will gain from using these weapons. These messages are key to reestablishing the nuclear taboo following nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibbons goes on to make the case for U.S. policymakers to immediately engage the U.S. public on the importance of allies, for example. The United States could also develop an engagement plan for deepening planning and consultations with allies on potential battlefield nuclear use and opportunistic aggression scenarios. A series of mini tabletop exercises could begin familiarizing allied and U.S. government officials across the interagency, including at the Department of State, the National Security Council, and the Department of Defense (including combatant commands) with how deterrence works and how battlefield nuclear use might impact both conventional campaigns and deterrence dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INTRA-WAR DETERRENCE WILL DEPEND ON PRECRISIS PLANNING AND DECISIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, intra-war deterrence will largely depend on precrisis decisions and planning. These comprise decisions and actions taken with adversaries, allies, domestic audiences, and wider international ones. Examples include dialogue with allies about crisis communication and decisionmaking, conceal/reveal capabilities, and establishing thresholds and threats (i.e., do not bluff). There are at least two main areas where the United States can focus on intra-war deterrence planning before a crisis begins: strategic communications, particularly with international audiences, and wargaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaping narratives and messaging before and during crises will be essential. Such messages will need to be tailored to multiple audiences: allies (focusing on assurance), domestic audiences (focused on the importance of U.S. alliances, and in support of achieving U.S. military responses to adversarial limited nuclear use), international audiences (aimed to “make the adversary a pariah,” as Weaver argues), and adversarial domestic audiences (meant to foment a facts-based public consensus). When facing a crisis involving potential limited nuclear use, strategic communication must be multifaceted. Messages must be tailored to diverse audiences (allies, the U.S. public, the international community, adversary leadership, and their citizens) and adapted for each stage of the crisis, including preemptive communication. For example, before a crisis, messages aimed at the U.S. population should focus on the importance of alliances. As Gibbons argues, “Before any potential conflict — and frankly, right now — the U.S. government, especially the president, should aim to better educate the public about the history of U.S. alliance relationships and their benefits.” Precrisis messaging to Americans could also focus, for example, on reassuring the U.S. public about U.S. commitment to deterrence and the limited nature of any potential nuclear response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precrisis engagement with international audiences (particularly the Global South and “non-aligned” states) was raised in several analyses. Gibbons writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasizing here that improving U.S. and allied relations with states within the Global South before this notional conflict in 2027 is paramount. Though the international community broadly supported the 2022 UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine, there have been fewer governments that have unilaterally condemned the attack or Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling, even among members of the Treaty on the Prohibition on Nuclear Weapons, a treaty that explicitly bans nuclear threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second priority for precrisis intra-war deterrence will be more wargaming. One way to address this challenge is with more wargames through all stages of escalation, as highlighted in Weaver’s paper in particular. But Sisson also writes, “Each phase of a scenario exercises the thought processes involved in aligning military operations with war aims, and war aims with strategic objectives, under conditions in which some variables that might affect the likelihood of success are foreseeable and controllable and some are not.” Variations of these aims, objectives, and conditions can be explored through wargaming or other exercising. One particular scenario that would be worth exploring is coordination among allies, which is somewhat ambiguous in the scenario used for this study. Even with additional gaming and empirical data, however, there will be limits on knowledge about what happens after nuclear use and how to re-establish strategic deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Weaver argues, “Detailed wargaming and simulation is needed to analyze the ways in which limited nuclear use by both sides affect the course of twenty-first-century conflict and escalation dynamics across a range of scenarios and strategic circumstances. Without such analysis, U.S. efforts to identify the range of nuclear options needed to address limited nuclear escalation will risk missing key insights.” More comprehensive wargaming of the central problem could require asking these same questions across a set of plausible scenarios that span the range of key strategic circumstances the United States might face. Examples of other scenarios that should be examined using the Project Atom 2024 methodology include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with Russia while deterring Chinese opportunistic aggression&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with China while deterring Russian opportunistic aggression&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with Russia and China in which the United States is winning conventionally in one theater and losing in the other when deterrence of limited nuclear use fails&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with Russia and China in which the United States is losing conventionally in both theaters when deterrence of limited nuclear use fails&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full range of scenarios farther into the future when China is a nuclear peer&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth acknowledging that even with additional gaming and empirical data, there will be limits on knowledge about what happens after nuclear use and how to re-establish strategic deterrence. However, analysis of additional scenarios and circumstances would likely produce new and important insights regarding the four key issues addressed in this project, to include opportunities for de-escalation and identifying off-ramps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a host of other opportunities for strengthening intra-war deterrence before a crisis begins. The United States and its allies may have to be prepared to fight and operate in a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) environment, which will require troop protection, equipment, and training. These preparations could also serve a deterrent function by demonstrating U.S. commitment to prevailing in defense of its allies, even in a CBRN environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To state the obvious, contemplating how to respond to nuclear weapons use and strategic deterrence failure is deeply uncomfortable. Such a scenario could involve hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) of casualties, environmental disasters, and the potential for further damage. Indeed, Sisson’s paper starts with the assumption that any nuclear detonation could quickly escalate to civilization-threatening general nuclear war. Ideally, the international community would condemn such attacks and impose heavy costs. But the United States also needs to be prepared to restore deterrence and end the conflict on terms favorable to the United States and its allies. In many of these scenarios, allies’ sovereignty is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s recommendations point to an urgent need for renewed engagement among policymakers and publics on nuclear issues. The stakes could not be higher, as it is the risk of repeated nuclear exchanges as well as the United States’ global leadership and credibility that are on the line. More regional nuclear capabilities will give U.S. planners more rungs on the escalation ladder for restoring deterrence without resorting to large-scale exchanges. They will also give the U.S. president more options in the event of a horrific scenario such as the one outlined here. A future U.S. president must be willing and able to employ nuclear weapons in response to a strategic deterrence failure scenario — and will therefore require flexible, limited options to navigate a scenario of limited nuclear use effectively. Whether a conventional or nuclear response to adversary nuclear use will be more effective in re-establishing deterrence and achieving U.S. objectives will depend on adversary motivations and the specific context of deterrence failure; while a nuclear response may be appropriate in certain scenarios, the same response could be unnecessary and escalatory in others. It is critical, however, that a U.S. president be able to employ whatever military response they determine to be most effective. The United States may therefore benefit from a more diverse nuclear force with a wider range of theater nuclear capabilities. Strategic investments in modernizing, diversifying, and enhancing the resilience of existing deterrent forces will strengthen deterrence and help avoid intra-war deterrence scenarios in the first place. By anticipating scenarios in which adversaries escalate regionally, potentially concurrently, the United States and its allies can strengthen deterrence and reduce the likelihood of adversaries exploiting perceived weaknesses. Preparing for multiple scenarios is not about seeking war but about enhancing deterrence to prevent it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these capability considerations, U.S. decisionmakers can start laying the groundwork now for intra-war deterrence, to include increased and improved wargaming and tabletop exercises, including with allies. And U.S. military and strategic planners, along with policymakers, must immediately consider the question of how to restore assurance alongside deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-of-deterrence-and-security-upon-nuclear-use&quot;&gt;Challenges of Deterrence and Security upon Nuclear Use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;christopher-a-ford&quot;&gt;Christopher A. Ford&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following pages respond to questions posed by the organizers of Project Atom 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-strategic-objectives&quot;&gt;U.S. Strategic Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ASSESSING DETERRENCE’S “FAILURE”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locus of deterrence “failure” here may lie not so much in the specific run-up to the crisis outlined in Project Atom 2024, but potentially years earlier. In this scenario, U.S. and allied leaders were stepping up their military preparedness before war broke out, and were very clear publicly that “wars of conquest will be punished.” Western posture and policy statements, in their own terms, left little basis for U.S. adversaries’ apparent conclusion either that: (a) the United States would not contest aggression in the first place; or (b) the United States could be frightened into intra-war concessions by adversaries’ use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, irrespective of what the United States declared in the run-up to war, U.S. adversaries seem to have assumed that the United States and its allies were: averse to war in general; incapable of waging war effectively or on a sustained basis; and sufficiently afraid of nuclear escalation that Beijing and Moscow could enjoy the benefits of aggression without facing prohibitive risk. This assumption would appear to be rooted not in assessments of specific Western actions undertaken in this scenario, but rather in antecedent beliefs, accumulated over time, about fundamental weaknesses and risk-aversion in Western leadership and societies, coupled — presumably — with the conclusion that the aggressors could draw upon greater resources of martial seriousness and societal stamina in waging war, and that the stakes involved in each theater favored the nearer, “hungrier” power over the distant and more diffident United States and its weak and degenerate local friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence of this aggression, in other words, arguably failed in Project Atom 2024 much the same way that deterrence of Russia’s 2022 attack on Ukraine failed not in 2021–22 but in 2014 — when Vladimir Putin, observing Western reactions to his annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbas, seems to have concluded that they would not react forcefully “next time” either. In the scenario presented here, the failure was twofold: the United States and its allies failed to deter Russia and China from undertaking wars of conventional military aggression, and then further failed in deterring them from using nuclear weapons when things on the battlefield began to go bad. Both of these failures likely derived from assumptions in Moscow and Beijing not that Western leaders lacked the capacity to respond effectively, but that they lacked the will — and hence were more tied to general and longer-term adversary assessments than to specific U.S. or allied posture and signaling failures in the run-up to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If so, this suggests that the efficacy of deterrence lies not only in clear military postures and public messaging, but also in an adversary’s underlying, longer-term assumptions about the character, motivation, and sociopolitical support enjoyed by those adopting such postures and sending such signals. If the adversary power has concluded that one is fundamentally timid and conflict averse — or simply unable to wage a war with resolution and commitment anyway — that adversary is less likely to be deterred by short-term precrisis signals even if they do, on their face, convey admirable resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the more immediate problem for Western leaders in this situation lies not in addressing such deeper challenges but in managing escalation risks and restoring deterrence now that bullets have started flying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If U.S. adversaries assumed that the West’s sociopolitical weakness and fears of nuclear escalation would preclude its responding effectively to conventional aggression by a nuclear-armed great power in this scenario, of course, they were wrong. Since they also seem to have assumed that even their very limited tactical use of nuclear weaponry would scare the United States into abandoning its response to their aggression, it is the primary task of intra-war deterrence here to convince them that this, too, was a misapprehension. To the degree that the United States can do this, it has a chance not merely to manage this scenario, but also to help shape U.S. adversaries’ more general perceptions of the United States in ways that will enable maintaining deterrence once peace is restored. (After all, it is much less plausible to argue that a country will not fight you next time when it has just surprised you, this time, by demonstrating that it actually will.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CORE U.S. OBJECTIVES IN THIS SCENARIO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the potentially existential implications, the first U.S. objective here is to avoid escalation to a full-scale nuclear exchange with either Russia or China. It would be a mistake, however, to conclude from this that the best way to achieve this requires backing down, or that this is the United States’ only important objective. On the contrary, making no response to the Russian and Chinese use of nuclear weapons in this scenario — or acting in a way that would reward such use with terrified Western de-escalation and hence cede theater-level advantage (or even victory) to the aggressor or convince that aggressor that the United States was abandoning its commitments to its allies — may actually increase the risk of broader war and even a full-scale exchange sooner or later, more than would a response of judicious firmness that denies them such benefits and makes clear that the United States stands with its friends and is not entirely unwilling to turn up the heat further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has at least two second-order, but nonetheless extremely important, objectives in this scenario. First, it has an incentive to deny Russia and China victory in these regional conflicts (even in conventional terms) and to make good on U.S. commitments to its allies, because were the United States to lose or weaken those alliances, this would open the door to untold future revisionist aggression and upend the international order upon which U.S. prosperity and that of the United States’ most important international trading and security partners depends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States has an incentive to deny Russia and China not just victory in general, but also victory through the use of nuclear weapons in particular. Rewarding their attempt at nuclear coercion would presumably lead to more aggressive employment of such approaches by Russia and China in the future, hence leading to more wars and greater risks of a full-scale nuclear exchange. Rewarding such coercion and aggression, moreover — and demonstrating the inability of U.S. alliance structures to deter them — would also encourage defensive nuclear proliferation to (and perhaps future offensive nuclear-facilitated coercion by) others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRIORITIZING THEATERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more difficult question is whether, in this scenario, the United States should prioritize one theater over the other. They present different military-operational situations, with the conflict against Russia being primarily a land war and that against China emphasizing naval power projection, although both would require significant air power. For this reason, each region is likely to draw most heavily upon somewhat different mixes of U.S. military capabilities and assets. It is conceivable, therefore, that the United States might not face unmanageably stark prioritization choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, if the United States were forced to choose between concentrating upon Europe and concentrating upon the Indo-Pacific, Washington should prioritize the latter. Even if Russia succeeds in carving out for itself some kind of neo-tsarist imperium in Eastern Europe, Moscow lacks the economic, demographic, and material resources to hold it over the medium-to-long term, especially if confronted by strong and sophisticated adversaries. An allied loss in the Polish-Lithuanian theater in this scenario would be devastating, but even then, a sufficiently alarmed, angry, and resolute Europe could likely still — even alone — present Russia with just such a set of adversaries if it really wished to. Accordingly, the odds of the entire continent falling under the Kremlin’s sway — as well as the odds of Russia maintaining a new empire over the long term — seem low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the implications of a Chinese victory in the Indo-Pacific seem more systemically problematic. Such a victory would very likely lead not merely to the bankruptcy of existing U.S. alliance guarantees, resulting in the Americans’ expulsion from the region — de facto, if not necessarily de jure (or at least not at first) — but also the creation of a Sinocentric imperium in East Asia. Nor would this new authoritarian Chinese regional order likely be particularly short lived. In contrast to the declining state of Russia, and despite some recent economic headwinds and the longer-term specter of demographic decline, China would not lack the manpower, military capabilities, or economic resources necessary to dominate its new network of tributary vassals. Between the two “theater-defeat” scenarios, therefore, from the perspective of the international order and the United States’ future role therein, an Indo-Pacific loss is probably the more traumatic and irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in saying that the United States should, in extremis, prioritize the Indo-Pacific theater, this paper is not suggesting that the United States should abandon efforts to protect its European allies in the Russia scenario. Prioritizing one thing need not mean euthanizing the other. Indeed, any failure to stand by NATO would likely have significant adverse consequences in the Indo-Pacific, whose leaders would be watching the war in Europe carefully as a window into their own ability to rely upon the United States when things become difficult. Just as the United States prioritized defending Europe from the Nazis in World War II without backing off in the war against Japan in the Pacific, even if the United States must now prioritize East Asia in certain ways, it should not abandon Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT COUNTS AS “WINNING”?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the great power committed to maintaining the existing system of international order against revisionist challengers, and as the leading state in the two alliance systems challenged by opportunistic authoritarian aggression, the United States has a “theory of victory” requirement here of denying Russia and China the achievement of their own theories of victory. In Europe, for example, this means preserving Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine as sovereign independent states, and as countries enjoying close security ties to the United States. In Asia, this means similarly preserving Taiwan’s autonomy and keeping the United States’ free democratic allies in Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines from having to become vassal states of the Middle Kingdom. As a status quo power facing revisionist aggression, the fundamental victory requirement for the United States here is thus simply that its adversaries do not “win.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, a broader and more satisfying sort of U.S. victory would see the threat of revisionist aggression from Moscow and Beijing recede (or end?) more broadly, rather than having those powers simply “put back in their place,” thereafter remaining as wounded and aggrieved states looking for future vengeance. Indeed, given the nature of the two authoritarian regimes in question, it is possible that the clear military defeat of either one could shatter its brittle internal legitimacy narrative and lead to regime collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the United States should not assume that such regime collapse would end revisionist threats. After all, both polities have strong and vicious hyper-nationalist elements strongly committed to dark and semi-paranoid anti-Western discourse. Moreover, there is no guarantee that either Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping would be replaced by rulers any less committed to violent international self-aggrandizement. Nevertheless, even if further revisionism could not be precluded by the replacement of the current government, the very fact of a decisive defeat could help reinforce future deterrence messages, especially to the degree that this defeat “felt” more like a consequence of the regime having overreached by striking out abroad than like the fruits of a nefarious Western conspiracy to conquer or subvert the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, after a Western victory in either theater, it might be difficult to tell whether deterrence had truly been “restored,” for each regime might react to such a setback with a policy of tactical retrenchment — that is, effectively accepting only a temporary armistice in order to buy time in which to reprovision, reequip, and prepare to resume hostilities on better terms. Yet deterrence is always provisional and conditional, as it is contingent upon the deterring party’s success in maintaining concrete capabilities (and a perceived willingness to use them) sufficient to persuade a would-be aggressor, each and every day, that “today is not the day.” In this sense, the belligerent powers are not the only ones with agency here. Even a mere armistice would also give the United States and its allies a chance to be better prepared for a potential resumption of hostilities, and hence better able to deter the aggressors. In the face of revisionist moves against the geopolitical status quo, an approach that defeats the aggressor’s initial thrust, returns all players to the territorial status quo ante, and buys time in which the United States can further shore up its alliances and prepare to counter any further attacks looks more like victory than loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As suggested above, moreover, the aggressor’s prior defeat at U.S. hands might itself help to redress the longer-term deterrence problem rooted in adversary assumptions about Western sociopolitical weakness. Rather than being presumed to be a soft and fundamentally weak-willed adversary, the United States would thereafter be “the folks who thrashed you last time, even though you used nuclear weapons.” With a track record of martial success against twenty-first-century near-peer adversaries — and with no less capacity than before to actually use nuclear weapons against future aggression if this is needed — the United States would thus be better positioned to ensure future deterrence than it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assuring-allies&quot;&gt;Assuring Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;QUESTIONS ABOUT U.S. CREDIBILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, there are two levels of U.S. credibility about which U.S. allies have reason to be concerned in this scenario, with the second being of more significance than the first. The first level is whether the United States would be willing to risk a direct clash with a great power adversary, in any form, were it to move against its allies. Here the allies ought to have little doubt about U.S. credibility, for in this scenario the United States not only did respond to aggression against its allies by throwing its conventional forces into the fray against the aggressors, but also responded effectively enough that it led to dramatic setbacks for the aggressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second level of allied concern is whether U.S. nuclear extended deterrence will remain available in the event that an adversary uses nuclear weapons against it — that is, whether the United States would be willing to use nuclear weapons in such a conflict if needed. This is a game-theoretical challenge dating back to the early years of the Cold War, which materialized once the Soviets acquired a strategic nuclear arsenal to counterpose against the U.S. one, and it raises a question to which no truly definitive answer has ever been given. In a context in which adversary nuclear weapons hold major U.S. cities at risk, to what degree would a U.S. president really be willing to “lose New York to save Hamburg”? On this level, the present scenario confronts the United States with a clear challenge: how much risk of nuclear escalation against the U.S. homeland should the United States be willing to accept in responding to an aggressor’s use of nuclear weapons against its forces and allies in theaters thousands of miles away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a challenging question to which no a priori answer is likely possible, as much would depend upon the specific battlefield circumstances, the geopolitical and political contexts, and the personalities of the leaders in question. To judge from U.S. deterrence policy over many decades, however, the answer to the question is “definitely some.” Nonetheless, U.S. intestinal fortitude in this regard is presumably not infinite. The United States was clearly willing to accept considerable risk of escalation to a full-scale nuclear exchange in order to deter Soviet aggression against its allies in Europe during the Cold War. Yet the United States also seems to have recognized that there was an inherent degree of non-credibility in a promise, in effect, to destroy the world in order to “save” (for instance) Hamburg from the Red Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this problem, the United States and its allies developed three answers that went beyond relying exclusively upon potentially homeland-imperiling U.S. strategic brinkmanship: (a) the British and French invested in their own nuclear weapons programs; (b) the United States adopted a “nuclear-sharing” policy under which it would provide nuclear gravity bombs for delivery by key NATO allies in time of war (while preserving U.S. control of such devices in peacetime); and (c) the United States deployed a variety of theater- and shorter-range nuclear delivery systems that would give it more options to respond to aggression without the stark choice between surrender and jumping all the way up the escalation ladder to a strategic exchange. Together, these choices added considerable operational flexibility to the collective NATO nuclear tool kit, enhancing deterrence without making nuclear use so casually thinkable that the United States would be tempted to engage in it absent the gravest of provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, by contrast, only the first of the United States’ three Cold War–era responses (British and French weapons) really remains viable, though even then in a form considerably attenuated since Cold War days and not optimized for theater-type engagements of this sort in any event. The second response (NATO’s nuclear-sharing policy) has been allowed to atrophy into a fairly noncredible operational capability that would be difficult to employ in a full-scale conflict, is vulnerable to both nuclear and conventional preemption, and which (at least until sizeable numbers of dual-capable F-35 aircraft come online) would have difficulty surviving and ensuring mission-completion against serious air defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the third response, the United States no longer has any effective U.S. nuclear assets designed for, devoted to, and deployed for theater-level nuclear missions. It does have a low-yield option in the form of the W76-2 warhead, but that device rides on a strategic delivery system, the Trident D5 submarine-launched ballistic missile. The United States has no flexible, theater-range nuclear systems to array against the considerable Russian and Chinese arsenals of diverse and flexible theater-range systems. This makes it harder to reassure our allies that we really would be there (in a nuclear sense) for their “Hamburg” — as well as harder to convince (and hence deter) the would-be aggressor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the basic challenge of the second-level question of nuclear use. It is surely possible for nuclear weapons to be too “usable,” and overquick resort to such tools could be catastrophic. Yet it is also possible for nuclear weapons use to be too hard to contemplate, for to find it truly “unthinkable” would be to invite aggression that cannot be deterred or combatted by purely conventional means. Deterrence policy is thus about finding the “Goldilocks point” — or, more elegantly, the Aristotelean Mean — between these bad answers. In the present scenario, however, the United States would surely be more able both to deter and to respond to aggression if it had more theater-range options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that nuclear weapons have been used in this scenario, this second-level question of nuclear use moves to the forefront. Fortunately, the facts of the scenario so far do not quite precipitate the most challenging dilemma, so it matters less that the United States lacks the more flexible theater-range nuclear options it needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably, U.S. allies have no special interest in the United States using nuclear weapons per se: their interest lies in being defended against aggression by whatever means are necessary — not excluding nuclear weaponry, but not necessarily employing it either. Indeed, at various points over the years, some allies have expressed concern that the United States might perhaps be too quick to use such weapons, particularly where such employment in theater would occur on their soil. (Over NATO’s history, U.S. defense planners have struggled incessantly with simultaneous European demands that the United States (a) be entirely ready to wage a nuclear war on their behalf and (b) not be too eager to do so, especially not in Europe. The equilibrium point between these demands is not always easily found.) Most likely, however, U.S. allies’ primary concern here is quite singular. Their fear is only that the United States might fail to use nuclear weapons in circumstances in which there is no way to protect the allies’ own existential security interests other than by using nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this lens, a critical question is whether this scenario is “one of those cases.” And in this regard, the scenario could be said not yet to present such a need. So far, the conventional situation does not seem to be one in which vital U.S. or allied interests are threatened in ways that would require U.S. nuclear use. On the contrary, the United States and its allies seem to be prevailing without it. The primary, existential question from the perspective of allied second-level (nuclear) assurance, therefore, has arguably thus not yet been raised. After all, it would presumably do little harm to the United States’ reputation among its allies as an extended deterrence protector — and might even enhance its reputation for responsible nuclear statesmanship — if Washington were to decline to use nuclear weapons where it did not need to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the remaining question here is whether a U.S. or allied nuclear response might be needed to the Russian or Chinese nuclear attacks simply because they were nuclear attacks. To this question, under these facts, reasonable people may disagree. Some might argue in the affirmative — claiming, in effect, that we “need” to use nuclear weapons to protect the credibility, to ally and aggressor alike, of the “nuclear” aspect of extended deterrence even when the United States does not need to use nuclear weapons for any actual operational military purpose in a war it is already winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, however, contends that on the current facts of this scenario, the United States does not yet need to use nuclear weaponry. The extended deterrence the United States provides to its allies has never been an exclusively nuclear insurance policy against aggression. Instead, it has been an inclusively nuclear one. It combines all elements of available military power that are required to deter aggression and to defeat it should deterrence fail. That is, the United States has promised to defend its allies by whatever means are necessary, but it has not promised to use any specific form of military power unless that form is necessary. This is not some U.S. analogue to the mindless automaticity of the old Soviet (and now Russian) “Dead Hand” nuclear launch system. Rather, it is an ironclad promise to the United States’ best friends of effective defense — not of U.S. nuclear use per se and no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this author’s view, a fundamental allied loss of trust in the credibility of the U.S. alliance guarantee would therefore probably not arise unless and until either (a) battlefield circumstances changed in ways that presented an ally with the prospect of catastrophic defeat absent U.S. nuclear use, and the United States did not then use nuclear weapons, or (b) the United States reacted to Sino-Russian nuclear use by retreat or some other measure of capitulation. Otherwise, remaining unintimidated and continuing to prosecute a successful conventional campaign — “fighting through” the adversary’s nuclear use in theater, as it were — should represent an optimal answer from the perspective of U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, at least, it is possible that some allies would wish the United States to use nuclear weapons against Russia and/or China, while others surely would prefer that we did not. On the whole, however, it would likely be less costly to alliance solidarity for the United States to continue to win the conventional conflict fighting alongside its allies without using nuclear weapons than it would for the United States to use such weapons (especially on European soil) when it was not absolutely clear it needed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALLIED SECURITY CONCERNS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security concerns of U.S. allies in this scenario are fourfold, deriving from their situations as relatively militarily weak states close to a powerful revisionist great-power predator that is eager to carve out a more expansive sphere of influence or empire for itself in the world. First and most fundamentally, U.S. allies’ security concern is an existential one: they must avoid the loss of their autonomy and independence as sovereign peoples. Beyond this, and deriving from this core concern, U.S. allies have a second security interest in avoiding the loss of their ties to other countries able and willing to assist them in meeting such primary security needs. Most of all, this means preserving military ties to the United States, but it also entails preserving their more general ability to leverage bilateral relationships or collective security institutions to meet security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third allied security concern is more prosaic, but still significant. Each ally has a security interest in keeping the military forces of its local great-power predator as far from its own borders as possible. Moreover, irrespective of immediate border threats, allies have a security interest in limiting that predator’s deployment of long-range fires, aviation assets, naval power-projection capabilities, and other military tools capable of threatening that ally’s forces, facilities, or critical infrastructure from afar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More indirectly, U.S. allies have a fourth security interest in avoiding deep entanglement in economic, natural resource–centered, technological, supply chain, financial, or other relationships of dependency with either of the two great-power predators involved in this scenario. Such relationships may, or may not, provide immediate benefits (e.g., inexpensive goods, cheap energy, or corporate profits), but such ties are strategically debilitating and inimical to maintaining the sovereign independence that is each ally’s first-order existential concern. Such relationships give leverage over that ally by allowing the other power to administer rewards and punishments in ways that reduce the ally’s autonomy, undermine its ability to maintain a credible deterrent against aggression, and weaken relationships with third parties that are important to preserving its core security interests. (The existence of such relationships also likely contributes to adversary assumptions underlying the deep sociopolitical failure of deterrence discussed earlier: a country mired in structural dependency upon an aggressor will probably be assumed less likely to fight it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SIGNALING RESOLVE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once deterrence has failed — or more challengingly, failed doubly, as in this scenario where both aggression and nuclear weapons use have occurred — the United States will likely have passed the point at which policy pronouncements and deterrence-related consultations with its allies can, alone, signal sufficient resolve. At this point, what counts most are U.S. actions and how adversaries understand them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this respect, perhaps the most important signal the United States could send is to not slow or alter its activities against aggressor forces in the two theaters, except when such steps may be needed to preserve ongoing operations in a potentially nuclear environment. To this end, all relevant U.S. (and NATO) conventional assets should be readied to operate in a radiological-nuclear combat environment as quickly as possible, with ground assets dispersing to widely scattered field dispositions and air assets moving to dispersal airfields. This could also include the issuance of detection and protective gear, medical countermeasures, and relevant decontamination equipment, as well as surging radiation-hazard first responder units and medical personnel forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersing conventional capabilities — not merely land and naval units near the zone of operations but also aircraft from vulnerable bases to a wider variety of auxiliary dispersed locations, including those dual-capable aircraft (DCA) that would be needed for nuclear attack missions (i.e., unilateral U.S. assets in East Asia and NATO nuclear-sharing aircraft in Europe) — would also demonstrate resolve, unity, and collective preparedness. U.S. nuclear weapon storage vaults at relevant European airfields should also be readied for potential operations, and any existing plans for weapon dispersal to additional airfields that do not involve actual DCA attack assets should be implemented. (Care should be taken, however, not to fly NATO DCAs en masse to weapon storage airfields or to fly DCA from such airfields, lest Russia mistake this for an attack in progress.) Every effort should be made to keep these precautions from slowing the pace of combat operations against the Russian forces, which should not stop, though some impact might be unavoidable. (The scenario gives us notably little detail about the operational implications of the Russian and Chinese nuclear strikes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signals sent by these efforts are intended, together, to demonstrate in concrete form that (i) NATO will not give up in the face of nuclear provocations and (ii) NATO is quite prepared for the possibility of escalation. Beyond the theaters in question, moreover, U.S. and allied leaders in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific should make clear their intention to isolate the aggressors’ economies as completely as possible from the global economy (e.g., impeding Chinese oil shipments through the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca, and ending all Russian resource exports) for the duration of their wars of aggression. This may help create additional incentives for moderation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alert level of U.S. strategic nuclear forces would also need to be elevated, with vulnerable bomber assets dispersing to auxiliary airfields, and with portions of the force perhaps even beginning rotating in-air readiness patrols (though not flying on headings that could be mistaken for attack trajectories either toward Russia or toward China). U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) would remain on ready-to-launch alert, with logistics support crews immediately providing extra supplies of diesel fuel to ICBM bases and individual silos to prepare them to sustain alert operations during a potentially prolonged crisis in which reliance upon local peacetime power grids might be precluded by sabotage or cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, serviceable in-port nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) — not only in the United States but also in Britain and France — should muster their crews and put to sea as quickly as possible. Emergency notice should also be given to operators of critical infrastructure facilities in the United States, Europe, and East Asia, encouraging or directing them to implement whatever protective protocols they might have to defend against Russian and/or Chinese cyberattacks, and to move to insulate their systems as much as possible from the internet (even at financial cost or loss in operational efficiency) and prepare themselves to implement emergency service restoration or reconstitution plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF MESSAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these preparatory steps are important in their own right, they are also critical to the U.S. messaging strategy. To understand the importance of getting U.S. strategic signaling right, it should be remembered that the Russian and Chinese nuclear attacks in this scenario were notably limited. They hit only things in theater that were of tactical operational relevance, for instance, striking only a very small number of targets despite both adversaries possessing a huge numerical advantage in theater delivery systems. Moreover, they refrained from hitting anything in the U.S. homeland or that was of arguable strategic importance to the United States. This suggests that U.S. adversaries are themselves carefully considering escalation risks, and that they do fear provoking a large-scale nuclear response. If they understand that their nuclear use has not intimidated the United States and that the United States is indeed comfortable with escalation despite their previous assumptions to the contrary — but that, at the same time, U.S. war aims are limited, being confined only to restoring the status quo ante — the United States may have a chance to restore deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, these concrete military moves would be accompanied by full-spectrum public messaging — including by the president directly — making three key points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, the United States would make clear that these nuclear-preparatory steps are indeed underway and that Washington is demonstrating in concrete ways the United States’ ironclad commitment to protecting the sovereignty and independence of its military allies by whatever means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, the United States would make equally clear that under the current circumstances, U.S. nuclear weapons use is not yet necessary. U.S. messaging would stress that, while Russia and China’s nuclear use was the result of tactical desperation as their wars of aggression began to falter, the United States itself faces no such desperate circumstances. On the contrary, despite the United States’ strong preference to avoid using nuclear weapons and its willingness to use them if its adversaries force it to, the United States is currently prevailing in the conventional fight and intends to continue with that winning approach for so long as its adversaries’ fixation upon aggression makes it necessary to resist them in order to protect the security and independence of free sovereign peoples. Washington would also make clear that it remains entirely prepared and ready to use nuclear weapons itself if Russia or China leave it no choice, and the United States would warn them not to test its resolve by using nuclear weapons a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, the United States would make explicit that its war aims in this conventional fight are quite limited. The United States do not seek to inflict a “strategic loss” or regime change upon either Russia or China, but rather merely stop their wars of aggression. If they stop that aggression, the United States would have no more need to fight them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TREATY VERSUS NON-TREATY PARTNERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this above-mentioned activity would be aimed primarily at protecting and reassuring U.S. military allies, as they would undoubtedly be the United States’ highest priority. Moves that would reassure those treaty allies would likely have some impact in reassuring non-treaty partners as well, but this would be merely a secondary, rather than primary, benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-response-options&quot;&gt;Military Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. MILITARY OPTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foregoing pages have already made clear the optimal immediate U.S. military responses to the current scenario: the United States should continue winning the conventional fight without employing nuclear weapons itself, while posturing itself to be ready for nuclear use if adversary nuclear threats or other military circumstances require. The United States would retain the option to do more, of course, and — depending how things develop — might well indeed still need to do so in the face of further Russian or Chinese provocations (e.g., massive U.S. battlefield reverses or a second instance of adversary nuclear use). Absent such further need, however, discretion should remain the better part of valor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT IF THEY USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAIN?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event that U.S. adversaries chose to use nuclear weapons a second time, the United States — as it will have signaled that it was ready to do — should be prepared to cross the nuclear threshold itself. At least initially, the key would be to find a type and level of U.S. nuclear response appropriate to the delicate task of (a) signaling undiminished resolve and of (b) not jumping so much further up the proverbial escalation ladder that things spiral out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, one possibility would be to have a deployed SSBN in the Atlantic and one in the Pacific launch Trident missiles with reduced-yield W76-2 nuclear warheads toward two targets. (If the United States had the capability to do this, and reasonable confidence that its adversaries could see and understand that this is what the United States was doing, these weapons should also be launched on depressed ballistic trajectories clearly incapable of hitting strategic targets deep in the adversaries’ homelands.) These four targets, two in Russia and two in China, would be chosen on the basis of being military locations consistent with legitimate targeting under the law of armed conflict (LOAC), and the destruction of which would have a real impact upon adversary military operations in each theater, but without inflicting massive civilian casualties and without directly posing what could be seen as an existential threat to either ruling regime. Choosing these targets would need to be done relatively quickly, and carefully, but there would be at least some time for careful selection, informed not only by military analysis but also careful assessment of adversary leadership psychology and domestic political dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point in these attacks would be affirmatively to cross the “nuclear threshold,” including by hitting targets in the adversaries’ homelands — not merely to raise the ante somewhat for purposes of coercive bargaining, but also because, as Willie Sutton might have put it, that is where the targets are, as well as because the United States would prefer not to set off nuclear weapons on its allies’ territory if it can avoid it — while yet doing so in ways that adversary observers would be less likely to mistake for any sort of strategic attack and that signaled U.S. continuing commitment to a great degree of restraint. The U.S. president should also announce these launches publicly, making clear that this is a carefully limited theater action responding directly to these adversaries’ nuclear use and demonstrating that the United States will neither yield to their intimidation nor be provoked into overreaction, and that U.S. commitment to protecting its military allies remains undimmed. (Afterward, moreover, U.S. officials would publicly present the rationale for choosing those targets and that means of attack, also making clear how this decision was consistent with longstanding LOAC principles of necessity, proportionality, distinction, and humanity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE RISKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has already been covered, or at least implied, in the paragraphs above. The primary risk lies in the danger that the United States fails to find the optimal Goldilocks point between the extremes as it tries to simultaneously (a) persuade allies and adversaries alike of U.S. seriousness and martial resolution and (b) not signal so much readiness or eagerness for escalation that the adversary feels provoked into catastrophic preemptive moves. Secondary risks also exist, among them the possibility either that some ally “opts out” of the conflict for fear of escalatory consequences, or that it “opts in” with too much enthusiasm by unilaterally taking steps that end up provokingadversary escalation rather than deterring it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE LOAC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long made clear its belief that the LOAC does apply to the use of all forms of weaponry in wartime, including nuclear weapons. Washington has also made clear in recent years its intention to abide by those rules in the event of conflict, even nuclear conflict. Despite U.S. commitment to such legal constraints, however, LOAC principles — if properly understood as U.S. officials have indeed carefully outlined them, and as generations of operational lawyers in the U.S. armed services have been trained on them — should not be a significant impediment to sound U.S. or allied strategy in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the use of nuclear weapons is not illegal under the LOAC when the very existence of a state is threatened — this being a formulation that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accepted in its 1996 advisory opinion on the topic — and the present scenario of aggressor use of nuclear weapons against Poland and the Philippines would certainly seem to raise such concerns. Nor would the LOAC rule out U.S. or other allied nuclear use in defending an ally from such attack as a matter of course, as the right of self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter does not preclude collective self-defense. The law would not permit simply any nuclear response, of course. Nevertheless, under such quasi-existential circumstances the logic of compelling “military necessity” should permit judicious nuclear counter-strikes — both to prevent allied defeat in a growing conventional conflict and to dissuade further (and potentially full-scale) nuclear escalation by the aggressor — even if such strikes entailed considerable civilian casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOAC principles are thus unlikely to be an obstacle to a careful and prudent response to the current scenario, even if that response turned out to involve U.S. or allied use of nuclear weaponry. The LOAC would preclude using a U.S. nuclear weapon directly to target Russian or Chinese civilians, of course, and U.S. and allied commanders would need to take feasible precautions to limit civilian damage (e.g., being as precise in their targeting as is feasible under the circumstances and using weapons of yield no greater than needed to accomplish the military objective). Yet it is hard to imagine military circumstances in this scenario giving rise to any need to do more than what a clear-eyed analysis of necessity and proportionality would permit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-kinetic-response-options&quot;&gt;Non-Kinetic Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the degree that non-kinetic options might exist that could affect the ability of Russian or Chinese forces to operate effectively in the specific theater wars described in this scenario, such activity might well contribute usefully to prosecution of the conflict below the level of U.S. or allied nuclear escalation. This might include, for instance: pursuing cyber or electronic warfare (EW) degradation of air defense activity or battlefield command, control, and communications (C3) networks; jamming or spoofing of adversary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) communications for engaged combatants; launching cyberattacks on infrastructure or transportation capabilities that directly contribute to the fight in theater; or jamming or otherwise engaging space assets in connection specifically with their support to theater operations. If means were available to degrade adversary nuclear C3, but only in the context of theater operations such as the two nuclear attacks that already occurred, this would likely also be a useful contribution to the fight, helping make further regional strikes more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least initially, however, care should be taken to avoid non-kinetic measures that might be interpreted as having existential implications. This could include, for instance, attacks upon Russian or Chinese space assets that support strategically critical functions such as national nuclear C3, cyberattacks upon critical infrastructure not associated with the specific military theater of operations, or perhaps even — given the paranoid and potentially fragile nature of the regimes in question — the dramatic stepping up of Information Operations (IO) or public diplomacy messaging that could be interpreted as encouraging regime change in Moscow and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario certainly presents challenging questions. For this author, however, the particular fact pattern of Russian and Chinese nuclear weapons use outlined in Project Atom 2024 does not have to drive the United States to nuclear use itself, at least not yet. The United States must continue to stand by its allies and ensure that they are defended against aggression, while denying the aggressors any advantage from their choice to cross the nuclear threshold. Nevertheless, since (and for so long as) the United States is winning both wars without using nuclear weaponry, it should continue to do so, while yet making it very clear that it is prepared to escalate to nuclear use — and indeed actually ensuring that it is thus prepared — if the aggressors leave the United States no choice. With the moderate war aims appropriate to a status quo power seeking to defeat aggression but not to remake the world in its image, the United States has the chance here to confound Sino-Russian aggression, rebuild a strong deterrent posture, prove to its allies that it indeed does stand with them when bullets start to fly, and demonstrate reassuringly temperate nuclear statesmanship, all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-1&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circumstances of nuclear use described in the proposed 2027 scenario are unprecedented. The notional attacks would not only break an 82-year taboo concerning nuclear use in warfare, but nuclear weapons have never been used in conflict against other nuclear-armed states. These novel circumstances combined with the high stakes for all parties involved present U.S. policymakers with significant challenges in determining how to respond. Ideally, Washington would lead a course of action that would illustrate U.S. resolve and credibility to its allies and partners, avoid nuclear escalation, and demonstrate that nuclear use does not result in attackers achieving their strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis below argues that the primary U.S. objective, if the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation (RF) use nuclear weapons in the context of conflicts over Ukraine and Taiwan, is to manage and prevent escalation up to a major nuclear exchange. Secondary — though still vitally important — objectives include maintaining alliance relationships, ending the conflicts on favorable terms, and ensuring that the international community does not perceive nuclear use as benefitting the attackers. The United States and its allies should take several actions, militarily and diplomatically, to prevent these conflicts in the first place, and failing this, be ready to address the first instance of nuclear use since World War II in a manner that does not lead to a broader nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-strategic-objectives-1&quot;&gt;U.S. Strategic Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section explores why deterrence failed and what the United States can do to prevent these deterrence failures, before presenting the U.S. strategic objectives in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHY DID DETERRENCE FAIL?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the notional 2027 scenario, the initial failure of conventional deterrence is the most consequential failure. Both adversaries used nuclear weapons because they instigated imprudent conventional conflicts against U.S. allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of nuclear use in both theaters appears to be twofold: (1) demonstrating the high stakes with which the adversaries view the conflicts and (2) terminating the war by deterring the United States and its allies from continuing to fight due to Western fears of additional nuclear attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent these competitors from resorting to nuclear attacks is to ensure that a strong and credible U.S. deterrent posture — integrating nuclear and conventional capabilities — prevents both from initiating aggression against allies and partners in the first place. The United States and its allies could have taken several political and military steps to improve this posture prior to 2027 when the proposed nuclear attacks occur. A deterrence failure would likely result from an adversary questioning the U.S. political commitment to its allies and partners. It is thus helpful to review signals the United States has sent in recent years that were intended to strengthen credibility, but which may have been misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, in June of 2024, began to publicly signal its military plan to aid Taiwan’s defense. Admiral Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, described the “Hellscape” strategy for defending Taiwan to a Washington Post columnist. Paparo explained that the “U.S. military would deploy thousands of unmanned submarines, unmanned surface ships and aerial drones to flood the area and give Taiwanese, U.S. and partner forces time to mount a full response.” He continued, “I want to turn the Taiwan Strait into an unmanned hellscape using a number of classified capabilities.” International media sources reported on Paparo’s remarks widely, serving a deterrent function for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admiral Paparo, however, also warned that the U.S. industrial base would need to increase its production of drones and other capabilities to implement this plan. Along the same lines, in 2023, a retired U.S. general questioned whether the U.S. military would be ready to defend Taiwan. This skeptical public rhetoric and an inability to attain necessary levels of readiness — something the Chinese government would surely learn from intelligence gathering — could contribute to deterrence failure by creating doubt about both U.S. resolve and U.S. military readiness for such an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, there are reasons for the PRC to doubt the United States’ commitment to defending Taiwan due to the U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity. The United States terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan (the Republic of China or ROC) in 1979 when it formally recognized the PRC. Since then, U.S. relations with Taiwan have been based on the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. The act obligates the United States to provide Taiwan “with defense articles and defense services” to allow the island “to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability” and “to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.” The act created a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding U.S. defense of Taiwan. Despite this policy, President Biden has spoken strongly of U.S. support for Taiwan’s defense on four separate occasions. Following these statements, White House officials emphasized that U.S. policy regarding Taiwan remained the same, presumably to avoid raising tensions with China. Making a “mistake” about U.S. support for Taiwan four different times likely has sent a strong signal of U.S. intentions to the PRC. It will be important to see how the next president speaks about Taiwan, as their words will send important messages to Chinese leadership about the U.S. defense of Taiwan. It is worth noting, however, regardless of presidential rhetoric, that as long as the policy of strategic ambiguity is in place, there is room for Chinese leaders to question the U.S. commitment to assisting Taiwan’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond uncertainty regarding Washington’s military and political pledges to Taiwan, any Chinese attacks on Taiwan could stem from an assumption by President Xi that the stakes are higher for the PRC than for the United States. With Taiwan just over eighty miles from mainland China and the PRC increasingly asserting its dominance in the East and South China Seas, it is unsurprising that Chinese leaders would assume that the island of Taiwan matters more to Beijing than to Washington. The assumption that the United States and its Pacific allies have lower stakes in the region could lead Xi to calculate, first, that he could get away with annexing Taiwan by force, and second, that nuclear use could stop the United States from continuing to defend Taiwan in a crisis if the annexation does not go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the European theater, the deterrence failure dates to at least 2014, when the RF annexed Crimea. Based on the West’s limited response to that action, Putin determined that it was worth attempting to take the rest of Ukraine by force in 2022. He did not anticipate Ukraine’s ability to resist the invasion or the support Kyiv would receive from the West. As Ukraine was not a member of the alliance, NATO’s Article 5 commitment did not apply, but members of NATO responded to the attack with intelligence, supplies, and funding. The level of NATO unity surrounding Ukraine and the increases in defense spending among alliance members are intended to send a strong deterrent message to Putin regarding further aggression, but if Moscow were in a desperate gamble to split the alliance and to reduce the West’s support for Ukraine in a conventional conflict, then additional attacks could not be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while preventing the conventional attacks in the first place is key to preventing the subsequent instances of nuclear use, this scenario does involve nuclear deterrence failures. The adversaries likely hoped that crossing the nuclear threshold would compel the United States and its allies to stop fighting. They may have doubts about whether the United States would employ nuclear weapons in regional conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT CAN BE DONE TO AVOID THESE DETERRENCE FAILURES?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military must prioritize the acquisitions required for the Hellscape plan and for follow-on military action in the region. In addition, the United States needs to find a way to sell Taiwan the military hardware required to defend itself from a PRC attack. If the United States does not provide what Taiwan needs in a timely fashion, it signals a lack of political resolve on the part of the United States and undermines Taiwanese military readiness. As (or if) the United States takes these steps to increase U.S. and Taiwanese readiness between 2024 and 2027, U.S. military leaders should project greater public confidence than they have to date about their ability to aid Taiwan’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of altering the U.S. policy of “strategic ambiguity” regarding Taiwan’s status, there are several ways the United States could message its resolve to maintain the status quo. First, more statements like those made by President Biden about his intention to defend Taiwan — even if they must be clarified after the fact — are better than saying nothing or being dismissive of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, top U.S. leaders should make clear to all audiences that the United States has long been a Pacific power and will continue to be one into the future. U.S. stakes in the region are significant: the United States has several allies and partners in the Pacific, maintains key military bases in the region, and benefits from the substantial percentage of global trade transported through the region’s waters. The United States has demonstrated its commitment to the Pacific in recent years with AUKUS, the trilateral security pact with Australia and the United Kingdom, and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with Australia, India, and Japan. U.S. leaders should not concede that the PRC has more of a stake in the region, and particularly in Taiwan, than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, U.S. leaders should reiterate several talking points regarding Taiwan, both domestically and to the broader international community, to highlight why the United States seeks to maintain the status quo. One set of messages should emphasize what could occur if Taiwan loses its autonomy and becomes part of the PRC. Taiwan is a liberal democracy and a fundamental economic partner to the West. In particular, Taiwan is the world’s foremost supplier of semiconductors and advanced semiconductors, which are necessary for cell phones, computers, cars, and military hardware. If Taiwan were to be swallowed up by its large communist neighbor, this vitally important industry would be under Chinese control. The United States could lose access to the advanced semiconductors necessary for its defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another set of messages should address the PRC’s unlawful claim to Taiwan. There is no history of the PRC controlling the island. The Taiwanese are a mix of indigenous and ethnic Chinese people, some of whom have lived on the island for centuries, well before the PRC existed as a nation-state. The PRC claiming that it has a right to this island is akin to modern colonialism. In sum, the United States and its allies must make clear that taking Taiwan by force is an illegal and illegitimate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several steps the United States could take to strengthen its relationship with the Philippines and deter a potential attack on the island nation. The United States could do more to emphasize the importance of its partnership with the Philippines by assisting President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. with his domestic and international priorities, countering the Chinese disinformation campaigns in the country, providing additional military assistance, and engaging in more joint military exercises in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the European theater, the RF’s initial attack on Ukraine in February 2022 appears to have been a strategic blunder as it created an enemy on its border, united NATO members against Russia, and caused many European nations to increase defense spending. If at some point in the future, the RF attacks Poland or another NATO member, then there must have been some change of circumstances that made Putin question NATO unity in the face of nuclear use on NATO soil. Alternately, a nuclear attack could be a desperate attempt to stop NATO from supporting Ukraine’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Washington must signal its ability and willingness to employ nuclear weapons in these theaters, if necessary, to defend its allies. Signaling comes in a variety of forms, from guidance documents, presidential rhetoric, weapons movement, and exercises that employ these weapons. While the United States under the Biden administration has been wise to avoid the type of belligerent nuclear rhetoric coming from its Russian counterparts, future administrations can privately message their willingness to defend allies using all available options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT DOES WINNING LOOK LIKE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several immediate and long-term strategic objectives in the proposed scenario. Before outlining those goals, it is worth emphasizing exactly what is at stake in this conflict. The PRC and RF crossing the nuclear threshold means that the world has come significantly closer to nuclear war, and with it, a nuclear exchange ending millions of lives, the loss of societies, and even the risk of human civilization on the planet. Any U.S. leader considering how to address this scenario must have that grave reality — however remote — in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary objective in this scenario is to prevent nuclear escalation, whereby the United States and either the PRC, the RF, or both engage in escalating tit-for-tat nuclear attacks that result in a large-scale exchange of nuclear weapons. This is the primary goal because such nuclear exchanges would destroy societies, lead to millions of deaths, and cause widespread environmental devastation. Even if that outcome appears unlikely from the limited notional scenario, the circumstances are so unprecedented and the possibility of large-scale nuclear exchange so dire that avoiding large-scale nuclear escalation must be considered the goal that supersedes all others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondary objectives include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reestablishing the pre-conflict status quo with the PRC and Taiwan and returning Ukraine to its pre-2022 borders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demonstrating U.S. credibility to its allies and partners. This is especially important in terms of nuclear nonproliferation goals. If allies no longer perceive Washington as a trusted security partner, they may consider developing their own indigenous nuclear weapons programs. For example, some leaders in the Republic of Korea (ROK) have called for the country to develop nuclear weapons, and a small number have done so in Japan as well. Polls of the ROK public have found that a majority supports an indigenous nuclear program. Polling of Eastern European publics also indicated support for indigenous nuclear programs in the weeks following the RF’s 2022 attack on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining the Philippines as an ally in the Pacific, to include the use of its military bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining freedom of movement for all states within the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reestablishing the taboo against first nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability to achieve any of these important secondary goals means the loss of U.S. global leadership. U.S. allies and partners are key enablers in promoting favorable rules, norms, and institutions within the international system. The PRC and the RF, along with Belarus, Iran, and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), are increasingly forming a bloc determined to undermine U.S. global influence. If the U.S. response to this conflict were to cause the perception that the United States is not a dependable ally or partner, it would be a strategic win for the so-called Axis of Upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assuring-allies-1&quot;&gt;Assuring Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the nuclear attacks on the territories of allies, other allies and partners will closely watch to see how Washington responds. U.S. leaders will need to address the immediate challenge of the attacks and the ongoing conflicts, while also considering how their actions affect alliance relationships in the immediate and longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT ARE THE RISKS — INCLUDING THEIR LIKELIHOOD AND CONSEQUENCES — OF ALLIES QUESTIONING U.S. CREDIBILITY IN THE EVENT OF STRATEGIC DETERRENCE FAILURE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is fair to assume that the publics and elites within allied nations will perceive the nuclear attacks by the PRC and RF as deterrence failures, but it is also important to note that both states used nuclear weapons in this notional scenario when they were losing conventional conflicts against the United States and its allies. Nuclear use stemmed from a place of adversary weakness and was meant to undermine U.S. resolve to keep fighting and to illustrate the high stakes of the conflict for the PRC and RF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Putin’s behavior over the past decade, it is possible, and perhaps even likely, that U.S. allies and partners will emphasize the RF’s taboo-breaking decision to conduct a nuclear attack more than they will blame the United States for the deterrence failure. For example, Putin already has defied several international rules and norms when it comes to respecting national sovereignty, upholding sanctions against proliferating nations, and using chemical weapons against perceived enemies of the state. Moreover, his strategic mistake in invading Ukraine in 2022 and his administration’s persistent nuclear saber-rattling since may result in NATO leaders questioning Putin’s rationality. The theory of nuclear deterrence relies on leaders behaving rationally, so can the United States be blamed for not deterring an actor who may not be rational?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC’s nuclear use presents a different and perhaps more complex challenge. The Philippines is not under the protection of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence per the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, and yet in a Pacific conflict, the nation would become a target as the United States operates out of its military bases. A potential nuclear attack on a Philippine military base would likely provoke public backlash toward the United States, especially among Filipinos aligned with the political faction of former president Rodrigo Duterte. Some Philippine leaders have already expressed concerns that U.S. military forces on their islands make them a potential target of a nuclear attack. Maintaining this partnership after an attack may be difficult without extending the U.S. nuclear umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW CAN THE UNITED STATES SIGNAL RESOLVE TO ALLIES IN THE EVENT OF STRATEGIC DETERRENCE FAILURE? WHAT WILL BE ALLIES’ SECURITY CONCERNS IN THE EVENT OF STRATEGIC DETERRENCE FAILURE? WHAT ROLE MIGHT CERTAIN ALLIES AND PARTNERS PLAY IN A RESPONSE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important means of signaling resolve is for the United States to continue prosecuting the respective conflicts and to respond to the nuclear attacks. Continuing the fight means that military forces may have to operate in spite of, and even in, radiation-contaminated environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hours after nuclear use, the focus in the White House will be learning as much as possible about the attacks and assessing its response. This will be a tense, high-stress period, but Washington will want to make allies aware of its plans. Ideally, NATO’s Nuclear Planning Group would have discussed responses to RF or PRC nuclear use well before the beginning of this hypothetical conflict in 2027. The public response to the Russian attack should be presented as a NATO response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of demonstrating credible resolve is maintaining public support for U.S. responses to the attacks; reminding the U.S. public of the strategic importance of its alliances will be vital to this support. News of nuclear use on allies in the Indo-Pacific and Europe will shock the U.S. public; many could fear nuclear detonations would occur on U.S. territory. As a result, securing public support in the United States for military action in defense of allies and partners following the attacks may be challenging. NATO expanded in a period when most Americans no longer worried about European security or nuclear war; the public salience of the alliance and of U.S. alliance commitments is likely much lower than it was during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before any potential conflict — and frankly, right now — the U.S. government, especially the president, should aim to better educate the public about the history of U.S. alliance relationships and their benefits. When it comes to most public discussions of U.S. allies today, there is too much talk about free-riding and too little about how U.S. economic, security, and political interests benefit from maintaining strong relations with its 30-plus treaty allies. Existing research from political science suggests that the U.S. public is more likely to support military action on behalf of formal allies than nonformal allies (such as Taiwan), so public education about Taiwan is also important. Current scholarship also indicates that support for allies among the U.S. public is based on “elite cues,” so leaders need to be providing positive talking points about U.S. allies if they want to build public support for military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the use of nuclear weapons in this scenario, allies will have several concerns. Any countries targeted or immediately impacted by the nuclear use will need immediate assistance addressing the medical emergencies caused by the nuclear detonation. Allies could also be fearful of follow-on attacks; they will expect the United States to respond strongly to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies and partners have a significant role to play in the messaging following nuclear use. They must unite in loudly and publicly condemning the nuclear attacks and should do so repeatedly. They should communicate that using nuclear weapons in these scenarios was unacceptable and neither nation will gain from using these weapons. These messages are key to reestablishing the nuclear taboo following nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-response-options-1&quot;&gt;Military Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most challenging question facing the U.S. president after nuclear use by the PRC and the RF is how to respond to the nuclear attacks. The following section offers options for a military response that aligns with the strategic goals discussed in the section on U.S. strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT’S MILITARY OPTIONS IN THE EVENT OF STRATEGIC DETERRENCE FAILURE? WHICH OF THESE OPTIONS WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO THE PRESIDENT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Chinese and Russian nuclear attacks, the president will hear many arguments that they must respond with nuclear weapons to signal strength and resolve. Some advisors will argue that responding without nuclear weapons will lead the adversaries to counter with another round of nuclear use. Others will warn that adversaries will perceive a nuclear response as escalatory and set the world on a dangerous path of nuclear exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendations for the U.S. response to this notional scenario are based on the following assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption 1: Leaders may be unable to control nuclear escalation.&lt;/strong&gt; Responding to the initial nuclear attacks with a U.S. or NATO nuclear attack makes it more likely that the United States will find itself engaging in tit-for-tat nuclear exchanges than if it does not initially respond with nuclear weapons. Once this contest of nerves begins, it could be exceedingly difficult to stop. Even if both sides do not want to escalate, in the fog of war, circumstances may add escalation pressures. For example, misinterpretations about the goals of adversary nuclear attacks (such as regime change or undermining command and control centers) could lead to escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, nuclear-armed states could face other types of accidents, mistakes, or misinterpretations that could lead to nuclear use. There are several historical examples of such mistakes. For instance, during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, an errant U2 pilot, an accidentally inserted nuclear attack training tape, and even a black bear in Duluth, Minnesota, could have led to a nuclear war that neither side wanted. Additionally, leaders below the commander in chief could conduct unauthorized attacks that could lead to further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that the theater nuclear use is far from a strategic nuclear exchange and does not present a risk of all-out nuclear war. In this argument, there is a clear and meaningful line between theater (or tactical) nuclear weapons and strategic nuclear weapons. It assumes that leaders could use tactical weapons but remain “below” the strategic threshold. There is little evidence to know whether this is true, and it could be a very costly and dangerous assumption to make. This argument of a clear demarcation between tactical and strategic weapons also has the unintended consequences of reifying three categories of weapons: conventional weapons, theater nuclear weapons, and strategic nuclear weapons. Whether intentional or not, this argument leads to the appearance that theater nuclear weapons are acceptable and thus more usable. And while smaller nuclear weapons do less damage, the damage is still significant and indicates a violation of a long-standing taboo. Furthermore, it is not clear if other leaders share the same assumption that there is a clear divide between employing theater and strategic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, significant destruction could occur if both sides begin employing nuclear weapons. This is unprecedented territory, and no one can predict with certainty what will happen. The potential destruction caused by nuclear escalation poses too great of a risk to make the ex ante assumption that leaders can fully manage this risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption 2: Military responses that lead to public humiliation of Putin and Xi are not likely to lead to preferred U.S. objectives.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the few checks on their decisionmaking, their regional and global ambitions, and their obsessions with legacy, it worth considering how to minimize actions that serve to humiliate Xi and Putin. For this reason, the West should explore finding the right balance between responses that are conducted in the open and those that can be conducted with plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumption 3: To be deterred from further escalation, Xi and Putin must be fearful of follow-on actions.&lt;/strong&gt; If the United States does not respond strongly to the nuclear attack, it will confirm that Xi and Putin were correct that the United States has lower stakes in both regions relative to the PRC and RF. The responses to the attack must be costly in terms of destruction of adversary capabilities — though not necessarily with nuclear weapons — and indicate that more attacks could follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy recommendation:&lt;/strong&gt; Given the extreme danger of beginning a process of nuclear exchange with U.S. adversaries and the fact that the adversaries may use nuclear weapons again regardless of U.S. and allied action, it is prudent to retaliate with punishing nonnuclear responses that are both public and clandestine. The United States should conduct timely and precise conventional attacks on adversary military bases or installations to degrade their military capabilities. Targeting should not include command and control capabilities, which could be perceived as escalatory. Moreover, these attacks should be reported to the public. This strong conventional response signals both that nuclear use will be punished and that the United States does not need to resort to nuclear use to do considerable damage to the adversary’s military capabilities. At the same time, the U.S. should signal its readiness to conduct limited nuclear operations, if necessary, by moving dual-capable aircraft and submarines to the regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should accompany these conventional attacks with clear assurances both in public and private that the United States does not seek regime change in the PRC or the RF. While in general the United States would prefer fewer authoritarian governments, in this conflict scenario, making adversaries believe their lives and governments are at risk could lead to further nuclear escalation. As prospect theory informs us, those in the domain of losses — as China and Russia would be in this scenario — are willing to take great risks. The United States simply seeks a reversion to the pre-conflict status quo. If either foreign leader assesses that regime change is a goal of the West, the conflict could quickly escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these conventional attacks, the United States should consider clandestine operations employing special forces teams that would degrade adversary military capabilities. These attacks do not need to be as immediate as the conventional attacks, but they should surprise the adversaries in terms of the damage done. If there are novel capabilities not employed by the West previously, this would be a suitable time to use them. The goal of these nonpublic attacks is to degrade enemy capabilities and demonstrate U.S. capabilities to adversary leadership with the plausible deniability of secret operations. PRC and RF leaders will not be forced to discuss these attacks in public and thus the potential humiliation or backlash that could come from these attacks is less likely. In other words, these operations should do serious damage while allowing Putin and Xi to save face. Once these actions have taken place, the United States should offer off-ramps to the RF and the PRC, while also making clear that the United States will continue fighting and may have to resort to nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT ARE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A MILITARY RESPONSE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant immediate risk is nuclear escalation. Other risks include the PRC and RF retaliating against the U.S. homeland and allies by other means, including conventional, cyber, or space attacks. The risks of not responding, however, include a loss of U.S. credibility, a breakdown in the U.S. alliance system, and a further weakening of the rules-based global order. Moreover, perceptions of “successful” use of nuclear weapons could increase proliferation pressures around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-kinetic-response-options-1&quot;&gt;Non-Kinetic Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to military responses to nuclear use, there are several other means by which the United States and its allies can pursue the primary and secondary strategic goals discussed previously. The president, with allies, should take non-kinetic actions against the RF and PRC to punish the use of nuclear weapons and demonstrate the costly repercussions of nuclear use. These actions should be taken along with the military responses described above. Potential non-kinetic responses include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial punishments:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States could utilize the tools of the global financial system to hurt the PRC and RF economies. These tools may have limited utility in 2027, however, as both countries have worked to limit, to the extent possible, their economic vulnerabilities. Additional use of these tools may be necessary, but they will further the decoupling of adversaries from the global economic system led by the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberattacks:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should consider conducting cyberattacks on the adversaries that are initially limited and measured, but which signal the possibility of pursuing attacks with greater effect if the conflict continues. This action does risk a dangerous escalation of cyber conflict — also unprecedented to date — so these actions must be calibrated very carefully. Attacks should avoid military command and control capabilities or otherwise blinding the adversary in such a way that they misinterpret the attacks as being the prelude to a larger attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diplomatic statements:&lt;/strong&gt; In the days and weeks following the nuclear attacks, U.S. and allied leaders should make strong statements to all audiences — foreign and domestic — about how the PRC and RF have broken a long-standing taboo in international relations. In addition, Washington should work with allies and all other like-minded states to write and publicize a unified statement of condemnation from leaders around the world (with as diverse a geographic grouping as possible). In addition, a UN General Assembly resolution, such as the one following Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022, would help send the message that the international community disapproves of the nuclear use. These condemnations may not affect RF and PRC actions in the immediate term, but the lack of global condemnation following the first nuclear use since World War II would undermine the nuclear taboo moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making public statements about the nuclear attacks, the United States and its allies must consider how other members of the international community will perceive nuclear use — namely, was it successful for the attackers? The most important message to convey will be that nuclear attacks do not allow states to succeed in territorial aggrandizement. The existing global nuclear order has dealt with many challenges to date, and this nuclear use would be a grave one, but there are indications that the order would be able to survive this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth emphasizing here that improving U.S. and allied relations with states within the Global South before this notional conflict in 2027 is paramount. Though the international community broadly supported the 2022 UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine, there have been fewer governments that have unilaterally condemned the attack or Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling, even among members of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a treaty that explicitly bans nuclear threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notional 2027 scenario discussed in this paper would pose significant challenges to U.S. leadership in the immediate and longer term. At best, the 82-year-old nuclear taboo is broken but further nuclear escalation is prevented. The United States is able to end both conflicts on favorable terms that punish the adversary’s militaries for nuclear use. Taiwan remains an autonomous democracy with a strong economy. Allies and partners remain committed to their security arrangements with the United States. Competition between the United States and both powers continues, but the PRC and RF are chastened. The message is clear that the use of nuclear weapons is not a means of achieving geopolitical goals, and the norm against their use is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst outcome is almost too horrible to imagine but must be contemplated: large nuclear exchanges that devastate massive swaths of nations on all sides of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the middle of these extremes, a large nuclear conflict is averted, but the use of nuclear weapons and the resulting fear of being targeted make allies and partners reconsider whether they want to be in a defensive alliance. In a world with fewer allies and partners, Washington would lose a great deal of influence to shape the norms and institutions that make up the global order. This outcome likely would hasten the end of any remaining notion of a U.S.-led global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because so much is at stake, the most significant takeaway from this analysis is the importance of trying to deter such conflict in the first place. As described above, there are several ways in which the United States can improve readiness and signal its resolve. Once nuclear weapons are used in war, one cannot predict how conflict will escalate. Because nuclear weapons present an existential threat to humanity, there is nothing more important than avoiding nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;presidential-prudence-and-responding-to-strategic-deterrence-failure&quot;&gt;Presidential Prudence and Responding to Strategic Deterrence Failure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. presidents, their advisers, and military planners must take seriously the possibility of limited nuclear use by adversaries in a range of plausible future contingencies. Resorting to the first use of nuclear weapons may appear attractive to U.S. adversaries as a means of seeking undeniable military and political advantage while simultaneously communicating exceptional resolve, risk acceptance, and stakes. In this way, the detonation of one — or multiple — nuclear weapons with deliberately lower yields on strictly military targets in the course of a conventional war or an intense crisis could compel the president of the United States, in their capacity as commander-in-chief, to weigh several risky response options, none of which may be particularly optimal across the full set of U.S. national objectives as articulated in peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Thomas Schelling observed in 1961, reflecting contemporaneously on the Berlin crisis (1958–1961), intense crises between nuclear-armed adversaries are usefully conceived of as games of competitive risk-taking, where the military effects of nuclear use may be a secondary consideration to the resolve conveyed. “We should plan for a war of nerve, of demonstration, and of bargaining, not of tactical target destruction,” Schelling observed. He added that should the United States resort to the use of nuclear weapons against Soviet military targets over Berlin, “destroying the target is incidental to the message the detonation conveys to the Soviet leadership.” For Schelling, prevailing in the crisis over Berlin would require “impress[ing] the Soviet leadership with the risk of general war — a war that may occur whether we or they intend it or not.” Limited nuclear use — or limited nuclear war — thus was an option meant specifically to communicate to the Soviet Union that the United States would be willing to tolerate exceptionally high risks to achieve the political ends it sought at the time. Today, military planners contemplating limited nuclear use may believe that target choice is more than an incidental matter; however, impressing on the adversary the prospect of an uncontrollable lurch toward Armageddon will remain central to such a choice. Adversaries need not be irrational or deliberately seeking nuclear escalation to contemplate such actions; all it may take for limited nuclear use to be attractive is that adversary leaders see that step as being less bad than the alternatives, which may include conventional defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schelling’s prescriptions, written in 1961, may appear somewhat uncontroversial to U.S. audiences familiar with the history of the Cold War and U.S. interests in central Europe in the 1960s. Yet it is not inconceivable that should Russia, China, or North Korea choose in the twenty-first century to rationally resort to limited, nuclear first-use, their calculations will rest on a similar logic. Just as a U.S. president might have resorted to a nuclear detonation to convey a greater stake in the fate of Berlin to the Soviet leadership in 1961, so too might Russian president Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, or North Korean leader Kim Jong Un seek to “impress” on a U.S. president that running a risk of a general — possibly spasmodic — nuclear war over nuclear strikes on military targets is simply a risk not worth running. This logic underscoring the potential appeal of limited nuclear use is essentially deductive. To be sure, any nuclear use by U.S. adversaries would represent a world-altering event and the unambiguous manifestation of what U.S. deterrence planners consider “strategic deterrence failure,” but there remains a meaningful difference between successful war termination between nuclear-armed adversaries following limited nuclear use and war termination after a large-scale nuclear exchange. This difference may, quite literally, be measured in the millions-of-human-lives lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Atom study asks its authors to consider a particularly sobering scenario of limited nuclear use. U.S. adversaries — specifically, Russia and China — escalate to limited nuclear use in order to compel the United States to back away from continuing military action. In the scenario assigned to the authors, both Russia and China resort to nuclear first-use, paired with signals designed to convey their willingness to run greater risks than the United States. In the scenario, both Beijing and Moscow reference each other’s military actions, including the other’s nuclear strikes, and a strong collusive logic appears to drive each adversary’s willingness to run risks. While such a scenario may not cohere to how subject matter experts versed in the decisionmaking and bureaucratic idiosyncrasies of the Russian and Chinese political systems might conceive of pathways to limited nuclear use by those states, it represents something close to a worst-case scenario for strategic deterrence failure manifesting in near-simultaneous nuclear use by two near-peer U.S. adversaries in different theaters. Notably, the scenario also features a resort to nuclear use by both adversaries following exceptional U.S. and allied conventional successes: in Europe, the United States’ NATO allies successfully seize a substantial portion of Russia’s Kaliningrad Oblast and, in the Indo-Pacific, the United States successfully interdicts an amphibious invasion force destined for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the problem described above and the prescribed scenario, this paper answers the query posed by the Project Atom study — namely, how the United States should respond to limited nuclear use — by centering the role of the U.S. president in nuclear decisionmaking. U.S. presidents, despite their limited briefings on U.S. nuclear capabilities and policies in peacetime, are unlikely to reason about matters of intra-war deterrence, escalation control, and war termination in a real crisis in the same manner that nuclear strategists writing about these matters in peacetime from their comfortable perches at research institutes might. Put simply, presidents are likely to be inordinately fearful of general nuclear war in the aftermath of limited nuclear use and averse to the possibility of even a single nuclear warhead detonating on U.S. territory. This may be the case even if presidential advisers and intelligence assessments do not necessarily ascribe a high probability to further nuclear escalation in the prescribed scenario. Given that the president is solely imbued with the authority to issue valid and legal orders to release nuclear weapons, any analysis of likely and plausible U.S. response options must center how current and future presidents may weigh response options. Despite however many options are in place or requirements provided in peacetime, a U.S. president cannot be compelled by their military advisers to seek any particular course of action in a given crisis. Given this, this paper largely argues that should Russia and China resort to partially collusive, deliberate, limited nuclear use in simultaneous crises, as specified in the Project Atom scenario, most plausible U.S. presidents — individuals who are overwhelmingly likely to be politicians, unversed in the finer points of nuclear strategy — will likely be compelled to stand down instead of engaging in competitive nuclear risk-taking. These men and women, whoever they may be, are overwhelmingly likely to find themselves worrying about the prospect of general nuclear war — or the “final failure” — as John F. Kennedy once did at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is true, there is little doubt that several self-professed U.S. national objectives as articulated in peacetime would come under substantial stress, with potentially far-reaching consequences for U.S. grand strategy and foreign policy. This is ultimately the cost of strategic deterrence failure and why the United States must take the prospect of averting any nuclear use anywhere seriously. Other scenarios, including those featuring opportunistic limited nuclear use by one peer, may lead a president to accept greater risks, but this is outside of the scope of this study. As this essay will discuss, prudent planning for such failure can ensure that a U.S. president that may choose to avoid running the risk of nuclear escalation remains able to seek a world after strategic deterrence failure that is somewhat favorable for the United States. This can also be a world where the consequences of having resorted to limited nuclear use do not entail strategic victory for Russia and China, but rather a narrow, costly, pyrrhic victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fundamental-questions-for-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Fundamental Questions for the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reasoning about possible responses to strategic deterrence failure manifesting in limited nuclear use, U.S. leaders, advisers, and planners must be clear about the key national objectives and their relative levels of priority. In the event of strategic deterrence failure, the chief U.S. objective should be to ensure the avoidance of a general, unlimited nuclear war that could lead to fundamentally unacceptable levels of damage against the U.S. homeland as a result of adversary counterforce or countervalue strikes. Democratically elected U.S. presidents, charged by voters with defending the homeland, are likely to consider any nuclear attacks on U.S. territory as tantamount to unacceptable damage. Despite the somewhat methodical Cold War origins of this terminology, in the context of the given scenario, presidents are unlikely to be persuaded by their military advisers that the United States can ride out limited nuclear strikes and continue to exist as it did precrisis. This consideration presents an obvious and uncomfortable source of friction with U.S. assurances to allies as delivered in peacetime, a matter to which we will return later in this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding general kinetic damage against the homeland in the course of an ongoing war should thus be a key consideration for the president and should be prioritized above all other considerations, including, in the context of the scenario, supporting Taiwanese and Ukrainian objectives, supporting NATO and East Asian allies, and generally preserving the international order. These goals will remain operative but are fundamentally secondary to the survival and protection of the U.S. homeland. Because strategic deterrence failure of any magnitude is likely to be a world-altering event, it is quite likely that the precise circumstances of initial adversary nuclear use should cause a reassessment of key U.S. objectives. While the prescriptions that follow will make for unsettling reading in allied capitals, they should not be taken as a recommendation for the United States to exit the business of extended deterrence altogether. There are several plausible limited nuclear use scenarios that do not feature collusion as outlined in the Project Atom scenario where U.S. presidents may be substantially more willing to run risks in the defense of allies, but the scenario at hand here presents a particularly devilish predicament: the possibility of follow-on collusion by Moscow and Beijing in a general nuclear war against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, strategic deterrence failure should not paralyze the United States in its ability to respond entirely. While restoring the territorial status quo ex ante in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific in the given scenario may not be possible at acceptable levels of cost to the United States, Washington should nevertheless seek to dissuade and deter further adversary nuclear use and terminate conflict on terms that would be deemed acceptable, if not entirely favorable. Critically, following strategic deterrence failure, U.S. adversaries will be correct in their assessment that their stakes — over Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively — are greater than those of the United States given the objectives articulated above. This is especially likely to be the case if Putin and Xi resorted to nuclear use out of desperation to preserve their political control and out of a belief that maintaining their territorial integrity requires running the risk of a nuclear exchange over these territories. Even if U.S. grand strategy and decades of investment in a global order that seeks to proscribe aggressive territorial revisionism may be at risk, many presidents may nevertheless opt for prudence in averting escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the president’s advisers might point out that Russia and China, like the United States, would also be fearful of a general nuclear war — undoubtedly correctly — and that the U.S. nuclear force is survivable to the point of assuring their destruction should escalation prove uncontrollable, prudent presidential leadership would still have to consider the stepwise process of escalation after a U.S. nuclear response. As a result, the prioritization of the survival of the United States as a key national objective is likely to prompt such a prudent president to abstain from responses that could heighten the probability of a general nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the president should be ready to employ the full array of tools from across the diplomacy-information-military-economics (DIME) spectrum to achieve the above-stated U.S. objectives as well as possible. Many of these steps can be planned for and conceived of well outside the immediate confines of a crisis, including the crises specified in the Project Atom scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing adversary nuclear use and strategic deterrence failure will rest on manifesting in the mind of adversarial leaders the prospect of intolerable costs should they proceed, while simultaneously conveying that nuclear use is unlikely to confer tactical or strategic benefit. For both Putin and Xi, the most substantial cost likely relates to their personal political control over their respective states. While the United States should not unambiguously indicate that any nuclear use would lead to an end of their regimes, its declaratory signaling should maintain calculated ambiguity while conveying that catastrophic costs would ensue. While deterrence should prioritize a willingness to hold at risk what adversaries value most, threatening the personal political control or broader regime security of nuclear-armed great power adversaries is unlikely to advance U.S. interests — either in the scenario at hand or in general terms. Issuing such signals, by contrast, is likely to powerfully disabuse adversaries of any deliberate restraint that may still seem valuable after their limited nuclear use, rendering the prospect of follow-on uncontrollable escalation far more likely. In essence, such signaling by the United States would have the effect of further heightening the stakes for adversarial leaders to essentially existential levels concerning their personal political control. Successful war termination for the United States following limited nuclear use will require forbearance on such messaging. A practical problem for the United States, however, will be its noisy domestic political environment, where prominent political figures, including lawmakers from the president’s own party and the opposition, will likely issue calls for regime change or at least the removal of these leaders. U.S. adversaries will likely be unable to disentangle this “noise” from the “signal” of deliberate presidential messaging and assurances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At higher levels of escalation — particularly, follow-on strikes initiated by Russia and China — U.S. messaging could adopt the position that general nuclear war is a real possibility and would mean the effective end of Putin’s and Xi’s political control. The United States should simultaneously seek to maintain a robust set of flexible and responsive conventional capabilities, including capabilities forward-deployed to both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. It should also seek to enable its allies and partners in the regions to proffer similar capabilities while ensuring integrated military planning and operations with these allies. Critically, U.S. messaging in the course of a crisis prior to strategic deterrence failure should be contingent: emphasizing that consequences will befall adversaries should they choose to transgress the nuclear threshold, but that, by contrast, those same consequences will not befall adversaries should they choose to abstain from nuclear employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-strategic-objectives-2&quot;&gt;U.S. Strategic Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is useful to reflect on the factors inherent in the scenario that appear to precipitate a resort by both Russia and China to limited nuclear use. In the scenario, the most critical cause of strategic deterrence failure appears to be the result of two factors. First, leaders in both Russia and China, fearing conventional defeat and having experienced substantial conventional setbacks, are likely primed to reach into their nuclear holsters. Successful conventional denial, in other words, prompts these leaders to view nuclear weapons as a useful offset — for tactical, strategic, and psychological reasons. Second, both Putin and Xi appear to believe — probably correctly — that nuclear use will powerfully convey both their resolve and the substantial asymmetry in stakes that exists for them versus the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may further believe that despite professed U.S. diplomatic and other assurances to allies in peacetime, a U.S. president in wartime may be deterred from employing disproportionate force, including through the use of nuclear weapons, if necessary, due to the prospect of uncontrollable escalation. Within the confines of the scenario, deterrence failure may have been averted through protracted conventional warfighting, even if this would entail substantial costs to the armed forces of the United States and its allies. Swift conventional success by the United States and its allies appears to have been a powerful motivator for both Russia and China to reach for their nuclear holsters. Deterrence failure in the scenario in no small part appears to be intertwined with both Putin and Xi fundamentally miscalculating the odds of conventional victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the Indo-Pacific and Europe, the United States’ core objectives prior to strategic deterrence failure are to deter significant escalation, to preserve the territorial status quo, to reassure its allies, and to preserve the international norm against territorial conquest. Following strategic deterrence failure, no objective should be greater for the U.S. president than ensuring that the survival of the country is not threatened by the prospect of uncontrollable escalation into a general nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victory for the United States within the presented scenario is far from straightforward despite the formidable conventional successes of allied forces in Europe and U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific. A president and their expert advisers may disagree on the precise contours of victory in a crisis like the one envisaged in the scenario — just as President Kennedy and many of the key ExComm members (with the exception of George Ball) disagreed about the advisability of the Jupiter deal in the final days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. After strategic deterrence failure, a president may be rendered exceptionally sober by the prospect of general nuclear war — what Kennedy called the “final failure” — and be willing to take exceptional steps to seek prompt war termination, even on terms that would have been nominally unacceptable to that same president prior to adversary nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, should a president choose to accept the risk of further nuclear escalation and retaliate in kind — either with nuclear weapons or a massive conventional attack — victory could amount to a decision by the adversary to seek termination of the conflict to avoid further damage to their nations or their political control. Because this latter option is far more contingent and depends on variables that may be fundamentally unknowable in the midst of a crisis (such as Putin’s and Xi’s proximal risk acceptance), it bears substantially greater risks. Should the U.S. president seek to sue for war termination following adversary nuclear use, there likely would be severe, unprecedented, and — from the vantage point of peacetime — intolerable consequences to how the United States’ capability to project power globally, to reassure allies at a distance, and to hold global leadership would be perceived. In such an event, the casualty would largely be the United States’ extended deterrence guarantees; a U.S. president would have palpably demonstrated that they are unwilling to run the risk of a nuclear war that could cause damage to the homeland to back its allies. But, in general, the United States would be able to maintain robust deterrence of adversaries for other scenarios, such as attacks on U.S. territory itself. The potentially fatal blow to the U.S. system of extended deterrence thus further underscores the severity of any strategic deterrence failure scenario involving limited nuclear use, but especially the collusive scenario articulated in Project Atom. As mentioned earlier, this analysis should not be taken as a repudiation of extended deterrence, but instead as an appraisal of the challenges to sustaining U.S. allied commitments in the aftermath of the precise limited nuclear use scenario at hand. Even if the course of action recommended here may heighten the probability of allied nuclear proliferation, this outcome — with its many uncertainties — may be preferable to inviting greater escalation by resorting to reciprocal nuclear attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assuring-allies-2&quot;&gt;Assuring Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks of allies questioning U.S. credibility in the event of strategic deterrence failure are substantial and likely insurmountable in the context of the scenario provided if Washington pursues a course of action that prioritizes its own national survival and immunity from nuclear attack. Allied leaders and a U.S. president will likely have a divergent sense of risk acceptance following strategic deterrence failure. For the presidents of the Philippines and Poland, in particular, nuclear use on their territories will be seen as a cataclysmic deterrence failure verging on an existential threat. For the United States, that same assessment would not hold, but the possibility of further damage in a general nuclear war would likely cause any prudent U.S. president to weigh the trade-off in supporting allies and averting damage to the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are likely conventional options that the president could adopt to inflict military costs on adversaries for nuclear use that would maintain an acceptable level of risk of follow-on nuclear escalation, but these may be insufficient for allied leaders and publics that could be motivated to see a U.S. nuclear response out of a desire for retributive damage against Russia and China. As a result, it is highly likely that following strategic deterrence failure, allied perceptions of the credibility of the United States would suffer drastically unless Washington opted for nuclear use in kind, which would present substantial risks and is unlikely to be preferable to the alternatives presented to most plausible presidents. As much as expert advisers to any president might profess support for U.S. alliances in peacetime, they might find that in the heart of a bona fide nuclear crisis, concerns about credibility are simply unpersuasive to a president concerned first and foremost with averting a pathway to nuclear war. This was precisely the predicament that arose in the final days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when several ExComm members were opposed to Kennedy’s willingness to contemplate an off-ramp by way of withdrawing U.S. intermediate-range missiles deployed to Turkey, a NATO ally. Notably, adversary limited nuclear use against allies may be unlikely to prompt the same kind of national outrage and fervor that drove the United States to run risks in the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor (1941) and September 11 (2001) attacks on the homeland. The sole exception may be the Chinese strike specified in the scenario, which hits a U.S. naval base and presumably results in the deaths of thousands of U.S. servicemembers. This could encourage a president to accept greater risks in responding to China, though likely still well under the nuclear threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A president may further inquire how best to signal resolve to U.S. allies throughout the crisis. They may then be told that the most effective means of signaling resolve to allies would be to meet adversary nuclear use with some form of proportionate nuclear use. There are substantial risks to this, however. First, a proportionate response in the eyes of U.S. military planners may be interpreted as escalatory by the adversary and, therefore, potentially could prompt further escalation. Second, by employing nuclear weapons, the United States would concede substantial normative credibility that could be valuable in shaping global diplomatic narratives in a post-conflict environment (including with nonaligned states). The United States could aim to signal resolve to allies by inflicting calibrated, proportionate damage against adversary forces implicated in the nuclear strikes described in the scenario with its conventional forces. This is unlikely to sufficiently convey resolve as allies may not find a conventional response to nuclear use on their territory as satisfactory. While allies may not be uniform in this assessment of a conventional response, U.S. experts and officials, in consultations with allies, from East Asia to Europe, repeatedly contend with demands that nuclear use be met with nuclear retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-response-options-2&quot;&gt;Military Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four basic categories of military response that could be considered in the course of the Project Atom scenario. First, a U.S. president could choose to forgo all military options and focus solely on war termination by diplomatic means. Second, a U.S. president could opt for a conventional response — either one designed to inflict tailored, proportionate damage, or one designed to disproportionately retaliate for nuclear use without employing nuclear weapons. Third, a U.S. president could opt for a nuclear response designed to inflict tailored, proportionate damage. Finally, a U.S. president could opt to seek escalation dominance and up the ante with significant nuclear use while communicating to the adversary U.S. resolve to escalate further should it be necessary to accomplish U.S. and allied objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of these options, the first and second will hold the greatest practical appeal for any prudent U.S. president, who is unlikely to be versed in the strategic rationales for an in-kind or escalatory nuclear response and more concerned with preserving the safety, integrity, and survival of the United States itself. The first option may be unappealing, however, due to it appearing tantamount to complete strategic defeat. (Presidents may consider their own political legacies in weighing responses too.) Following strategic deterrence failure, there is likely an extremely low probability that the United States can, at acceptable levels of risk to the homeland, optimize for all its core strategic objectives, including reassuring its allies. As a result, a prescription for the president could be two-fold. First, they should opt for a limited conventional strike against the nonstrategic and regional nuclear force units involved in the strikes against Poland and the Philippines. At the same time, the president should employ a diplomatic strategy that seeks to persuade these allies as to the inadvisability of a nuclear response, which could beget further nuclear use against their territories (including against nonmilitary targets or military targets more proximal to population centers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While allies may be unpersuaded and motivated by a retributive logic demanding nuclear use, it is equally possible that internal fissures within allied governments and domestic political forces may support U.S. goals in persuading allies of the sufficiency of a conventional response. To deter further nuclear use by adversaries, the president should be willing to allude to intolerable and extreme consequences while underscoring to the broader world that the United States differentiates itself from Russia and China in viewing nuclear weapons as tools of last resort for truly extreme circumstances — not as a mere offset to the possibility of conventional defeat, as Moscow and Beijing have demonstrated in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics may counter that Russia and China resorted to nuclear use precisely because of U.S. and allied conventional military successes — and so why should a conventional response deter further nuclear use? The answer to this question rests on the logic of nuclear use by both countries in the first place. If both leaders crossed the nuclear Rubicon out of a belief that a single instance of limited nuclear use would paralyze the United States into inaction, the willingness to continue conventional military operations would disabuse them of this notion. By “fighting through” nuclear use and continuing to inflict costs without relying on nuclear weapons, the United States would deny Moscow and Beijing the political benefits of their limited nuclear use. Should Russia and China seek to deprive the United States of this option, they may be forced to opt for additional nuclear strikes against U.S. and allied forces, significantly raising the prospects of a total war across two hemispheres alongside the prospect of general nuclear war with the United States. If Putin and Xi remain rational, they may see no benefit in upping the ante in this game of competitive risk-taking, and instead may seek to minimize their further losses while retaining political control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for not recommending that the president seek a tailored nuclear response or adopt an escalation dominance mindset and seek to escalate with nuclear weapons is because both options present substantial drawbacks and an unacceptable level of risk of a general nuclear war that would be most ruinous to the United States. Even assuming a small probability of escalation by the adversary should be sobering for a president given the consequences that could ensue. In the case of a tailored nuclear response option, U.S. adversaries may fail to be deterred if they continue to believe that their stakes in resolving their short-term territorial conquests are greater than those of the United States. Putin and Xi would, in their own minds, likely be willing to believe this — especially if they see the stakes in the crises as having now grown to encompass their own political survivals and legacies. If this is the case, a tailored, proportionate U.S. nuclear response, even if correctly interpreted as proportionate by U.S. adversaries, may beget further adversary nuclear use. Neither Putin nor Xi may choose to escalate in the types of targets they choose to hold at risk — keeping retaliation confined to military targets — but could continue strikes on NATO and Philippine territory by focusing on military targets. The collusive logic that is at play in the scenario could also influence this decisionmaking as both Moscow and Beijing may understand that their continued choice to participate in a game of competitive nuclear risk-taking will force the United States to contend with the challenge of waging a general nuclear war simultaneously against both powers. Hewing to the damage-limiting principles that have guided U.S. nuclear strategy for decades simultaneously against Russia and China would be largely unfeasible, even if survivable U.S. systems could inflict massive damage in punishment against both aggressors. A collusive all-out nuclear attack by Russia and China against the United States with their surviving forces would still result in the practical end of U.S. civilization and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An escalation dominance approach, meanwhile, would succeed in conveying U.S. resolve and likely persuade Xi and Putin that their assumptions about U.S. stakes in these conflicts may be incorrect. However, a substantial use of nuclear weapons by the United States against military targets in Russia and China runs a serious risk of generating concerns in both states about the possibility of their forces remaining intact and about the viability of their regimes themselves. Without robust means of communication with the national or senior military leadership of both countries, which cannot be taken for granted, the United States may be unable to assure Russia and China that its choice to opt for nuclear escalation was not the precursor to a massive, damage-limiting counterforce campaign or a broader war of regime change. Fear of either outcome will encourage both Putin and Xi to contemplate larger-scale nuclear use. Because U.S. and allied combined military posture in the Indo-Pacific and Europe will also consist in the scenario timeframe of precise, conventional munitions, adversaries will have to also account for the possibility of massive, supplemental, conventional counterforce strikes. This option, while appealing for what it might convey about U.S. credibility to adversaries and allies alike, generates the greatest possibility of massive adversary nuclear use, which would result in unacceptable damage to the U.S. homeland. It would not be advisable for a president to run these risks immediately; instead, they should seek to maximize U.S. goals through the nonnuclear means articulated above, at least initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a meaningful difference between the preceding two options in terms of how they might prompt reactions from Russia and China. Russia, which is known to incorporate a degree of counterforce targeting itself, may be more willing than China to run greater risks by attempting to destroy U.S. nuclear forces preemptively. In the 2028 timeframe specified in the Project Atom scenario, China’s nuclear forces will remain quantitatively inferior to those of the United States, and Chinese leaders would likely be deterred by the prospect of assured U.S. retaliation. As a result, it is substantially more likely that, even if opting for escalation dominance, U.S.-China nuclear exchanges could take place across several steps before either side considers massive nuclear strikes against the other. Despite this, Chinese leaders may remain pathologically vulnerable to fears of a disarming U.S. counterforce strike; these fears could be compounded by 2028 with the deployment of additional missile defense and conventional long-range strike assets in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of U.S. objectives, it will be in the interest of the United States to have adversaries remain less concerned about the possibility of a massive, damage-limiting first strike than about limited retaliation (either nuclear or conventional). Additionally, the United States should endeavor to avoid feeding adversary expectations that it seeks to end their political control or regimes. The key to successful war termination will differ with regard to both Russia and China. For China and Xi, inflicting substantial enough damage to the People’s Liberation Army’s conventional and amphibious landing forces to render seizing and controlling Taiwan unfeasible will confer bargaining leverage. With Russia, the United States and NATO may try to use seized territory in Kaliningrad to sue for war termination with Putin. If either Putin or Xi begin to exhibit particular psychological pathologies indicating irrational risk acceptance (which cannot be ruled out), these assumptions may not hold, and the United States may be forced to contemplate greater escalation than might otherwise be prudent. Given the impossibility of predicting irrational decisionmaking pathologies in a serious nuclear crisis, further elaboration on this point will not be provided, though it does bear consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. planners must also consider the law of armed conflict. Adversaries will expect a U.S. nuclear or conventional response to adhere to publicly stated prewar principles, which include an emphasis on counterforce targeting and compliance with the law of armed conflict. This should rule out adversary expectations of countervalue strikes (deliberate attacks against major urban population centers and other nonmilitary targets). However, this will likely also heighten adversary fears about a possible damage-limiting strike against their nuclear forces, command and control, and other enabling capabilities. While the United States will be unable to disabuse adversaries of its long-stated interests in damage limitation, to the extent possible, any U.S. nuclear or substantial kinetic response should be accompanied by assurances that it does not seek to destroy adversary nuclear forces or sever adversary national leadership from key military functions. To this end, a response should be accompanied by public and private messaging (if feasible) designed to indicate tailored punishment against military units implicated in the execution of nuclear strikes. There is no reason the United States should deliberately seek to eschew the law of armed conflict in navigating responses to the scenario at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-kinetic-response-options-2&quot;&gt;Non-Kinetic Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president would have a wide array of non-kinetic options available in the event of strategic deterrence failure. Choices would include broad diplomatic messaging to allies, partners, and the nonaligned world aimed at obtaining unconditional condemnation of Russia and China for resorting to the first use of nuclear weapons in war in more than 80 years. The president could simultaneously marshal U.S. diplomatic resources to seek a broad, international coalition condemning both countries. It is likely that certain nonaligned states or states more aligned with Russia and China would opt to blame the United States for Russian and Chinese nuclear use, citing well-trodden narratives built up over years by Moscow and Beijing about U.S. alliances, military posture, and other factors. The United States should be ready to actively counter this, including by declassifying intelligence as much as possible to demonstrate that nuclear use was a result of desperation for both Putin and Xi. Given the severity of the scenario and the implications for U.S. interests, the president should be willing to authorize broad declassification that would serve these ends, even at the cost of possibly compromising sensitive sources and methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically, the United States would likely also seek to enhance international economic sanctions, but the efficacy of these sanctions is likely to be limited; in anticipation of a decision to employ nuclear weapons, Putin and Xi would likely have expected such a response and have been undeterred by the prospect, as their limited nuclear use exhibits. Other non-kinetic options could include cyber operations against both Russia and China. These could be carried out for a range of objectives, including sowing a narrative within both countries that seeks to convey to the Russian and Chinese people the erratic character of their national leadership; seeking intelligence on likely follow-on military action following deterrence failure; and, finally, undermining Russian and Chinese military operations. Out of caution, the president should ensure that U.S. offensive cyber operations, to the extent feasible, do not affect Russian or Chinese assertive political control over their own nuclear — or broader military — forces. In general, cyber operations, if detected, could prove escalatory. The president should be particularly cautious about authorizing operations aimed at penetrating sensitive systems related to strategic situational awareness or command and control, which could raise the fears in both states about non-kinetic interference in their nuclear forces either as an end in itself or as a precursor to broader counterforce strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chief purpose of U.S. non-kinetic efforts should be to maintain the normative higher ground, which will be valuable in a post-conflict environment with allies, partners, and nonaligned states alike. Even if allied governments view U.S. credibility as having taken a fatal hit following a decision to resort to a nonnuclear response, allied publics may be more readily persuaded by a U.S. choice to respond in a more limited fashion, particularly if Washington is able to make the case that opting for more escalatory responses would likely have resulted in nuclear strikes on their territories (and further nuclear strikes, in the case of Poland and the Philippines). For Russia and China, however, U.S. non-kinetic measures will largely be peripheral in shaping their cost-benefit calculations on further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be acknowledged that from the vantage point of peacetime in 2024, the above-stated analysis does not make for particularly encouraging reading. One does not need to have read this assessment of the scenario and U.S. response options to conclude that the strategic deterrence scenario presented likely portends “defeat” for the United States. However, this defeat should be construed narrowly: the United States likely fails to compel Russia and China away from seeking their territorial revisionist goals at substantial cost, but ultimately survives as a nation and polity to restore and seek influence in a post-conflict world. Writing about potential nuclear crises demands an abundance of imagination, and U.S. policymakers and planners should be clear-eyed about the possibilities that would remain for the country in a post-strategic deterrence failure world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centrality of presidential decisionmaking about nuclear crises represents both a strength and a weakness in the analysis above. It is a strength because it contends with the often-heard dictum that military plans “never survive first contact with the enemy” — partly because reality is complex and inherently unpredictable, but also because the ineffable idiosyncrasies of presidential decisionmaking can only become known under the psychological and emotional stress of a real crisis. However, the choice to center the president and presidential guidance also represents an analytical limitation in reasoning about U.S. responses to limited nuclear use because it is inherently impossible to account for the various personalities that may one day be asked to reason about matters of nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for U.S. allies, this scenario presents the crystallization of long-held anxieties about extended deterrence. Indeed, as much as U.S. policymakers may see peacetime assurance demands from allies as a leaky sieve, they are born of well-placed anxieties about extended deterrence failing under extreme circumstances. Allied fears in this regard are not entirely misplaced and there are indeed scenarios, at the worst-case end of the spectrum, involving collusion by the United States’ two great power, near-peer, nuclear-armed adversaries that will bend and possibly break assurances made in peacetime. The Project Atom scenario could be one such example. Analytically, however, this should not condemn extended deterrence to the status of a bluff. Instead, the United States and its allies should be ready to consult, plan, and game out various strategic deterrence failure scenarios to ensure that they can be averted in the first place. For instance, in the provided scenario, it appears that escalation to nuclear use by Russia in the European theater was driven by Polish and Lithuanian conventional operations into Kaliningrad without a central decision by NATO or broader consultations with the United States. Ensuring coordination and strategic synchronicity between the United States and its allies will be key to avoiding the worst in high-intensity conventional crises. Finally, beyond the working- and expert-level tracks, U.S. assurances must be supplemented by high-level political engagement with allies, underscoring in particular the special role of the president in U.S. nuclear decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, this analysis should also underscore the essential importance of averting strategic deterrence failure in the first place. The hard choices U.S. nuclear-armed adversaries could force upon the United States by resorting to limited nuclear use are ones no president should be asked to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though much is known about nuclear explosions — their physics, their mechanics, their effects — very little is known about their use as weapons of war. History provides analysts a single war in which nuclear weapons were detonated, and a small number of occasions in which decisionmakers are known to have seriously contemplated their use. This record is thin gruel upon which to make compelling inferences, or from which to draw solid conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A paucity of empirical data, however, is not evidence that nuclear weapons cannot — or will never — be used again. Nor does it exempt civilian policymakers and military practitioners from the responsibility of preparing to make choices about nuclear employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers confronting a situation in which they find it necessary to consider whether, when, which, and how many nuclear weapons to use will have to answer questions that are at once philosophical and practical, moral and material, urgent and permanent. If they are of stable temperament and rational inclination, then policymakers will seek methodical ways with which to weigh the value of nuclear restraint against that of nuclear action. Such approaches will produce clarity in defining strategic objectives and war aims, intellectual empathy for the adversary’s decision calculus, and creativity in the operational art of designing alternative military courses of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario analysis is one method for comparing the advantages and disadvantages of alternative courses of action and, for strategists and planners, serves the same purpose as practice does for teams in any discipline: it doesn’t make perfect, but it does make progress. Each phase of a scenario exercises the thought processes involved in aligning military operations with war aims, and war aims with strategic objectives, under conditions in which some variables that might affect the likelihood of success are foreseeable and controllable, and some are not. In this way, scenarios pull assumptions to the surface, inspect their implications, and then test courses of action for consistency of logic, fidelity to principle, and resiliency to changes in condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario analyses, however, are abstractions of reality accompanied by storytelling — theory, reasoning, and argumentation. This is especially true for nuclear scenarios. There is, therefore, special risk in attending too much to a scenario’s mechanics and not enough to the concepts and commitments it calls into question. If nuclear war does move from being a possibility to being a reality, whatever the specifics, there is no evading the fact that what policymakers will be deciding is which and how many humans will not survive, or if any will survive at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analytic-assumptions&quot;&gt;Analytic Assumptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy developed here is premised on analysis of a two-theater, two-adversary, two intra-war nuclear launch scenario (referred to throughout as “the scenario”). Where information is not available — either because it does not exist or because it is not specified in the scenario — the strategy relies on a set of reasonable assumptions. Some assumptions are about the dynamics of nuclear war, because there hasn’t been one from which to draw historical evidence. Some are about decisionmaking in the United States, about which relatively much is known in general, but nothing at all in the context of a two-theater war that involves nuclear use. Other assumptions are made about the scenario’s adversaries, because little information about their respective decisionmaking processes is available in the scenario itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no standard definition of what elevates nuclear use from being limited nuclear war to being general — “all-out” — nuclear war. In the 1960s, the U.S. government planned for its nuclear forces to be of a size and quality to be able to execute a retaliatory strike that would destroy “between 20 and 25 per cent of the enemy’s civilian population and between 50 and 75 per cent of his industrial capacity.” Applying this measure to the scenario means that general nuclear war would produce the immediate deaths of approximately 376–469 million people. A recent study by climate scientists calculates that if the belligerents in the scenario detonated sufficient warheads to achieve this mutual 25 percent casualty rate, then follow-on deaths from post-nuclear famine would reach approximately 2.5 billion people within two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of any less arbitrary threshold, this strategy defines the lower bound of general nuclear war as the detonation by any one state of the number of nuclear weapons needed to produce a total yield sufficient to kill 25 percent of a belligerent’s population. Detonations that occur below that threshold constitute limited, not general, nuclear war. The strategy similarly assumes, based on the above, that general nuclear war in the scenario would destroy modern civilization and might even constitute a species-extinction event for much of biological life on earth, including humans. It assumes that governments would cease to function, and that there would be no meaning attached to the idea of nationhood, as individuals and collectives would instead be left to struggle to survive. In other words, the strategy assumes that the costs of general nuclear war are so extremely negative that they far exceed any benefits derived from the defeat and unconditional surrender of the adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy also is built upon the recognition that there is no empirical basis upon which to make predictions about the dynamics of nuclear war. Specifically, once nuclear exchange has begun, there is no fact-based reason to presume that the likelihood of de-escalation, or of controlled escalation, is greater than the likelihood of unrestrained escalation. The strategy therefore assumes that all nuclear detonations have an unknown probability of creating an escalatory spiral, regardless of variation in their specific features — for example their type, location, yield, casualty rate, and so forth. Even relaxing this assumption and allowing the likelihood of escalation to general nuclear war to be low instead of unknown does not change the basic inequality. The magnitude of the costs of general nuclear war are so great that even very small probability estimates produce very large negative results — ones so destructive that they dwarf any possible positive results of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-strategic-objectives-3&quot;&gt;U.S. Strategic Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy presented here assumes that U.S. policymakers are rational actors. This means they are sensitive to the costs, benefits, and probabilities of various courses of action and base their choice of action on estimates of expected value: the net positive or negative effect on U.S. interests produced by the outcome of each course of action, multiplied by that outcome’s probability of occurring. The strategy also assumes that U.S. decisionmakers assess that the extreme costs of general nuclear war exceed any potential benefits derived from the adversary’s total destruction, and that they are aware that the detonation of any nuclear weapon has the potential to result in an escalatory cycle that ultimately produces general nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the set of nonnuclear outcomes, the strategy assumes that policymakers consider the benefits of conventional victory to be greater than those of a negotiated settlement, and that both are greater than the benefits of total defeat. It also assumes policymakers judge the value of maximalist victory — the unconditional surrender of the adversary — and of a negotiated settlement to be greater than the costs of conventional war because, in the absence of this assumption, the incentive would be for the United States to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expected values produced by these combinations of probabilities, costs, and benefits mean that U.S. policymakers will prefer all nonnuclear outcomes to all nuclear outcomes (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of information to the contrary, this strategy assumes that the scenario’s adversarial decisionmakers also are rational actors whose choices reflect their estimates of expected value. This assumption, however, does not require the adversaries to arrive at the same rank ordering of preferences over outcomes as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fHthMgu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Assumed U.S. Preferences over Outcomes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, preference hierarchies can be classified as one of two types. Type-1 actors estimate that the costs of general nuclear war exceed any benefits derived from the adversary’s total destruction, whether by nuclear or conventional means. A Type-1 actor will therefore prefer all nonuse outcomes to all nuclear-use outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type-2 actors do not consider the costs of general nuclear war to exceed any benefits derived from the adversary’s total destruction, whether by nuclear or conventional means. A Type-2 actor can therefore prefer one or more nuclear-use outcomes to one or more nonuse outcomes. One possibility in the scenario, for example, is that one or both of the adversaries assesses that the expected value of general nuclear war is equal to or greater than the expected value of a defeat that requires conceding their political objectives and surrendering (Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ev8PYwk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Example Rank Ordering of Rational Type-2 Adversary Preferences over Conflict Outcomes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If either adversary is a Type-2 actor, and it concludes that the United States has maximalist war aims and estimates the probability of conventional loss to be high, then this preference ordering makes the Type-2 adversary more likely than a Type-1 adversary to initiate nuclear war, and very unlikely to exercise restraint in waging it. Other preference orderings are possible, though for all rank order profiles the key differentiator between adversary type is the relative value placed on nuclear-nonuse outcomes compared to nuclear-use outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy makes assumptions about the United States, as outlined above, that define it as a Type-1 actor. This classification might be incorrect. Even if it is correct at conflict initiation, policymaker views might change once war is underway; so long as decisionmaking is driven by humans, the decisions they make will be vulnerable to variations caused by the full range of human biases, frailties, emotions, and impulses. Nonetheless, the United States is assumed here to be a firmly Type-1 actor because this assumption is consistent with the scenario’s emphasis on seeking to deter, rather than to fight, nuclear war. The strategy does not make the same assumption about the adversaries and instead accepts the possibility that each might be either Type-1 or Type-2 — not for lack of hope that they are the former and not the latter, but rather to account for the uncertainty that they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumed expected value calculations and resultant rank order establish preventing general nuclear war as the primary U.S. strategic objective. The secondary U.S. strategic objective is for there to be no additional nuclear detonation, of any type or yield, anywhere. This secondary objective is responsive to the horrific effects that all nuclear detonations have on humans, other animal species, and their habitats, and to the risk that additional nuclear launches might escalate to general nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the scenario, the United States has joined wars in two theaters after adversarial attacks on allies and partners. U.S. political objectives and war aims in both regions are twofold: to demonstrate intolerance for wars of choice and to retain the sovereignty and autonomy of U.S. allies and partners. Because policymakers cannot eliminate the possibility that the adversaries are Type-2 actors, and because the primary U.S. strategic objective is to achieve a nonuse outcome, U.S. warfighting strategy must start from the premise that for all belligerents there is a set of possible, acceptable political outcomes short of maximalism that they can accept. Seeking such an outcome requires implementing a U.S. warfighting strategy that uses diplomatic, economic, and military measures to communicate that the United States does not seek regime change or societal collapse. The strategy must also demonstrate nuclear restraint by not engaging in tit-for-tat nuclear actions, including posture, alert, or deployment changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assuring-allies-3&quot;&gt;Assuring Allies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. political objectives need to be supported, and its warfighting operations aided, by local allies in both regions in the scenario. Alliance discipline in communicating limited war aims is essential; inconsistent and mixed messages will undermine the ability of the United States to credibly signal both nuclear restraint and its desire to reach a mutually acceptable, negotiated settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As adversary confusion and the likelihood of misperception of U.S. intent increase, so does the likelihood of adversary nuclear use regionally and, ultimately, the likelihood of escalation to general nuclear war. The United States cannot impose signaling consistency upon its allies and partners, but they should regularly be reminded that mixed messages increase the risks of adversary nuclear use and escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the scenario, U.S. allies across and within the two theaters differ in their reasons for entering into conflict, in the type and extent of the material contributions they make, and in their respective war’s immediate effects on their interests. Some allies might be dissatisfied with non-maximalist U.S. political objectives and wish to press for the adversaries to surrender on allied terms. The United States should attempt to address this objection by reinforcing that the purpose of limiting possible actions (e.g., nuclear use or nonuse) is to protect the alliances’ shared interest in averting the least favorable conflict outcomes: concession to the adversaries’ maximalist demands, or an uncontrolled escalatory spiral that begins with nuclear detonations, perhaps on allied territories, and that ultimately leads to general nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies might also take the view that the unwillingness of the United States to make nuclear threats or to use nuclear weapons on their behalf undermines long-standing U.S. policies of extended deterrence, and therefore increases their risk of being a victim of a nuclear strike. This misperceives key features of the post-detonation environment. In the first instance, the United States’ nonuse strategic objectives render as equivalent the security interests of U.S. allies and of the United States itself — nonuse is definitionally an “extended” objective. In the second, an environment in which an adversary has used conventional and nuclear weapons to attack a U.S. ally is one in which U.S. extended nuclear deterrence — adversary inaction produced by the threat of nuclear consequence — has failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possible reasons for detonating a U.S. nuclear weapon thereafter are three: to punish the adversary; as an element of a strategy to try to reassure allies by demonstrating that the United States will use nuclear weapons on their behalf; or as one element of a strategy aimed at deterring adversaries from additional nuclear use. Policymakers cannot be confident that the likelihood of producing these effects is greater than the likelihood of producing an escalatory spiral ending in general nuclear war. Because the primary U.S. objective of this strategy is to prevent general nuclear war, this risk of escalation means that the United States cannot use a nuclear weapon to punish the adversary, to try to assure allies, or to try to establish U.S. credibility and, on that basis, implement a new strategy of deterrence. This does not mean that the United States is not committed to its allies and their vital national security interests during the war. It does mean, however, that the United States’ obligation to defend them is addressed by the ongoing conventional fight and the strategic U.S. objectives of preventing additional nuclear detonation and general nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-response-options-3&quot;&gt;Military Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving a nuclear nonuse outcome is commonly discussed under the rubric of intra-war deterrence. In this scenario, deterrence is applicable because military defeat of the adversaries is not possible. No matter how powerful and effective U.S. diplomatic, political, economic, and military measures are, they cannot render the adversary (or adversaries) incapable of continuing to fight: their nuclear arsenals will remain available for use even under conditions of international isolation, economic collapse, and conventional military defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategies of deterrence seek to alter adversary perceptions of the likelihood and magnitude of the benefits of an action in relation to the likelihood and magnitude of its costs. This assumes the actor is sensitive to costs, and that it has principles, people, objects, or assets that it values and prefers not to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logic of deterrence, however, does not capture the full set of possible motivations for an adversary’s nonuse of nuclear weapons. An actor might choose to exercise nuclear restraint for one or some combination of at least seven reasons (Table 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/M7FHeKM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Possible Reasons for Adversary Nuclear Nonuse and its Applicability in the Near-Term, Two-Theater, Intra-War Nuclear Use Scenario&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moral or ethical compunction and fear of technical failure can be considered if not impossible then at least highly unlikely to inhibit an actor from nuclear use in any conflict scenario in which that actor has already successfully detonated at least one nuclear weapon. In the scenario, it also is reasonable to assume that none of the belligerents is likely to assess that any one of them has the capability to mount a meaningfully protective defense against a concerted nuclear campaign. The United States therefore can seek to deter additional nuclear use through the threat of cost imposition — a strategy of conventional or nuclear deterrence — or it can seek to convince the adversaries to pursue a mutually acceptable, negotiated, political settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the scenario, U.S. adversaries first used conventional war to achieve political aims despite the threat of substantial resistance, continued to fight despite a decreasing likelihood of prevailing, then escalated horizontally by attacking a U.S. defense treaty ally, and finally escalated again vertically through the detonation of a nuclear weapon. The scenario does not contain sufficient information to make any analytically sound inferences about how or why the initial U.S. warfighting strategy failed to deter the adversaries from nuclear use. This strategy therefore interprets these behaviors as indicating that the scenario adversaries are highly cost tolerant, a characteristic that decreases the likelihood that strategies of deterrence through threats of cost-imposition will be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy assumes that in both theaters the initial U.S. conventional warfighting strategy was to impose conventional costs meaningful enough and substantial enough either to eliminate the adversary’s ability to continue to fight conventionally or to convince it to sue for peace — that is, to deter it from carrying on fighting. The scenario describes the war as ongoing, meaning that the United States has been unable to destroy the adversary’s conventional capabilities or to threaten the type and severity of costs that would convince it to abandon its war aims. Given that both adversaries detonated a nuclear weapon during the war, moreover, the conventional costs the United States imposed, and those it threatened, also were demonstrably not effective at deterring intra-war nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the United States would eventually identify and be able to threaten conventional costs that could hurt the adversary sufficiently in a way it didn’t anticipate and thereby deter further nuclear use or persuade it to concede. Pursuing such a strategy of deterrence, however, is high in uncertainty and, therefore, also in risk. It is not possible to know prior to making the threat or imposing the consequence that it will have the desired effect. Each such attempt has some probability of resulting in escalation to further adversary nuclear use, and there is no way to know if that probability is high or low. Even if the quality of intelligence assessments and other information about the disposition and preference of the adversaries is quite high, such information cannot eliminate uncertainty about the adversary’s likely course of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects produced by the threat of nuclear cost imposition in a strategy of intra-war deterrence are similarly uncertain. This approach risks cultivating the adversaries’ belief that they might be able to achieve their strategic or political objectives by engaging in nuclear brinkmanship and escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of encouraging rather than deterring adversary nuclear use applies equally to threats to and attacks on the adversaries’ nuclear infrastructure, via conventional kinetic or cyber weapons, including on units or sites from which a tactical nuclear strike has been launched. Such an action would not only run the risk of initiating an escalatory spiral, but the possible colocation of tactical with strategic nuclear weapons also means that strikes meant as limited retaliations might be misconstrued as strategic first strikes intended to deplete the adversary’s second-strike capability. In this scenario such a perception would therefore be expected to increase the likelihood that an adversary would launch a nuclear weapon, and perhaps execute a massive attack, possibly against nuclear assets or civilian targets in the U.S. homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. warfighting aims in each region therefore will be limited and focal. In both regions, U.S. warfighting strategy should use conventional forces to try to prevent either adversary from advancing the current lines of contact as described in the scenario, but not to advance the line of contact itself. All kinetic and cyber actions should target only adversary military units and assets. Attacks on the adversaries’ homelands should include only those military units and assets that have been directly engaged in conventional kinetic or confirmed cyber-warfighting activity, and all U.S. military actions should adhere to international humanitarian law. To the extent possible, the United States and allied forces should execute operational concepts that minimize the military utility of adversary tactical nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an adversary does detonate another nuclear weapon anywhere, then the U.S. intra-war deterrence strategy has failed, and the president will have to assess current conditions and decide whether to continue to fight conventionally or to concede. The United States should not respond with its own use of a nuclear weapon in theater or elsewhere, given the possibility of escalation to general nuclear war. This is true even if the adversary launches one or more nuclear weapons against nuclear assets, industrial facilities, or civilian centers in the U.S. homeland. If the homeland strike is limited, the adversary still cannot be certain that the United States will not use its nuclear weapons in the future and therefore might still be deterred. The president would therefore, again, have to assess current conditions and decide whether to continue to fight conventionally or to concede. If the homeland strike exceeds the lower bound of general nuclear war (an explosive yield that kills 25 percent of the U.S. population), then the United States, insofar as it exists, destroys much but gains nothing by sending a salvo in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-kinetic-response-options-3&quot;&gt;Non-Kinetic Response Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy assumes that diplomatic and economic instruments — e.g., severe reprimands, changes in standing and status in international institutions, the imposition of economic sanctions, and other restrictions on adversaries’ abilities to participate in the global economy and to access the international financial system — were imposed as part of the initial U.S. warfighting effort. Given that both adversaries detonated a nuclear weapon during the war, the non-kinetic costs the United States imposed and those it threatened were not effective at deterring intra-war nuclear use. Even if the United States did not immediately implement the full retinue of available measures, the adversaries’ initial nuclear detonations suggest that threatening to impose more such costs is likely to have little persuasive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-kinetic responses should, nonetheless, continue to be elements of the ongoing U.S. warfighting strategy. They are useful insofar as they hinder the adversaries’ kinetic warfighting capacity, and the United States can use the possibility of relaxing these consequences in efforts to convince the adversaries that a mutually acceptable, negotiated, political settlement is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;war-termination-on-favorable-terms&quot;&gt;War Termination on Favorable Terms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy is based upon the rational calculation that, in this scenario, the overriding U.S. strategic objective must be to preserve a future in which humans can live in some form of society that permits more than the base struggle for near-term survival. It therefore confines the definition of war termination on favorable terms to those that govern the present moment, not those that might protect U.S. interests beyond it. There is no way to anticipate what U.S. interests after these wars will be, or what geopolitical structures might further them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temptation when formulating alternative strategies based on nuclear war scenarios like the one considered here is to recommend courses of action that include U.S. nuclear use on the basis that there is some chance that it will succeed in convincing the adversary to do what the United States wishes — to argue, that is, that it just might work. This is precisely the temptation that policymakers must resist. No attachment to any political ideology, nor any idea of nationhood, can justify knowingly endangering humankind. This must certainly be true for any political ideology or nation that purports to hold sacred the inalienable rights of all human beings. What could be more contrary to this commitment than risking nuclear holocaust for entire societies of people who had no direct authorship in the policies of their governments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The urge to destroy adversary governments in such a situation would no doubt be powerful, but it is intolerable under any circumstance to risk the extinction of the human species in order to do so. Nuclear decisionmaking cannot be driven by pride or vengeance, or by the fear that, if the worst comes and the United States perishes, then so too do the values and principles that produced it. Nuclear decisionmaking must instead be guided by the conviction that liberal thought will reemerge, and by the imperative of preserving a world in which that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-deterrence-fails&quot;&gt;If Deterrence Fails&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analyzing U.S. Options for Responding to Adversary Limited Nuclear Use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gregory-weaver&quot;&gt;Gregory Weaver&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to focus Project Atom 2024 on the issue of how the United States should respond to limited nuclear deterrence failure in a conflict with a peer nuclear adversary was both wise and timely. Wise because doing so helps address key gaps in U.S. strategy development. Timely because the rise of China as a second peer nuclear adversary, and the increasing strategic alignment of Russia and China, create a heightened risk of collaborative or opportunistic aggression in two theaters that requires the development of a strategy and associated enabling capabilities to address this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most nongovernmental analyses of the problem of war with a nuclear-armed adversary focus, understandably, on how to deter the initiation of such a conflict or on deterring nuclear escalation in such a conflict. Successful deterrence avoids the much uglier problem of what to do if deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on deterrence alone, however, fails to address the very difficult problem of how the United States and its allies and partners can protect their vital interests while avoiding uncontrolled escalation to large-scale nuclear war when the adversary has already escalated to the limited use of nuclear weapons. Focusing on deterrence alone fails to address the complex task of thinking through the military and non-kinetic response options the United States and its allies and partners might require to achieve their objectives while avoiding uncontrolled escalation. Moreover, by failing to identify the range of response options required, perhaps through multiple instances of limited nuclear weapons employment by both sides, such deterrence-focused analysis also risks failing to identify the capabilities required to provide such options credibly and effectively. Finally, the process of thinking through how to address limited nuclear deterrence failure somewhat counterintuitively provides important insights into how to enhance deterrence of both war and limited nuclear escalation in war that an analytic focus on deterrence alone is unlikely to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of how to respond to limited nuclear deterrence failure is inherently scenario dependent for a number of reasons. The stakes of the two sides in a conflict have a significant impact on the war aims of the combatants and on their willingness to escalate and counter-escalate in pursuit of those aims. The political circumstances, particularly regarding issues of alliance cohesion and the internal politics of the combatants, also shape the options of both sides. The military circumstances are of course a critical factor in shaping the two sides’ strategic and operational objectives and the military means available to pursue them. Analyses must address a range of questions, including: Who is winning or losing, and why and how? Is one side asymmetrically vulnerable to limited nuclear escalation? Could horizontal escalation alter the military situation to one side’s advantage? Does one side have an endurance advantage in an extended conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, were the United States to find itself engaged either in a conflict with one nuclear peer while seeking to deter opportunistic aggression by the other, or in simultaneous conflicts with both Russia and China, the interaction of these scenario-specific factors would be far more complex to assess and far more challenging to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Atom 2024 asked its participants to conduct their analyses in the context of a single 2027 scenario involving two regional conflicts with Russia and China simultaneously. Thus, this paper addresses only that scenario, providing analysis of the four key issue areas identified by the project’s designers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. Strategic Objectives If Strategic Deterrence Fails&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assuring Allies after Strategic Deterrence Failure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Military Response Options after Strategic Deterrence Failure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-Kinetic Response Options after Strategic Deterrence Failure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the reader will see, this two-conflict scenario presents U.S. strategists with a complex set of issues. However, a more comprehensive analysis of the overarching two nuclear-armed adversary problem would require asking these same questions across a set of plausible scenarios that span the range of key strategic circumstances the United States might face. Examples of other scenarios that should be examined using the Project Atom 2024 methodology include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with Russia while deterring Chinese opportunistic aggression&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with China while deterring Russian opportunistic aggression&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with Russia and China in which the United States is winning conventionally in one theater and losing in the other when deterrence of limited nuclear use fails&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conflict with Russia and China in which the United States is losing conventionally in both theaters when deterrence of limited nuclear use fails&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The full range of scenarios farther into the future when China is a nuclear peer&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are bound to be additional important insights from analysis of these alternative scenarios that are needed to formulate a comprehensive U.S. strategy for this problem set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-scenario-in-question&quot;&gt;The Scenario in Question&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Atom 2024 posits a 2027 scenario in which the United States and its allies and partners face collaborative aggression by Russia and China in two theaters simultaneously. The scenario postulates that, despite collaborative Russian-Chinese aggression, U.S. and allied conventional forces far outperform Russian and Chinese conventional forces, almost immediately putting Russia and China in very difficult strategic circumstances 8–10 days after conflict initiation in both theaters. The scenario results in a dire strategic situation in which both Russia and China have initiated limited nuclear escalation, seemingly in response to losing the conventional conflicts they initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, U.S. objectives and potential response options in such a situation would be highly dependent on the specific political-military circumstances of a conflict. In the case of this scenario, however, several key facts regarding the strategic situation are unclear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Has the defeat of the Chinese landing force negated China’s ability to invade Taiwan, and for how long?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How long will it take Polish forces to seize the city of Kaliningrad and the rest of Kaliningrad oblast?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much have Russian nuclear strikes damaged NATO’s ability to reinforce Poland and the Baltic states, and to seize Kaliningrad?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How many Russian ground forces are where? Along the Baltic states’ borders? In Kaliningrad? In Belarus?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pointing out these uncertainties is not intended as a criticism of the scenario. But the fact that such details regarding the range of strategic circumstances the United States might face have such a significant effect on the analysis of the central problem does raise an issue for future analysis: How much understanding of the potential impacts of limited nuclear use on the course of a theater conflict between nuclear-armed adversaries is required to formulate an effective strategy for the potential range of such contingencies? It is likely that experts are reaching the end of what they can learn about this central question without detailed wargaming and simulation of twenty-first-century theater warfare that includes the limited use of nuclear weapons by one or both sides in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Atom 2024 is a first step in this direction, as it effectively examines the issues regarding what to do in the wake of limited nuclear deterrence failure by asking the right first-order questions at the unclassified level. But that is not enough. The Department of Defense needs to take up the challenge of a campaign of wargaming and simulation that will provide the necessary analytic basis for informed strategy development and military capability requirements identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is an analysis of the four key issue areas in the scenario provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-strategic-objectives-if-strategic-deterrence-fails&quot;&gt;U.S. Strategic Objectives If Strategic Deterrence Fails&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that the U.S. stake in both theater conflicts is sufficient for the United States to risk large-scale nuclear war. Whether either adversary perceives this to be true, however, is unclear. Stakes sufficient to take this risk clearly involve vital national security interests. The United States has historically perceived the sovereignty and security of its NATO allies as meeting this test. The purposeful ambiguity regarding whether the United States would intervene to defend Taiwan against Chinese military aggression makes it less certain that Taiwanese security meets this threshold, though the impact of the forcible incorporation of Taiwan into the People’s Republic of China on U.S. economic interests and U.S. alliances in Asia could well rise to a vital national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before identifying potential U.S. strategic objectives in this scenario, it is useful to consider for a moment why deterrence of limited nuclear use failed in both theaters and whether there was something that the United States could have done to enhance deterrence of such nuclear use. While the scenario does not provide sufficient information to determine the answers to these questions with much confidence, it does at least hint at Russian and Chinese motivations for crossing the nuclear threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both theaters, the adversaries’ unexpectedly poor conventional military performance puts them in fairly dire strategic circumstances very early in the conflict. In Europe, the combined effect of Russia’s failure to make any significant inroads into the Baltic states while simultaneously failing to stop the NATO offensive into Kaliningrad and eliciting direct NATO military intervention in Ukraine could hardly be worse. In Asia, the destruction of China’s invasion fleet before it can reach Taiwan denies the Chinese leadership their primary objective and is followed by internal unrest in opposition to the war. Limited nuclear escalation in both theaters offers some prospect of terminating the conflicts on terms Russia and China can accept, but the scenario does not describe Russian or Chinese intent. Neither adversary pairs their limited nuclear escalation with clear coercive political-military demands, making the purpose of their escalation unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to say that the United States failed to clearly and credibly communicate its stake in defending its allies and partners in both theaters. However, it is also possible that the Russian and Chinese leaderships miscalculated not about U.S. will to intervene but rather regarding the ability of Russian and Chinese conventional forces to achieve their objectives even in the face of U.S. intervention if they both attacked at roughly the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four U.S. strategic objectives that should be pursued in both theater conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is to restore or maintain the territorial status quo ante. This means that no NATO or Taiwanese territory remains under Russian or Chinese control (respectively) at the end of the conflict. This constitutes a fundamental denial of Russia and Chinese strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second U.S. strategic objective should be to restore deterrence of further nuclear use by Russia or China. Doing so would enable the United States and its allies and partners to continue to pursue the first strategic objective at lower risk and with a lower level of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third U.S. strategic objective in both conflicts should be to avoid uncontrolled nuclear escalation. This means deterring large-scale nuclear escalation by Russia and China even if restoring deterrence of further limited nuclear use is unachievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth U.S. strategic objective should be to demonstrate that the adversaries’ limited nuclear escalation did not result in any meaningful political-military gains. Achieving this objective in one theater could enhance the achievement of the U.S. objectives mentioned above in the second theater. It would also arguably enhance deterrence of future aggression and escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenario’s description of the Ukraine conflict complicates the establishment of further clear U.S. strategic objectives consistent with the four above objectives. The scenario posits that some eastern NATO allies have begun deploying forces into Ukraine, and NATO airpower is now flying support missions for Ukrainian forces on the offensive in preparation for the liberation of Crimea “within weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not clear, however, what U.S. territorial objectives should be in the Ukraine conflict post Russian nuclear use. Combined NATO-Ukraine forces pressing to drive Russian forces from all Ukrainian territory might make restoring deterrence of Russian nuclear use significantly more difficult and could increase the risk of uncontrolled escalation. A less risky, but still ambitious, option would be to demand Russian withdrawal from all Ukrainian territory that Russia has seized since the February 2022 invasion in exchange for NATO withdrawal from the portions of Kaliningrad it now occupies. However, this would leave Russia in control of Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which U.S. objective is chosen regarding Ukraine, U.S. objectives should clearly include termination of all fighting between NATO/Ukraine and Russia, consistent with the achievement of the other U.S. strategic objectives identified above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the relative priority of this set of potential U.S. strategic objectives in this strategic context?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restoring the territorial status quo ante (with a possible modification regarding Ukraine) while avoiding uncontrolled escalation are undoubtedly the two most important objectives. Achieving these two objectives in both theaters would amount to “victory.” Immediately restoring deterrence of nuclear use is not necessary to “win” the conflicts, but doing so would reduce both the cost and the risk of doing so. Achieving the two most important objectives would also arguably result in achieving the fourth objective of denying U.S. adversaries any significant political-military gain through their nuclear escalation, thereby enhancing future deterrence of war and escalation in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the scenario, there is no clear indication of whether success in one theater is more important to the United States than in the other theater. However, one thing is clear: U.S. and allied successes in achieving their objectives in one theater would be likely to affect the decision calculus of the adversary in the other theater regarding further nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assuring-allies-after-strategic-deterrence-failure&quot;&gt;Assuring Allies after Strategic Deterrence Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key issue noted by the Project Atom 2024 designers involves how the United States can assure its allies and partners in the wake of a failure to deter limited nuclear escalation by an adversary. This is indeed an important question, as one potential adversary motivation to escalate is to shatter U.S.-led alliance cohesion. Maintaining such cohesion is critically important to the achievement of the highest priority U.S. strategic objectives in both theaters. Thus, effectively assuring U.S. allies after strategic deterrence failure is in effect an enabler of the primary war aims of the United States should a nuclear-armed adversary choose to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuring allies in the immediate aftermath of adversary nuclear use, particularly if they have been the target of such use, is more complex than assurance while deterring first use. Allies might be concerned the United States will not respond forcefully enough to either restore deterrence and/or continue to defend their vital interests for fear that the conflict might escalate out of control and put the U.S. homeland at risk. Conversely, allies might fear that the U.S. response to adversary nuclear escalation will elicit further adversary nuclear escalation in the theater, putting the allies at increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these legitimate concerns, allies and partners in both theaters have no credible alternatives to U.S. nuclear extended deterrence commitments. In NATO, the only non-U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities are French and British. Other NATO allies are unlikely to see those forces as credible alternatives to U.S. nuclear forces in the wake of limited nuclear deterrence failure given the vast superiority of Russian nuclear forces over those of the United Kingdom and France combined. In Asia, there are no existing alternatives to U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If U.S. responses to initial Russian or Chinese escalation make clear that the United States is willing to engage in a competition in dire risk-taking, and that Russia and China must also fear potential uncontrolled escalation, allies are likely to be reassured in the near term. The greatest fear of allies who rely on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence is that in extremis the United States will be unwilling to risk strikes on the United States homeland to defend them. A decisive early demonstration that this fear is unfounded would bolster allies’ confidence and potentially convince U.S. adversaries that they had miscalculated about the U.S. stake in the conflict, as well as about U.S. political will to defend that stake resolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the U.S. responses result in further Russian or Chinese nuclear use against U.S. allies and partners, allied confidence will likely go down. Once deterrence has failed — as evidenced by limited adversary nuclear use against U.S. allies or partners — allies will want to be reassured about our ability to defend them against such attacks, not just deter them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions about how to respond to limited nuclear deterrence failure will be about how best to achieve U.S. (and allied) political-military objectives while avoiding uncontrolled escalation. If the United States succeeds in achieving its objectives while avoiding uncontrolled escalation, allies are likely to be assured. And those U.S. response decisions may need to be made too quickly to allow for extensive consultation if they are to be effective. For example, if an adversary escalates to limited nuclear use in an effort to coerce war termination on terms it can accept because it is decisively losing the conventional war, how long can we expect them to wait to see if their coercive use has had the desired effect before they decide to escalate further?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-response-options-after-strategic-deterrence-failure&quot;&gt;Military Response Options after Strategic Deterrence Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third key issue raised by the Project Atom 2024 designers involves the range of potential U.S. military responses to adversary limited nuclear escalation. The relevant range of such military options will be a direct function of the political-military objectives they are designed to achieve or support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recap of the U.S. strategic objectives identified above allows one to identify sub-objectives and military options to achieve them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTORE OR MAINTAIN THE TERRITORIAL STATUS QUO ANTE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Sub-Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore U.S. or allied conventional superiority following limited adversary nuclear strikes on key U.S. or allied conventional forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Military Options:&lt;/strong&gt; Depends on the exact nature of the military impact of adversary nuclear use and the adversary’s own vulnerability to U.S. response options. Analysis is required to understand the range of potential targets this objective and sub-objective might dictate and to determine whether currently planned military capabilities enable effective strikes on such targets on operationally relevant timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTORE DETERRENCE OF FURTHER NUCLEAR USE BY RUSSIA AND CHINA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Sub-Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Convince adversary that their nuclear escalation was a dire miscalculation regarding how the United States would respond and that further adversary escalation will fail to achieve their objectives while increasing the risk of uncontrolled escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Military Options:&lt;/strong&gt; Must exceed either the level of violence or the strategic impact that the adversary anticipated — likely difficult to know with confidence — in order to shake their confidence in their ability to gauge how the United States might respond to further escalation. There is a potential role here for the calculated revelation of capabilities of which the adversary was previously unaware that have potentially decisive military effects (“You didn’t tell me they could do that. What else don’t I know?”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AVOID UNCONTROLLED NUCLEAR ESCALATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Sub-Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Convince adversary that U.S. nuclear responses and conventional operations are being conducted in pursuit of limited war aims that do not constitute an immediate threat to state survival and do not constitute the initiation of a large-scale counterforce attack designed to negate their strategic nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Military Options:&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid strikes that threaten the adversary’s ability to detect nuclear attacks, command and control their nuclear forces, etc. Pair messaging about the purpose of the U.S. response with promises of U.S. restraint if Russia or China were to cease nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEMONSTRATE ADVERSARY LIMITED NUCLEAR ESCALATION DID NOT RESULT IN MEANINGFUL POLITICAL-MILITARY GAINS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Sub-Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Send a message to the adversary in the second theater of conflict that limited nuclear escalation is unlikely to have the coercive effects they seek. Send a message to future potential adversaries that there is no nuclear coercive offramp from failed conventional aggression against the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Military Options:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost all the options noted above could serve this purpose if effective in denying the adversary their objectives and in making clear that further nuclear escalation increases the risk of uncontrolled escalation. The nature and extent of U.S. and allied resolve must be messaged appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TERMINATION OF FIGHTING BETWEEN NATO/UKRAINE AND RUSSIA, CONSISTENT WITH ACHIEVEMENT OF OTHER U.S. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Sub-Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Create facts on the ground that provide negotiating leverage that enables termination of the Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Military Options:&lt;/strong&gt; Seize more or all of Kaliningrad to use as a bargaining chip. Escalate level of NATO military intervention in Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several key issues associated with the military response options outlined above that need to be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NUCLEAR OR NONNUCLEAR RESPONSE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these is whether the U.S. military responses to Russian or Chinese nuclear use should be nuclear or nonnuclear. If the objective of the U.S. military response is to restore deterrence of nuclear use, then there are several problems with a nonnuclear response. First, if the purpose of the adversary’s escalation was to coerce war termination on terms they can accept because they are decisively losing the conventional war, then a nonnuclear response may convince them that they simply need to hit the United States harder in pursuit of their objective. Further, they may conclude that it safe to escalate because the United States is reluctant to respond in kind for fear of uncontrolled escalation. Second, if restoring deterrence requires that the United States respond in a more severe way than anticipated by the adversary in order to convince them that they cannot be confident in predicting future U.S. responses to further escalation, then a nonnuclear response is less likely to meet this criterion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the U.S. objective is to restore U.S. or allied conventional superiority following limited adversary nuclear strikes, then the decision to respond with nuclear or nonnuclear weapons should hinge in part on which response is most likely to be more militarily effective. Increasing the range of relevant targets susceptible to a U.S. nuclear or nonnuclear response option would increase the range of options available to the president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the U.S. objective of avoiding uncontrolled nuclear escalation, at first glance it might seem that nonnuclear military response options may be preferred. And in some circumstances this would be true. However, if the effect of selecting a nonnuclear response to adversary nuclear escalation is to convince the adversary that the United States is so concerned about uncontrolled escalation that it fears responding in kind, then a U.S. nonnuclear response could actually increase the risk of eventual uncontrolled escalation. This may seem counterintuitive, but if a U.S. nonnuclear response to adversary limited nuclear use results in encouraging further adversary nuclear escalation, then the U.S. nuclear responses that may eventually be required to achieve U.S. objectives are likely to be larger in scale and more provocative in their effects. This could well make uncontrolled escalation more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRIKE RUSSIAN OR CHINESE TERRITORY WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second key issue regarding U.S. military responses to adversary limited nuclear use involves whether to strike targets on Russian or Chinese territory with nuclear weapons given the potentially escalatory nature of such action. On the one hand, strikes on the adversary’s homeland would cross a potential firebreak against uncontrolled escalation. On the other hand, making the adversary’s territory a sanctuary from U.S. limited nuclear responses could create a potentially decisive asymmetry in the ability of the two sides to achieve relevant military effects with nuclear weapons. A limited U.S. nuclear response (or a credibly communicated threat) that makes clear that Russian or Chinese territory will not be a sanctuary if the adversary continues to escalate could be effective in restoring deterrence following adversary first use. This decision in particular will be highly scenario dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RANGE OF AVAILABLE NUCLEAR OPTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of U.S. military response options in the wake of adversary limited nuclear escalation will in part be a function of the range of available nuclear options available to the U.S. president. Identifying future nuclear force and capability requirements first requires development of a future strategy for addressing the two-peer nuclear threat environment, a strategy that is likely to create new operational requirements for nuclear and conventional forces. But strategy development alone is not enough. Detailed wargaming and simulation is needed to analyze the ways in which limited nuclear use by both sides potentially affects the course of twenty-first-century conflict and escalation dynamics across a range of scenarios and strategic circumstances. Without such analysis, U.S. efforts to identify the range of nuclear options needed to address limited nuclear escalation will risk missing key insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW TO MESSAGE U.S. INTENT AND WAR AIMS PAIRED WITH A GIVEN MILITARY RESPONSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Thomas Schelling first made clear in his book Strategy of Conflict, there are certain strategic circumstances in which deterrence or the avoidance of further escalation can only be achieved if one pairs a credible threat of military response with a credible promise of restraint that provides the adversary with an acceptable, if not desirable, offramp. Given the clear role of coercive limited nuclear use in Russian strategy and doctrine, and the potential for China to adopt a similar strategy and practice when it soon acquires the necessary nuclear capabilities, the United States must determine how it will formulate and implement this pairing of threat with promise to deter such limited nuclear use. This includes not only ensuring that U.S. nuclear forces have the requisite range of capabilities to make the threat element credible and effective, but also determining what forms of restraint the United States is willing to promise and how to make such promises credible and effective in the context of a high-intensity theater conflict in which nuclear weapons have already been employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RECOMMENDED MILITARY RESPONSE OPTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step in a scenario-based analysis of this central problem is making recommendations regarding U.S. military responses to Russian and Chinese nuclear escalation in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Russian escalation, the United States should simultaneously pursue its objectives of restoring the territorial status quo ante, reestablishing deterrence of further nuclear use, and restoring U.S. and allied conventional superiority following limited Russian nuclear strikes. This could be done by executing low-yield nuclear strikes on key military targets in Kaliningrad paired with clear messaging that Russia must halt further nuclear use and that U.S. war aims are limited to restoring the territorial status quo ante vis-à-vis NATO (and possibly a return to the pre-February 2022 borders in Ukraine). However, should Russia escalate with further nuclear use, U.S. war aims might change, and U.S. military responses will become more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding China, assuming Chinese forces are no longer capable of conducting a Taiwan invasion due to U.S. and allied conventional actions, simultaneously pursuing the U.S. objectives of restoring deterrence and restoring U.S. and allied conventional superiority following limited Chinese nuclear strikes (as the territorial status quo ante already is intact) could be an appropriate course of action. This could take the form of a U.S. response in kind on three of the militarized islands in the South China Sea: Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, and Fiery Cross. Such strikes would not affect the Chinese mainland and, given the U.S. position on territorial disputes in the South China Sea, would not constitute attacks on Chinese territory. This response would make clear that the United States will neither tolerate, nor be disadvantaged by, Chinese limited nuclear use. These strikes should be paired with clear messaging that U.S. war aims are limited to defending Taiwan and our regional allies and to achieving an immediate ceasefire. However, it should be kept in mind that should China escalate with further nuclear use, U.S. war aims might change and the Chinese mainland may not be a sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;non-kinetic-response-options-after-strategic-deterrence-failure&quot;&gt;Non-Kinetic Response Options after Strategic Deterrence Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wide array of potential non-kinetic response options to adversary limited nuclear use in this scenario that could further the achievement of the U.S. strategic objectives identified above. The most important of these are the following (in descending order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Messaging in support of achieving the purposes of U.S. military responses to adversary limited nuclear use. How this might be done has been discussed above. Formulating this kind of messaging should become part of both the political-military planning process and the presidential decision-support process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information actions designed to make the adversary a pariah for having been the first to violate the nuclear taboo since 1945. The purpose of this is to make it difficult, if not impossible, for third parties to side with Russia or China in the wake of their nuclear escalation, and to affect the Russian and Chinese leaderships’ decision calculus regarding further escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information actions designed to convince both elements of Russian and Chinese political and military leadership, and the Russian and Chinese populations, that their leaders’ actions are risking large-scale nuclear war and the destruction of their nations in a failing pursuit of nonessential objectives. The purpose of this is to put pressure on the leadership to terminate the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic actions designed to make clear that the longer the adversaries continue the war, the more long term the economic damage they will incur. This also serves the purpose of pressuring their leaderships to terminate the conflict, though it is not clear that such economic effects can be imposed on a timeline sufficient to affect relatively near-term adversary decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impact-of-the-law-of-armed-conflict-on-us-military-responses&quot;&gt;Impact of the Law of Armed Conflict on U.S. Military Responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Project Atom 2024 asked how U.S. policy, when U.S. nuclear planning and operations comply with the law of armed conflict, might affect U.S. military responses in this scenario. Compliance with the law of armed conflict poses no insurmountable barriers to the United States developing effective military response options in support of the array of potential strategic objectives identified in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-4&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insights derived from this analysis make clear that there is a need to move beyond thinking only about how to deter aggression and subsequent escalation in wars with multiple nuclear-armed adversaries in the twenty-first century. The failure of deterrence of limited nuclear use would create extremely dangerous circumstances, but there are plausible ways to achieve U.S. and allied strategic objectives without automatically triggering large-scale nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, there is a need to expand the scope of the initial Project Atom 2024 analysis to address the full range of plausible scenarios and strategic circumstances in which the United States and its allies and partners might face the challenge of responding to a failure to deter limited nuclear use in a theater conflict with Russia or China. In the scenario addressed here, the United States and its allies find themselves rapidly and decisively winning the conventional war in both theaters simultaneously. As a result, Russian and Chinese nuclear escalation seems to be motivated by a desire to terminate the conflicts on terms they can accept before U.S. and allied conventional success further worsens the outcome. This is a very different strategic circumstance than a scenario in which an adversary is winning the conventional conflict and seeks to secure rapid victory through limited nuclear escalation, or one in which the United States is forced to consider limited nuclear first use to prevent a decisive conventional military defeat. Analysis of those and other scenarios and circumstances would likely produce new and important insights regarding the four key issues addressed in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

Members provided a list of recommendations for the UK to develop a strategy which not only sends a clear signal of UK priorities, but also has a tangible impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Brexit, the UK had an opportunity to develop its independent sanctions framework to address the evolving geopolitical landscape and its own foreign policy messaging. This framework included a broader range of thematic and geographic sanctions regimes, targeting issues such as corruption, human rights abuses and cyber activities, while countering threats to international peace and security. In an attempt to give substance to this vision, in February 2024, the UK published its first Sanctions Strategy, outlining its approach to ensuring that sanctions are effective, giving the UK more influence in the world, and helping to “keep Britain safe”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security set up the UK Sanctions Implementation and Strategy Taskforce, made up of 50 former UK and other government officials, senior sanctions executives from the financial sector and industry, and academics, from the UK and elsewhere. The first meeting highlighted a series of implementation challenges, such as: resourcing and expertise; engagement with industry; alignment with international partners; and the lack of a clear set of objectives for the UK’s sanctions policy. Notably, while Russia has become the focus of the UK’s sanctions response, the Taskforce also emphasised the need for a more comprehensive and flexible approach beyond Russia alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report presents findings from the second Taskforce meeting, which was held in October 2024. The discussion aimed to identify opportunities to optimise the use of existing sanctions regimes and enhance the effectiveness of sanctions as a strategic tool. Members provided a list of recommendations for the UK to develop a strategy which not only sends a clear signal of UK priorities, but also has a tangible impact. None of the comments made by the Taskforce members are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thematic-sanctions&quot;&gt;Thematic Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce first discussed ways to increase the effectiveness of the UK’s thematic regimes, which had been described in the previous meeting as mostly “presentational” and lacking clear criteria and vision. The discussion focused on three regimes: Global Anti-Corruption (GAC) sanctions; Global Human Rights (GHR) sanctions; and cyber sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-anti-corruption-sanctions&quot;&gt;Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce recognised the steps the UK has taken to address corruption through its GAC sanctions regime. However, discussions highlighted gaps in the current approach that hinder its legitimacy and credibility, mostly linked to the lack of clarity regarding the criteria and purpose for which these sanctions are deployed, and the strategy for their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members reiterated the risk of sanctions targeting corruption in name only without being accompanied by genuine disruption of related networks and criminal enforcement. They described the GAC regime as an “uncomfortable fit” between sanctions and criminal enforcement, with sanctions being prioritised over the actual targeting of corruption. One Taskforce member pointed to the EU’s misappropriation sanctions regimes as a useful cautionary tale for anti-corruption sanctions. Introduced in 2011 to target corruption and financial misappropriation by government officials in Egypt and Tunisia, these sanctions regimes struggled to achieve tangible results, securing no convictions and becoming the subject of political disputes. The failure of these regimes, according to Taskforce members, resulted from a lack of criminal enforcement efforts due to limited resources and political will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce warned that without robust investigations, prosecutions and confiscations of the proceeds of corruption accompanying the rollout of anti-corruption sanctions, the GAC regime might face a similar fate and lack credibility. To ensure this does not happen, members recommended appropriate resourcing of law enforcement agencies, and stronger coordination between government agencies responsible for sanctions enforcement and criminal prosecutions. They also argued that better processes for listing and delisting would be useful for more targeted action against corrupt individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Taskforce member stressed the disparity between the UK’s efforts to combat corruption at home and its actions abroad. Noting the UK’s recent decline in international rankings such as Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, they argued that the lack of focus on domestic corruption weakens the UK’s credibility in the global fight against corruption and its sanctions response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase international credibility, Taskforce members suggested complementing anti-corruption sanctions, measures to tackle domestic corruption, and criminal enforcement with capacity-building in target countries, particularly in the Global South. One member from civil society cautioned that a failure to cooperate with local justice systems could result in sanctions being perceived as neocolonial, undermining their legitimacy and impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;global-human-rights-sanctions&quot;&gt;Global Human Rights Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce also discussed GHR sanctions, which have become a prominent aspect of the UK’s independent sanctions regime, particularly through the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020. GHR sanctions allow the UK to target individuals and entities involved in serious human rights violations by freezing their assets and restricting their travel. While recognising the value of these sanctions in principle, Taskforce members noted that the sanctions were far from realising their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One primary concern raised by Taskforce members was that human rights sanctions often do not serve their intended purpose of deterrence, but are instead adopted as a form of punishment. The discussions highlighted that, similarly to GAC sanctions, GHR sanctions often operate in a vacuum, without the support of additional efforts to promote human rights globally. Some participants suggested including GHR sanctions in a broader human rights strategy, combining them, for instance, with diplomatic efforts and criminal prosecution of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members from the legal sector also noted that these kinds of sanctions are in place indefinitely, with little evidence that they influence the behaviour of the targeted individuals or regimes. This situation, combined with a lack of clear criteria for lifting human rights sanctions or explanation of the reasoning behind designations, raises questions about the long-term purpose and effectiveness of these sanctions, and risks reducing their overall legitimacy. Taskforce members stressed the need to gather more data on the impact of GHR sanctions on the ground, for instance by establishing collaboration with local organisations to assess whether the sanctions were providing accountability for human rights abusers or deterring further abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyber-sanctions&quot;&gt;Cyber Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber sanctions have also emerged as a growing area of focus for the UK, particularly as cybercrime and state-sponsored cyber activities have become more prevalent. These sanctions aim to disrupt the financial operations of cyber-criminals and state-backed actors involved in malicious cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members noted that compliance with cyber sanctions is not particularly complex for financial institutions (FIs) in terms of screening, but that challenges arise with tracing the broader criminal networks involved in cybercrime. Similarly to GAR and GHR sanctions, the key challenge was the lack of criteria clarifying what it takes for a specific network to be sanctioned. Some members noted that the more cyber sanctions designations there are, the easier it is for the industry to learn and comply. However, for cyber sanctions, as well as for other lists, designations are often the result of the work of pressure groups or the gathering of information found in the public domain, which can be altered. Participants noted that this made it difficult for the private sector to understand why sanctions targeted some groups rather than others. Some Taskforce members from the private sector also argued that FIs do not operate in an active intelligence-sharing community within the sector, with banks only seeing data at their disposal and becoming overreliant on information in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Taskforce, any information that authorities can provide will make a difference. An example of new approaches to mitigating this challenge is the US Office of Foreign Assets Control’s move to add IP and virtual wallet addresses to sanctions designation details; FIs can input these addresses into their compliance systems to support their efforts to unveil the networks involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Taskforce also stressed the legal and operational grey areas for insurers. They noted that insurers may face conflicting obligations: on the one hand, they may be required to pay claims to clients affected by ransomware, but on the other hand, if they identify a designated entity to be behind a ransomware attack, they must avoid making payments because that would violate sanctions. To overcome this issue, the Taskforce recommended the UK issues clearer guidelines on how insurers should handle claims related to ransomware attacks, and share best practices on how to identify and prevent cyber-related sanctions violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geographic-sanctions&quot;&gt;Geographic Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce discussed strategies to enhance the effectiveness of the UK’s country-specific sanctions. Members emphasised the importance of maintaining a balanced approach, ensuring that the focus on Russia does not overshadow other critical sanctions regimes, such as those applied to North Korea and Iran. These states continue to pose significant global security threats through their illicit activities and development of nuclear and other weapons programmes. However, the implementation and enforcement of related sanctions regimes have seen reduced focus in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members identified common challenges related to the current geographic regimes. First, they pointed out the persistence across multiple regimes of similar sanctions-evasion practices. For instance, North Korea’s continued use of ship-to-ship oil transfers, flag-hopping, smuggling, and collaboration with other sanctioned countries enable it to evade sanctions and sustain the development of its nuclear weapons programme, while also serving as a blueprint for other sanctioned jurisdictions, such as Russia. According to participants, the cessation of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, which previously played a key role in monitoring and reporting on suspicions of sanctions evasion, has also weakened oversight and enforcement, and increased evading activities. Taskforce members agreed that there was an opportunity for the UK to assume a leadership role in ensuring that sanctions violations are properly monitored and addressed. They suggested: expanding sanctions designations to cover individuals and entities involved in facilitating partnerships among sanctioned jurisdictions; ensuring the adequate coordination of geographically divided desks within UK government departments; and implementing measures to cut off access to shared resources and illicit networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as regimes such as North Korea and Russia progressively disengage from Western financial and corporate ecosystems to avoid sanctions, there are fewer opportunities to disrupt evasion activities through the compliance efforts of Western businesses. Some Taskforce members from the insurance community emphasised that overcompliance by the private sector may exacerbate this issue. They noted that, while some government officials view overcompliance as a positive trend that keeps businesses away from high-risk activities, those officials neglect the resulting unintended consequences, such as the creation of parallel structures by sanctioned entities outside the scope of G7 regulatory oversight. Members cited the growing role of Russia’s shadow fleet as an example of this. The oil price cap (OPC) was designed to leverage the fact that 90% of the world’s ocean-going tonnage was insured by Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;amp;I) Clubs in the International Group, all of which are based in G7 countries, and the clubs could therefore police the sanctions. However, Russia has moved away from Western services through the development of the shadow fleet, which now reportedly transports 90% of Russian crude oil, beyond Western oversight. Taskforce members recommended that the UK expand the designations of vessels involved in violations of the OPC to strengthen the enforcement of maritime sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, representatives from the P&amp;amp;I insurance community noted that they are largely unconcerned with North Korean sanctions, because vessels associated with the country rarely enter Western ports or rely on major Western insurers. However, this leads to a knowledge gap within the insurance and shipping sectors, where companies have little direct experience dealing with North Korea’s maritime operations, and may therefore be ill-prepared to address the sophisticated evasion techniques being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the current system relies heavily on private data providers for information to conduct sanctions screening, without a guarantee of the accuracy of the data they provide. The absence of centralised oversight or clear competency in the management of entity-screening systems means that many organisations may be operating with outdated or incomplete information, reducing the overall effectiveness of sanctions. Taskforce members reiterated the need for the UK government to expand its collaboration with industry and provide more information about sanctioned entities and suspected involved actors, to support compliance in the private sector, reflecting the national security priority placed on the use of sanctions. To address this, a Taskforce member suggested exploring opportunities for industry secondments, where experienced professionals from the private sector could work within government agencies to improve mutual understanding of industry-specific challenges. Such initiatives could bridge the gap between government and industry, accelerating the development of more effective sanctions policies and improving compliance across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, participants stressed challenges in the enforcement of geographic sanctions similar to those found in the enforcement of thematic regimes. According to one participant, the issue with enforcement is rooted in the lack of proactivity in investigations – the launch of an investigation is often reliant on self-reporting – and the number and amount of fines imposed, which do not act as a deterrent in comparison to the cost of compliance. Members recommended a speedier upscaling and expansion of the remit and resources of agencies responsible for enforcing sanctions. To achieve this, the UK should consider a more collaborative and unified approach to improve information sharing; an increase in resources across the whole sanctions architecture; and greater engagement with industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, consistent with the point raised for GAC/GHR sanctions, the Taskforce noted that the UK should lay out a clear series of actions required for the wind-down of sanctions for geographic regimes. While the grounds for which sanctions were adopted against actors such as Russia remain active, planning for the eventuality of a wind-down or an offramp helps to avoid the unintended consequences of overly extended sanctions. Ensuring that sanctions are well-targeted and calibrated, both in the short and the long term, will help maintain the UK’s credibility and the strategic effectiveness of sanctions in achieving a behavioural change in their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve the credibility and legitimacy of the UK’s thematic and geographic sanctions regimes, Taskforce members provided the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen and unify the UK government architecture.&lt;/strong&gt; Effective sanctions implementation and enforcement require greater coordination between the various government departments involved, including the FCDO, the Treasury and the Home Office – and, where relevant, intelligence services. A more unified approach is needed to ensure that sanctions are implemented consistently across departments and that existing programmes are aligned. The UK should consider developing an integrated sanctions “agency” model that would address any inter-institutional competitiveness, gaps and/or opportunities for miscommunication; improve information-sharing; and simplify reporting obligations for the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand and review the list of designated entities and individuals.&lt;/strong&gt; The processes and criteria for listing individuals and entities under both thematic and geographic regimes should be reviewed, to ensure sanctions meet the intended goals and are reaching the right targets. The UK should also continue broadening its sanctions on entities and individuals, particularly those involved in facilitating sanctions evasion. This includes targeting and sharing information with the private sector on shell companies, financial intermediaries and other entities that play a role in efforts to circumvent sanctions beyond the Western ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide more and better data.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK government should focus on improving the quality and accessibility of data used in its sanctions regimes. This includes providing FIs and other private sector actors with up-to-date and accurate data, incorporating newer data points such as IP and virtual wallet addresses. Additional training and capacity building should be offered to both government agencies and private sector firms, particularly smaller companies, to ensure their expertise in managing the increasing volume and complexity of data involved in sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve public-private collaboration.&lt;/strong&gt; Regular consultations with FIs, technology companies and other private sector actors are essential to ensure that sanctions are effectively implemented and that their design has the best chance of success. The UK government should establish a formal mechanism for ongoing dialogue with the private sector, focusing on emerging challenges such as cyber sanctions and ransomware, and ensuring that companies have the guidance they need to comply with sanctions regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balance domestic and international efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK government must align its domestic efforts with its international actions. This includes strengthening domestic anti-corruption laws, frameworks and enforcement mechanisms to complement the GAC regime. The UK should also focus on diplomatic engagement and capacity-building initiatives in strategic jurisdictions, such as providing training to law enforcement agencies or supporting the development of local anti-corruption frameworks, recognising that sanctions are one tool in a wider foreign policy toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance sanctions enforcement capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Enforcement of sanctions has been inconsistent, with significant gaps in the UK’s ability to investigate and prosecute sanctions violations. The UK government should introduce clearer enforcement guidelines, similar to the framework established under the Bribery Act, to ensure penalties for sanctions violations are appropriate and proportional and focus on genuine sanctions evaders rather than low-hanging fruit. Furthermore, the UK government must increase funding and resources to enable more effective investigations and prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance maritime enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt; Given Russia’s and North Korea’s reliance on maritime sanctions evasion tactics, the UK government should invest in better maritime tracking systems, and coordinate with international partners to improve enforcement in key shipping lanes. It should prioritise targeted actions against vessels involved in ship-to-ship transfers and flag-hopping, along with secondary sanctions on facilitators of these activities. The UK government should ensure it takes a leadership role in the newly formed Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, leveraging its expertise in key areas such as maritime sanctions and financial services in support of this renewed initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine sanctions with criminal enforcement.&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure the effectiveness of sanctions, they must be deployed together with additional tools, such as robust criminal justice responses. Sanctions should be accompanied by more investigations, prosecutions and confiscations of criminal proceeds. Law enforcement agencies such as the Combating Kleptocracy Cell should intensify their efforts to prosecute money laundering and corruption offences, together with sanctions evasion offences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve monitoring and impact assessment.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK government should invest in monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to assess the impact of its sanctions regimes. For instance, the FCDO could collaborate with international partners and local organisations to gather data on the effects of sanctions on the ground. Regular assessments can both help to ensure that sanctions are achieving their intended outcomes and inform decisions about whether they should remain in place or whether new ones should be adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a roadmap for lifting sanctions.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK government should develop a framework for reviewing and potentially rolling back sanctions. This framework should include specific benchmarks for compliance, such as changes in the behaviour of the targeted individuals or regimes. Sanctions should be seen as a tool for encouraging behavioural change, not just as a punishment. Any wind-down needs to be coordinated with international partners to avoid creating loopholes or undermining the overall sanctions regime. This is applicable across all sanctions regimes to ensure that sanctions have a clear endgame that compels targets to change their behaviour in exchange for sanctions relief.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce agreed that sanctions have become a preferred tool in the UK’s foreign policy arsenal, particularly in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. However, as the scope and complexity of sanctions continues to expand, the Taskforce was clear that the UK government must ensure that the entirety of its sanctions regimes remain effective. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, the UK government can enhance the effectiveness of its thematic and geographic sanctions, ensuring that they achieve real impact in both disrupting illicit activities and promoting international security. Failure to address these issues risks reducing the UK’s sanctions regime to a largely symbolic tool, rather than one that drives meaningful change on the global stage.&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. public diplomacy must work harder than ever to showcase the superior attractiveness and value of the United States and its policies over competing alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia leverage technology, social media, and big data as tools to deceptively present information for hostile purposes. The United States must embrace a bold approach to public diplomacy to protect the ideas, values, electoral processes, and all the elements that make a free and open society possible and prevent it from becoming a casualty in the information war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-cold-war-to-information-war-the-evolution-of-us-public-diplomacy&quot;&gt;From Cold War to Information War: The Evolution of U.S. Public Diplomacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions of U.S. public diplomacy over the last two decades are often framed around its “failures,” what’s “wrong” with it, what a “mess” it is, and its diminishing returns. The solution is not reorganizing U.S. government institutions or simply increasing congressional appropriations. Rather, it involves refocusing the collective perspective on how the U.S. government should think about public diplomacy in an era dominated by great-power competition. A comprehensive “all of the above” approach to public diplomacy is more appropriate for countering authoritarian states in the context of the Information Age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A comprehensive “all of the above” approach to public diplomacy is more appropriate for countering authoritarian states in the context of the Information Age.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edmund Gullion coined the term “public diplomacy” in 1965, but deliberate engagements with international audiences had become a prominent component of U.S. peacetime foreign policy since the beginning of the Cold War (see Box 1). Initial policy was focused on a bipolar world order, with the Cold War aligning nations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The goal of bipolar public diplomacy was to “win the hearts and minds” in favor of Western values: representative democracy, free speech, religious freedom, gender equality, and capitalistic economies over the only other option — communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the Cold War, the Clinton administration disbanded many of the institutions at the core of U.S. public diplomacy. The U.S. Information Agency (USIA), created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 as an independent agency to promote U.S. values overseas through information programs, was dissolved in 1999. Many components of the USIA’s public diplomacy were transferred to the Department of State, while an independent Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was tasked with overseeing international broadcasting networks like Voice of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9/11 terrorist attacks marked the re-securitization of public diplomacy as the United States sought to “win the hearts and minds of Muslims” across the Muslim world. Like the post–Cold War era, however, there were few media alternatives for audiences in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, or Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Trump administration rebranded the BBG as the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent federal agency that oversees and broadcasts news and information about the United States and the world internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of State and the USAGM sought to maintain credibility with international audiences as new technologies emerged, allowing other voices to compete with U.S. efforts to promote Western norms and institutions globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-what-is-public-diplomacy&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1. What Is Public Diplomacy?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A challenge in any effort to revamp public diplomacy lies in the fact that there are multiple definitions of the term and competing understandings of what activities fall under its umbrella. A traditional understanding of the term might only include state-to-state activities. More broadly defined, U.S. public diplomacy also encompasses official messaging from the Department of State and the White House; U.S. international broadcasting via USAGM, Voice of America, and Radio Free Europe; and other soft power tools, military operations, and covert actions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. public diplomacy today faces a fundamentally different landscape than it has ever encountered since its inception: a highly digitalized, multipolar world order where audiences can choose where they get their information and what they believe, all in the palm of their hands. Today’s market diversification provides audiences with many choices, including numerous countries with actively engaging foreign ministries and their state-sponsored news networks. Audiences are no longer passive consumers of whatever is available — they get to choose where they invest their time and attention. There are fewer gatekeepers to instant information. Videos, images, and articles no longer have to pass through a newspaper editor or network producer to reach an audience. A caveat, however, is that deepfakes, propaganda, and other forms of unverified information also have direct lines to mass audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means U.S. public diplomacy must work harder than ever to showcase the superior attractiveness and value of the United States and its policies over competing alternatives. To do this, policymakers and practitioners must reframe their thinking from what public diplomacy was to what it needs to be in the coming century, which will likely be dominated by superpower competition between the United States, China, and Russia. They must refocus on multipolar public diplomacy and fill leadership voids in this space. In other words, the United States needs to reorient public diplomacy policy as a tool of relativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective public diplomacy will require appropriate levels of congressional funding and more effective use of that money. As the United States has decreased spending on public diplomacy, China and Russia continue to invest heavily in sophisticated propaganda in the developing world. The underlying goal of the U.S. effort should be not just to make the United States the most attractive and desirable country in the world but to position it as the “partner of choice” in competition with other vying players. Reputational security achieved through public diplomacy is undervalued, as reflected in underinvestment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-values-to-interests-in-public-diplomacy&quot;&gt;From Values to Interests in Public Diplomacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States is to refocus its public diplomacy policy, the central purpose of multipolar public diplomacy must be building alliances. Current U.S. policy underpins the “marketplace of ideas,” which focuses on values and norm-building. The issue is that when the United States advocates for and institutionalizes its values, it often neglects the divergent values held by foreign audiences. Strategic communication is not unidirectional; it is imperative to listen to counterparts when shaping the United States’ image and to avoid actions that contradict the desired perception. This is why the United States continuously struggles to improve its image and reputation in the Middle East. Large majorities in nine Middle Eastern countries report feeling that “the West doesn’t respect Muslim values, nor show concern for the Islamic and Muslim worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, multipolar public diplomacy is underpinned by the “marketplace of loyalties,” which focuses on interests. In this framework, states can work together to pursue their individual and common goals despite contradicting value sets. This is illustrated by the cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II. Based on a shared interest in defeating Nazi Germany, two world powers vying for dominance were able to work together for a common goal that benefited both of their interests, despite disagreements on political and economic values. Likewise, the United States’ relationship with Saudi Arabia is a modern example. The two countries have markedly different value sets, yet based on mutual security, economic, and energy interests, they work together for mutual advantage, even in the face of starkly contrasting values and continuous tension. The killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 is an example of a value-based difference that tested but did not break the U.S.-Saudi relationship, which is underpinned by common geopolitical interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-way, mutually beneficial relationships that advance respective interests — not values — must drive the U.S. alliance-building for the remainder of the twenty-first century. Per Richard Haass, “Foreign policy is not about virtue signaling; it is about advancing interests. Prioritizing and compartmentalizing are essential.” This is not to say that the United States should give up on promoting democratic values — quite the contrary. U.S. public diplomacy needs to create reputational security by being genuine, authentic, and consistent. However, given the democratic backsliding over the last two decades and the rise of regimes that do not share Western values regarding universal human rights, the cost of pursuing global democratization and a liberal world order is growing exponentially. The United States’ political, social, and economic capital simply cannot afford to re-democratize the international system while also fending off power advances by China and Russia. It becomes a cost-benefit analysis, where interests offer a greater potential for cross-cultural engagement, dialogue, and cooperation than do values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. public diplomacy needs to create reputational security by being genuine, authentic, and consistent.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the rise of a “post-truth” reality, marked by information overload and rampant disinformation, has created a social ecosystem that significantly bottlenecks the marketplace of ideas. The best ideas do not always rise to the top; even those that do are not always accepted as the best. At a time when the philosophical applicability of the “marketplace of ideas” is failing, the “marketplace of loyalties” offers a viable alternative. The underlying premise of refocusing U.S. public diplomacy is that this new approach focuses on making the United States the partner of choice over China or Russia, based on its superior ability to deliver on the interests of foreign audiences and governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-centrality-of-emerging-technology&quot;&gt;The Centrality of Emerging Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information is the currency of the new world order, so to compete in a multipolar landscape, U.S. public diplomacy must be competitive in telling its narratives to the rest of the world. Technology and buy-in from tech companies are important elements in formulating a public diplomacy strategy suitable for the twenty-first century. The importance of diplomatic ties to and collaboration with tech companies is evidenced by the soaring number of countries that have established dedicated diplomatic missions to Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay Area. Luckily, the United States and its private sector already outcompete both China and Russia in technology development, so it simply comes down to leveraging the public and private resources already at play while combating adversarial attempts to weaponize the same technological advances. But how can technology help U.S. public diplomacy in a multipolar world order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, technology can provide greater internet access. The United States needs to be able to deliver its content to audiences, even in countries that control or restrict access. Therefore, technology that provides increased access is invaluable. For example, Starlink’s mobile broadband satellite system provides access across the African continent. Likewise, USAGM’s Open Technology Fund programs, which provide virtual private networks and censorship-circumvention tools, are steps in this direction. For example, the agency has worked with nthLink, Psiphon, and Lantern since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in 2014 to provide Russians with greater access to Western media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States needs to be able to deliver its content to audiences, even in countries that control or restrict access. Therefore, technology that provides increased access is invaluable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, technology can provide improved techniques for telling the United States’ story. Even the most credible and authentic narratives can fail if they are not persuasive or never reach their intended audience. Leveraging new technologies to enhance the storytelling context of U.S. public diplomacy, elicit emotional responses, and achieve persuasive outcomes will be vital for outperforming competing narratives from China and Russia. This can range from artificial intelligence to virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, or infotainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, technology can aid in countering state-sponsored disinformation and influence operations. U.S. public diplomacy cannot operate on its own merits alone. It must leverage emerging technology to identify, track, counter, and discredit narratives and false information spread through Chinese and Russian active measures. This requires interagency cooperation through initiatives like the Department of State’s Global Engagement Center (GEC), as well as public-private partnerships with the tech sector, like Facebook’s election integrity program, to employ rapid alert detection networks to identify artificial amplification, deepfakes, content coordination, etc. The European External Action Service (EEAS), for example, employs a rapid alert system to detect disinformation and coordinate multistate responses through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre, EEAS Situation Room, G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, and NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-is-the-audience-of-a-refocused-public-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Who Is the Audience of a Refocused Public Diplomacy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enhance the competitive edge of U.S. public diplomacy over the next century, the conceptual focus on “foreign audiences” should be broadened operationally to include a range of foreign actors: corporations, nongovernmental organizations, cities, diasporas, influencers, and more. The Department of State’s Office of Global Partnerships is a model for partnering U.S. government staff and resources with nontraditional partners across business, philanthropy, and community organizations that could be mirrored within the Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources (R/PPR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, U.S. public diplomacy suffers from a lack of engagement with the domestic public. While Americans frequently see headlines about how China and Russia challenge the United States abroad, they often lack substantive knowledge of how the U.S. government is working to compete in this shifting world order. As public opinion influences both political representation and appropriations, better engaging and informing U.S. residents about the efforts and successes of public diplomacy is crucial for securing public support, congressional recruitment, and greater influence in interagency cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 allowed for greater transparency and access to materials intended for foreign audiences but maintained restrictions on their use for influencing domestic U.S. public opinion. Further revisions to the act should consider eliminating outdated policies and rethinking U.S. public diplomacy’s domestic engagement strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;achieving-public-diplomacy-goals-in-the-coming-decades&quot;&gt;Achieving Public Diplomacy Goals in the Coming Decades&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refocusing U.S. public diplomacy’s purview requires a whole-of-government approach, interagency exercises to expose resource gaps, and designing a grand strategy that outlines responsibilities and costs associated with expanding capacity. This requires five key first steps to compete in the coming multipolar world. These span leadership, cooperation, evaluation, purpose, and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-consistency-in-leadership-and-strategy&quot;&gt;1. Consistency in Leadership and Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. public diplomacy has been self-sabotaged out of the gate for over 20 years by a lack of consistent leadership. The position of the undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs (R) was vacant 44 percent of the 22 years between 1999 and 2021 (over nine and a half years), with nine congressional appointees filling the office the other 56 percent of the time (just over 12 years). This lack of institutional continuity has prevented the development of an organized and coherent strategy for implementation across the Department of State, let alone the entire U.S. government. This inconsistency has contributed to China and Russia outperforming the United States in the information and influence domain over the last two decades. If the United States is serious about competing with China and Russia in this space, the White House must prioritize quickly filling this critical office with qualified personnel. However, given the broken Senate confirmation process, creating a role that bypasses the lengthy process would be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, in the United States, the executive branch cannot bypass the legislative branch if reputational security advancements are to be achieved. If the Senate confirmation process cannot be streamlined, it is critical for congressional leadership to better address authorizations and appropriations related to public diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, leaders like Xi Jinping in China and Vladimir Putin in Russia can arbitrarily redirect national resources at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-centrality-of-leadership-in-interagency-cooperation&quot;&gt;2. Centrality of Leadership in Interagency Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. public diplomacy during the Cold War was successful because the USIA was the centralized leader of U.S. government information and influence efforts, with direct access to the White House and the National Security Council. Today, the lack of influential leadership in public diplomacy weakens the U.S. government’s effectiveness in the information domain. Edward R. Murrow, the late director of the USIA, recommended that “public diplomacy be in at the takeoff of foreign policies, not just at the occasional crash landing.” The absence of a prominent agency leader also reduces attention from senior-level policymakers in both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no point in creating a new USIA, as that would be an unhelpful bureaucratic reorganization. However, giving the White House and the National Security Council authority over a singular organization or agency, as the USIA once had when it participated in White House cabinet and National Security Council meetings, would clarify, harmonize, and centralize U.S. government efforts, increasing the efficiency of interagency cooperation and resource allocation. Positioning the GEC as the dedicated central hub, for example, would be ideal, as it is Department of State-focused but enjoys more operational cooperation and buy-in from the national security and intelligence communities than R/PPR. This would require official interagency memoranda of agreement directing other agencies and departments to be accountable to the GEC. It would also necessitate more funding — for example, liaisons to the GEC, GEC liaisons to the tech world, and additional billets within the GEC for analysts, supervisors, and possibly their own software programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to achieve greater impact is by doubling down on performance measurement in U.S. public diplomacy. This would allow practitioners to demonstrate its effectiveness and value as a security tool to policymakers in Congress and the White House. The work done by R/PPR’s Research and Evaluation Unit is the first step in institutionalizing performance measurements across U.S. public diplomacy. However, it is important to stress that psychological and sociological influences are slow processes. No social science programming can yield comprehensive results in a matter of weeks, months, or even years. Policymakers need to understand that public diplomacy measurement and evaluation is a cumulative process, with trends revealing themselves over the course of years, decades, or even generations. Assessment expectations within an annual budget cycle, for example, will do little more than illustrate the fact that individual and societal influence is far from instantaneous. There must be a willingness to consider the compounding evidence of comprehensive mixed-methods research over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-efficiency-of-dollars-spent&quot;&gt;3. Efficiency of Dollars Spent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States does not need to outspend China or Russia in this domain; instead, it must allocate resources and efforts more efficiently. Audience analysis and segmentation are ideal methods to achieve this. The key is to win over moderate and persuadable audiences, so the greatest resources should be focused on countries and regions not already aligned exclusively with China or Russia. This should begin with countries of strategic geopolitical interest to the United States that are being actively courted by either country. For example, Panama was one of China’s first Belt and Road Initiative partners, and the influx of Chinese investments influenced the outcome of Panamanian elections and legislative votes in favor of China’s economic and security priorities over those of the United States. Similarly, the popularity of the Arabic-language RT (Russia’s international news network) has influenced public perception of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an in-depth strategic analysis by regional experts is required to develop a comprehensive list of countries of strategic geopolitical interest to the United States, numerous natural-mineral-rich countries in the Global South are being lobbied by both Chinese and Russian public and private sectors. Some key examples include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Africa:&lt;/strong&gt; Zimbabwe (platinum group metals and lithium), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (copper, cobalt, lithium, and petroleum), Mali (iron, lead, chromium, nickel, lithium, and uranium), Guinea (iron and uranium), Mozambique (iron, titanium, graphite, and copper), South Africa (iron, platinum, manganese, and uranium), and Zambia (copper, cobalt, and platinum group metals).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South America:&lt;/strong&gt; Bolivia (petroleum), Chile (lithium and copper), Mexico (iron, copper, and zinc), Peru (iron, manganese, and copper), Jamaica (iron, copper, and zinc), the Dominican Republic (copper, nickel, and zinc), Guatemala (iron, nickel, and zinc), and Panama (access to the canal).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asia:&lt;/strong&gt; India (iron, manganese, graphite, zinc, and copper), Uzbekistan (petroleum, uranium, copper, and zinc), Indonesia (nickel, cobalt, and copper), Kazakhstan (manganese, uranium, iron, copper, zinc, and petroleum), Kyrgyzstan (iron, manganese, petroleum, and zinc), Malaysia (iron, manganese, copper, and bauxite), and Tajikistan (iron, uranium, petroleum, and zinc).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-purpose-as-informer-or-persuader&quot;&gt;4. Purpose as Informer or Persuader&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcing institutional mission sets is also vital. The goal of U.S. public diplomacy might be compared to counterinsurgency’s purpose of winning the “hearts and minds” during military conflict. In the Information Age, public diplomacy should aim to build the United States’ credibility with global audiences. USAGM has spent decades cultivating a reputation for credibility with its various networks, serving as a transparent and objective news outlet. The agency needs to retain its editorial independence to remain a recognized international source of fact-based journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Nicholas J. Cull argues, “international broadcasting is powerful but works best at arm’s length.” This necessitates codified barriers to operational interference from the White House or Congress. Politics must stay out of USAGM for it to remain attractive to foreign audiences as a reliable source of information. On the other hand, as a central branch of the executive government, the Department of State should remain the primary tool of political advocacy in advancing the United States’ narratives to the rest of the world. The Department of State is the central hub for engaging, through various soft power means, in persuasive communication that articulates the attractiveness of U.S. policies and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-advanced-training-and-professional-development&quot;&gt;5. Advanced Training and Professional Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, communication is a skills-based profession, yet most foreign service officers and many public diplomacy officers are not highly trained communication practitioners. The State Department should model high-level training and strategically oriented professional development programs with academic partners, like the Defense Department’s program for mid-career public affairs officers (PAOs) at San Diego State University’s School of Journalism and Media Studies. This curriculum provides PAOs with advanced theoretical knowledge and practical skills in campaign planning, implementation, and measurement. It also trains PAOs to serve as strategic counselors to commanding officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experienced public diplomacy officers need similar advanced training and professional development to build industry-led skill sets in campaign planning and implementation, program development, audience analysis, measurement, and evaluation, and counseling senior foreign service officers, ambassadors, and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options for collaboration with academia include specialized programs in public diplomacy at institutions such as the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Oklahoma State University’s School of Global Studies, and George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs. Another option is to pair the Foreign Service Institute and R/PPR with academic and research partners, facilitated through the Office of Global Partnerships’ Diplomacy Lab program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the U.S. government seeks to contain its adversaries’ influence and geopolitical impact, it is critical to consider lessons from the twentieth century. Public diplomacy was a novel tool that helped tip the Cold War stalemate in the United States’ favor. The White House and Congress must prioritize investments in public diplomacy’s capacity to become a competitive tool in the international information ecosystem and reconsider what twenty-first-century public diplomacy requires for effective global strategic communications. The undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs (R) and USAGM’s lack of centrality in the national security community will continue to handcuff U.S. government efforts if inaction persists. Meanwhile, the United States will watch as China and Russia continue to build alliances across the globe and fortify their legitimacy as superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;

CSIS stress-tested these concepts through a tabletop exercise designed to illuminate the conditions under which planners might assess that a gender-informed strategic approach would generate meaningful advantage for the United States. The brief concludes with recommendations for how the DoD might generate enterprise-wide momentum toward meaningfully leveraging WPS tools and incorporating gender perspectives in key processes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence — essentially, utilizing instruments of power to convince an adversary to refrain from taking a particular course of action — is a core aspect of the United States’ strategy to halt the advance of authoritarian regimes across multiple domains. In order to better organize the DoD’s deterrent posture, the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) puts forward an intriguing construct: tailored, integrated deterrence. Integrated deterrence is, at its core, a way of reminding the DoD about the fundamentals of deterrence: namely, that it is a psychological calculation rather than a particular widget or program. In order for an adversary to be deterred, it must believe that a course of action that it is considering is not worth pursuing. The key components of strategies that dissuade adversaries from undesirable activities are capabilities, such as the actual military and other elements of national power, and credibility, namely demonstrations of the political will to act in the event a red line is crossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central challenge before the DoD — and the U.S. government more broadly — is to better tailor its deterrent strategies through more creative employment of military ways and means. This requires a better understanding of the psychologies of power and vulnerabilities within adversary regimes. In other words, building deterrence strategies that actually affect the psychological calculations of most U.S. adversary authoritarian regimes requires taking a much more serious look at their power structures and concepts of power, both of which are heavily gendered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central challenge before the DoD — and the U.S. government more broadly — is to better tailor its deterrent strategies through more creative employment of military ways and means.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gender-as-a-conceptual-lens&quot;&gt;Gender as a Conceptual Lens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Gender” does not mean “women”; rather, gender is a way to express and promulgate core notions of identity and power at individual and structural levels. “Gender” as a conceptual lens is not limited to women and women’s representation. Although women often play important roles in challenging authoritarian power structures — as recent events in Iran demonstrate — they do so in opposition to the reactionary gender roles prescribed for all citizens by authoritarian regimes. While women are often drivers for thinking about gendered aspects of security questions — if not catalysts for social change — analytically focusing on one gender misses the bigger societal and structural pictures of which gender is a key part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To understand how WPS and gender-related approaches might help illuminate more effective approaches to building tailored, integrated deterrence strategies, CSIS initiated a multipronged project that incorporated a mixed methods analytic approach in its research design. Over the course of one year, CSIS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;convened six working groups with leading gender, regional, and strategy experts;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conducted dozens of research interviews;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;traveled to both U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and U.S. European Command (EUCOM) theaters to engage with experts and planners at operational or theater levels; and&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;designed, ran, and analyzed a tabletop exercise to “stress test” and validate insights derived from working group discussions, interviews, and study trips.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Research interviews were conducted utilizing a grounded theory approach; that is, theory was designed based on the information shared by interlocutors. In this case, participants were asked to share their views of the major problems they grappled with on a daily basis without reference to gender or WPS efforts. Theories on the utility of gender analytic approaches and WPS programs were constructed afterward.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-authoritarians-want&quot;&gt;What Do Authoritarians Want?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do authoritarians want? The short answer: power. They use gender scripts and repertoires to consolidate and maintain power; however, in so doing, they offer the United States opportunities to fracture, exploit, or contradict those scripts in ways that serve deterrent strategies. Authoritarian scripts often involve the repression of women and marginalized gender groups and the simultaneous promotion of what it means to be a desirable and powerful man, which may reflect both how authoritarian regimes acquire power and what they believe power is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-gender-and-women&quot;&gt;Russia, Gender, and Women&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women’s equality is written into Russia’s constitution, and women in Russia occupy a relatively more equal social position than their counterparts in other authoritarian contexts. Yet, as of 2024, it is clear that Vladimir Putin’s brand of authoritarianism relies on strict differentiation between men and women. Russian women occupy a significant place in the labor market, and, in general, they are more educated than Russian men, but the legal and social differentiation of men and women has increased in Russia since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Feminist activists and gender equality advocates have been vocal opponents of the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The legal and social differentiation of men and women has increased in Russia since the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Soviet era, Russian laws supported gender equality, but then, as now, women’s social role was heavily centered on their childbearing and childrearing capacity. Although many women held jobs outside the home, they were banned from professions that might threaten their reproductive health, and pronatalist policies featured heavily in Soviet economic plans. Indeed, especially today, Russian women are encouraged to bear children to counter the nation’s declining birth rate — a statistic associated with decreased competitiveness in the global economy. Cloaked in the language of “traditional values,” Moscow’s sustained campaign against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) rights can also be understood in light of its pronatalist stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This emphasis on “traditional values” has not always been a part of Vladimir Putin’s political arsenal. He began emphasizing cultural traditionalism (and restrictive gender roles for men and women) toward the end of his second term as president (2007–2008) and ramped up the rhetoric significantly after returning to the presidency in 2012. Along with his performance of virile masculine virtues in public spaces and photo opportunities, Putin began drawing starker lines of contrast between Russian “civilization” and the West. The close connections and affinity between Putin’s regime and the Russian army — an organization notorious for the brutality not only of its battlefield tactics, but also of its barracks culture — further underlined the importance of aggressive, “macho” behavior in legitimizing Putin’s abrogation of political opposition. Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the violence of the war and domestic violence have been mutually reinforcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These restrictive visions of gender cut across Russia’s many social, ethnic, and cultural divides. In places where support for Putin might be limited because of his regime’s actions in the past — Chechnya, for example — promoting this version of violent, dominating masculinity is a way to consolidate support in certain quarters (and divide potential opposition by casting the regime’s role in “natural” and “nonpolitical” terms). Public memory of the chaos of the 1990s makes calls for order (even if restrictive) appealing across Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-gender-and-women&quot;&gt;China, Gender, and Women&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women in twentieth and twenty-first century China have found their social and legal position highly dependent on the internal politics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP): despite robust official rhetoric about communism’s equality principles, men remain socially and legally advantaged over women. As of 2024, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China is undergoing a period of rising discrimination against women and inequality between men and women. Indeed, the CCP has been intensifying its crackdown on feminist activists and is increasingly reliant on the subjugation of women to maintain its hold on power. This is evident in the proliferation of unchecked gender-based violence, emphasis on “harmony” in response to dissent, and the performance of stereotypical masculinity by Xi and other high-ranking officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising economic uncertainty in China in the early 2020s has been accompanied by new policies pushing women into traditional roles of wife and mother in the home and making it far more difficult for women to obtain a divorce. Concern over a “masculinity crisis” has led to crackdowns on certain kinds of popular music, clothing, and other forms of expression deemed too “feminine” for Chinese men. At the same time, official rhetoric in support of Xi Jinping has focused on his paternal and masculine qualities, painting him as an ideal type of husband and father. Mirroring the CCP’s characterization of the Chinese state as a familial unit, this rhetoric makes space both for increasing the centralization of power in the CCP and for collectively enduring potential economic downturns. Sexist elements of Confucianism tend to replace the more egalitarian language of Marxism in these displays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As of 2024, under the leadership of Xi Jinping, China is undergoing a period of rising discrimination against women and inequality between men and women.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, China’s economic uncertainty will be directly impacted by women’s choices. Decades of the infamous one-child policy have produced severely declining birthrates in China, threatening a demographic contraction that will likely lead to greater instability. Efforts to both encourage and shame women into marriage and childbearing have had little discernible effect thus far, and, among younger generations, women — and to a lesser extent even men — express solidarity with feminism and gender equality. Most significantly, Chinese women were at the forefront of protests in China against the CCP’s draconian Covid-19 policies. The CCP’s campaign to shut down feminist dissent networks was only partially successful, as their previous anti-dissent campaigns focused on the threat of male dissenters. Women’s criticism of the regime poses a more complicated threat to the CCP’s dominance of the political discourse in China, in part because of the efforts the CCP has made to exclude them from the political realm and because of the growing popularity of feminist ideas among ordinary young women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, as Xi strengthens his grip on power in Beijing, the CCP is fomenting concerns that boys are being “feminized,” and it has chosen not to place women in CCP leadership positions, a move that appears to contradict decades of Chinese policy promoting gender equality. Indeed, Beijing’s vision of a strong China now includes returning women to traditional gender roles — such as pushing them into marriage and childbirth — and cracking down on feminist activism. Much more directly, the Xinjiang crackdown has an extremely strong gendered element — specifically the elimination of Uyghur masculinity and the mass sterilization of women, combined with the imposition of Han men on Uyghur households.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-dictators-gender-playbook&quot;&gt;A Dictator’s Gender Playbook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Beijing and Moscow are weaponizing aspects of gender to advance their own strategic aims — and in somewhat similar ways. Indeed, there almost appears to be a gender-oriented “Dictator’s Playbook” with the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Women support national strength by serving as wives and mothers within the politically stabilizing institution of marriage&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Western ideas about sexuality are a threat to national strength&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Power means domination over other countries&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Young people are weaker than the generation the leaders came from, especially young men, and a demographic crisis looms without change&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Women in power are deceitful and threatening&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These gender-driven positions are spilling over into the politics and strategic priorities of third-party states. As elites in Georgia, for example, are expanding cooperation with both Moscow and Beijing, they are simultaneously targeting women political leaders and rolling back progress on gender equity. Conversely, upward of 60,000 Ukrainian women have been on the front lines of the country’s war against Moscow, enhancing the resilience and resistance capabilities of Ukraine overall in the face of an overwhelming adversary. Interviews on the ground in Ukraine in August 2023 suggested that investments in civil society — and in particular women’s groups — since 2014 helped create a sufficiently prodemocratic Ukrainian identity that, in turn, contributed to a ferocious national will to fight. In Iran, which engages in gender apartheid, a powerful protest movement has been challenging the authority and legitimacy of the Ayatollah’s radical Islamic regime — a protest movement that was sparked and carried forward by women and girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: If U.S. adversaries are using similar gender-conservative playbooks, what might these gendered activities mean for U.S. strategy broadly, and for tailored, integrated deterrence specifically? In other words, gender appears to represent a critical societal fault line for contemporary authoritarian regimes — and a key, if perhaps underappreciated, mechanism for mobilizing prodemocratic forces and national will to fight. This leads to an interesting proposition: might gender-related tools, and primarily those associated with the WPS toolkit, provide the United States and the DoD with key vectors for tailoring its integrated deterrence strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-concepts-using-wps-and-gender-analyses-as-strategic-enablers-for-building-competitive-advantage&quot;&gt;Strategic Concepts: Using WPS and Gender Analyses as Strategic Enablers for Building Competitive Advantage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one interlocutor over the course of the study noted: given the manifold strategic advantages that WPS programs and capabilities can present for the United States, it may be time for the DoD enterprise writ large to consider gender as a significant dimension of competition rather than as a set of abstract concepts. While a number of components, for example INDOPACOM, have already taken and are promulgating this conceptual approach, the concept of gender as a domain needs to be understood throughout all of the DoD’s echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If gender is a dimension of competition, WPS tools then logically become a DoD strategic enabler — that is, a mechanism for more effective accomplishment of DoD activities and priorities. Accordingly, by considering the interrelated problems of strategic competition and tailored, integrated deterrence within a gender perspective, this brief underscores a number of ways that the DoD can leverage WPS as a strategic enabler to build advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WPS as a flanking maneuver.&lt;/strong&gt; China and Russia have both ceded this space by ignoring WPS initiatives — that is, by not participating in decisionmaking processes to elevate women’s engagement in peace, political, and security discussions. As a result, this gives the United States, and the DoD specifically, opportunities to outflank Chinese and Russian activities in the Eurasian and Indo-Pacific theaters, if not globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WPS as a mechanism to expand the competitive space.&lt;/strong&gt; WPS represents unique opportunities to interact and engage with partner and allied nations in a theater that is entirely absent China’s participation. For instance, WPS opens pathways for enhanced dialogue between the United States and say, Japan, via Track 1.5 dialogues that have positive externalities that span beyond the WPS mission. To that end, WPS represents a key vector for shaping allied and partner perceptions that is presently underutilized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WPS as a mechanism for crisis assurance and communication on other non-WPS national security matters.&lt;/strong&gt; Among democratic states, WPS creates positive spaces that are often viewed as not politically controversial. Accordingly, the United States ought to consider how WPS spaces might create vectors for communicating broader policy messages to key allies and partners in theater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WPS and gender as a strategic offset vis-à-vis Russia’s numerical superiority in a warfighting context.&lt;/strong&gt; A recent CSIS report found that “European states are likely to face significant challenges conducting large-scale combat missions, particularly in such areas as heavy maneuver forces, naval combatants, and support capabilities such as logistics and fire support.” Much like during the Cold War, Russia has a vast supply of manpower that it is willing to expend on the front lines in Ukraine (and elsewhere). During the Cold War, that numerical advantage was offset by U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nuclear weapons. As it is unlikely that the United States will want to utilize nuclear weapons in a contemporary contingency unless absolutely necessary, U.S. allies and partners in the EUCOM area of responsibility (AOR) must be able to call upon their entire populations to resist and deter Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WPS and gender as a tool for societal resilience vis-à-vis an expansionist Russia.&lt;/strong&gt; As one strategy expert noted, “deterrence is ” In other words, the ability of a society to withstand attacks by aggressors is a key aspect of deterrence strategies, and it informs issues like continuity of governance and operations planning. As discovered during a research trip in August 2023, women’s groups in Ukraine were — and are — critical in building national-level societal cohesion and resistance to authoritarian aggression. Designing gender-informed strategic offsets and societal resilience strategies requires incorporating gender perspectives centrally into national security and societal resilience planning and preparedness operations, rather than as an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender treatment as a key strategic competition indicator or warning.&lt;/strong&gt; Democratic backsliding in order to cater to authoritarian regimes such as China and Russia is almost always accompanied by gender-based harassment and the undermining of women’s rights. Given that almost all contemporary authoritarian regimes double down on these gender-based playbooks, it is worth exploring how the utilization of gender by U.S. allies, partners, and adversaries can inform indicators and warnings about regime trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women fighters as strategic assets.&lt;/strong&gt; Much as women in Ukraine have been critical on the front lines in the war against Russia, Kurdish women’s units were fierce fighters against the Islamic State. Further, the reputational damage to misogynistic Islamic State fighters being forced to fight — and lose — to women made such women’s units strategic rather than tactical assets. This suggests the need to more meaningfully consider the utility of women and women’s units within combat formations to create military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth underscoring that these concepts are primarily focused on women and the application of the WPS toolkit. However, given that many contemporary authoritarian regimes use a militaristic, misogynistic version of masculinity to consolidate and promulgate power, considerable further work should be done to understand how different masculinities and different genders might intersect with efforts to implement NDS objectives and tailor deterrent strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-the-utility-of-wps-informed-approaches-in-dod-scenarios-through-tabletop-exercises&quot;&gt;Testing the Utility of WPS-Informed Approaches in DoD Scenarios through Tabletop Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might applying these concepts in practice look like? How might a WPS or gender-forward approach modify approaches to operations, activities, and investments (OAIs) in key theaters? And do practitioners agree with the premise that such WPS-informed approaches might generate strategic advantage for the United States? To discern answers to these questions, CSIS designed a series of tabletop exercises (TTXs) that allowed players to develop new OAIs associated with global competition against China and Russia. The following insights were gained through that activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, according to player assessments, gender-linked OAIs produced greater advantages in long-term competition. As one participant noted, “if you have one country or society that is willing to mobilize 100 percent of its people and one that is only willing to mobilize 49 percent of its people, one’s got a big advantage over the other.” In the words of another player, “the quantity that our adversaries have when it comes to an actual contingency . . . given their numerical superiority, just the mass they can throw at these problems . . . ensuring that all of society and our allies and partners [are] able to mobilize, to resist and to deter, [to] defend all these things is going to be essential.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there was no meaningful difference between the treatments with respect to escalation risk. In other words, players believed that gender-informed competition mechanisms and OAIs constituted a net positive. Gender-informed competition, especially activities that linked civil society groups and showed that U.S. partners had a great capacity to mobilize diverse constituencies, supported integrated deterrence and campaigning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the TTX discussion, participants ultimately concluded that U.S. adversaries, particularly China, were likely to view any action as escalatory by virtue of the fact that Beijing is likely to be hostile to any form of increased U.S. activity. Escalation might therefore be better conceived as a given rather than something to be avoided. Further, one participant noted that the United States might do well to design activities that would force adversaries to respond. A number of participants maintained that a command post exercise that tested whole-of-society mobilization in the INDOPACOM AOR might be one useful way to do this while simultaneously building capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of escalation led to contemplating whether supporting women’s groups might lead to authoritarian backlash. Women’s groups, and women individually, are often targets for repression and retaliation; in any number of instances when women rise in status under authoritarian regimes, conspiracy theories circulate that their power is a result of U.S. backing. In order to minimize such risk, efforts to engage women and women’s groups should be treated carefully and with the overall intention to do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there was no major difference with respect to how players assessed long-term competitive effects and regional prioritization for OAIs between the two treatments. Both treatments saw groups prioritize preparing partners as the optimal long-term strategy in support of integrated deterrence and campaigning (48 percent in gender-linked OAI treatments, 45 percent in non-gender-linked treatments). Regionally, across the treatments players focused on activities in INDOPACOM (75 percent in gender-linked OAI treatments, 67 percent in non-gender-linked treatments). Last, there was a similar distribution with respect to complementary interagency activity. Across both treatments, players emphasized combining military competition with diplomacy and measures designed to inform and influence targeted populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only meaningful difference between treatments was with respect to intelligence. In treatments with gender-linked OAIs, players appear to have assessed that working with civil society groups gave them increased situational awareness, as they less frequently selected intelligence activities. This is likely due to a sense that WPS-linked activities helped them better understand the operational environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, what became apparent from the TTX is that planners assess that WPS has a key role to play in great power competition. This is because WPS can help mobilize diverse constituencies in partner states (capacity) and increase the ability of the United States to counter malign actions in the gray zone (capability) — especially since the United States is often blind to adversary operations designed to hijack civil society. WPS represents a way to more effectively counter authoritarian strategies to compete with, if not undermine, U.S. positioning and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;applying-the-insights-the-european-and-pacific-deterrence-initiatives&quot;&gt;Applying the Insights: The European and Pacific Deterrence Initiatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) and the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) are flagship programs designed to better organize DoD programs and capabilities intended to communicate U.S. and partner red lines to Moscow and Beijing, respectively. Because they are also theater-specific programs with dedicated congressional authorization, oversight, and funding levels, they provide key insights into how the DoD implements its deterrence strategies over multiple fiscal years. Critically, gender and WPS are rarely, if ever, referenced in discussions about EDI and PDI — which creates opportunities for usefully reconsidering how such approaches might inform OAIs for the EUCOM and INDOPACOM theaters. Combining insights from all the research conducted over the course of the study, some ideas for recalibrating PDI and EDI investments with a gender-informed approach emerge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercising.&lt;/strong&gt; Within INDOPACOM, the DoD could increase the number of exercises with partner units that have a higher number of women entering their ranks — such as the Japanese Self-Defense Forces and Philippine forces during the annual Balikatan exercise — to show how to build partner capacity while signaling the expanding role of women in defense, something China will struggle to match.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased presence.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD can use permanent and rotational forces to demonstrate to allies and partners in theater the power and utility of women in combat, as well as in combat support and combat service support Likewise, both Moscow and Beijing are utilizing regressive gender roles as mechanisms for consolidating state power. The United States might consider using its increased forward presence to demonstrate other more democratic and meritocratic gender roles that can undermine adversary morale and cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network-building.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD can work with women’s groups in countries like Papua New Guinea to build information-gathering mechanisms for monitoring Chinese economic coercion and infrastructure projects that are damaging to the region. Doing so might simultaneously empower women within local societies and create new mechanisms for countering China’s economic expansionism and elite capture strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Posture and military construction.&lt;/strong&gt; As the United States adjusts its posture in the EUCOM and INDOPACOM theaters, choices of where and how bases and facilities are constructed will have effects on local Conducting a gender analysis, and understanding local gender dynamics, can help inform strategies for using military construction monies in a manner that will engender the greatest level of local support for U.S. presence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced prepositioning.&lt;/strong&gt; A key aspect of EDI and PDI is the forward stationing of key equipment and materiel that could be utilized in a crisis or contingency. Host nation support — that is, the ability of a given country to support U.S. forces during peacetime and war — includes a nation’s ability to ensure that U.S. forces are able to land, access such equipment, and move in a crisis. Considering women and women’s networks more centrally in prepositioning and host nation support activities may build complementarity between EDI or PDI and building whole-of-society resistance and resilience strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusions and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War is a centrally human endeavor; gender is a core aspect of individual identity and of the human experience. Omitting gender, and gender perspectives, from defense planning and operations creates enormous blind spots toward adversary weaknesses and opportunities with allies and partners. If the DoD is to build its deterrent strategies in a tailored manner, considering gender more centrally in its war and defense planning is essential. A number of recommendations flow from the above analysis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional resources.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the applications of WPS for tailored, integrated deterrence purposes as outlined above are conceptual rather than resource That said, the current funding levels for WPS activities — particularly those involving allies and partners — is unlikely to be sufficient for these purposes. It is outside the scope of this brief to develop a concrete budgetary recommendation; partnering with Congress, the DoD should establish a WPS/Strategic Competition pilot fund for actioning these activities that includes an assessment of the resources required to increase their scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage gender advisers.&lt;/strong&gt; The DoD has established a cadre of gender advisers (GENADs) across its command structures. In addition to the WPS-related training, education, and partner support work these GENADs perform, components should bring them into key planning and other processes to ensure that their perspective and ideas can be integrated into operational and strategic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A broader gender lens.&lt;/strong&gt; While women and women’s issues are often the starting point for considerations of gender, at the end of the day “gender” also includes how men view Do men living under repressive authoritarian regimes in Russia, China, or Iran agree with the policies of gender apartheid — and the promotion of hollow, militaristic versions of “manliness”? How do women in these societies relate to men? What are men’s own aspirations and how do they realize them?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the WPS agenda forward toward countering and deterring authoritarian regimes requires situating women within the broader societal context of which men are a part. Considering gender and WPS in this way is not to “weaponize” or “militarize” these toolkits. Rather, it is a way to acknowledge that women have been, and will be, decisive when it comes to countering authoritarian expansionism. Women are active, and at times critical, agents in both war and peace; smart strategy will better incorporate women — and all genders — more fully into the tailored deterrence strategies needed to prevent war from occurring. Many authoritarian adversaries are weaponizing gender against U.S. interests; it is past time for the U.S. government, and the DoD within it, to develop sufficiently gender-informed responses. Viewed in this light, applying a gender perspective to the problem of strategic competition is a necessary step toward accomplishing the UN-supported vision for Women, Peace, and Security.&lt;/p&gt;

Crafting an effective deterrence strategy, however, presents its own unique challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent US elections have created a new political reality that will impact global stability in the coming years, including the Russian war in Ukraine. While Donald Trump’s stated goal of ending the war quickly resonates with Ukrainians, achieving a lasting peace requires selecting the right strategies and resources to ensure sustainable results. Apart from dealing with immediate challenges on the battlefield, given Vladimir Putin’s obsession with Ukraine, any solution that lacks this lasting impact risks disastrous consequences, as Russia could recover, rearm, and reignite the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining long-term security arrangements for Ukraine requires a comprehensive set of military and strategic measures for maintaining stability and defending Ukraine’s territory, society, economy and rule of law against future foreign aggression. Such measures are widely seen as critical to Ukraine’s post-war recovery and to preventing future escalations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic is especially challenging to address while Ukraine’s immediate security remains under severe threat. After enduring nearly three years of active war, Ukraine still needs ongoing support for operations, including additional weapons, funding and domestic mobilisation. Meanwhile, the support from international partners shows signs of wavering, and in the US, assistance to Ukraine has become a point of contentious political debate. With uncertainties around how and when Ukraine will emerge from this war, within what borders and in what economic state, it is understandably difficult to plan for its long-term security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, long-term strategising remains essential, as lacking a clear security vision creates a void that complicates any future planning. Without this long-term perspective, doubts may arise about Ukraine’s prospects, potentially impacting international support even if its territory is liberated. So long as Russia remains under Putin’s regime, the existential threat to Ukraine will persist, driven by Putin’s personal fixation on the country which may push him beyond rational limits. While some observers suggest that Ukraine should pursue territorial concessions as a path to compromise, this approach misunderstands the existential nature of the conflict. For Putin, territory is not the ultimate goal – ending Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence is. Concessions would not end hostilities but instead encourage further aggression, as they would fail to address the core motives driving Putin’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO membership offers a natural path forward. Once active hostilities conclude, Ukraine’s admission to NATO will be crucial to stabilising the region. Ukraine must, however, be treated not merely as a security liability but as an asset. Structuring and strengthening Ukraine’s defences will make this discussion more feasible, as a robust new NATO member will strengthen the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Under current conditions, with limitations on weapon types and their use, Ukraine is fighting a war that NATO would never choose to fight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One crucial assumption is that Putin will refrain from attacking Ukraine if Russia lacks either the resources or the likelihood of success. Although the first condition may be difficult to ensure indefinitely, the second can be achieved. Should Ukraine possess or have access to sufficient defensive capabilities to thwart any future invasion, this would significantly reduce the likelihood of renewed aggression. This approach, often called “deterrence by denial”, would serve as an effective defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other forms of deterrence may be less optimal. For instance, “deterrence by punishment” appears limited in impact. Russia is already incurring staggering losses in the current conflict, allocating over 40% of its state budget to the war and losing close to 700,000 troops as casualties, thousands of weapon systems, and most of its Black Sea fleet. For most regimes, such losses would be unsustainable, but for Putin, they do not appear to have impacted his commitment to the war. To force a resolution, the Kremlin would need to lose strategically – not merely in manpower or equipment, but through a fundamental military failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising the importance of deterrence, the Ukrainian government has incorporated this strategy into its national military framework, known as the “Victory Plan”. While largely classified, key elements were outlined by President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Verkhovna Rada on 16 October 2024, with “Deterrence” as a central theme addressing long-term security. Zelensky proposed a “strategic non-nuclear deterrence package” within Ukraine, aimed at providing a robust defence against potential Russian aggression. According to Zelensky, “the deterrence package ensures that Russia faces a choice: engage in diplomacy or see its war machine dismantled. Peace through strength”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus should be on building a force capable of repelling future aggression and ensuring that, if Russia attacks, it will face defeat on the battlefield. Such a capability must not only be developed but also maintained at a high state of readiness. It should be evident to Russia that any attack would lead to decisive failure, thereby preventing it from trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of such deterrence must also be evident to the people of Ukraine, allied governments, and the international business community. Confidence in Ukraine’s military potential should be strong enough to assure investors that they can safely conduct business in the country. The only way to sustain such a force in the long term is to match it with a strong economy. In this respect, the example of South Korea is particularly relevant. Despite the absence of a peace agreement with the North, the deterrent capability of military power has provided the security necessary for sustained social and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building such a force will be a significant challenge. First, it must deter a Russian force that, despite multiple failures in Ukraine, remains large in numbers. Second, any ceasefire would give Russia the opportunity to rebuild its military capabilities, potentially enhancing its strike power. Russia, after all, spares no resources in producing weapons, with at least 40% of its state budget currently allocated to the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The costs of building a credible deterrent force are easy to underestimate. Simply sending older Western equipment to Ukraine will not achieve the necessary deterrent effect. Only competitive capabilities will suffice. For example, the current provision of older F-16s to Ukraine is inadequate to deny Russian air superiority over the frontlines due to outdated radars and missiles. As a result, Russia continues to dominate the airspace in close proximity to the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of tactical air superiority cannot be overstated. Today, Ukraine faces significant challenges in dealing with Russia’s gliding bombs, missiles, and long-range drones. A competitive air force is as essential for Ukraine as it is for any NATO country preparing for war. With NATO membership, these costs could be shared – especially for high-cost capabilities like aviation. Without it membership, Ukraine will have to build and sustain them on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for a future force cannot be based on today’s operational environment. Under current conditions, with limitations on weapon types and their use, Ukraine is fighting a war that NATO would never choose to fight. NATO’s strategy would rely on overwhelming airpower and deep strikes to weaken enemy forces before they reached the frontline. Instead, Ukraine is meeting Russian forces at their strongest, at the front. Lacking adequate air and long-range firepower, Ukraine is compelled to compensate with the lives of its people – at least until a more effective operational model is established. Addressing the shortcomings of the current model is crucial not only for immediate success but also for ensuring future security. Delaying this effort results in the tragic loss of lives on a daily basis, underscoring the urgent need for decisive action. This painful reality demands immediate attention and cannot be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The costs of building this force could be significantly reduced by leveraging Ukraine’s industrial capabilities, implementing leasing arrangements, and creating international funds with contributions from multiple donors for specific programmes. Ukraine has the potential to close a massive capability gap if its industrial base is engaged in full. Unlike Western defence industries, Ukraine’s industry is operating on a war footing, with many factories running 24/7 and bureaucratic red tape kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strategically planning Ukraine’s future military force, anticipating evolving trends, and conducting rapid assessments is not just essential for Ukraine’s survival; it is critical for the security of Western allies as well&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, cost is not the only challenge. In accepting that deterrent capabilities must be competitive, the ongoing need for adaptation and innovation becomes crucial. The speed of technological advancement today is unprecedented. Innovation teams on all sides of the war are working tirelessly, introducing new measures and countermeasures. Technologies such as computer vision, electronic warfare, and long-range communications are poised to profoundly influence future military concepts and capabilities, and we have yet to see how these will ultimately shape weapon systems. The successful implementation of these technologies on the battlefield could render many older weapons and doctrines obsolete, a trend already visible in the current war. Ukraine’s future force must remain competitive in this rapidly evolving operational environment, which makes long-term predictions difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, small and medium-sized unmanned platforms are challenging the concept of air superiority, operating beyond the reach of traditional aviation and air defence. At the same time, electronic warfare has significantly impacted the effectiveness of these platforms. Current developments in computer vision aim to make these systems immune to electronic warfare, while counter-air drones are being designed to present a new challenge to drone warfare itself. All of these systems are part of an evolving operational landscape, competing for battlefield dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping up the pace of adaptation and technological development is now a critical requirement to remain relevant. Unfortunately, many Western developers and governments have not yet achieved the necessary speed. For example, procurement and export control systems, designed for peacetime conditions, are ill-suited to the fast-paced demands of modern warfare. These bureaucratic hurdles prevent too many innovative platforms from being deployed effectively in the field. Western militaries and governments should not view this as a minor delay in aiding Ukraine. Rather, lengthy supply chains and slow adaptation cycles risk rendering critical platforms obsolete before they can be competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After assessing the ongoing war, former US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, co-authored an article warning that the US military is not keeping pace with the fast-changing nature of modern warfare, and this issue is likely even more pronounced in European militaries. Now is the time for faster research and development, more rapid prototyping, and quicker delivery to the battlefield. The multiyear cycles traditionally required for new weapons must be viewed as an unaffordable luxury of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically planning Ukraine’s future military force, anticipating evolving trends, and conducting rapid assessments is not just essential for Ukraine’s survival; it is critical for the security of Western allies as well. The urgent need to innovate and collaborate in defence capabilities cannot be overstated. Only by embracing change and acting decisively can the West ensure that this conflict does not become a harbinger of greater crises in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

The focus was on how players representing key nations make decisions at the intersection of climate and trade policy to reduce emissions, boost economic opportunity, and ensure security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game explored the geopolitical and economic dynamics that arise when a bloc of developed countries establishes a climate club. Will such a club drive greater global cooperation on emissions as it expands, or will it trigger trade wars, creating a bleaker outlook for long-term climate outcomes? How do economic, environmental, geopolitical, or security considerations shape players’ priorities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report documents the game and how participants navigated the one-day simulation. It outlines the game’s setup, turn-by-turn progression, and key takeaways for policymakers. Additionally, the authors examine the game’s limitations and propose areas for further research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-structure-and-rules&quot;&gt;Game Structure and Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each player was assigned to one of three teams: G7+ (representing the Group of Seven countries along with Australia and South Korea), China, or emerging markets. Each player assumed the role of a government leader tasked with achieving their country’s ambitions for climate, economics, and security. Twenty-five experts from the climate and trade communities participated, representing a diverse mix of academic and civil society institutions, private companies, foreign embassies, and trade associations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the game, each participant represented a country or, in the case of China, a political or administrative entity. The three teams were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G7+ team.&lt;/strong&gt; Each of the 11 participants represented each G7 country (except Italy), Australia, and South Korea. The U.S. delegation had three players, acting as the president, the special presidential envoy for climate, and Congress. And European Union was represented by one player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emerging markets team.&lt;/strong&gt; The nine participants represented Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China team.&lt;/strong&gt; The five participants represented the following political authorities and administrative entities: Chinese president Xi Jinping and the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration; the Ministry of Ecology and Environment; the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Finance, People’s Bank of China, State Administration of Taxation, Security Regulatory Commission, and Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission; and provincial and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants received individual motivations outlining objectives to pursue and defensive interests to protect, both within their team’s deliberations and in the broader game context. They were asked to make decisions consistent with that guidance but to be creative in how they realized their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game covered a five-year time frame from 2027 to 2032 and consisted of three rounds, each lasting between one and one-and-a-half hours. The first round began with instructions to the G7+ to establish a climate club in the first turn. Over the next two turns, exogenous geopolitical and climate conditions continued to worsen as global temperatures passed key global targets, climate-associated extreme events negatively affected different regions, and geopolitical tensions worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams were assigned separate rooms to strategize, deliberate, and set policies. Teams could submit action forms to make official communications or announce policy decisions. These were publicly announced to all other teams and the game’s moderators (Control). In addition to central moderators, each room had a facilitator answering questions and announcing updates from Control. Control could amend the scenario at any time to introduce events that could shift game dynamics, such as the reestablishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for the first hour and the last 30 minutes of the game, when teams deliberated over their opening and closing strategies, written bilateral communications and in-person bilateral and multilateral meetings were allowed between teams. Participants were free to take action independently of their team by submitting individual action forms. There was no limit to the number of forms participants could table per round, though all were encouraged to stay within the scope of trade, economic, and climate policy actions. They were also blocked from declaring war or resorting to kinetic military action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each team started the game with a score assigned by Control representing their collective standing in 2027 across four categories: economy, emissions, domestic political support, and allies (i.e., the level of cohesion within the group). Control updated the scores after each round based on how each team’s actions had affected these four categories, and facilitators privately distributed these to team members. Teams could choose which categories they wished to prioritize through their actions, consistent with their internal motivations, but they were instructed to consider the long-term effects beyond the game’s five-year time frame. For example, they had no obligation to implement dramatic emissions cuts within five years, as establishing credible long-term climate policies was sufficient to realize climate ambitions, though potentially at the expense of economic outcomes or domestic political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each round was followed by a 30-minute break enabling teams to regroup and participants to address personal business, as well as a 30-minute adjudication session in which all teams reconvened in the main meeting room to receive an update on game progress from Control. The day ended with a one-hour hotwash for organizers to reflect on the decisions participants made throughout the game and for participants to share feedback on the game’s overall design and conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-progression-and-key-events&quot;&gt;Game Progression and Key Events&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;round-1-club-formation-and-reactions&quot;&gt;Round 1: Club Formation and Reactions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first round, set in 2027, was devoted to establishing a G7+ climate club and immediate reactions from other participants. The G7+ team was tasked with reaching an agreement on the nature of their climate club within the first hour, while other teams considered their engagement strategies. The emerging markets team made preemptive announcements, expressing concern that wealthy nations would unilaterally impose border measures and undermine multilateral efforts to reduce emissions. They called on the G7+ to adopt collective strategies that accounted for their past emissions and developing countries’ need for financial support and technology for mitigation. China echoed these sentiments, offering support for the emerging markets’ position and inviting an open bilateral discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G7+ announced the creation of a climate club with the following features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon-free economy goal.&lt;/strong&gt; Members commit to achieving a carbon-free economy by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon accounting.&lt;/strong&gt; Members gradually implement value chain accounting across all economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbon border measures.&lt;/strong&gt; Each member establishes its own carbon border measure, such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for the European Union or carbon tariffs for the United States under the Foreign Pollution Fee Act.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal trade exemption.&lt;/strong&gt; Members assign no climate-related border measures internally, pending the negotiation of an internal green marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology transfers.&lt;/strong&gt; Members make technology transfers to low- and lower-middle-income countries wishing to join the club.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared oversight.&lt;/strong&gt; All members participate in oversight and decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China criticized the proposal as vague and likely to undermine global trading rules for protectionist purposes. However, the China team refrained from taking adversarial action, instead calling for more details from the G7+ about the climate club. Meanwhile, China, Brazil, and India announced they would begin discussions on creating a global carbon accounting system open to all countries. The round closed with the United States and Canada communicating Mexico’s decision to join the club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;round-2-expansion-attempts-and-emerging-market-responses&quot;&gt;Round 2: Expansion Attempts and Emerging Market Responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second round, covering the period of 2028–2029, unfolded as a battle for influence over emerging markets between the G7+ and China, with China scoring some early wins. Talks between China, Brazil, and India on establishing a global carbon accounting system gained momentum as all remaining BRICS members and Saudi Arabia joined. In response, the G7+ offered to collaborate by sharing data and discussing potential common standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China released a three-pronged strategy designed to counter the G7+ club:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reserve the right to “respond appropriately” to any discriminatory measures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest RMB 10 trillion over 10 years to speed up the decarbonization of China’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Launch the Inclusive Green Belt, focused on a fair accounting mechanism for carbon, technology sharing for climate challenges, and promoting free trade in environmental goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China later secured the backing of India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa to pursue a joint dispute settlement case at the WTO against U.S. carbon border tariffs. This decision prompted Control to announce the reestablishment of the WTO Appellate Body based on a coin toss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China’s momentum soon slowed. Crucially, no country chose to join the Inclusive Green Belt. While Russia responded positively to that proposal, China instead started bilateral negotiations on nuclear cooperation and a 30-year gas supply agreement aiming to reduce Chinese coal dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the G7+ successfully enticed Mexico and Turkey to join its climate club, though it had to concede to their demands for preferential conditions. To further strengthen the club, the United States announced a USD 1 trillion fund offering grants and submarket loads for climate investments — exclusively accessible to club members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Courted on both sides, emerging markets sought to strengthen their negotiating power by leveraging their collective resources. Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, and South Africa came together to form the Organization of Critical Minerals Exporters (OCME) to promote inclusive, fair, sustainable, and stable critical minerals markets. In the process, OCME even attracted Australia and Canada to join its ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the round, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (OPEC+) coordinated to undermine the green transition within the G7+. They released large quantities of oil into the market, aiming to slow the growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and stall investment in critical minerals. Officially, OPEC+ presented this as a move to ease the global cost of living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;round-3-final-negotiations-and-outcomes&quot;&gt;Round 3: Final Negotiations and Outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and final round, covering 2030–2032, did not bring any realignment among the teams. The G7+ solidified its climate club by achieving three key milestones. First, it finalized a major internal agreement on the green marketplace, tackling tariffs and nontariff barriers to establish a free market for environmental goods and services, public procurement options, conformity assessment and standards, nondiscriminatory access to incentives programs, and critical minerals. Second, the group tackled inflation concerns by reallocating tariff revenue toward cost transfers, home retrofitting for higher efficiency, and clean vehicles and electricity subsidies. Lastly, the G7+ anchored Turkey into the club, largely through an EU commitment to accelerate Turkey’s accession talks and South Korea’s pledge to invest in Turkey’s nuclear and EV sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the G7+ could not prevent Mexico from leaving the club as inflationary pressures and declining economic opportunities within the club prompted its exit. Additionally, a joint EU-U.S. offer granting OCME members access to climate funds in exchange for preferential access to critical minerals went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, meanwhile, toughened its opposition to the G7+ club by imposing an export ban on all critical minerals processing technologies. However, China failed to gain traction in emerging markets despite pledging up to RMB 10 trillion in foreign direct investment to countries that would join the Inclusive Green Belt and remove tariffs on Chinese green goods. Additionally, the global carbon accounting discussions from the first and second rounds seemed to stall or fall by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among emerging markets, cohesion dissolved as each country pursued its national interests, choosing to negotiate bilaterally — either with other emerging markets or with other teams. India agreed to double its imports of Russian oil and gas in exchange for Indian investment into the Russian energy sector along with enhanced cooperation on decarbonization between the two countries. India further secured public financing from Saudi Arabia for domestic climate and energy transition projects, while Saudi Arabia negotiated a uranium deal with the United States and Australia to facilitate the Gulf region’s development of nuclear energy. OCME welcomed India, Japan, and South Korea within its ranks as “trusted processing and recycling centers,” but no other multilateral agreements emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scoring-progression&quot;&gt;Scoring Progression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the day progressed, each team dealt with advances and setbacks, and its scores in the four categories (economy, political support, emissions, and allies) shifted accordingly. The formation of a climate club by the G7+ team in round 1 improved its members’ emissions outlook, raising their emissions score from 2 to 4. By contrast, the club engendered the threat of trade restrictions and geopolitical hostility, lowering the team’s economy score from 6 to 4 and political support score from 5 to 3. China and emerging markets also saw bleak economic outcomes, with the club’s border adjustments and tariffs creating an economic burden for nonmember states. Round 2 saw general improvements for the G7+ and China teams, with the G7+ team expanding its alliance and China presenting a clear alternative to the G7-led climate club. The emerging markets team, however, was left with worsening natural disasters and inadequate financial commitments, reducing its political, economic, and allied scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/loZ92Lb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Progression of Scores by Team and Round&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team-analysis&quot;&gt;Team Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G7+ team.&lt;/strong&gt; The G7+ team proved particularly fractious due to the large number of participants and their diverse domestic approaches to climate policy. Internal differences kept the club from policy alignment. Early on, the EU and U.S. players retreated to separate rooms to coordinate their positions, a practice they continued at regular intervals. These divided sessions slowed overall club negotiations as each prioritized the management of their internal cohesion. The U.S. and EU policy proposals were also in conflict, as the United States had no internal carbon price to secure its climate goals, while the European Union was attached to its emissions trading system, which forced other members to mediate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the European Union and the United States reached an ungainly compromise and agreed on the main terms and benefits of the club, which they reluctantly extended to the rest of the group. However, the European Union stressed that its agreement was contingent on establishing a shared financing mechanism and access to U.S. subsidies in later rounds, which virtually halted the club’s implementation until all details were finalized in the late stages of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumed by internal negotiations throughout the game, the G7+ had little bandwidth to devote to a coherent outreach strategy for membership candidates — or even to consider how its proposals might appeal to them. Unable to tolerate China’s presence within the club, the United States clearly defined the group’s collective stance toward China, though the group’s lack of coordination was evident in the absence of cohesive messaging inside meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The China team.&lt;/strong&gt; The team’s structure was designed to mirror the decisionmaking processes that shape energy and climate policies in China. Each player represented a specific government entity. However, such internal dynamics were largely muted during the gameplay, as players were not assertive in their assigned roles. Instead, the team took a collaborative approach and deferred to the president/politburo when making major decisions. This pattern persisted when a different player assumed the presidency later in the game for logistical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early stages of the game, players spent significant time aligning their views on two key points: the state of energy and climate in China and the government’s priorities and redlines. Once the team reached a consensus, it acted as a unified block in international proceedings. No player deviated from the agenda during meetings with foreign representatives, the group consulted internally before and after each meeting, and no actions were taken without the group’s consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although players were keen to use China’s strengths in technology and state-driven international finance during negotiations, they took a cautious approach, avoiding proposals that might harm China’s economic security. Only in the final turn did China act on its stated opposition to the G7+ club by raising export controls on critical minerals technology. Their other initiatives to compete with the G7+ for global leadership, such as the Inclusive Green Belt and global carbon accounting schemes, stalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emerging markets team.&lt;/strong&gt; In the initial stages of the game, India and South Africa sought to lead a preemptive strategy to deter or at least mitigate the impact of the anticipated G7+ climate club. However, discussions broke down due to competing national interests. Turkey’s economic ties with Europe, as well as Mexico’s trade relationship with the United States, made them more conciliatory toward the G7+, culminating in their decision to join the G7+ club. However, Mexico later withdrew after determining the cost of membership was too high. By contrast, Indonesia and Vietnam were wary of antagonizing or overly depending on China, which hindered unification efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural resources also played a major role for players on the emerging markets team, as seen in the establishment of the OCME. Russia, meanwhile, pursued a natural gas and nuclear agreement with China, though its primary strategy was disruption. Russia used its cyber capabilities and natural resources to sow discord, particularly within the G7+, and to deter any actions that might threaten demand for its hydrocarbon exports. By the end of the game, the emerging markets team was too fragmented to resemble a cohesive economic bloc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-outcomes-and-insights&quot;&gt;Key Outcomes and Insights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The outcomes highlighted the risks of a trade-based climate strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; The game ended with escalating trade tensions, a worsening economic outlook for many countries, and only a modest increase in global ambitions for climate change. Despite mounting pressure from the public and increasingly visible climate effects, players prioritized economic and geopolitical goals over emissions reductions. Throughout the simulation, U.S.-China relations remained distant, and even the threat of a trade war failed to inspire rapprochement on carbon accounting standards, green development spending, or a common approach to climate and trade. The potential benefits of joining the G7+ climate club were not compelling enough to attract major emitters such as India, Brazil, or Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguity prevented teams from taking decisive action in early rounds.&lt;/strong&gt; As China and the emerging markets awaited details about the nascent club, they cautioned the G7+ against adopting protectionist measures but did not oppose the creation of a climate club outright or threaten direct retaliation. This left the G7+ team relatively free to act without external pressure. Most notably, China and the emerging markets failed to unite around a credible alternative to the G7+ effort. This could reflect a lack of appetite for climate clubs, or it could stem from emerging markets hedging their bets between potentially attractive options. In any case, the G7+ team appeared too preoccupied with its internal divisions to capitalize on opportunities to bring large emitters from the emerging markets team (such as Brazil, India, or Indonesia) into the fold or pressure China to increase its internal ambitions for climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic imperatives appeared to have a stabilizing effect on Chinese decisionmaking.&lt;/strong&gt; Appearing hesitant to jeopardize economic opportunities through retaliatory measures, the China team explored alternative options ranging from warning the G7+ against discriminatory measures to engaging with emerging markets in various formats and appealing to the WTO. When these efforts failed, China finally opted for retaliation, the scope of which was narrow, focusing on critical minerals and WTO litigation. The China team calculated that persistent macroeconomic difficulties would make it unfeasible to sustain a large-scale trade war that could compromise other priorities, including national security and climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geopolitical considerations, as well as regional and economic proximity, strongly influenced decisionmaking.&lt;/strong&gt; After the G7+ formally established its club, the United States and Canada swiftly approached Mexico, and the European Union approached Turkey. These moves seemed low risk and logical given the nations’ geographic proximity, political ties, and significant trade flows. By contrast, India was never directly courted to join either the G7+ club or China’s Inclusive Green Belt. The country’s ambivalent geopolitical positioning, as well as its low-ambition trade and climate mitigation policies, may have acted as deterrents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, both Mexico and Turkey sought access to the G7+ club in a manner that would permit continued Chinese investment in their economies. They requested that goods produced by Chinese companies on their soil, like BYD EVs, not be excluded from the internal green marketplace. Meanwhile, bilateral deals — such as those between China and Russia, Russia and India, or Saudi Arabia and the United States — aligned with existing geopolitical and sectoral relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade liberalization and energy supplies were the most effective tools for driving collaboration and realignment.&lt;/strong&gt; Both the G7+ and China made technology transfer and investment central to their efforts to entice other countries to cooperate, but they met with little success. Attempts by China and the emerging markets to exert influence through tighter controls on critical minerals or fossil fuels were also of limited influence. In contrast, trade liberalization played a significant role in supporting and dissuading club membership. Access to the green marketplace was key in attracting Mexico and Turkey to the G7+ club, while market access for Chinese green goods deterred emerging markets from embracing the Inclusive Green Belt. Energy supply played a significant role in bilateral deals between teams but was not a driver for clubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-for-policymakers&quot;&gt;Lessons for Policymakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear policy communication is paramount in multilateral negotiations — both in the run-up to a major policy pronouncement and upon its enactment.&lt;/strong&gt; Slow, cautious play characterized the game’s opening turns as all three teams appeared unsure of how to proceed or respond. After the G7+ and China teams published their proposals, they spent considerable time dispelling misunderstandings and clarifying their terms. Without clearly articulated goals and terms, club members had little opportunity to market membership to large emitters or potential geopolitical allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate clubs are contingent on flexible mechanisms that accommodate diverse national interests.&lt;/strong&gt; The G7+ team struggled to overcome its members’ disparate policy approaches but struck compromises to clinch an ambitious agreement based on long-term decarbonization. For example, the European Union exempted U.S. products from CBAM, even in the absence of a U.S. carbon market, in exchange for access to Inflation Reduction Act–style subsidies and expanded trade in green goods. The members also did not create a unified border measure, instead allowing each country to follow its national preference. Flexibility was crucial in expanding the club in later turns, as demonstrated in Mexico’s and Turkey’s attempts to protect Chinese investment in their territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate clubs must be aggressively marketed to emerging markets and geopolitical allies.&lt;/strong&gt; Neither the G7+ team nor the China team succeeded in attracting development economies to their club. This failure appears to stem from a lack of coordination among emerging markets as well as the one-size-fits-all approaches of the G7+ and China. Participants did not form any transactional arrangements, such as exchanging access to critical minerals for industrial investment or market access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade has the potential to drive, as well as deter, climate action.&lt;/strong&gt; Conventional climate club designs feature a common border measure to encourage nonmembers to join and adopt emissions targets. This is precisely what drove Mexico and Turkey to seek accession to the G7+ club. Yet trade policy considerations also complicated the search for solutions. The debate over the nature and extent of the border measure almost derailed the formation of the G7+ club, as the European Union and the United States disagreed on whether to adhere to WTO rules for raising border adjustments or selectively liberalize trade within the club. Later in the game, China’s demand for tariff-free treatment of its exports as a condition for participating in its Inclusive Green Belt deterred emerging markets from joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;priorities-for-future-research&quot;&gt;Priorities for Future Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve modeling of climate-focused trade mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt; A key shortfall in this game was the inability to model or quantitatively understand the economic, trade, emissions, and political stakes of different decisions. Participants had to reason about decisions using intuition or by asking questions of Control. They were also limited in their ability to compare options or grapple with the outcomes of different actions. Although policymakers in the real world face substantial uncertainty in the outcomes of their decisions, they must enter negotiations with some quantitative understanding of how to achieve their climate and economic goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the priorities of emerging markets in climate and trade negotiations.&lt;/strong&gt; Future research on climate clubs should focus on devising a coherent approach that enables the identification and harmonization of the diverse and often conflicting security, climate, and economic priorities of emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs). Research could explore how climate clubs can tailor membership incentives, such as market access, technology transfer, and political support, to attract EMDE participation. This could alleviate the shortcomings of the narrow, one-size-fits-all approaches observed in this simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a standardized and adaptable global carbon accounting framework.&lt;/strong&gt; Lack of consensus on carbon accounting standards and other evaluative criteria emerged as a major obstacle to cooperation during the simulation. Future research should focus on identifying carbon accounting procedures that meet enough needs to become standardized, such as accounting for data access and validation procedures. Proactive multilateral engagement is critical to effectively integrating these global standards into trade negotiations and carbon border mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify and navigate geopolitical and security redlines in climate negotiations.&lt;/strong&gt; The simulation illustrated that bilateral and multilateral agreements that align with existing geopolitical relationships or shared economic and security interests have higher rates of success. Future research should focus on identifying geopolitical and security redlines that hinder climate negotiations, as well as the ways climate clubs can mitigate these obstacles through measures such as public diplomacy, economic incentives, and security guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI has moved out of the academic sphere and is rapidly becoming a “general-purpose” technology with a significant impact on industry, government and society. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop a cross-sectoral environment for AI within countries to attract foreign direct investment, and actively participate in global trade and meet both economic and national security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in parallel to the technological investment in and development of this capability, robust governance systems must be in place to ensure the development and application of AI is trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These levels of trust, predictability and protection are particularly important at a time when collaboration between global powers and economies of a lesser magnitude is vital, but when different forms of regulation may be better suited to smaller economies and political structures. Moreover, the so-called “rules-based order” that once governed global interactions is now inconsistently applied. This presents a unique opportunity for like-minded middle economies to unite and collectively set the highest standards for AI’s ethical and responsible use in ways that uphold their strong commitment to democratic principles, human rights and freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of global uncertainty, the UK and Canada have consistently been viewed as trusted partners and “safe pairs of hands”. Both countries have respected political systems, strong higher education institutions, a shared monarchy, similarities in the legal and regulatory regimes, and military alliances (NATO and the “Five Eyes”). While many middle economies wait for powers like the US and the EU to set data and AI standards rules in the digital world, progress has been slow. Therefore, taking stock of the milestones and progress achieved in countries such as Canada and the UK is crucial, as well as considering the formation of a coalition of middle economies to set and influence global standards in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries are navigating their roles as middle powers in the global AI race, which is dominated by the US, the EU and China. Ranked third (UK) and fifth (Canada) in the 2024 top 10 countries leading in AI research and technology, with a market value of $21 billion for the UK and 144 generative AI-related startups in Canada, and scores of 38.1 (UK) and 34 (Canada) in the leading 20 AI countries in 2023 by research capacity, these countries have significant potential to collaborate on AI governance and the establishment of trustworthy and responsible AI cooperation. Demis Hassabis and Geoffrey Hinton, two thought leaders in AI research and practice, are both British, with Hinton having spent a significant part of his career in Canada – which is also home to other leading global AI scholars like Yoshua Bengio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;canada-and-the-uks-progress-and-existing-challenges&quot;&gt;Canada and the UK’s Progress and Existing Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress in data privacy and protection in the UK is an excellent example of progressive national efforts in the data-driven and digitalised world. These efforts have already resulted in comprehensive legislative frameworks like the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK-GDPR, both of which align with the EU’s GDPR to safeguard personal data across various sectors. The UK has also made progress in sector-specific privacy advancements, particularly in health informatics, with initiatives such as NHS Digital implementing stricter controls on patient data access through the Data Security and Protection Toolkit. Innovations like the UK National Data Strategy and the UK National AI Strategy highlight the government’s commitment to ensuring the responsible use of data while fostering innovation in digital services and AI applications. The Alan Turing Institute, which is the UK’s National Institute for Data Science and AI, focuses on advancing world-class research and applying it to national and global challenges, developing skills and training for the future, and driving informed public conversation. The Ada Lovelace Institute develops research, policy and practice to ensure that data and AI is used and harnessed in ways that maximise social wellbeing and put technology at the service of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is a unique opportunity for like-minded middle economies to unite and collectively set the highest standards for AI’s ethical and responsible use&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian progress in AI ethics and regulation is also worthy of note. Canada has been at the forefront of promoting ethical AI through the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy and Algorithmic Impact Assessment tools. In 2018, as Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner, Dr Ann Cavoukian introduced the seven foundational principles of “Privacy by Design”. These principles directly informed the development of the EU’s GDPR. Currently, the Canadian government is actively working on regulations – including the proposed AI and Data Act (AIDA) – to ensure transparency, fairness and accountability in developing and using AI systems. Canada’s strength in AI research, notably through the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and Center for International Governance Innovation, has positioned the country as a global leader in AI ethics and governance, encouraging responsible innovation. Programmes including the Vector Institute (Ontario) and Mila (Quebec AI Institute) contribute significantly to research on ethical AI and developing tools for assessing algorithmic fairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key challenge lies in integrating these ethical standards into broader legal frameworks and ensuring uniform implementation across provinces, particularly given Canada’s decentralised governance. There are also significant concerns regarding the ethical use of AI in public services, such as law enforcement, where algorithmic bias and surveillance risks must be carefully managed. Balancing the rapid development of AI technologies with ethical considerations and privacy preservation remains a complex and ongoing issue, particularly as AI systems become more pervasive in sectors like healthcare, education and finance. Despite progress on ethical frameworks, the lack of comprehensive national AI legislation presents hurdles in ensuring consistent oversight across industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-collaborations-and-joint-efforts&quot;&gt;Current Collaborations and Joint Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This progress notwithstanding, challenges remain, particularly in balancing innovation with compliance, as industries such as health informatics seek more flexible use of personal data while maintaining privacy. The issue of cross-border data flows post-Brexit presents regulatory complexities, especially with potential data adequacy rulings from the EU. The rapid advancement of AI and big data analytics in sectors like finance and healthcare tests the limits of existing frameworks, prompting ongoing discussions about updating privacy laws to cover emerging technologies like AI-driven decision-making systems and biometric data usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada and the UK have been actively fostering collaboration on AI-related initiatives. For example, in 2019, the UK-Canada AI Initiative was launched to fund collaborative research projects between the two countries. This initiative focuses on AI’s application in areas like health and environmental sustainability and on the ethical challenges posed by AI technologies. The goal is to leverage the AI expertise of both countries while promoting research that aligns with their shared values of transparency, fairness and privacy protection. The 2024 UK-Canada science of AI safety partnership serves as another collaborative initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Canada are both active internationally in advocating for the responsible use of AI. They are co-signatories of the 2019 OECD AI Principles, the 2022–2024 Council of Europe AI Convention drafting group, the 2023 G7 Ministers’ Statement, the 2023 Bletchley Declaration and the 2024 Seoul Ministerial Declaration. They have also both participated in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence. This multilateral engagement runs in parallel with national legislative frameworks such as the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy and the UK National AI Strategy, both of which are oriented towards building AI ecosystems that prioritise ethical standards, transparency and fairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-canada-and-the-uk-make-a-difference&quot;&gt;How Can Canada and the UK Make a Difference?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on a long history of collaboration between the UK and Canada in emerging technologies, shared values and similarities in political cultures and the diversity of their populations, as well as the novel approaches and practices established and implemented in both countries, joint efforts could be enhanced in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-governance-and-data-protection&quot;&gt;Data Governance and Data Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries could build a bilateral data governance framework that enhances data protection while facilitating secure data sharing for research, public health, and economic growth. This would ensure that data governance aligns with ethical standards and that personal data is protected across both countries while enabling the flow of information critical to innovation and commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the US–EU Privacy Shield Framework offers a reference point for cross-border data governance. Although invalidated in 2020, it was initially designed to facilitate data transfers while ensuring compliance with stringent privacy laws on both sides of the Atlantic. A UK–Canada data governance initiative could draw lessons from this experience to build a framework that maintains high data privacy standards without impeding cross-border innovation and AI research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-cybersecurity-and-defence-against-hybrid-informational-threats&quot;&gt;Development of Cybersecurity and Defence Against Hybrid Informational Threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint investments in cybersecurity systems include cooperation on AI-driven threat detection, defensive measures against cyberattacks and developing countermeasures to combat disinformation and hybrid attacks. This could involve research collaborations between top universities in both countries, pooling expertise to create cutting-edge tools that protect national digital infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Singapore’s cybersecurity cooperation is a strong example of two countries collaborating to enhance cyber defences. Under their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, Australia and Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2017 to cooperate on cybersecurity initiatives. This partnership includes joint cyber threat exercises, collaboration on cyber capacity building, sharing good practice on cybersecurity governance, and developing common frameworks for cyber risk management. The UK and Canada could adopt a similar model by establishing a formal cybersecurity cooperation framework focusing on joint threat intelligence sharing, collaborative defence against cyberattacks, and coordinated responses to disinformation and hybrid informational threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;investment-in-ai-startups-and-innovation&quot;&gt;Investment in AI Startups and Innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI ecosystem in the UK and Canada is thriving, with solid support for startups and innovation hubs. The UK’s Alan Turing Institute and Canada’s Vector Institute are global leaders in AI research, and both countries have numerous AI startups working on cutting-edge innovations. Earlier this year, Innovate UK invited UK companies developing AI for improving healthcare to apply to join its Global Incubator Programme in collaboration with MaRS Discovery District in Toronto, Canada. However, more can be done to foster cross-border investment and collaboration in this space. A bilateral initiative to increase investment in AI startups could include creating joint AI venture capital funds, protection for creator rights and intellectual property, support for incubators, and cross-border mentorship programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Franco-German AI collaboration is a prime example of bilateral cooperation aimed at fostering innovation. By signing the Aachen Treaty in 2019, the two countries solidified their collaboration in research and digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fostering-responsible-ai-talent-and-establishing-educational-exchange-projects&quot;&gt;Fostering Responsible AI Talent and Establishing Educational Exchange Projects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As AI continues to grow, the need for a skilled AI workforce has become critical. The UK and Canada are home to world-class universities and AI research institutions that have already made strides in educating the next generation of AI talent. However, the demand for responsible AI practitioners is rising, and there is room for deeper cooperation in building the skills pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK and Canada could build a bilateral data governance framework that enhances data protection while facilitating secure data sharing for research, public health, and economic growth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab is an example of collaboration between academia and industry on AI. Through this partnership, researchers from both institutions work together on AI research, focusing on responsible AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-healthcare-and-public-health-systems-with-trustworthy-ai&quot;&gt;Enhancing Healthcare and Public Health Systems with Trustworthy AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada and the UK have advanced healthcare systems and have increasingly adopted AI to improve healthcare delivery, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. AI technologies in healthcare can enhance diagnostics, predict patient outcomes, and streamline public health responses. However, AI’s use in healthcare must be carefully regulated to ensure it is trustworthy, ethical and aligned with public trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canadian-French health cooperation, including the Future of Healthcare using Artificial Intelligence mission, is focused on establishing industrial R&amp;amp;D collaboration opportunities (specifically for technology co-development validation and adaption) in the digital health sector, and has been designed to promote discussions on commercialisation-oriented R&amp;amp;D collaboration opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;towards-a-deeper-future-ukcanada-cooperative-initiative-on-ai&quot;&gt;Towards a Deeper Future UK–Canada Cooperative Initiative on AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposed cooperative initiative must grow to encompass more countries than just the UK and Canada. It must include other leading middle economies that are deeply committed to these issues and working to develop national capacities for AI- and data-driven systems. Such a cooperation framework could serve as a model for establishing bilateral agreements and enhancing collaboration among other middle economies within the G20 and beyond. It could also encourage countries like the Netherlands, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand and Japan to strengthen their efforts in developing ethical frameworks for responsible and efficient AI governance.&lt;/p&gt;

This report highlights the urgent need to integrate civic knowledge and responsibility into STEM education and careers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need to strengthen civic knowledge, skills, and engagement across all ages, including adults. This includes those who study and work in STEM fields. Technology plays an increasingly central role in our lives and society, in ways that are both constructive and destructive. Tech innovators must understand the concept of civic responsibility inherent in “we the people,” and think critically about the impact of the work they do. At the same time, we need to inspire tech and science experts to help ensure that decisions by government, at all levels and across all three branches, are informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report focuses on the integration of civic knowledge and responsibility into STEM education and careers, and how individuals in STEM fields can and must hold institutions accountable and move us toward a more perfect union. Reinvigorating civics knowledge and civic skills has become a national and economic security imperative. The urgency requires reaching not just K-12 students but also adults. This report also offers actionable recommendations for businesses and government, and other organizations committed to equipping employees, partners, and associates with essential civic knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to any other period of human history, the pace of technological advancement over the last few decades is unmatched. The era we currently find ourselves in is marked by exponential growth in areas such as biotechnology, the internet, data analytics, quantum computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Each of these holds the power to change the world completely, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanity and technology are inextricably linked. The 2023 National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy aptly states, “technology itself does not have a value system; rather, it carries the values of its owners and operators.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of AI technology widely available to the public has highlighted that today’s technology can be used both as a tool and as a weapon. It is vital to encourage developments that promote innovation while intentionally maximizing the potential for technologies to be used in positive ways. Foundational to this goal is the need to strengthen civic responsibility, respect for the rule of law, and an understanding of the role of government — and, most importantly, the role of citizens — in a healthy democracy. That is the function of civics education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CivxNow defines civics as “the lifelong process that makes people into informed and engaged members of their communities — which range from schools and towns or neighborhoods to the whole nation and even the world.” Today, civics education is crucial for understanding and addressing the broader implications of technology. It must be provided at all education levels — K–12, colleges and universities, and even for adults. Strengthening civic knowledge and skills can help build system and societal resilience against tech-enabled threats, actively counter divisiveness and cynicism in society by reinvigorating shared aspirations and empowering citizens, and even strengthen workforce cohesion. Beyond that, incorporating civics concepts into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and the technology sector can better position our democracy to benefit from all that technology offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Today, civics education is crucial for understanding and addressing the broader implications of technology. It must be provided at all education levels — K–12, colleges and universities, and even for adults.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the goal of the Defending Democratic Institutions (DDI) project’s Civics in STEM initiative. As part of this effort, DDI has already hosted two private roundtables — on June 17 and July 23, 2024 — bringing together distinguished leaders from the private sector, government, and academia. These discussions explored why incorporating civics education into STEM is critical for society, as well as the challenges and strategies associated with promoting civics within the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By embedding civics education into STEM curricula, we help ensure that future innovators are not only skilled in their technical disciplines but also equipped with the knowledge and values necessary to contribute to a just, inclusive, and democratic society. This integration bridges the gap between technical expertise and policy, helping to ensure that the innovations of tomorrow are guided by principles and policies that strengthen democracy and uphold ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unparalleled pace of technological advancements in recent history has often caught us off guard, leading to a growing recognition of the need to include ethical and policy considerations alongside technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid technological development has significantly impacted U.S. democracy in both positive and negative ways. Technology has enabled increased voter engagement, enhanced transparency, efficient communication, and the rapid dissemination of information. Yet, it has also contributed to a growing digital divide, rampant misinformation and disinformation, and mounting cybersecurity threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the societal level, the internet has enabled unprecedented connectivity, yet it has also contributed to a disconnect between the individual and their respective communities. Social media has empowered civil society and historically marginalized groups, revolutionizing social movements and increasing accessibility to information. However, it has helped enable the rise of tribalism and deepened polarization. Similarly, while there will be many benefits from embedding AI into our daily lives, we must remain aware of both the visible and unforeseen implications, which may carry significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Cyberspace is composed of not only technology and protocols but also people. People are an integral part of cyberspace, both in creating and using it. In less than a generation, technology has transformed our daily lives …. We rely on [it] for our national security, economic development, and innovation. More than any other domain — air, space, sea, or land — people conceived of and created cyberspace and will continue to improve it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the double-edged nature of technological innovation, it is important to incorporate civics education to ensure that technology’s impact on society is understood and responsibly managed. Over the past several years, there has been a growing emphasis on including ethics in STEM education. (See, e.g., the work of roundtable participants listed in Appendix A.) Civics, particularly the concept of civic responsibility, can provide an important “why” to that ethics discussion. Democracy only works if individuals understand their obligations as part of “we the people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civic knowledge and skills should not be limited to students interested in the social sciences; they should be considered essential for those working in the technology sector. Integrating key civics concepts, such as civic responsibility, into STEM education and the tech sector can challenge students and professionals alike to think critically about their responsibilities regarding the work they either hope to do or are already doing. Hopefully, this will inspire them to contribute constructively to their workplaces, communities, nation, and world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integrating key civics concepts, such as civic responsibility, into STEM education and the tech sector can challenge students and professionals alike to think critically about their responsibilities regarding the work they either hope to do or are already doing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having individuals who are both tech savvy and policy sensitive is a prerequisite for developing effective laws, policies, and norms to guide our democracy in an increasingly tech-driven world. Bringing civics concepts into STEM training can help drive more informed policies around the development and use of technology by building a pipeline of technology-oriented individuals interested in public service, the military, and even private sector work that provides a sense of mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Inspired to Serve,” the report of the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service, made reinvigorating civics its number one recommendation for inspiring young people to serve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Widespread and effective civic education is an essential requirement for fostering a culture of service in which Americans can identify how their own strengths, skills, and interests could contribute to the public good by addressing needs in their communities and Nation. When 22 percent of American adults cannot name any of the three branches of government, it is well past time for the country to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STEM education has rightly been viewed over the last several decades as a national security imperative. Yet, teaching civics is also a national security imperative. Integrating civics concepts into STEM is critical as society and technology continue to evolve together. The last several decades have seen a decline in civics education that has left too many without a clear understanding of the importance of democracy, the rule of law, or their role in it. This gap exists beyond STEM fields but is particularly consequential for individuals who will help shape innovation moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of technology will play a pivotal role in determining whether societies evolve toward greater democracy or slide into authoritarianism. Take AI as an example. AI has the potential to enhance democratic processes by enabling more efficient governance, increasing transparency, and empowering citizens through better access to information. Yet, if AI is left unchecked or misused, it could easily concentrate power in the hands of a few, enabling surveillance, manipulation, and control on an unprecedented scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert in one of our roundtable discussions highlighted the importance of securing market democracy, warning that without public action, big data and AI could lead to a drift toward “totalitarian surveillance [and] oppression.” If the public does not actively shape industrial and government policy “toward [ensuring] diversity, competition, and every individual having a voice,” the system risks tilting in the opposite direction, following the models of Russia and China. Technological advances could instead be used for surveillance, censorship, and repression. China is already exporting this model globally through its Belt and Road Initiative. Its recent sale of Huawei surveillance equipment to Uganda’s military regime is an example of moving a nation toward a surveillance society. The governance structures we establish today will be critical in ensuring that technology serves as a force for democratic empowerment rather than a tool for authoritarian control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is already being used to refine social media and content algorithms, keeping users engaged in a continuous stream of personalized content. While this may not always be harmful, increasingly personalized feeds can lead to more segmented thinking, the extremization of opinions, and, in some cases, heightened polarization that could escalate into violence. Furthermore, according to Harvard Business Review, AI has the potential to exacerbate existing biases in data, including those against minorities. A 2024 National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine study on facial recognition points out multiple examples of where the systems have misidentified innocent Black Americans, causing them to be arrested. Further, a criminal justice algorithm used in Broward County, Florida, was found to be twice as likely to mislabel African American defendants as “high risk” compared to White defendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our choices now — both at home and as a global society — will influence whether AI becomes a catalyst for a more open, participatory society or a mechanism for exacerbating injustice and reinforcing autocratic regimes. Understanding the role of governance and governance structures is crucial, as these structures, institutions, and processes will have a huge impact on the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We can look at what is happening to society as a result of innovation, and right now, around the AI conversations, there is a sense of we should build what we can, not what we should.… You can’t put the genie back in the bottle, but you can help people holding the bottle understand what the implications may be. The important question to address is: How do we empower people to better understand what the implications are and what role they can play?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-we-get-here&quot;&gt;How Did We Get Here?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957 had a profound impact on the United States, particularly on its education system, leading to a dramatic shift toward STEM education. The shock of Sputnik created a sense of urgency, motivating policymakers, educators, and students to prioritize STEM. Numerous public awareness campaigns highlighted the importance of scientific achievement and encouraged a generation of young people to pursue careers in STEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1958, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act, providing substantial federal funding for STEM education. The act aimed to produce more scientists, engineers, and mathematicians to help the United States maintain its technological superiority and enhance national security. On May 10, 1950, U.S. president Harry S. Truman signed the National Science Foundation Act, creating the first federal agency dedicated to supporting education and fundamental research across all scientific disciplines. Since this pivot, the U.S. education system has undergone significant curriculum reforms to emphasize STEM subjects and create a more technically skilled and scientifically literate workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These curriculum reforms extended beyond K–12 and into higher education. The launch of Sputnik led to increased support for higher education institutions in the form of funding for research and development programs in STEM fields, leading to the expansion of graduate programs and the establishment of new research facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on STEM education had several implications for civics education in the United States, as the Sputnik-induced shift initially diverted attention and, ultimately, resources from it. As noted in a 2020 commentary, in the decades following Sputnik’s launch, the desire to maintain superiority in STEM-related fields remained a priority as the world grew more connected and complex. Over time, this resulted in less class time and fewer resources available for civics education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors have likely contributed to this dynamic. For instance, STEM metrics and outcomes can be easily and uniformly tracked across different countries, reinforcing and intensifying competition between nations. Moreover, civics education is sometimes viewed as a subjective, politically sensitive area of study. It is also difficult for the general public to conceptualize, internalize, and actively prioritize the importance of a good civics education, which means there is less public pressure for it. In comparison, STEM fields appear straightforward, apolitical, and noncontroversial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, the difference in career paths and salaries in STEM versus non-STEM fields has substantially changed. When high school students and college freshmen consider their career paths, STEM fields often offer a clearer sense of direction — leading to roles like doctors and software engineers — frequently with attractive salaries. In contrast, the career path in civics is less defined, though equally important, which may partly explain the increasing preference for STEM among younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-play-in-civics-education&quot;&gt;The Current State of Play in Civics Education&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last several decades have seen a drastic decline in civics education in the United States, which has left too many without a clear understanding of the importance of democracy or their role in it. A report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that “more than 70% of Americans fail a basic civics literacy quiz on topics like the three branches of government, the number of Supreme Court justices, and other basic functions of our democracy.” According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), in 2022, 22 percent of eighth-graders “scored at or above the NAEP Proficient level in civics.” The 2023 Annenberg Civics Knowledge Survey also found that many adults did not know what rights the First Amendment protected, and only 65 percent of respondents could name the three branches of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for civics remains an ongoing issue. Federal funding for K–12 STEM education is roughly $50 per student, while funding for civics is closer to 50 cents. The lack of funding and attention paid to the humanities affects higher education as well. Facing budget constraints, many public universities target humanities and liberal arts programs first in their attempts to balance their budgets. At private universities, prestige and lack of tangible vocational benefits seem to have played a role in this trend. Other factors also contribute to this trend, such as the perceived value of a humanities-centered education and job prospects after graduation. This trend transcends borders. According to Ben Goldstein, “humanities and social science fields without a clear pre-professional connection — disciplines classifiable as ‘qualitative academia’ — have been falling out of favor worldwide. Between 2015 and 2018, the share of bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees awarded in humanities fields fell 5%, 11%, and 9% respectively on average throughout the OECD, with drops of varying proportions detected in 24 of the 36 OECD countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Funding for civics remains an ongoing issue. Federal funding for K–12 STEM education is roughly $50 per student, while funding for civics is closer to 50 cents.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline of civics education is matched by a decline of trust in U.S. democracy and democratic institutions, such as the U.S. Congress and the justice system. A 2024 Gallup poll found that only 28 percent of U.S. adults are “satisfied” with how democracy is working in the United States — a new 40-year low. A similar poll found that only 9 percent of U.S. adults have a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the U.S. Congress and 30 percent have a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court. Similarly, the 2022 Annenberg Civics Knowledge Survey found that nearly 7 in 10 people (67 percent) agreed with the statement that the Supreme Court “gets too messed up in politics,” an increase of 12 percent since 2019. In 2024, another poll found that “7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology.” This perspective is not limited to the highest courts. For example, a 2023 survey by the National Center for State Courts found that 61 percent of respondents believed state courts are “political.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;meeting-an-urgent-need--civics-for-adults&quot;&gt;Meeting an Urgent Need — Civics for Adults&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracy depends on informed and engaged citizens. Americans today live in one of the most polarized eras in our nation’s history, a pattern that continues to grow exponentially due to information operations by foreign adversaries, declining trust in our democratic institutions, and a lack of civic understanding of how to engage effectively with our democracy. With civics education having been underresourced and undervalued for decades, we now see a resulting lack of civic knowledge and skills that has left many adults ill equipped to fulfill their essential roles within our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K–12 and higher education reform are critical to rebuilding a foundation of civics knowledge but require significant time to implement before we see results. Given the urgency of the issues, we cannot wait for this long-term investment. There is an immediate need to remedy the current civics knowledge gap among adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empowering adults with civics knowledge can strengthen democratic participation and counter the growing influence of misinformation, enabling a more resilient and informed electorate. In the technology sector, where professionals are shaping the digital infrastructure of society, understanding the values and aspirations of democracy and the responsibility of individuals in a democracy is even more crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2022, CSIS launched its Civics at Work (CaW) initiative, a partnership with leading civics groups, national security practitioners, and business leaders looking to reinvigorate civics literacy as a national and economic security imperative, both through their respective workforces and in their larger communities. Business leaders, in particular, are optimally positioned to take on this role. As leaders, employers, community members, and patriots, businesses must be at the heart of any effort to reinvigorate the public’s civics awareness and engagement. Commerce, innovation, and U.S. competitiveness all depend on a healthy democracy and continuing commitment to the rule of law. Civics literacy is a fundamental part of a successful and thriving community, and businesses have a unique ability to contribute by investing in their workforces. Furthermore, a Harvard Business Review paper notes that free markets rely on free and stable political systems to thrive, which can be reinforced through stronger civics education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, because people today trust their employers more than the government or the media, companies remain one of the few institutions with broad public support and are equipped with the “resources, political power, incentives, and responsibility” to help protect democracy. In another Harvard Business Review white paper, BET Networks president Scott Mills notes that companies also recognize the need to foster environments where employees from diverse backgrounds can collaborate and communicate effectively. As such, skills such as strong collaboration, clear and regular communication, compromise, and mutual respect — areas that can be strengthened by increasing civic skills such as civil discourse and renewing a sense of shared aspirations — are crucial for creating these successful business environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector plays a critical role in its ability to leverage investment for good — directing financial resources toward initiatives that not only generate profits but also contribute to society. This approach aligns with global policies aimed at mitigating risks associated with new and emerging technologies while also addressing the need to move from a first-to-market mentality to a best-to-market imperative. In this context, the business case for promoting civics education has never been stronger or more critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Teaching the discipline of law to those seeking technical graduate degrees in cybersecurity has been highly rewarding. The students are usually intimidated to begin the class but then embrace the study as they begin to understand the “system” of the rule of law in our country - the Separation of Powers; the role of courts; the distinction between legislation and regulation; etc. I am convinced that we can and must cultivate a commitment within science and technology communities to understand the rule of law, to embrace it, to defend it and proselytize about it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;dan-sutherland-professor-of-cybersecurity-law-and-policy-george-washington-university&quot;&gt;Dan Sutherland, Professor of Cybersecurity Law and Policy, George Washington University&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of CaW, DDI developed Civics for Adults: An Implementation Guide for Businesses, Civics for Adults: A Guide for Civics Content Providers, and hosted discussions on how civics can promote the role of businesses in U.S. democracy. The first business leader to sign up to participate in CSIS’s CaW was Brad Smith, president of Microsoft. During a January 2021 CSIS program on the importance of equipping STEM students with civics education, Smith said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Technology has become a multidisciplinary activity and every engineer at a company like Microsoft needs a bigger dose of the liberal arts and civics in particular … and what is true at a place like Microsoft is true across the tech sector …. At the end of the day, the heart of our society is our democratic foundation and therefore civics education always has to be at the heart of this multidisciplinary approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ongoing-challenges&quot;&gt;Ongoing Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating civics concepts into the STEM and tech worlds faces several ongoing challenges, primarily stemming from a disconnect between scientific and policy communities. Yet, a grasp of how our system works is essential for those entering technology and science-oriented fields; governmental decisions not only directly influence innovation and discovery, but, perhaps even more importantly, directly affect implementation. Teaching scientists and engineers that considering social impact and learning about taking a scientific or engineering concept from idea to use requires understanding — and, quite possibly, acting within a civics context — in order to achieve success; this should be an important aspect of science and engineering education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bridging the gap between “techies” and policymakers is difficult, as it entails encouraging technologists to navigate the nuanced “gray areas” of societal and policy issues, as well as the equally challenging task of teaching policy professionals that there can be clear right and wrong answers in technical realms. Failure to do so means failed public policy due to a mismatch between legislators and regulators intents and what is technically feasible. It also means failure of scientists and engineers to take into account societal issues as they design the technology. Teaching the two communities to be speak a common language is thus really important for society’s health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a potential use case could be the accreditation requirements of the British Computer Society (BCS) in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1957, BCS is a charity dedicated to “[raising] standards of competence and conduct across the IT industry.” To achieve this, BCS provides a wide range of accreditation, qualification, and certification services for IT professionals, higher education programs, and at-home education. Due to its international recognition, BCS accreditations and qualifications are highly sought after by employers in the IT sector and academic programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain official BCS accreditation, programs and courses must satisfy BCS’s “Criteria for Accreditation.” One such criterion is “the ability to [recognize] the legal, social, ethical and professional issues involved in the exploitation of computer technology and be guided by the adoption of appropriate professional, ethical and legal practices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BCS use case has been studied to assess its effectiveness in implementing a nationwide ethics requirement in educational curricula. A study by Tom McEwan and Sandra Cairncross from Edinburgh Napier University notes some challenges in implementing BCS’s Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues (LSEPIs) criteria in higher education. In their paper, the authors observed that “technically-oriented undergraduate students are often reluctant to engage with [BCS’s] ‘Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues (LSEPI).’” They further noted that, after a decade of increasingly relaxed social and ethical standards in certain media, such as widespread illegal downloading of music, video, and software, many current UK undergraduates “appear to have an increasingly cavalier attitude to intellectual property in digital media” despite receiving BCS training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is just one paper examining the efficacy of BCS’s LSEPI requirements, it presents a mixed picture. The requirements are well intentioned and capable of being implemented on a national scale, but they still encounter many of the same challenges faced by traditional general education and undergraduate requirements in the United Kingdom. Fundamentally, the results may point toward the importance of instilling a sense of civic responsibility to help explain why students should care about ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge lies in educating teachers on how to integrate civics into STEM curricula. Education schools are not adequately preparing teachers to teach civics, let alone equipping STEM teachers to integrate civics concepts into their lessons. Political polarization exacerbates the challenge. For example, a study by Daniela Kruel DiGiacomo et al. found that only 28 percent of teachers believe parents would support them teaching about contemporary elections, even though 81 percent report that doing so would help meet state curriculum standards. This impacts both the content teachers feel comfortable covering and the overall quality of civics education students receive. Additionally, the same study found that schools lack training for teachers on handling polarization, largely due to insufficient administrative support. As a result, 92 percent of teachers said they will “shut down” student discussions on contentious topics to avoid partisan conflicts, rather than encouraging constructive dialogue and working on civil discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an expert in one of our roundtable discussions noted the ongoing challenge of engaging some first-generation students, and other minorities that are underrepresented in STEM fields, with civics because they often feel disenfranchised by the very system we ask them to study and value. A potential solution could be to emphasize that civics can empower them to become effective agents of change, helping to dismantle barriers and injustices that prevent more students from advancing in STEM careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the binary thinking often characteristic of STEM fields — and the focus on solving technical problems — leads many to avoid political discourse and civic engagement, mistakenly believing it doesn’t apply to them. Many in the field are drawn to STEM subjects precisely to avoid the messiness of civil society, preferring a world seen through the binary lens of 0s and 1s. Teaching STEM students that it is not only acceptable to engage in discussions that involve ethics and values, but that it is in fact necessary and valuable in developing acceptable technical solutions to societal problems, is thus critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the variety of motivations of tech professionals is important. An expert in one of our roundtable discussions described the four Ps of motivation guiding people in the field: protection, prestige, patriotism, and puzzle-solving. The challenge — and the opportunity — lies in finding the commonality between those motivations and being civically literate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, incentives within the business world are not always in sync with broader societal good. While corporate responsibilities lie with shareholders and employees, the right decision for business is not always seen as aligned with what’s best for society. Framing democracy as a business asset is a critical step in aligning private sector incentives with public good. Although the tension between societal good and corporate responsibilities is an issue that we will continue to grapple with, there are numerous cases in which the private sector leverages its influence to safeguard democracy and incentivize civic-minded investment. These companies recognize the importance of civics education as a business imperative and have incorporated it into their programs, demonstrating the societal impact of technology and its alignment with democratic principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracy is neither invincible nor inevitable. It can only be sustained by a civically informed and engaged citizenry that comes together with a common purpose. However, this fundamental prerequisite is threatened by the decades-long decline in civics education, which has left Americans lacking the skills to fulfill their essential role in moving us toward a more perfect union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move to reinvigorate civics education, we cannot afford to leave anyone behind. We cannot settle for reaching only those who are already interested in government and the role of the individual in a democracy. We must find ways to also engage those whose interests lie in more technological and scientific fields. And we must reach adults as well as students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges we face today — polarization, misinformation, and a lack of trust in our institutions — underscore the urgent need for a reinvigorated focus on civics education. As democracy’s survival hinges upon informed participation, it is essential that education systems empower citizens to understand their role in shaping our more perfect union. Nowhere is this more important than in the STEM and tech world. Science and technology have an undisputed influence on society, and the decisions made by tech professionals shape not only the future of innovation but also the fabric of society and its democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infusing civics concepts into STEM education can ensure that the next generation of technologists understands that they have a civic responsibility to think about the societal impact of their innovations. This interdisciplinary approach is key to preparing a workforce that is technically skilled and civically engaged, including engagement in the development of norms, policies, and laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating civics concepts into the STEM and tech world is not just an educational priority — it is a democratic imperative. As technology continues to shape the world, those at the forefront of innovation must be equipped with the civic knowledge and ethical grounding to guide their work responsibly. And those making governance decisions must be equally prepared to meet the demands of a complex and technological future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integrating civics concepts into the STEM and tech world is not just an educational priority — it is a democratic imperative.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW DO WE INTEREST STEM STUDENTS AND TECH WORKERS IN CIVICS?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reveal Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Herbert Lin, a fellow in cyber policy at Stanford University, often tells his students that it behooves them to understand how government works because it is government that effectively dictates what we can know and understand about the universe, primarily through decisions about how to allocate its massive funding. AI and cybersecurity are good examples of how governments are developing rules, regulations, and policies that will impact the development and deployment of technology. But technical experts are not just impacted — they can and should also have an impact. They are members of society with valuable experience and skills to bring to societal problems, and thus they should participate in the discussions both as experts and as members of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevate the Role of Translators Between STEM and Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a critical need for individuals who can bridge the gap between STEM and policy by getting involved in the process and acting as “translators.” These professionals must understand both technical concepts and policy implications, enabling them to communicate effectively between the two communities. Teaching policymakers the technical aspect of emerging technologies, while helping technologists navigate the complexities of policy, is essential for fostering collaboration and innovation. To strengthen this vital role, we must create programs and positions that elevate these “translators” by raising awareness of their importance, making these roles more prestigious, and incentivizing individuals to pursue them. By recognizing and investing in these positions, we can ensure that the intersection of technology and policy is more effectively navigated, driving ethical innovation and informed decisionmaking. There are several examples of Master of Science (MS) degrees in tech and public policy, but there is still room for more. In the field of cybersecurity, Tufts University offers a degree in Cybersecurity and Public Policy and the University of Texas at Austin offers a Master of Public Affairs (MPAff ) dual degree program between its Cockrell School of Engineering and its Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect to the Scientific Revolution and the Age of Enlightenment:&lt;/strong&gt; STEM students may be interested in the connections between the Scientific Revolution, with its questioning of established concepts and structures, and its influence on the Age of Enlightenment, which in turn informed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, with the framers developing our radical system of government in the same breath, and in much the same way, that a new world of scientific discovery and understanding was helping inform new ways of thinking. The framers did not see a bright distinction between what today we might call “hard science” and “soft science.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridge the Gap between Binary and Shades of Gray:&lt;/strong&gt; We must explore how the mathematical and scientific principles and “answers” that seem so black and white today actually arrived through a process — a process of discernment and discovery that did not always yield societal acceptance at first. Similarly, the framers of the Constitution set up not just institutions but a process for arriving at the “right” answer for the advancement of individuals, society, and the nation. And just as science is constantly raising new questions about long-held answers or assumptions about the universe, democracy is always moving toward a more perfect union, with change coming about through the work of informed and engaged citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage the Scientific Method to Strengthen Civic Engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; The principles of the scientific method — critical thinking, evidence-based reasoning, and an iterative approach to problem-solving — offer a powerful framework for enhancing civic engagement. By teaching students to apply the scientific method to democratic participation, we can cultivate a more informed and thoughtful citizenry. Encouraging students to evaluate information with the same rigor they would in a scientific setting allows them to engage in civil discourse and embrace differing perspectives. This connection between scientific inquiry and the democratic process helps foster collaboration and critical thinking, empowering students who are driven to solve problems to apply their skills to civic challenges. Embedding these principles into civics education not only reinforces a sense of civic responsibility but also ensures that the next generation is equipped to address complex societal issues with thoughtful, evidence-based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CIVICS CONCEPTS TO CONVEY?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;csiss-civics-for-adults&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CSIS’s Civics for Adults&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Developed in partnership with the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, CSIS’s Civics for Adults guide aims to help civics experts and content providers create resources for business, government, and higher education leaders. The goal is to enhance civic understanding among adults and improve the functioning of democratic institutions within communities by identifying existing resources suitable for adults and adapting civics materials originally designed for schools.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;First, the guide emphasizes that civic knowledge alone is insufficient; it must be paired with civic skills that can produce positive outcomes for both institutions and communities. Second, it offers actionable guidance on developing civics content for adults, ensuring they grasp the importance of the federal system, the roles of each branch of government, the separation of powers, the rule of law, and civilian control of the armed forces. Additionally, it highlights the importance of promoting civic engagement and fostering a sense of civic responsibility in learners. Only when individuals take ownership of their work and are invested in the success of their institutions and communities can they consistently make decisions that contribute to the long-term health of democracy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The guide also provides advice on how to effectively tailor civics to adults, noting that adults are typically self-directed learners who engage more with content when it has immediate relevance to their lives or careers. It emphasizes that materials should include narratives that resonate with adults’ work experiences and lived realities, sparking discussions about both the strengths and shortcomings of current systems. Further, employers should focus on implementing achievable civics goals, such as encouraging employees to vote or compensating them for jury duty or community service.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lastly, the guide stresses that outreach should not be limited to large corporations or government institutions. Equal attention should be given to local chambers of commerce, small businesses, community colleges, and trade schools. While concise, this guide serves as a practical starting point for content creators developing or adapting civics resources to engage adults in both their workplaces and communities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS’s Civics for Adults guide discusses the key civics concepts all Americans should understand (see box above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular importance in the technology arena is an understanding of civic responsibility — obligations that go beyond oneself and are essential for a functioning democracy based on the then-radical idea of self-governance. Civic responsibility can help inform the “why” of ethics. It can also strengthen the message that security, particularly cybersecurity, is a shared responsibility between the government and the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also important, as noted, is an understanding of how policy decisions are made and at what level(s) of government. Major funding decisions are generally made by the U.S. Congress and the executive branch, but state and local governments can also impact the level of resources available for the development of technology or new engineering projects, for example. Similarly, policies and laws establishing limits or guidelines for scientific or technological research could come from federal, state, or even local governments. Understanding our system of federalism is important for understanding how to bring about change or influence outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, reinforcing a sense of shared values and aspirations captured in the notion of a more perfect union, for which we must always strive, can help strengthen the commitment to using STEM-related expertise to reinforce, rather than undermine, those values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOW DO WE GET CIVICS CONCEPTS INTO THE STEM CURRICULUM?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civics education must be embedded across a variety of subjects, not limited to social studies. Civics concepts should permeate STEM fields, where the intersection of technology, ethics, and policy is increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage Initiatives Such As the 2023 National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the foundational skills highlighted in the strategy are the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Be Active Participants in Society and the Economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Understand the Social, Technical, &amp;amp; Cultural Dynamics of Computational Technology, including Equity and Inclusion.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Ethically, Securely, and Safely Use Information” and “Recognize the Rights, Privacy, Responsibilities, &amp;amp; Opportunities of an Interconnected Digital World.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These objectives are all advanced by civics education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy also seeks to “Invigorate the Pursuit of Foundational Cyber Skills and Cyber Careers.” As noted earlier, the Commission on Public Service determined that teaching civics was one of the most important and foundational ways to inspire public service and careers with a mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the strategy notes that “cyber education should be integrated across disciplines so learners can gain the requisite knowledge and skills in relevant and contextualized learning experiences.” Again, the kind of cross-discipline approach advocated in this report meets that objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Teacher Training and Professional Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Teachers play a central role in fostering civic engagement among students, but they need better support to effectively incorporate civics and ethics into STEM subjects. Professional development programs should equip educators with the tools to teach the ethical and civic dimensions of technology. Partnerships between schools, universities, and tech companies can also help educators stay up-to-date with the latest technological advancements and their societal implications. Additionally, teacher training schools should place greater emphasis on teaching educators to teach civics, especially in today’s politically polarized environment. This training should include an understanding of the pervasive impact of technology in government. For example, the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to use technology for a more transparent and accountable government could serve as relevant case studies. Potential STEM teachers should also be required to have a basic understanding of civics and the role of laws and be encouraged to use similar examples in their classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspire STEM-Related Civic Engagement:&lt;/strong&gt; Schools across the country should experiment with integrating social studies and STEM concepts. For example, in 2021, U.S. history teachers at South Doyle High School in Knoxville, Tennessee, developed a cross-disciplinary project to explore the city’s lack of sidewalks. This project allowed students to learn about post–World War II history, 1950s building codes, urban planning, civil engineering, and even the health impacts of inadequate walking infrastructure, such as its effects on heart health and obesity rates. Although this is just one example, it demonstrates how some schools are working to bridge the gap between civics and the hard sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate Cybersecurity and AI as Use Cases:&lt;/strong&gt; AI presents an unparalleled opportunity to engage students and the public in discussions about ethics and civic responsibility. Integrating AI as a focal point in civics education, from K–12 to higher education, can enhance students’ understanding of both historical context and the role technology plays in democracy. Policymakers, educators, and communities must work together to ensure AI is not only a subject of study but also a means to teach critical civics concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security-agency-and-department-of-homeland-security-centers-of-academic-excellence-in-cybersecurity-designations&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity Designations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;One way to incentivize higher education to bring civics concepts into more technical areas might be to leverage the National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (CAE-C) designations. These official designations, awarded by the NSA and DHS, recognize academic institutions that demonstrate excellence in cybersecurity education and research. Because the cybersecurity standards required to achieve this designation are high, earning it can “enhance [an] institution’s reputation, attract top-tier students and faculty, and open doors to federal funding and partnerships.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are several designations under the CAE-C umbrella, including Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CDE), Cyber Research (CAE-R), and Cyber Operations (CAE-CO). As a result, incorporating a civics education component into one of these criteria could quickly incentivize academic institutions to invest in and prioritize civics education to attain these prestigious designations. Since civics would suddenly become a government-recognized standard with direct workforce applications — such as clear communication and effective compromise — the field could attain new prestige. This, in turn, could attract more students and adults to civics, fostering a culture of lifelong learning and civic engagement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentivize Civics in STEM through Testing and Hiring:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s often said that if you don’t test for it, it won’t be taught. Standardized tests could integrate some basic civics concepts, such as civic responsibility and respect for the rule of law, into questions related to STEM subjects. Additionally, as noted above, schools — particularly in higher education — tend to prioritize education that aligns with hiring demands. If businesses recognized the importance of a civically literate workforce and included this in their hiring decisions, it could significantly influence schools’ decisions on what to teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Equity and Inclusion in STEM and Civics Education:&lt;/strong&gt; It is vital to create pathways for underrepresented groups to engage in both STEM and policymaking roles. Addressing barriers to entry and retention for first-generation and minority students is crucial for building a diverse and inclusive workforce. Programs should encourage these students to see themselves as active participants in both technological innovation and democratic governance, promoting civic responsibility alongside technical skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframe Civics Education as a Shared Responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Civics education should be viewed as a collective responsibility involving educators, policymakers, businesses, and the public. Federal, state, and local governments must collaborate to scale ongoing efforts in civics education, while private-sector support can help bridge the resource gap. Additionally, integrating civics education as a criterion for attaining Centers of Excellence designations can incentivize higher education institutions to prioritize this critical area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a Systems-Based Approach to Civics and STEM Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; A holistic, systems-based approach is necessary to successfully integrate civics into STEM education. Collaboration across federal, state, and local governments; educational institutions; and tech companies is crucial for creating sustainable change. By aligning resources and goals across sectors, we can build an educational ecosystem that fosters technical expertise and civic engagement, ensuring that democracy and innovation go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To maximize the impact of the integration of civics in STEM education, existing initiatives must be scaled and interconnected. Numerous programs across education, government, and the private sector are working across STEM, ethics, and civic responsibility. However, these efforts often operate in silos, at times also using differing terminology, which further hinders efforts to identify and connect them. By creating stronger connections between these initiatives — whether through partnerships, shared resources, or collaborative platforms — we can amplify their reach and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To maximize the impact of the integration of civics in STEM education, existing initiatives must be scaled and interconnected.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, employers should ensure that as they implement initiatives to engage their workforces in ways that build their civic knowledge, skills, and engagement, they include aspects designed specifically to reach employees who are more STEM oriented. This should include finding ways for their employees to use their technical skills in civic engagement activities to strengthen their communities. Leaders should also clearly communicate why civics is important and encourage other tech sector leaders to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coordinated, system-wide approach that aligns stakeholders at the local, state, and federal levels will allow for the replication of successful models, accelerating progress toward a more civically engaged, technically proficient workforce better prepared to address the challenges and opportunities of rapid innovation in a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

It also explores the preconditions that have shaped their adoption in the Ukraine war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the first part of a series on military artificial intelligence (AI) development and its application in the war in Ukraine. It will focus on two critical aspects of AI adoption in Ukraine’s military:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The conditions and factors that contributed to military AI development from the beginning of the war with Russia in 2014&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The key government institutions and initiatives responsible for driving AI adoption, along with a summary of their major AI-related initiatives&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary section below presents key findings and insights on both of these aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-ai-is-in-experimental-deployment-and-is-overwhelmingly-geared-toward-supportive-functions&quot;&gt;1. AI is in experimental deployment and is overwhelmingly geared toward supportive functions.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although AI is frequently discussed in the context of the war in Ukraine, its full deployment on the battlefield remains limited. Numerous AI-driven capabilities and technologies are being tested along the frontlines, in long-range strikes within Russian territory, and across multidomain operations, but these efforts are largely experimental rather than indicative of AI systematically replacing human functions in warfare. AI currently assumes a predominantly supportive and informational role, and even when AI capabilities advance and improve, they are not yet implemented in fully autonomous modes on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-there-is-growing-government-involvement-in-ai-development-in-ukraine-through-organizational-regulative-and-technological-initiatives-led-by-various-government-stakeholders&quot;&gt;2. There is growing government involvement in AI development in Ukraine through organizational, regulative, and technological initiatives led by various government stakeholders.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, the development of AI-driven technologies in Ukraine was spearheaded by the private sector and volunteer initiatives. However, government institutions and agencies have recently begun to build their own capacities for advancing new technologies. This shift is evident in the creation of new organizational divisions and units within government institutions and the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), which are specifically dedicated to AI-focused technologies and their deployment. These efforts mark a significant step toward the institutionalization of AI innovation within the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-ukrainian-government-is-focusing-on-the-adoption-of-commercial-ai-rather-than-on-developing-new-technology-within-government-institutions&quot;&gt;3. The Ukrainian government is focusing on the adoption of commercial AI rather than on developing new technology within government institutions.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian authorities, having recognized that the speed and quality of technology development in the private sector far exceed those of the government sector, have prioritized creating infrastructure and procedures for the fast adoption of commercial technology. This approach has resulted in simplifying regulations on the adoption of innovation by the AFU, initiating programs for prototype testing, and providing grant funding to early-stage start-ups, among other initiatives. Moreover, most newly established units within Ukraine’s military, such as the Unmanned Systems Forces, are dedicated to integrating new technologies into military operations rather than participating in combat itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-the-absence-of-a-long-term-strategy-for-military-ai-development-poses-significant-challenges-to-the-sustained-and-effective-adoption-of-these-technologies&quot;&gt;4. The absence of a long-term strategy for military AI development poses significant challenges to the sustained and effective adoption of these technologies.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a long-term strategy for military AI development represents a critical gap within the government’s approach to emerging technologies. Despite Ukraine’s recognized technological potential, there is no unified vision guiding the use of AI in defense. This strategic void is primarily driven by limited management capacity across government institutions and by the inexperience of political leadership in addressing the complexities of warfare. As a result, the focus has been on immediate, tactical solutions rather than on establishing a cohesive, forward-looking strategy to harness the full potential of AI in military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-between-2014-and-2022-two-grassroots-applications--analytics-for-situational-awareness-and-drones-for-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance-isr--laid-the-groundwork-for-the-post-2022-surge-in-military-ai-following-russias-full-scale-invasion-military-ai-expanded-significantly-across-six-major-applications-with-a-growing-number-of-companies-focusing-on-autonomy&quot;&gt;5. Between 2014 and 2022, two grassroots applications — analytics for situational awareness and drones for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) — laid the groundwork for the post-2022 surge in military AI. Following Russia’s full-scale invasion, military AI expanded significantly across six major applications, with a growing number of companies focusing on autonomy.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report categorizes AI applications in Ukraine’s military operations into six major areas, listed below. A more detailed analysis of these applications will be provided in subsequent reports in this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt; The most significant advancements have been in autonomous systems, where Ukraine is making strides in areas such as GPS-denied navigation and swarm operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-source intelligence and fighting disinformation.&lt;/strong&gt; AI helps to analyze large volumes of digital content from media and social networks and to identify Russian narratives, propaganda, and information campaigns spreading disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situational awareness and command and control.&lt;/strong&gt; AI enhances situational awareness with numerous software platforms used by the military to analyze battlefield and intelligence data and to facilitate real-time efficient decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demining.&lt;/strong&gt; AI-powered analytic software and AI-enabled unmanned ground vehicles improve the efficiency and safety of mine clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training and simulation.&lt;/strong&gt; AI-driven training simulations are helping soldiers adapt to complex battlefield conditions by playing close-to-real combat scenarios with AI adjustments to address warfighters’ skill gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage assessment.&lt;/strong&gt; AI is crucial in damage assessment, utilizing satellite data and drone imagery to analyze damage, losses, and devastation and to estimate future recovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-several-factors-have-facilitated-the-rapid-development-of-military-ai-in-ukraine-creating-a-unique-environment-for-defense-innovation&quot;&gt;6. Several factors have facilitated the rapid development of military AI in Ukraine, creating a unique environment for defense innovation.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation in Ukraine over the last decade, particularly the ongoing conflict with Russia, has affected all aspects of society and necessitated rapid adaptation in defense and related fields. These factors have enabled Ukraine to test and deploy AI-driven solutions in real battlefield conditions, leading to numerous innovations, particularly in the realm of autonomy and autonomous weapon systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existential need for advanced technology.&lt;/strong&gt; The Russian invasion of 2022 created an urgent, existential need for Ukraine to develop advanced defense technologies rapidly. The high-stakes environment pushed both government and private sectors to prioritize technological advancements, such as AI, to enhance military capabilities. This urgency also catalyzed a willingness to experiment with AI, leading to quicker deployment of AI-driven capabilities in combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active civil society and a robust private sector.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s vibrant civil society and entrepreneurial private sector have been instrumental in driving defense innovation. Even before the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian entrepreneurial spirit, combined with a deep sense of national defense responsibility, led many private companies and start-ups to actively contribute to the war effort. These organizations have developed AI-driven solutions ranging from autonomous drones to advanced surveillance systems, with many innovations coming from small teams responding quickly to military demands. The active participation of nongovernmental actors in AI-enabled defense technology development and the fast deployment of commercial technology have significantly accelerated progress in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permissive regulatory frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s regulatory environment for military AI was absent before the invasion. Unlike in many other countries, where regulatory bottlenecks can slow down innovation, Ukraine’s government refused to regulate military AI, allowing innovators to respond quickly to frontline needs and develop AI applications that could be immediately deployed in combat settings. The Ministry of Digital Transformation (MDT) prioritizes a soft, business-friendly approach, aiming to avoid overregulation. Instead of imposing strict rules, the ministry uses a bottom-up strategy, offering voluntary guidelines and tools to prepare businesses for future regulations. This approach extends to the defense sector, as the MDT has indicated that it does not plan to introduce regulation of AI in the defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct communication between engineers and military personnel.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most significant accelerators of military AI development in Ukraine has been direct communication between engineers and military personnel. Through a well-established network of technical workshops positioned near the frontline or within military units, including mobile drone repair vans, engineers from private companies are able to closely monitor and assess the performance of their systems in real combat scenarios. This proximity enables engineers working on unmanned systems and autonomous capabilities to receive real-time feedback, allowing for the rapid refinement of their technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign assistance providing access to new technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; International support, from both governments and private companies, has been crucial in allowing Ukraine to leap forward in its technological capabilities. This support has facilitated Ukraine’s adoption of new technologies, such as analytical tools from Palantir, communication infrastructure via Starlink, and the migration of critical government data to Microsoft’s cloud services, to name just a few examples. This external assistance has not only equipped Ukraine with essential tools for innovation but has also fostered opportunities for collaborative development between Ukrainian and foreign companies, thereby strengthening Ukraine’s military and technological capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-collaboration-on-ai-between-ukraine-and-the-us-government-can-be-mutually-beneficial&quot;&gt;7. Collaboration on AI between Ukraine and the U.S. government can be mutually beneficial.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows are several key recommendations for the U.S. government to foster closer collaboration in AI development between the United States and Ukraine in a way that will be beneficial to both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic support.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should leverage its technological leadership to help Ukraine develop a cohesive long-term strategy for integrating AI into defense operations. By providing strategic guidance, the United States can help to align Ukraine’s national priorities in AI development while gaining valuable insights into AI applications in active warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing the feedback loop.&lt;/strong&gt; A structured feedback system for evaluating the performance of U.S.-provided drones and military technologies in Ukraine would benefit both nations. U.S. companies could quickly iterate and improve their technologies, while Ukraine would receive more tailored and effective capabilities, enhancing battlefield operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI in U.S. foreign aid.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should integrate AI development into its foreign aid programs for Ukraine, providing essential computing infrastructure to support AI innovation. This would strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities and establish the country as a hub for military AI development, benefiting U.S. strategic interests in global AI leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-focused training and entrepreneurial development.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should establish AI-related programs for Ukrainian defense entrepreneurs and business leaders. These initiatives would foster Ukraine’s defense tech ecosystem and strengthen U.S.-Ukraine collaboration, positioning both countries to lead in AI-driven defense innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-ukraines-ai-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Understanding Ukraine’s AI Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section provides a comprehensive overview of Ukraine’s military AI ecosystem. It begins by providing a background to Ukraine’s commercial AI sector, which for more than a decade has been quite successful — more than is commonly recognized in the West. Next, the paper examines how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014 resulted in major changes to the Ukrainian military’s approach to software and data, changes that were critical to the foundation of the military’s post-2022 introduction of AI technologies. Finally, it provides an overview of the key government organizations responsible for driving AI adoption throughout Ukraine’s military as well as a summary of their AI-related initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;commercial-ai-in-ukraine-a-decade-of-quiet-success&quot;&gt;Commercial AI in Ukraine: A Decade of Quiet Success&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the race for leadership in artificial intelligence, Ukraine may appear an unlikely contender. However, this comparatively small nation is demonstrating significant potential, with a highly skilled and technologically adept population. Notably, nearly two-thirds of Ukrainians express optimism regarding AI’s potential to enhance human life, reflecting widespread public confidence in the transformative capabilities of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, for more than a decade, Ukraine has quietly served as a developer of innovative AI capabilities that have captured the world’s imagination. While a full list is beyond the scope of this paper, three companies — Looksery, Respeecher, and Augmented Pixels — provide a helpful illustration of how Ukraine’s commercial AI sector has long been more impactful and more capable than is commonly understood outside technology communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in 2015, Snap Inc. — a Santa Monica-based technology company and the maker of the popular Snapchat social media app — spent $150 million to acquire Looksery, a two-year-old Ukrainian AI tech firm. Looksery’s AI-based facial recognition and augmented reality technology laid the foundation for Snapchat’s Lens portfolio, which today boasts 250 million daily users. In 2022, Snap Inc. stated that the company still employed 300 Ukrainian staff, almost all of whom are engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukrainian AI companies have also been involved in Hollywood, providing AI technology for audio generation. In 2020, Disney sought to include a younger version of Luke Skywalker in the television series The Mandalorian, but faced a challenge in that Star Wars actor Mark Hamill was 68 years old. Disney contracted with the Ukrainian AI company Respeecher to synthesize a younger voice that was sufficiently high-quality to meet Disney’s exacting standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third and finally, Qualcomm acquired Augmented Pixels in 2022. Founded in 2010 in Odesa, Augmented Pixels developed AI navigation technologies, such as 3D mapping and localization, for drones and AI glasses. At the time of purchase, Augmented Pixels’ commercial customers included National Geographic, LG Electronics, Intel, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway from these cases is that Ukraine’s AI sector was a meaningful player in commercial technology markets — taken seriously even by leading Western companies — long before Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. A 2024 study conducted on behalf of Ukraine’s MDT found that Ukraine has 243 AI-focused companies and a broader information technology (IT) and software workforce comprising more than 307,000 specialists. Additionally, Ukrainian universities have launched a remarkable 106 specialized AI and machine learning (ML) programs across 42 institutions, resulting in a 122 percent increase in enrollment over five years. The report found that Ukraine produces more IT graduates than any other Central or Eastern European country, with a quarter of these graduates specializing in AI/ML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Ukraine’s aforementioned strengths, its AI sector continues to encounter substantial challenges. According to the 2023 Government AI Readiness Index by Oxford Insights, Ukraine was ranked 60th out of 193 countries in AI integration into public service. The country’s AI development is hindered by several factors, including insufficient computing infrastructure and a shortage of skilled human capital due to the relocation of IT engineers fleeing the war (although some have continued working remotely for their Ukrainian employers). Additionally, Ukraine’s low government research and development investment further constrains the sector’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nzE7KG9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the Oxford Insights report found that Ukraine matches the United States — the index’s top-ranked country — in one crucial aspect: vision. However, vision alone is not enough to boost AI development and deployment. Ukraine’s position in the index underscores a critical gap between the ambitious plans of its tech sector and the resources needed to execute them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-ai-in-ukraine-since-2014-necessary-growth&quot;&gt;Military AI in Ukraine since 2014: Necessary Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pre-2022-laying-a-digital-foundation&quot;&gt;Pre-2022: Laying a Digital Foundation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the 2022 full-scale invasion shocked the world, for Ukrainians, it was not the start of the war with Russia. Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territories in 2014 was a major wake up call for Ukrainian society — including Ukraine’s tech sector, which became increasingly willing to directly support Ukrainian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 full-scale invasion, however, did mark a watershed moment in Ukraine’s approach to military artificial intelligence. Prior to 2022, Kyiv had not prioritized AI in its defense strategy, despite the ongoing war in the Donbas region. However, groundwork laid by volunteer groups since 2014 — focused not on AI but on software for data collection, analysis, and warfighting operational support — has proved instrumental in facilitating rapid military AI development and adoption since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This subsection will examine two key military use cases from the 2014–2022 period that enabled AI integration after the full-scale invasion: situational awareness systems and drones. After 2014, volunteers from Ukraine’s tech sector developed systems using modern data and software techniques (though not ML/AI). Over time, these systems dramatically improved Ukraine’s intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) capabilities and even overtook competing official systems in adoption and impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Situational Awareness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2014 and 2022, Ukraine’s tech-savvy and patriotic workforce developed and introduced 11 new situational awareness and battlefield management systems to the Ukrainian military. Because they were unofficial and unsanctioned, one might think that these volunteer initiatives would be divorced from real military requirements. In practice, however, the volunteer groups had direct communication with front line operational forces, allowing them to focus their development efforts on high-priority military needs. One of the initiatives, the situational awareness system Delta, was eventually adopted and formally integrated into the Ukrainian military. The remarkable fact is that some unofficial volunteer systems and software have achieved near-universal adoption by the relevant Ukrainian forces, vastly exceeding the adoption rate of some official military technology initiatives that sought (and usually failed) to provide similar capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diverse capabilities of these systems — generally originating from explicit military requests — ranged from fire control, artillery optimization, and air traffic management to combat command and control. These systems not only significantly enhanced Ukraine’s operational effectiveness but also helped transition the Ukrainian military to a modern data- and software-enabled fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[Early situational awareness and command and control systems] not only significantly enhanced Ukraine’s operational effectiveness but also helped transition the Ukrainian military to a modern data- and software-enabled fighting force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most noteworthy volunteer groups is Aerorozvidka, whose situational awareness system Delta has become a linchpin in Ukraine’s multidomain operations. Started in 2016 and transferred to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine (MoD) in 2023, Delta seamlessly integrates NATO ISTAR standards to provide essential situational awareness across all branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Building on this foundation, Aerorozvidka has spearheaded the creation of situational awareness centers in eight cities, each focused on gathering information from its respective section of the front. These centers serve as technological hubs, uniting and coordinating intelligence from a wide variety of sources — drones, satellites, stationary cameras, sensors, field scouts, and data from allies. The system even digitizes information from loyal informants in temporarily occupied territories, who interface with government apps and chatbots. Bringing all these different data sources together in a unified software platform is a challenge even for the United States military, but Delta achieves this and enjoys high user satisfaction among Ukrainian forces. As will be discussed further in this paper, Delta has recently been enhanced with AI/ML-enabled capabilities. At one point, there was an officially sanctioned military system — Dzvin — in development that promised similar capabilities as the volunteer-built Delta. However, this fell victim to bureaucratic hurdles and corruption and never achieved meaningful adoption despite its official introduction into the AFU in 2022. A diverse range of military officials told CSIS that Delta now is the de facto standard and Dzvin is functionally irrelevant. Delta is also of keen interest to NATO, which has described the system as “ground-breaking” following its victory in a 2017 NATO hackathon and prominent testing in NATO military exercises, most recently in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kropyva artillery software system improves target accuracy and routinely reduces the time between receiving orders and striking targets by up to tenfold. Ukrainian artillerymen access Kropyva through a tablet or mobile phone, then enter enemy coordinates, which are automatically translated to the nearest available artillery battery along with precalculated aiming trajectories. The Army SOS volunteer organization developed Kropyva in 2014, and 90 to 95 percent of Ukrainian artillery units have adopted it as their primary artillery fire control system. Another military system helping to coordinate artillery strikes, GisArta, attracted widespread attention in the Western press as “Uber for artillery,” even though Kropyva is more widely used and impactful according to Ukrainian military officials in conversation with CSIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kropyva and Delta are just two of dozens of examples demonstrating how systems initially developed by tech industry volunteers changed Ukraine’s armed forces after 2014. Many of these systems began with the modest goal of supporting warfighter decisionmaking and have since evolved into advanced situational awareness and battle management systems routinely used by hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Prior to 2022, the adoption of these modern software and data-driven platforms also laid the groundwork for AI/ML integration. As critical information sources were networked and digitized, the data they generated became the raw material for training AI models and enabling AI-driven capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of volunteer-led grassroots projects underscores a crucial point: in the face of existential threats, innovation in Ukraine has primarily thrived outside traditional channels. However, this decentralized approach is not without its challenges. Many of these teams still operate on shoestring budgets, relying heavily on donations. The lack of systemic support and funding raises concerns about the long-term sustainability and interoperability of this diversity of systems. Ukraine still possesses a hard-won technological edge, but the government needs to ensure that these successful initiatives are put on a more secure long-term foundation and incorporated into official plans and strategies. Unfortunately, multiple executives in Ukraine’s defense technology ecosystem told CSIS that the scale of Ukraine’s technological edge is shrinking as Russian forces improve their own technology and their pace of innovation adoption. Whereas previously Russian forces would take a month or more to adapt to new Ukrainian innovations before adopting countermeasures in the form of new tactics or technologies, now Russian forces may need as little as two or three days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to 2022, drones were in use by both sides, mostly for remotely piloted ISR missions and without AI/ML capabilities. Drones have become a ubiquitous feature of the post-2022 war with Russia, widely recognized as a transformational capability for both sides. However, the impact of drones during the 2014–2022 period was considerably more limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Donbas served as an early testing ground for commercial drones, with both sides exploring their potential. While Russian forces made early strides in drone warfare, the Ukrainian side’s attempts to leverage commercial drones were met with mixed results. The lack of trained operators, coupled with the high attrition rate of these relatively expensive items for Ukrainian soldiers who usually had to buy them at their own expense, initially dampened enthusiasm for their widespread adoption. Volunteer organizations, which have played a crucial role in supporting Ukraine’s military efforts, did not — prior to 2022 — prioritize drone acquisition. Similarly, official military decisionmakers were slow to recognize the potential of these systems, focusing instead on more traditional assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases where Ukrainian forces did use drones, the priority use case was ISR. China was a major supplier of commercial drones to Ukraine, primarily for civilian purposes such as agriculture and event photography, often referred to as “wedding” drones. However, these also saw usage in combat, even prior to 2022, again mostly for ISR. Hence, Ukrainian defense companies focused their military drone development efforts primarily on medium and long-range reconnaissance and artillery fire correction. Notable examples include the PD-2 from UkrSpecSystems, the Furia from Athlone Avia, the R18 from Aerorozvidka, and the ACS-3M from Skyeton. Companies like DeVIRo also contributed with their Leleka-100, further expanding Ukraine’s domestic drone capabilities, while the Punisher, a strike drone produced by UA Dynamics, represents Ukraine’s foray into offensive drone technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the early use of drones in the war in Donbas, neither Ukrainian nor Russian drones were equipped with ISR AI/ML capabilities. However, increased familiarity with drones would set the stage for later AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite the early use of drones in the war in Donbas, neither Ukrainian nor Russian drones were equipped with ISR AI/ML capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;post-invasion-ai-surge-wide-ranging-military-ai-applications&quot;&gt;Post-Invasion AI Surge: Wide-Ranging Military AI Applications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Ukraine having been at war with Russia for nearly a decade, its 2022 full-scale invasion was a shock to the Ukrainian military system. The survival of Ukraine as an independent state was at stake, and leaders across civilian, military, and commercial structures reacted accordingly. Society as a whole mobilized to support the armed forces, and in many cases, everyday citizens volunteered to participate in combat and defend Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial technology sector of Ukraine was also swept up in this wave. What had been a volunteering side project for many became the dominant focus of their professional life. In numerous cases, these efforts were centered on maintaining and enhancing existing digital platforms like Delta and Kropyva. However, a new suite of volunteer-built capabilities focusing on the opportunities of AI technology also emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the pre-2022 era, there was no centrally guided plan to accelerate the adoption of AI for priority use cases. Rather, experimentation with AI emerged organically, as technically proficient volunteers explored solutions to the diverse security challenges facing all of Ukrainian society — from disinformation to cyberwar to front-line conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the technology development and drive behind Ukrainian AI efforts originated in the private sector and volunteer communities, the Ukrainian government and military responded with significant organizational changes to accelerate and improve the adoption of AI-enabled capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While much of the technology development and drive behind Ukrainian AI efforts originated in the private sector and volunteer communities, the Ukrainian government and military responded with significant organizational changes to accelerate and improve the adoption of AI-enabled capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-institutional-landscape-for-military-ai-development-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Institutional Landscape for Military AI Development in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The institutional landscape supporting AI development in Ukraine has evolved significantly since 2022, with many government agencies and institutions shifting from initially neglecting AI to actively creating specialized departments and units dedicated to developing AI capabilities. This transformation has been driven largely by the pressing demands of the ongoing war against Russia, where AI technologies have repeatedly demonstrated the potential to provide an advantage on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of special note, Ukraine has gone so far as to create an entirely new branch of its armed forces, the Unmanned Systems Forces. While smaller than the other branches of the Ukrainian military, it is nevertheless technically their peer, and it serves as evidence that Ukrainian leadership views as critical the task of driving organizational reforms to account for new technological realities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other defense and security institutions have also created new organizations and empowered them to accelerate technology innovation, such as Special Unit Typhoon, a new part of the National Guard of Ukraine. One newly created organization within the MoD, the Center for Innovation and Defense Technologies (CIDT), is a direct outgrowth of the tech volunteer community’s efforts. In 2023, the CIDT took official responsibility for upgrading and developing situational awareness technologies, including the Delta system discussed in a previous section. In 2024, the developers began integrating AI/ML capabilities into Delta with an initial focus on video and text processing for the identification of enemy forces in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, the war has led organizations to reinvent their mandate. Both the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU, a subordinate body of the MoD) and the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) have taken a leading role in developing and executing long-range precision strikes on Russian infrastructure. In previous years, these organizations would not have been responsible for such missions. AI is a useful enabling technology for long-range precision strikes, and both organizations have developed the relevant competencies to be at the forefront of AI adoption. For example, AI-based computer vision is helpful for accurate navigation in GPS-denied environments, such as the territory on both sides of the Russian border. More broadly, both the DIU and the SSU have adopted AI for processing and analyzing vast volumes of battlefield data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond creating new institutions and changing the mandate of existing ones, Ukrainian authorities are also implementing regulatory reforms and launching diverse initiatives to make it easier for companies to develop AI — and for military units to adopt it. The MDT, which is responsible for policymaking in AI development, is fostering an innovation-friendly regulatory environment, avoiding overregulation and promoting AI development through initiatives such as the Army of Drones and the Brave1 platform (further discussed below). These initiatives have accelerated the deployment of unmanned systems — including AI-driven ones — by providing essential financial and organizational support to early-stage projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;profiles-of-organizations-in-ukraines-military-ai-ecosystem&quot;&gt;Profiles of Organizations in Ukraine’s Military AI Ecosystem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of AI-enabled warfare is not occurring in isolation; it is shaped by a complex institutional landscape of government agencies and stakeholders. This section provides an overview of key institutions, along with their initiatives specifically related to developing military AI and drones, while excluding the broader scope of these institutions’ functions as it falls outside the focus of this research. Due to the classified nature of much of the information on government initiatives, this overview remains general, without going into the technical specifics of the projects and technologies involved. The purpose of this section is to offer a clearer understanding of Ukraine’s somewhat unstructured governmental approach to military AI development, as well as to facilitate the identification of relevant counterparts for collaboration where Ukrainian models or initiatives align with U.S. government objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ministry-of-defense&quot;&gt;Ministry of Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD of Ukraine is the government body responsible for overseeing national defense and the AFU. The MoD is headed by the minister of defense, while the president of Ukraine holds the position of supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational AI Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center for Innovation and Defense Technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, the MoD established the CIDT to reform its approach to IT project management. Its primary objective is to modernize automated combat management systems and develop future operational-strategic, tactical, and situational awareness systems. A notable achievement in this workstream is the formal adoption of the Delta situational awareness system by the MoD in 2023, which the CIDT inherited from the volunteer organization Aerorozvidka. Public information on the CIDT’s AI-related initiatives is limited, particularly beyond its focus on the Delta platform. However, recent job postings for machine learning engineers, MLOps specialists, and computer vision researchers suggest that the CIDT is prioritizing the integration of AI-enabled solutions into Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanned Systems Forces.&lt;/strong&gt; A dedicated branch of the AFU, the Unmanned Systems Forces (USF), was established to systematize and expand the experience gained in the deployment of unmanned systems while formalizing a doctrinal approach suited to the realities of asymmetrical warfare. The USF is responsible for operations across all domains and levels, ranging from frontline engagements to deep strikes within enemy territory. Under the leadership of Colonel Vadym Sukharevsky, the USF plays a central role in introducing unmanned systems throughout the AFU, adopting emerging technologies, sharing innovations, and training units and brigades to use new systems. The USF is tasked with identifying the most effective systems to address the diverse challenges faced by the AFU on the battlefield. To date, over 170 models of unmanned systems have been integrated into frontline operations, positioning the USF as a critical driver of technological innovation in combat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Technology Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation Development Accelerator.&lt;/strong&gt; The MoD has sought to accelerate the development and adoption of defense technologies through the creation of the Innovation Development Accelerator. Established in 2023, this initiative is designed to streamline and modernize the ministry’s operations by addressing issues of overregulation, lengthy processes, and inefficiencies in collaboration with defense companies. The accelerator aims to reduce the time required for the implementation of weapons and equipment from more than two years to approximately 45 days, while simplifying bureaucratic procedures to enhance operational efficiency. One of its six core priorities is the advancement of robotization and AI tech adoption for unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as ground and water drones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiatives in AI Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctrine for Unmanned Systems Forces.&lt;/strong&gt; The USF has developed a comprehensive doctrine and statute for all branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is currently being tested in operational units. The documentation is developed for every level, from squad to battalion, and it will standardize tactics and procedures for the use of unmanned systems across the AFU. The creation of this statute marks a significant step toward the formalization and regulation of unmanned system deployment, ensuring consistent operational practices across the military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy.&lt;/strong&gt; The only AI-related regulatory initiative in which the MoD is currently involved is the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy, launched in 2023. This provides a framework for the responsible use of military AI and aims to build international consensus, guiding states in the ethical development, deployment, and use of military AI technologies. Besides this international initiative, the MoD has not yet released any public strategies or formalized vision regarding AI implementation or the development of autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-intelligence-of-the-mod-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;Defense Intelligence of the MoD of Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Main Directorate of Intelligence of the MoD, also known as the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU), serves as the military intelligence agency to the country’s leadership and the AFU. Its portfolio includes intelligence, cyber, technology development, and occasionally direct execution of high-priority missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Technology Initiatives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI for analytics.&lt;/strong&gt; The DIU has emerged as one of the most advanced users and adopters of AI technology within the military. According to Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, chief of the DIU, the increasing volume of acquired intelligence data necessitated the enhancement of analytical capabilities. To address this challenge, the analytical branch has been significantly bolstered with technologies for automated data processing, integrating artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency and accuracy of analysis. This integration of AI has been critical in managing large datasets and enhancing the decisionmaking process within the intelligence operations of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drones for long-range strikes.&lt;/strong&gt; The DIU is a leading agency in conducting long-range strikes into Russian territory using drones equipped with some elements of autonomy. These autonomous drones play a crucial role in Ukraine’s ability to carry out precision strikes at extended distances, significantly expanding the operational capabilities of its military. The use of such autonomous systems represents a forward-looking approach to modern warfare, where AI-enabled technologies enhance the effectiveness of long-range operations while minimizing the need for direct human intervention. While the Ukrainian government has not disclosed all of the functions that AI plays in this mission, government officials told CSIS that AI does play an important role. This positions the DIU as a key player in the development and application of autonomous military technologies in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-service-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;Security Service of Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) serves as the country’s principal security and intelligence agency, tasked with safeguarding national security, conducting counterintelligence operations and counterterrorism efforts, and combating organized crime. It operates under the authority of the president of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Technology Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naval drones.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the SSU’s most innovative contributions to the war effort is its use of naval drones, which have significantly impacted the balance of power in the Black Sea. These drones are not just simple unmanned vessels; due to constant close interaction between the SSU and its drone operators and engineers, they have evolved into multifunctional platforms that are constantly undergoing technological improvements. For example, the Sea Baby drones, initially designed for explosive attacks on Russian naval ships and infrastructure, have been enhanced to perform additional functions such as offensive sea mining. They have successfully laid mines in strategic locations, significantly impacting Russian naval operations. Moreover, due to recent upgrades, the drones are equipped with rocket systems — specifically the Grad multiple rocket launchers, which have already shown effectiveness in targeting Russian positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-guard-of-ukraine&quot;&gt;National Guard of Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Guard of Ukraine is a military force under the command of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and it is tasked with protecting public order, securing strategically important facilities, and countering illegal paramilitary groups. During martial law periods, the units of the National Guard are subordinate to the AFU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational AI Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2024, the National Guard of Ukraine established a specialized unit known as Typhoon, which is focused on the deployment of unmanned aerial systems for military operations. This unit, composed of seasoned Special Forces veterans, has been created with the objective of enhancing the operational capabilities of combat brigades by integrating advanced unmanned systems into their strategic and tactical frameworks. The veterans within the unit bring a wealth of combat experience, which is crucial for the effective deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex battlefield environments. By integrating unmanned systems into combat operations, the Typhoon unit aims to increase both the flexibility and responsiveness of brigade-level engagements, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing risks to personnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ministry-of-digital-transformation&quot;&gt;Ministry of Digital Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine (MDT), established in 2019, is responsible for shaping and implementing state policy in digitalization, the digital economy, and digital innovation. It focuses on e-government, digital democracy, the development of digital skills and rights, open data, national electronic resources, and broadband infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational AI Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Expert Committee on AI Development.&lt;/strong&gt; The Expert Committee on AI Development, established under the MDT in December 2019, plays an important role in enhancing the country’s competitiveness in the field of AI. Composed predominantly of business and science representatives, the committee’s main task is to drive AI policy recommendations, facilitate research and development, and nurture talent across various domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Technology Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Army of Drones.&lt;/strong&gt; Launched in July 2022 by the MDT, the Army of Drones initiative represents a significant effort to integrate unmanned aerial vehicles into Ukraine’s defense capabilities. Initially conceived as a fundraising campaign, the initiative quickly evolved into a systematic and comprehensive program aimed at both procuring drones and training operators for their effective deployment on the battlefield. The program’s scope has grown to encompass not only the direct supply of drones to frontline units but also the promotion of domestic UAV production, significantly bolstering Ukraine’s defense industrial base. One of the core objectives of the Army of Drones initiative is to equip Ukrainian armed forces with modern, locally produced UAVs that can be used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and tactical strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the initiative places significant emphasis on the training and skill enhancement of drone operators, ensuring that personnel are proficient in utilizing the advanced technologies embedded in contemporary UAV systems. By the end of 2023, 20,000 operators had successfully completed the training. This comprehensive approach — combining procurement, production, and operator training — has had a transformative impact on the use of drones in frontline operations, making the Army of Drones a pivotal component of Ukraine’s broader defense strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brave1.&lt;/strong&gt; As an effort to support projects and companies in their early stages, a platform dubbed “Brave1” was established in July 2023. It is designed to facilitate collaboration among all major stakeholders in the government’s defense sector, the tech industry, and investors and volunteers. Manufacturers who meet the 12 priority verticals of technological development identified by the general staff of the AFU for the Brave1 cluster and have passed a defense expert review can apply to get military expertise; testing opportunities; and organizational, informational, and financial support for their projects. Brave1 also funds early-stage miltech start-ups, giving grants up to UAH 8,000,000 (approximately USD 194,000). As of September 2024, the program has awarded 299 grants totaling USD 6.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In October 2024, the MDT stated that the list of priority verticals of technological development will be revised, with a larger focus on electronic warfare and AI-enabled capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Events organized by Brave1 provide valuable insights into the urgent technological needs and priorities of the AFU, as the topics and competition areas reflect requests gathered by the Brave1 team from various military institutions and agencies. For example, the deputy commander-in-chief of the AFU has identified key areas for technological advancement, including alternative navigation systems, jamming-resistant communications, drone swarm technologies, “friend or foe” identification, and improved target identification and engagement capabilities. Events such as the Precision Hackathon exemplify the immediate demand for AI-driven solutions in defense technology — including advanced targeting systems, real-time data integration, and innovative smart munitions capable of adjusting their trajectories to engage dynamic targets. The emphasis on autonomous and semi-autonomous systems with precision targeting capabilities and network-centric tools for combat operations reflects a broader shift toward AI-enabled autonomy in military applications. Furthermore, events like the AI for Ukraine Recovery Hackathon, which focused on topics such as cybersecurity, damage assessment, and disinformation prevention, underscore the pivotal role of AI in strengthening Ukraine’s defense capabilities and supporting its recovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiatives in AI Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach to AI regulation.&lt;/strong&gt; The MDT is responsible for overseeing Ukraine’s digital development, digital economy, and innovation, with AI being an integral component of this policy. Consequently, the ministry also holds responsibility for AI regulation. However, it has explicitly emphasized a commitment to avoiding overregulation by adopting a soft, business-friendly approach. The MDT plans to implement a bottom-up strategy, initially preparing businesses for future regulations before moving toward formal implementation. In the early stages, the state will provide businesses with tools such as general and sector-specific recommendations, voluntary codes of conduct, a legal assistance platform, and a regulatory sandbox for product testing, all aimed at facilitating compliance with forthcoming legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The current regulatory framework includes the Concept of Development of Artificial Intelligence in Ukraine, adopted in 2020, followed by the AI Regulation Roadmap introduced in 2023. While neither document constitutes formal regulation, they provide guiding principles for AI development within the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The MDT also plays a significant role in fostering defense innovation, making its approach to AI regulation in the defense sector particularly clear in its white paper “Artificial Intelligence Regulation in Ukraine: Vision of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine.” The ministry has stated that it does not intend to propose any regulation of AI systems within the defense sector, emphasizing a noninterventionist stance in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplifying regulation for local high-tech defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt; To boost local production, the MDT has made some considerable steps in terms of regulatory simplification for private drone companies. By implementing regulatory changes, the allowed profit margin for Ukrainian drone manufacturers was increased from 1 percent to 25 percent. This change makes the drone production business more financially viable and attractive for local companies. Previously, the low profitability cap of 1 percent limited potential earnings, discouraging investment and innovation. By raising the limit to 25 percent, the government aims to stimulate growth in the domestic high-tech defense industry, encouraging companies to scale up production and invest in advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, regulations governing contract negotiations, goods acceptance for military use, operational clearance, and delivery to the front were streamlined. Measures were also implemented to accelerate the operational approval process for UAV manufacturers, facilitating faster integration into state procurement contracts and supply chains for frontline operations. The government eliminated the requirement for export service control documents, simplifying the import of drones and their components, and removed the need for Security Service approvals, significantly expediting the overall approval process. Additionally, drone manufacturers can opt into the special “Diia.City” tax regime for IT companies, which allows up to 50 percent of employees eligible for military service to be exempted from active duty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;innovations-development-fund&quot;&gt;Innovations Development Fund&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Innovations Development Fund (previously called the Ukrainian Startup Fund) is the first and only state institution dedicated to helping innovative projects and tech start-ups secure early-stage funding and launch their ventures. Established in 2018 by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, it has been managed by the MDT since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Technology Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program for defense start-ups.&lt;/strong&gt; The “Fast Track to Victory” program is an example of Ukraine’s capacity to rapidly adapt and use existing infrastructure to foster innovation in defense technologies. This program streamlines the interaction between the MoD and UAV manufacturers, facilitating a more efficient approval process for drone technologies. By leveraging the fund’s web portal, UAV developers with finished products can apply directly for official ministry approval. This approval is essential as it authorizes the MoD to procure the products and allows the AFU to deploy them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;According to government documents describing the program, the application process is designed to be efficient, with all submissions reviewed by MoD representatives in a timely manner. The program specifically targets UAVs that meet the tactical and technical characteristics required by the military, ensuring that the products are immediately relevant to the operational needs of the AFU. Once approved, the products can be integrated into military service, streamlining the deployment of innovative drone technologies on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ministry-of-strategic-industries-and-ukrainian-defense-industry&quot;&gt;Ministry of Strategic Industries and Ukrainian Defense Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Strategic Industries is responsible for overseeing Ukraine’s military-industrial complex, which includes a state-owned enterprise named Ukrainian Defense Industry (formerly known as UkrOboronProm). This entity manages over 100 defense-related enterprises, many of which are remnants of Soviet-era companies. While efforts are underway to modernize some of these enterprises to meet the demands of the current war, the ministry and its associated industries remain predominantly focused on traditional defense platforms — such as artillery production and missile programs — rather than on emerging technologies like software-driven systems and AI, which are increasingly defining modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Technology Initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI implementation together with the MDT.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2021, Ukrainian Defense Industry signed a memorandum of intent with the MDT to coordinate efforts in advancing the digital economy and fostering innovation, with a specific focus on AI technology. Formerly, UkrOboronProm had also expressed plans to establish a dedicated unit for AI development. However, Ukrainian Defense Industry sources told CSIS that these initiatives have not yet been realized or advanced, highlighting a gap between stated intentions and actual implementation in the area of digital and AI-driven defense innovation. This suggests that while there is recognition of the importance of emerging technologies, the practical shift toward their integration in Ukraine’s defense industry remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation with Helsing.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2024, the Ministry for Strategic Industries signed a memorandum with Helsing GmbH, a German company specializing in software development and AI integration in defense technologies. This cooperation aims to enhance Ukrainian defense technologies by integrating AI into drones, particularly Ukrainian-made UAVs. This is probably the only public mention of ministry- or state-owned enterprises introducing AI technology in their production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiatives in AI Regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming strategic AI project for key economic sectors.&lt;/strong&gt; Somewhat unexpectedly, given the ministry’s responsibilities and the current situation in the country, the Ukrainian government has approved a concept for a state program using artificial intelligence in strategic sectors of the economy and has designated the Ministry of Strategic Industries as responsible for the development of a detailed AI program for these priority sectors. The program aims to enhance Ukraine’s economic potential and strengthen its global market position by 2026 in such sectors as machinery, chemicals, defense, nuclear industry, agriculture, healthcare, and scientific activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;money-matters&quot;&gt;Money Matters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of the defense industry and the sustainability of military operations are heavily dependent on the government’s purchasing capacity, regardless of the scale and quality of research, development, and production. In FY 2024, the Ukrainian government has allocated UAH 58.8 billion (USD 1.4 billion) for the acquisition of UAVs and an additional UAH 1.5 billion (USD 36 million) to support the Brave1 platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Ukrainian defense companies face significant challenges, including export bans imposed since the onset of the full-scale war due to the need to satisfy the demand for weapon systems for the AFU first. As a result, many defense factories remain underutilized due to insufficient funding for weapons procurement in the state budget and the consequent low purchasing capacity from the government. Although the defense industry’s capacity is estimated at around USD 20 billion, the maximum government procurement budget for 2024 is only USD 6 billion. In response, discussions have recently begun regarding the reopening of defense exports. A parliamentary working group is currently evaluating risks and developing a mechanism to enable Ukraine’s reentry into the global arms market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drone production represents a significant area of expansion. Ukrainian Defense Industry sources told CSIS that the current production output for FPV drones alone exceeds 2 million units in 2024, although only 1 million have been contracted by the government to date. A survey conducted among defense companies revealed that 38 percent of them have more than half of their production capacity idle, while 85 percent are considering relocation abroad. The primary factors that could prevent such relocation include the reopening of exports, an increase in government procurement orders, and the establishment of long-term contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, the Ministry of Strategic Industries is actively working to address current challenges in the industry, with a key focus on securing external funding for the purchase of Ukrainian defense products, including UAVs. ZBROYARI: Manufacturing Freedom is a global fundraising campaign aimed at raising USD 10 billion from partner countries to produce Ukrainian weapons in 2024. Of EUR 60 million in Dutch contributions, EUR 20 million is for FPV drones, EUR 22.5 million for Dutch drones, and EUR 17.5 million for Ukrainian-made naval drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military AI in Ukraine underwent a rapid transition from being a secondary concern during almost eight years of war in Donbas to becoming a cornerstone of the country’s survival after the full-scale Russian invasion of 2022. This dramatic transition is reflected in the growth of private companies developing military AI capabilities, which have increased from two dozen or so in the beginning of 2022 to over a thousand in 2024. The Ukrainian government embraced the role of innovation enabler by streamlining the bureaucratic processes for technology adoption, adapting its organizational structures to meet rapidly advancing technological capabilities, and providing funding to the commercial defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these efforts, most of the industry representatives and brigade commanders interviewed by CSIS confirmed that numerous AI solutions are currently being tested on the frontline. They expect a transition to semi-autonomous unmanned capabilities in a year or two, wherein the human role will only be in confirmation of a strike. However, Ukraine may not have the luxury of time and must fast-track the realization of this vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, Ukraine must overcome several challenges that are hindering its military AI development: insufficient funding, the limited capacity of small companies and their fragmented efforts in developing AI capabilities, competition within the government for resources, and a lack of coordination among key defense and military institutions to create a unified approach to military AI. Additionally, there is a shortage of computing power and experienced AI professionals in the country to work on classified technology, which are critical for making military AI a game-changer in the fight against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia is investing enormous resources into transitioning to an economy on a war footing with a focus on technological advancement within its military, Ukraine requires support from its international partners to fully leverage the advantages of AI as a competitive edge across all battlefields and frontlines in its fight against a conventionally superior adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of this paper presents recommendations on how the U.S. government can collaborate with Ukraine to harness the advantages of military AI development and ensure that both nations remain at the forefront of AI and defense innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-providing-strategic-support&quot;&gt;1. Providing strategic support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, with its technological superiority and numerous AI-related defense programs, is uniquely positioned to assist Ukraine in addressing its challenge of lacking a cohesive, government-led strategy for defense technology development. Given the United States’ forward-looking and long-term AI development plans, it can collaborate with Ukraine to craft a comprehensive, mid-term strategy for integrating AI into its military for beyond immediate tactical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This support would offer Ukraine much-needed guidance to align its decentralized bottom-up approach with a coherent national vision, allowing volunteer groups, start-ups, the defense sector, and government institutions to operate in synergy with national priorities. This approach could help Ukraine align government stakeholders’ efforts in accordance with a single strategy in order to avoid wasting resources, and it could increase competition by promoting efficient resource allocation and funding for AI-enabled capabilities development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits for the United States are twofold. First, by collaborating with Ukraine, the United States can access real-time insights into the application of AI technologies in active warfare, gaining valuable data that can enhance its own AI capabilities. Second, support for Ukraine’s efforts is a contribution to strengthening the global security architecture and countering common adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-unlocking-battlefield-data-for-innovation&quot;&gt;2. Unlocking battlefield data for innovation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To harness the full potential of AI in defense, Ukraine must build a collaborative framework that brings government authorities and private sector innovators together on data-sharing strategies. This framework should regulate access to and use of real-world combat data by establishing clear legal procedures and protocols for data collection, storage, and sharing — all while safeguarding national security. Such an environment would streamline access for approved developers and foster sustainable business models, incentivizing private investment in military AI research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States could play a pivotal role in enabling this effort, helping Ukraine develop a technical and regulative framework by drawing from its own experience of data exchange within global projects such as the Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control, where military data is shared among allied countries and the U.S. military. This initiative could set a global precedent for responsible data sharing in defense technology development. Ukraine could monetize its combat data by offering access to countries, organizations such as NATO, and even private defense companies in order to improve their AI tech and the interoperability of all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-closing-a-feedback-loop&quot;&gt;3. Closing a feedback loop&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the United States sends significant military aid to Ukraine, including drones, and many U.S. start-ups and drone manufacturers are contributing by donating their products through volunteers, NGOs, and Ukrainian government initiatives. However, there is no established system for collecting feedback on the performance and effectiveness of these drones on the battlefield, leaving the feedback loop incomplete. Establishing a more structured and standardized feedback collection process would be highly beneficial for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For U.S. companies, faster and more organized feedback would enable them to shorten their iteration cycles, update their platforms and software more rapidly, and scale up production of cutting-edge technology. This is particularly important when it comes to AI, where software updates can be implemented much quicker than hardware — without the need to alter supply chains, source new components, or update manufacturing processes. On the Ukrainian side, this would mean receiving more advanced and better-suited capabilities for their battlefield conditions, as U.S. companies have the resources and capital to accelerate drone and AI development, as well as to scale up production. By closing this feedback loop, both the United States and Ukraine can enhance their technological capabilities and improve the effectiveness of military assistance on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-considering-ukraines-ai-in-us-foreign-aid&quot;&gt;4. Considering Ukraine’s AI in U.S. foreign aid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current U.S. financial assistance to Ukraine, primarily through USAID, has been vital for the digital development of the country. However, by integrating an AI component into this aid, the United States can achieve two key objectives: enhancing Ukraine’s AI capabilities and securing a role in what could become a global AI development hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s regulatory environment for AI is highly permissive, and its political leadership is open to embracing technological risks for significant advancements. This combination creates a unique “laboratory” for AI development that the United States cannot afford to overlook. This approach requires more than just funding; it necessitates providing computing infrastructure to key AI innovation centers in Ukraine, such as the MoD, research institutions, and labs. By equipping these entities with the necessary computational power, AI research and development can accelerate at an unprecedented pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-offering-ai-focused-training-experience-exchange-and-entrepreneurial-development-programs&quot;&gt;5. Offering AI-focused training, experience exchange, and entrepreneurial development programs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should establish training and experience exchange programs for Ukraine’s defense entrepreneurs. These programs would focus on developing expertise in AI applications, the specifics of defense industry, and international market and investor relations to build successful defense-oriented enterprises. Given the rapid growth of Ukraine’s defense tech ecosystem, these initiatives would enable entrepreneurs to gain a deeper understanding of how to attract investments, scale innovations, and align with national security objectives. For the United States, such programs offer the opportunity to strengthen collaboration with Ukraine’s emerging defense sector. This partnership would give the United States valuable connections with Ukrainian innovators across the defense industry, benefiting both nations in shaping the future of AI in national security and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and integration of military AI into future weapon systems is inevitable. While the United States leads in technological innovation, it faces limitations in testing these advancements under real combat conditions. Collaboration with Ukraine presents a unique and mutually beneficial opportunity to bridge this gap. By working together with Ukraine, the United States can gain firsthand insights into the practical applications of military AI and autonomous systems without putting “boots on the ground.” Otherwise, real combat environments remain theoretical or simulated for U.S. systems manufacturers. Moreover, this partnership can provide valuable contributions to the international debate on safe and responsible AI deployment, offering concrete evidence from battlefield usage to help construct a global framework for military AI governance. As AI continues to reshape defense landscapes, U.S.-Ukraine collaboration stands to advance technological innovation while setting standards for responsible and ethical AI integration into military systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Congress enacted the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act), a pivotal initiative which seeks to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor technology — the backbone of everything from cars to household appliances to defense systems. The CHIPS Act represents a national effort to reverse recent trends, driven by major industrial policies of other countries, that have led to the loss of U.S. leadership in the technology needed to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors. The United States has also seen an erosion of onshore chipmaking, which now accounts for only about 10 percent of global capacity. The urgency of the situation was brought into sharp relief by highly disruptive chip shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, China — the United States’ most formidable strategic competitor — is making rapid strides in semiconductor technology, particularly in defense-related areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its plan for implementing the CHIPS Act, the U.S. government has earmarked substantial federal assistance for the world’s three most advanced chipmakers, among others, to construct leading-edge manufacturing facilities and grow U.S. regional semiconductor ecosystems. Two of these firms, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) and Samsung, are slated to receive substantial funding to support major investments in such ecosystems, which bring manifold opportunities for local growth and employment. Both firms are headquartered outside the United States and have, in the past, kept the lion’s share of their research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and technology development in their respective home countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third leading-edge firm is the storied Intel Corporation, the largest and most advanced U.S.-headquartered manufacturer. Intel has an unmatched history of breakthrough semiconductor innovations — including the first programmable microprocessor and the x86 architecture — which have together made an “indelible impact on the world of computing . . . [that] continues to shape the digital landscape of the modern world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Intel is at present trailing TSMC and Samsung in chip process technology, it is the only U.S.-headquartered firm within striking distance of regaining U.S. capabilities at advanced process nodes. The company has made massive commitments to invest heavily — more than $100 billion over the next five years — in new chipmaking capability and capacity on domestic soil, aiming to develop and manufacture chips at the most advanced process nodes of 2 nanometers (nm) and below. Recognizing the importance of this, the U.S. government has announced plans to award Intel the largest share of federal support under the CHIPS Act. Successful implementation, and the resultant national security benefits, will depend on Intel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, at this juncture, Intel is experiencing financial and operational turbulence, in no small part due to its ambitious investments pursuant to the CHIPS Act’s objectives. Now, with a recently announced strategic recovery plan, the company appears to be seeking additional investment. Given Intel’s importance to the CHIPS Act’s economic and strategic goals, it is vital that the company remains viable and capable of carrying out its commitments — with even more public support, if necessary, than it has already been given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given Intel’s importance to the CHIPS Act’s economic and strategic goals, it is vital that the company remains viable and capable of carrying out its commitments — with even more public support, if necessary, than it has already been given.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intels-turnaround-strategy&quot;&gt;Intel’s Turnaround Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel’s operational and financial difficulties received extensive media coverage in 2024, some of which exaggerated the severity of its challenges and perhaps adversely affected the company’s stock price. Shortly after Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, took charge in 2021, he announced an ambitious “IDM 2.0” strategy, which included plans for the company to become a major global player in the contract-manufacturing (“foundry”) market. The initial plan called for the establishment of a new business unit, Intel Foundry Services (later rebranded as Intel Foundry), as well as tens of billions of dollars for the construction of new manufacturing facilities to service surging demand. Intel Foundry, when announced, represented a significant expansion beyond Intel’s integrated device manufacturer (IDM) business model, in which the company’s manufacturing capacity was reserved for Intel-designed chips. Intel Foundry, however, allows for the manufacturing of chips designed by other firms, which puts Intel in direct competition with other large foundry providers such as TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Gelsinger unveiled the next phase of the firm’s strategy, announcing that it will further separate its design business from Intel Foundry, which will be an independent subsidiary with substantial autonomy, complete with its own board of directors, bylaws, and operating structure. This action is intended to provide foundry services for chip design firms with stronger protection of intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some progress on this front has already been made. In a multibillion-dollar arrangement, Intel Foundry will leverage new process technology to manufacture chips for Amazon’s cloud computing wing beginning in 2025, including customized server devices. Forbes observed that “This can only be looked at as a positive — a strategic, long-term deal that Intel didn’t have before. If you can get the number-one cloud provider to do not just one but two highly custom chips with you, one in the foundry and one in a custom server chip, that portends a very good future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, backed by a $3 billion federal grant, Intel will develop chip manufacturing infrastructure for the U.S. defense industry. The federal award represents “another win for Intel Foundry, and even more so for the highly secure supply chain that Gelsinger has been intent on building for Intel over the past few years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress, profitability will take time, as the high capital costs and lengthy timelines required to bring new fabs online limits near-term revenues. In 2023, for example, the company’s foundry unit brought in $18.9 billion but reported an operating loss of around $7 billion, as well as other operational problems. Intel does not expect the new fabs to generate “meaningful” revenue until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;issues-with-process-technology-and-products&quot;&gt;Issues with Process Technology and Products&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a September 2024 Reuters report, Intel faces difficulties in its upcoming 18A process technology, which is slated for high-volume production in 2025. Reuters indicated that Broadcom, a major fabless firm, had concluded after tests that Intel’s process was not yet ready for such production. Yet the report, even if accurate, may not be indicative of a significant problem, as Intel’s timeline anticipates the 18A technology to be ready for high-volume production in mid-2025, rather than mid- or even late 2024. Moreover, Intel reports that it already has a dozen customers using its 18A tool kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel’s 13th- and 14th-generation Intel Core processors are also reportedly encountering problems, which have potentially arisen from manufacturing defects. The company also reported in September 2024 that it would no longer use its Intel 20A process technology in Arrow Lake processors and instead outsource Arrow Lake production to Taiwan’s TSMC, stating that “because of our early success on Intel 18A . . . [we are able] to shift engineering resources from Intel 20A earlier than expected as we near completion of our five-nodes-in-four-years plan.” While some may see this move as a setback, it may reflect a strategic shift to concentrate on the 18A process. Other observers have pointed out that “Intel 20A was always a bridge to the more refined Intel 18A.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shifts-in-demand&quot;&gt;Shifts in Demand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Intel’s main revenue sources have been chips for personal computers and for data centers, which in 2023 accounted for 80 percent of the company’s revenues. The market for these kinds of chips, however, is being affected by a shift in consumer demand toward graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) that support applications of artificial intelligence (AI) — a market in which Intel’s presence is relatively limited — plus increasing competition from rivals AMD and Nvidia. As a result of these shifts, the company’s revenues declined from $79 billion in 2021 to $54 billion in 2023. As of mid-August 2024, Intel’s shares were trading below the company’s book value for the first time since 1981.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gelsinger’s response has been decisive. In August 2024, in order to cut costs, he announced that Intel would reduce its workforce by 15,000 by November, suspend its shareholder dividend, and reduce or eliminate many employee perks. While the company’s stock price declined by roughly two-thirds between February 2021 and September 2024, recent turnaround strategy announcements have led to a modest rebound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security-implications&quot;&gt;National Security Implications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While recent accounts of Intel’s difficulties have mostly been confined to the business pages, the company’s future has broad national and global significance far beyond its employees and shareholders. Intel is a critical player in the U.S. government’s efforts to reduce dependency on chips manufactured abroad — notably the significant concentration of production in Taiwan — and regain leadership in semiconductor manufacturing technology. Both capability and capacity are needed to provide an alternative source for the most advanced chips and a more resilient supply chain for foundational chips essential to the automotive, telecommunications, and medical sectors. If Intel’s restructuring efforts fail, larger U.S. efforts are unlikely to achieve their objectives, with significant ramifications for U.S. national security and economic future. Indeed, as Geoff Colvin recently argued in Fortune, “Intel is no longer a conventional company and can no longer be evaluated as one. . . . it’s now a corporate actor on the geopolitical stage.” Policymakers must recognize Intel’s national security importance within this decade’s dramatically changed geopolitical environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intel-and-the-chips-act&quot;&gt;Intel and the CHIPS Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic led to disruptions across the U.S. semiconductor supply chain — most notably in the automotive industry — as well as volatility in other industries and supply chains involving PCs and data centers. While the causes of the shortage are complex, it highlighted the fact that when foreign supply is limited, the United States no longer has the domestic chipmaking capacity to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors which many products demand. Recognizing the national security and economic implications of this vulnerability, Congress enacted the CHIPS Act in 2022, which seeks to support U.S. chipmakers’ efforts to recapture technological leadership and to encourage the expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the United States. The CHIPS Act deploys a combination of federal grants, loans, and tax incentives for investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, as well as support for R&amp;amp;D and related workforce initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in late 2023, the Department of Commerce proposed a series of federal funding awards for companies undertaking capital investments in chipmaking. Intel is the provisional recipient of the largest single federal award package, reflecting both its centrality in the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem and the scale of its investments in chipmaking. The Department of Commerce’s Preliminary Memorandum of Terms (PMT) with Intel, announced in March 2024, included grants of up to $8.5 billion to help finance the construction, expansion, and modernization of wafer fabrication, advanced packaging, and development facilities in Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon. Additionally, the PMT provides up to $11 billion in federal loans to support Intel’s investments. The company also indicated that it would take advantage of the Department of the Treasury’s Investment Tax Credit for fab construction, which is expected cover up to 25 percent of qualifying capital expenditures undertaken by the end of 2026. Furthermore, Intel will receive $3 billion in additional CHIPS Act grants for a Secure Enclave program, which would ensure a protected supply of leading-edge chips for the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-central-role-in-growing-us-technological-capacity&quot;&gt;A Central Role in Growing U.S. Technological Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult to overstate Intel’s role in the success or failure of the CHIPS Act. Intel has been described as “the only U.S.-based company with leading-edge semiconductor fabs” capable of developing and manufacturing cutting-edge chips that are necessary to support advanced applications of AI at the 2 nm node and below. While Intel’s 3-nm production and below may be a year or more behind that of global leaders TSMC and Samsung (indeed, Samsung is apparently struggling with technical challenges itself), no other U.S.-owned semiconductor maker is in a position to reignite U.S. semiconductor manufacturing process leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the near-term cash flow concerns, Intel remains committed to its over $100 billion investment in new U.S. chipmaking capability and capacity over the next five years. No other large chip manufacturer is investing anywhere close to the scale of Intel’s projects in the United States over the same time frame. These plans necessarily require very high levels of capital expenditure, with payoffs only coming in the medium-to-long term. In early 2024, to raise the necessary capital, Intel sold a 49 percent share in its Ireland-based fab to Apollo Global Management for a sum of $11 billion. In addition, Intel has concluded a deal with Brookfield Asset Management, a major investment firm, to funnel $30 billion into two new chipmaking facilities in Arizona. Notwithstanding Intel’s internal layoffs and other setbacks, Gelsinger affirmed in August 2024 that the company remains committed to domestic manufacturing, stating that “Intel is prioritizing our core investments that are laying the groundwork for our future, and . . . our existing U.S. projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel’s ambitious manufacturing objectives rest on exceptional technological capabilities. Intel remains at the cutting edge of chip manufacturing innovation: its next process technology, Intel 18A, operates at the 1.8 nm node and is expected to compete directly with TSMC’s 2 nm “N2” process. Intel 18A combines multiple process innovations, from 3D hybrid bonding to nanosheet transistors to back-side power delivery. Intel plans to use 18A process technology in its own new server processor, Clearwater Forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;still-a-first-mover&quot;&gt;Still a First Mover&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its recent setbacks, Intel continues to be a first-mover on leveraging technologies that would bring it back to leading-edge manufacturing process leadership. Recently, Intel finalized a deal with the Dutch lithography equipment maker ASML to receive ASML’s first 2024 run of new state-of-the-art High-Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet (High-NA EUV) lithography machines. High-NA EUV lithography further shortens the wavelength of the ultraviolet light used to etch nanoscale circuits, a crucial process for the next generation of lower-nanometer chipmaking. According to IBM, the ASML machines “can perform a new technique that could pave the way to developing and producing chips at nodes even smaller than 2 nm.” It is important to note these are not just plans. Intel received the world’s first High-NA EUV machine in December 2023, which was installed and calibrated in the spring of 2024 at the company’s technology development fab in Oregon. Moreover, Intel is slated to receive a second machine in late 2024 and, according to reports, has committed to buying ASML’s entire 2024 run of High-NA EUV tools, giving it a head start on deploying this new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Intel’s principal competitors, TSMC and Samsung, are also making investments in U.S. chipmaking under the CHIPS Act, their new fabs will only represent a small portion of each company’s capacity. TSMC and Samsung remain the national champions for Taiwan and South Korea, respectively, retaining essential know-how and R&amp;amp;D facilities in their home countries, whose governments have well-honed incentive strategies to nurture and sustain leading-edge chipmaking at home. They are responsive, first and foremost, to their own national ecosystems and the needs of their governments. Intel’s decision to pause new chipmaking investments in Europe underscores the limits foreign-owned chipmakers may set on their U.S. manufacturing operations and investments as markets, company strategies, and geopolitical concerns evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Intel were to bow out of CHIPS Act initiatives — whether by its own decision, a change in U.S. government policy, or the acquisition of the company’s foundry business by a third party not bound to the CHIPS Act — the act’s successful and timely implementation would be seriously jeopardized. The stakes are high, including for national defense; as writer Mackenzie Hawkins recently pointed out in Bloomberg, “Intel’s woes may . . . jeopardize the government’s ability to reach its policy goals, which include establishing a secure supply of cutting-edge chips for the Pentagon and making a fifth of the world’s advanced processors by 2030.” Finding a U.S.-headquartered replacement to maintain domestic ownership of Intel’s higher-end fabs or to preserve its technological know-how would be nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As veteran chip industry analyst Dan Hutcheson succinctly put it, “The purpose of the Chips Act was partly to make sure we kept Intel as an American company supported by the American government.” The Biden administration appears to recognize this: The Financial Times reported in September 2024 that Intel and the U.S. government were on track to finalize negotiations on the $8.5 billion grant contract by the end of the year, which “would amount to a vote of confidence in Intel by the U.S. government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with Intel’s negotiations with the Commerce Department, reports have surfaced that Samsung, Apple, and the fabless design firm Qualcomm are considering taking a stake in Intel or acquiring the company outright. It is not clear that these or other similar reports have much substance. In September 2024, Intel reportedly rebuffed an overture from UK-based, SoftBank-owned Arm Holdings to acquire its product division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an acquisition of Intel, or pieces of it, by another major chip firm would unquestionably face antitrust scrutiny in the United States and possibly elsewhere, as well as a likely challenge by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) if the investor were foreign. At the very least, takeover of any part of Intel’s business could disrupt the delicate negotiations between the company and the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the stakes in this global contest, it is unfortunate that the negotiations over Intel’s CHIPS Act funding continue to become more complex, with the CHIPS Program Office reportedly requiring commitments beyond those outlined in the act, and which some suggest are more akin to those required for private equity investments than for a congressionally mandated grant program. Overly stringent government requirements, though designed to ensure CHIPS Act funding meets the program’s goals, could paradoxically compromise Intel’s ability to utilize the grants. For example, Politico recently cited concerns from a number of CHIPS Act recipients that government negotiations are both slow and expansive with conditions on the CHIPS Act awards that have little to do with ensuring the success of the projects. While recognizing the obligation to meet statutory requirements, more than two years after passage of the CHIPS Act, the Commerce Department has yet to distribute major funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ensuring-intels-continued-us-manufacturing-presence&quot;&gt;Ensuring Intel’s Continued U.S. Manufacturing Presence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, having Intel continue as an innovative, internationally competitive U.S. semiconductor manufacturer is a matter not only of economic interest, but of national security. The release of near-term CHIPS Act funding is becoming more important, especially given the scale of Intel’s investments and its ongoing financial difficulties. In response to potential further delay — attributed to the slow disbursement of federal aid — in Intel’s $28 billion Ohio project, Governor Mike DeWine has requested that the Biden administration expedite the necessary funding to Intel. However, the new fabs funded by these grants will not generate significant revenues until 2027, exposing the company to cash-flow challenges in the interim. One recent industry analysis commented that “Intel’s continued struggle begs the question: will the U.S. government need to do more?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the government concur with the assessment that Intel is not too big to fail but too good to lose, there are major recent precedents for federal policy measures to shore up companies whose collapse would bring unacceptable national costs. For example, the 2008 financial crisis posed an existential threat to large U.S. financial and manufacturing companies; confronting the prospect of imminent calamity, the Bush administration implemented the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), providing $426 billion in federal support to stabilize financial and manufacturing institutions, including failing U.S. automakers, that were considered “too big to fail.” TARP was not designed to subsidize or nationalize struggling companies, but rather to give them an interim financial bridge, allowing them to remain solvent while working toward profitability and continuing to serve as pillars of the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Should the government concur with the assessment that Intel is not too big to fail but too good to lose, there are major recent precedents for federal policy measures to shore up companies whose collapse would bring unacceptable national costs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, TARP was executed at scale in several affected industries. In December 2008, the Bush administration announced a $17.4 billion rescue loan for U.S. automakers. President Bush later recalled that he “didn’t want history to look back and say, ‘Bush could have done something but chose not to do it.’” Incoming President Barack Obama defended Bush’s action as a “necessary step to avoid a collapse in our auto industry that would have devastating consequences for our economy and our workers.” Obama augmented the Bush administration’s financial support for U.S. auto firms with federal outlays eventually totaling about $80 billion. Washington subsequently recovered most of these funds, with the net cost to taxpayers amounting to about $10 billion. No major U.S. automaker disappeared during the crisis, and the Big Three auto manufacturers remain a key element in today’s domestic manufacturing economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar measures were extended to ailing financial institutions under the Treasury Department’s 2008 Capital Purchase Program (CPP), which exchanged financial assistance for preferred stock in the companies, along with debt securities and warrants to purchase common and preferred stock. Under the CPP, the Treasury Department acquired $205 billion worth of shares to shore up troubled financial services firms over the short term, of which $200 billion was eventually redeemed by those same institutions. The purpose of the CPP was to enable financial firms to continue supplying essential levels of liquidity to the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;avoiding-disaster&quot;&gt;Avoiding Disaster&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of TARP was to avert a second Great Depression, which could have been triggered by the collapse of the U.S. financial and manufacturing sectors. It not only succeeded but did so at what proved to be a bearable cost to the government. A 2022 Congressional Budget Office study observed that “the U.S. financial system was in a precarious position when the TARP was created, and the transactions envisioned and ultimately undertaken entailed substantial financial risk for the federal government. Nevertheless, the TARP’s net realized costs have proved to be near the low end of the range of possible outcomes anticipated at the program’s outset.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the specifics of TARP and the CPP fortunately do not align perfectly with Intel’s current challenges, Intel’s current operational problems have important parallels with the crisis of 2008:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intel is the central player in the government’s implementation of the CHIPS Act, which is critical for national security and economic well-being. The company could benefit a great deal from federal support to surmount a cash flow pinch in 2025–26, when its new fabs begin to generate revenue in 2027 and beyond. The goal of such a cash flow would be to provide financing to enable Intel to keep the construction and investments on track while signaling a commitment to the company’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Semiconductor manufacturing is not a waning industrial sector. The demand for advanced chips is robust, due in no small part to the AI boom. The question is not whether the sector is viable, but who will lead its production and reap the rewards, including the revenue necessary to fund the next round of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Without Intel’s continued participation, achieving the CHIPS Act’s main goals — reestablishing American technological leadership in high-end chip manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign chipmakers — will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The demand for advanced chips is robust, due in no small part to the AI boom. The question is not whether the sector is viable, but who will lead its production and reap the rewards, including the revenue necessary to fund the next round of innovation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-could-it-be-done&quot;&gt;How Could It Be Done?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional federal support for Intel should be envisaged on both national security grounds and to favor domestic R&amp;amp;D investment. This support could come in various forms: an extension of the CHIPS Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit; the extension of additional loans and loan guarantees; targeted tax measures; and other similar measures taken under TARP and CPP. If the Big Three automakers and major U.S. financial institutions were deemed “too big to fail” in 2008, Intel can be similarly considered “too important to fail” in today’s increasingly perilous geopolitical environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the CHIPS Act has been instrumental in laying the groundwork for increased U.S. manufacturing capacity, the existence of new facilities does not guarantee their effective utilization. The U.S. government should thus consider how it can build on the foundational work of the CHIPS Act by focusing on strengthening the domestic supply chain. For example, targeted tax measures that provide incentives for the consumption of U.S.-produced wafers could not only help ensure the best possible return on new manufacturing facilities, but also encourage the building of additional capacity once the CHIPS Act incentives run out. Policies to help onshore the semiconductor supply chain will help to ensure that U.S. development and production of advanced chips is prioritized, thus encouraging periodic technological upgrades and even enabling the co-location of technology developments that are critical to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some will point out — correctly — that government support is inconsistent with traditional laissez-faire principles, historical precedent shows that national security concerns have overridden such principles during major crises such as World Wars I and II, the Cold War, and the 2008 financial crisis. Indeed, Washington has consistently taken steps to invest in and nurture key industries relevant to defense and health (including major investments in vaccine manufacturing during the Covid-19 pandemic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar fears regarding the semiconductor industry’s competitiveness prompted significant federal investment and trade measures in the 1980s, when the U.S. chip industry was at risk of losing technological leadership. Major government investment, matched by the private sector, helped form the successful Sematech research and manufacturing consortium, which enabled the U.S. chip industry to regain competitiveness. Now, the future of Intel — the linchpin of the CHIPS Act — cannot be left to the vagaries of the market, especially one shaped and conditioned by other countries’ industrial policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;perspectives-from-abroad-policies-of-allies-and-competitors&quot;&gt;Perspectives from Abroad: Policies of Allies and Competitors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry means it must make substantial investments to maintain and improve production capacity during economic downturns for the eventual recovery in demand. Semiconductor companies require significant capital to maintain their production capacity. To address these industry characteristics, leading manufacturers abroad often receive both direct and indirect government support, frequently on a massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not new. The world’s leading semiconductor foundries, TSMC and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), were both established with the support of the Taiwanese government when they spun off from the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Since 1991, as the foundry concept gained traction, TSMC has experienced rapid growth as the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, acquiring unparalleled expertise and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SK Hynix, one of the leading South Korean companies in advanced memory semiconductor manufacturing, is now a successful company despite sustaining major losses in the past following sharp declines in DRAM semiconductor prices that began in the mid-1990s. Pressured by the South Korean government, Hyundai Electronics Industries acquired LG Semicon, and their semiconductor division spun off as SK Hynix in 2001. After the spin-off, Hynix faced severe financial pressures from a heavy debt load and low DRAM prices. To restore the firm’s viability, a consortium of private and national financial institutions implemented a comprehensive support program, including debt forgiveness, equity conversion, credit limit expansion, debt maturity extension, and interest rate reductions. Hynix is now a profitable and competitive company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This policy approach remains relevant today. The Japanese government recently allocated $1.3 billion to Kioxia Holdings, Japan’s leading memory semiconductor company, which experienced very significant losses in 2023 primarily due to a cyclical downturn in demand for memory chips. Continuing to address the firm’s financial challenge, the Japanese government has recently allocated $1.3 billion in support of the company. This funding could stabilize Kioxia with the broader goal of ensuring Japan maintains its technological leadership in NAND flash memory, supporting a robust supply network to meet future market demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these examples suggest, government policies have often played, and continue to play, major roles in shaping the industrial landscape in semiconductors. Today, many of the world’s leading countries are actively promoting domestic production. Like the United States, these nations are backing their domestic chipmakers with public support for investments in R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing capacity. What is clear, however, is that these governments will not allow these key national enterprises to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, reflecting both the China challenge and new efforts of countries such as the United States, policies to support semiconductor manufacturing within national borders have increased in scale and frequency. This list of recent government investments in key domestic manufacturing companies illustrates the scale of financial support for firms in this strategic industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;France:&lt;/strong&gt; In June 2023, France announced that it would allocate $3.1 billion in public funding to its most advanced semiconductor manufacturer, STMicroelectronics, to build a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Crolles, in partnership with U.S.-based GlobalFoundries. STMicro, regarded as one of the most innovative firms in Europe, has benefitted from extensive state support since its formation under government auspices in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Japan:&lt;/strong&gt; After taking a largely laissez-faire approach, the Japanese government concluded it could not be economically secure without production of advanced semiconductors, particularly those used by its auto industry. Since 2022, in a major national initiative, the Japanese government has allocated $6 billion to Rapidus, aiming to establish this government- and privately-owned company as the flagship of Japan’s “ambition to catch up in semiconductor manufacturing.” Additionally, the company is expected to receive additional private bank loans and subsidies in its ambitious bid to produce cutting-edge chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Korea:&lt;/strong&gt; Samsung and SK Hynix are engaged in discussions with the Korea Development Bank (KDB) about utilizing a low-interest loan program, valued at $12.3 billion, which is aimed at bolstering the semiconductor industry. SK Hynix will again seek government support, reportedly applying for a loan amounting to $2.1 billion. More broadly, South Korea recently enacted the “K-Chips Act,” a major program with significant incentives to promote national high-tech industries, notably semiconductors. The architect of the “K-Chips Act,” a former Samsung executive, sees the stakes as fundamentally shaping national trajectories, emphasizing that “the winner of the global chip battle will control the economic security order, while the loser will end up becoming a technological colony.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; China offers perhaps the leading case of government support for the industry. At the end of 2022, the Chinese government was reportedly planning to spend $143 billion over the next five years to support its semiconductor industry. In 2022, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) received $282.1 million. This continues the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (the “Big Fund”) to support investments in China’s semiconductor value chain, including production capacity, equipment, materials, and advanced packaging. In May 2024, China launched its third semiconductor “Big Fund,” a $45.7 billion investment vehicle to support the country’s domestic semiconductor industry. This figure is roughly on par with the CHIPS Act but more narrowly focused in that these resources will likely primarily benefit Huawei’s chip design and SMIC’s chip manufacturing. These new measures augment China’s already-massive government support for the country’s chip sector, including direct subsidies, preferential loans from government banks, and equity infusions, as well as subsidies from regional and municipal governments involving land, electrical power, and infrastructure. The ability to domestically develop and produce advanced chips is a top priority for China’s leadership, and this comprehensive strategy reflects that commitment. The collective effort of these programs dwarfs the support offered by other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiwan:&lt;/strong&gt; Even in Taiwan, arguably the leading center of semiconductor manufacturing today, the government has recently stepped in to provide support. In January 2023, Taiwan enacted its own version of theCHIPS Act that “offers investment tax credits of 25% on R&amp;amp;D and 5% on equipment.” This introduced the country’s largest-ever tax deduction for R&amp;amp;D expenses and related capital investments in semiconductors, designed to benefit eligible semiconductor companies such as TSMC that meet specific criteria. These incentives complement the special benefits that Taiwan grants for research and manufacturing organizations located in science and industrial parks, which include, according to a Boston Consulting Group report, “relatively low-cost access to land, water, electricity, and infrastructure, as well as the possibility of expedited approvals and the elimination of import and export duties.” These multifaceted measures reflect the long-term commitment of the government to ensuring the continued success of its leading firms and the country’s central position in this global industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies confront an unparalleled strategic challenge from China that has the potential to escalate. In any such confrontation, leadership in and access to advanced semiconductor technology — and the AI systems these innovations enable — will play a central role and could even be decisive. Numerous recent analyses conclude that China is investing heavily in the sector and is rapidly gaining on the United States in strategic areas of microelectronic production, a dynamic that raises major national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Successful and timely implementation of the CHIPS Act is a critical step to addressing that challenge and deterring conflict — and that cannot happen without Intel.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful and timely implementation of the CHIPS Act is a critical step to addressing that challenge and deterring conflict — and that cannot happen without Intel. Accordingly, the U.S. government needs to be proactive, make CHIPS Act resources available as soon as possible, and accept that while there will always be risks, speed and compromise are crucial to achieve the CHIPS Act’s central goals. More broadly, the Departments of Commerce and Defense need to begin using existing tools, contracting mechanisms, and authorities — such as OTA — to support Intel through its current transition and not wait until Intel’s financial position slows its progress and further erodes the country’s competitive position. Prompt and strategic action must be taken to bring the objectives of the CHIPS Act closer to reality. Implementing an array of supportive measures beyond the CHIPS Act would also be a powerful way to underscore that the government wants Intel, and the semiconductor industry, to thrive and grow for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing countries across the globe are installing or upgrading their digital infrastructure. But choosing a telecommunications vendor involves weighing factors such as cost, efficiency, quality, and security. The Covid-19 pandemic drove home the importance of connectivity and secure networks, over which information on e-commerce, education, financial services, and health — as well as national security — must pass. China has initially taken the lead in this sector by providing telecommunications solutions and financing primarily to countries in the Indo-Pacific and Africa. Meanwhile, the United States has fallen behind in addressing this important infrastructure gap. The United States and its partners have the financial and technical tools to provide safer and cost-effective technology to help bridge the digital divide in the Global South, where competition for high-quality digital infrastructure plays into broader great power tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States and its partners have the financial and technical tools to provide safer and cost-effective technology to help bridge the digital divide in the Global South, where competition for high-quality digital infrastructure plays into broader great power tensions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-high-risk-network&quot;&gt;A High-Risk Network&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) features an initiative that is quickly becoming the country’s most prolific and impactful infrastructure investment: the Digital Silk Road (DSR). The DSR encompasses investments in wireless networks, surveillance cameras, subsea cables, and satellites; it is primarily financed and constructed by state-owned banks and companies such as Huawei, Hengtong, HMN Technologies, Hikvision, Dahua, and BeiDou. The bulk of China’s DSR contracts are with Indo-Pacific and African countries, where companies like Huawei are providing affordable mobile phones, cloud computing, and other types of hardware. Huawei Marine Networks, now known as HMN Technologies, has spearheaded subsea cable network infrastructure. In the last decade, the company has completed 108 projects that have amounted to an estimated 60,000 kilometers of subsea cable; roughly 16 of those projects are in 27 countries in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies also have a significant stake in the 5G wireless networks around the world. Huawei and ZTE have engaged in nearly 160 projects in Africa, Asia, and Europe, providing network equipment and infrastructure. Recipient countries have so far welcomed these investments, namely for the speed at which the projects are implemented — but also for the price. Due to Chinese government subsidies, Huawei and ZTE can offer below-market rates, with Huawei offering as much as 30 percent below typical costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report by the European think tank MERICS, Chinese companies are also involved in providing products in the e-governance, online education, and telehealth sectors. Huawei and ZTE have implemented these projects — predominantly in Africa and Central Asia — with more financing from the Chinese government than from local governments, multilateral development banks, and G7 countries combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has consistently raised security concerns about China’s digital technology investments, citing questions of national security, cybersecurity, personal security, and intellectual property, as well as the potential for authoritarian nations to surveil their own citizens. Some countries have heeded this advice; telecom carriers in Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have replaced Chinese equipment with technology from low-risk vendors, or vendors that adhere to agreed-upon standards on privacy, data collection, surveillance, and intellectual property. The United States and many countries in the European Union have signed onto the Prague Proposals, which call on countries to select carriers and providers that will prioritize safe and secure 5G networks and communication technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;offering-an-alternative&quot;&gt;Offering an Alternative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The countries that have signed onto China’s BRI and the DSR are doing so for several reasons. A primary motivation is to address critical infrastructure gaps by providing digital connectivity. The Covid-19 pandemic emphasized this need, underscoring its importance to nearly all aspects of daily life for individuals, companies, and governments. The BRI and DSR have stepped into this gap to provide something the United States and its allies have not. Typically, information and communication technology (ICT) projects are approved, deployed, and financed much more quickly by China than they would be through a G7 development bank. Approvals by the latter institutions often are bogged down by long feasibility studies, risk assessments, and other considerations. China, by contrast, offers a more streamlined approach: loans, construction companies, and equipment, all from one source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners have struggled to provide an alternative to the DSR; however, in recent years, Washington has established agencies, initiatives, and partnerships to prioritize ICT projects overseas, including investments in wireless networks, Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) technology, surveillance cameras, subsea cables, mobile handsets, and satellites, as well as systems upgrades from 2G and 3G to 5G and beyond. But there are multiple avenues available for additional policies to increase export and development finance of these technologies by trusted suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-mexico&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study: Mexico&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Over a decade ago, Mexico reached an inflection point in the development of its digital strategy and connectivity policies. Its experience offers both an example of best practices and a cautionary tale.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2013, Mexico implemented a constitutional reform that created the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) and the Federal Economic Commission for Competition (COFECE). Both are independent regulators and antitrust authorities with very broad powers. This was born out of a larger reform process in the telecommunication and broadcasting sectors that took place in Mexico and in Latin America more broadly. The reforms reviewed and updated the legislative frameworks and institutions created in the 1990s to boost competition after market liberalization during that decade. As in many Latin American markets, fixed-line telephony in Mexico was provided by the state-owned operator, Teléfonos de México (Telmex), until the early 1990s, when the government gradually divested its assets to national and foreign investors. In 1995, the Mexican government passed the landmark Federal Telecommunications Law (LFT), opening all market segments for competition and removing geographic limitations for fixed and mobile telephony networks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The IFT promotes and regulates competition and the efficient development of telecommunications and broadcasting, in accordance with its constitutional mandate and the 2014 Federal Law for Telecommunications and Broadcasting, LFTR, as well as the 2014 Federal Law for Economic Competition. The COFECE is responsible for overseeing, promoting, and guaranteeing competition and free market access in Mexico. The COFECE has a board that consists of seven commissioners; a Technical Secretariat that analyzes the market and its competitiveness; a strategic planning and institutional evaluation coordinator; and an internal comptroller that oversees COFECE officials.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Upon the creation of the IFT, Mexico licensed new national broadcasting networks, designated officials to evaluate carriers and operators, introduced rules for unbundling Telmex, and created a public registry of licenses. Since its creation, IFT has been viewed as a credible authority; as a result, prices have decreased and competition has increased. There are now dozens of new local broadcasting licenses in radio and television, including for indigenous communities. Mexico’s internet penetration rate stood at 83.2 percent of the total population at the start of 2024, up from 44 percent in 2013. In 2015, AT&amp;amp;T undertook a series of local acquisitions, and the U.S.-headquartered company now comprises 16 percent of the market for mobile telephone operators. In December 2021, AT&amp;amp;T Mexico announced it intended to launch a 5G network using its 2.5 GHz spectrum, making it the first mobile network operator in the country to build such a network.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite a more competitive ICT market, domestic politics have hindered and threatened progress. Most concerning has been the chipping away of IFT’s independence and operational ability. When former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador entered office in 2018, he sought to undermine the independent IFT. Since February 2022, the agency has operated with only four of its seven presiding commissioners, as President López Obrador refused to nominate any more. This has left the agency without enough commissioners to operate effectively; losing another would render it completely inoperable. The IFT’s budget has also decreased by roughly 41.1 percent since 2014, hampering its ability to implement its mandate. Additionally, the government has set high spectrum fees, which has undercut telecommunications operators’ ability to expand broadband connectivity, particularly in rural areas, and undermined IFT’s efforts to license more spectrum. The country also remains plagued by anticompetitive tendencies, despite the efforts of the IFT and COFECE.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mexico has stood apart from its Latin American peers in creating and implementing one of the most sophisticated telecommunications regulations. But, before concluding his term, former president López Obrador sent to Congress an initiative for constitutional reform that would disappear IFT and COFECE and assign their responsibilities to different ministries within the executive branch. This initiative is waiting to be analyzed in Congress. In order to build on the progress of the 1990s, Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, will have to undo Obrador’s efforts and reinstitute the authority of these bodies, while also ensuring they are protected from political winds. Mexico is an excellent case study of how a country can succeed in building an effective and laudable regulatory infrastructure and have it subsequently come apart due to politics.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-resources&quot;&gt;U.S. RESOURCES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has established new agencies and tools in recent years to help promote and support U.S. technology — particularly ICT — abroad. These efforts can be further honed to more effectively support U.S. and partner initiatives in the developing world, as well as private company engagement in this sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the bipartisan Better Utilization of Investment Leading to Development (BUILD) Act to support and finance investments in emerging economies and to boost national security and foreign policy priorities in critical markets. The BUILD Act combined the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Development Credit Authority (DCA) to form the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). The DFC has stated that encouraging ICT investments in low and lower-middle-income countries is a key priority for the agency. The agency can provide loans, loan guarantees, equity financing, political risk insurance, and technical assistance to support investments in the telecom industry; it can only work on private sector projects, not ones supported by the public sector. However, the DFC is limited in working in networks that include high-risk vendor equipment. According to the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, U.S. financing agencies investing in networks with this type of equipment must get a waiver from the head of the relevant executive agency or from the Director of National Intelligence and must have a phase-out plan to “rip and replace” the high-risk vendor equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC and its predecessor OPIC have undertaken several ICT investments in the past two decades, including a network acquisition in the Pacific Islands; renewable power for cell phone towers in Nigeria and the Central African Republic; telecommunications infrastructure in Myanmar; and, in Jordan, infrastructure to provide a critical interconnection point for an internet cable system connecting Europe and Asia. In 2018, the DFC also provided $100 million in financing to Africell for the expansion of affordable mobile voice and data services in The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as upgrades to network equipment in these countries to accommodate increased traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (EXIM)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXIM has been mandated by Congress to enact its China and Transformational Exports Program (CTEP) to help U.S. exporters facing competition from China, particularly in the fields of AI, wireless communications, and fintech. Established in 2019, CTEP is expected to counter export subsidies and finance provided by China, advance U.S. leadership, and support U.S. innovation, employment, and technological standards. Exporters can take advantage of EXIM’s reduced fees, extended repayment tenors, and exceptions from other EXIM policies to get financing on transactions with at least 51 percent U.S. content. However, to date there have been no ICT deals financed through CTEP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, EXIM can also provide loans, loan guarantees, and insurance for the purchase of goods and services shipped or invoiced from any country to facilitate U.S. exports for 5G-related transactions. EXIM has lowered its U.S. content threshold. But the creditworthiness of potential in-country private sector partners has remained a key challenge in many instances, particularly in countering opaque Chinese lending practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (CHIPS Act) of 2022 authorized billions of dollars for funding to the Departments of Commerce, Defense, and State to develop onshore domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. It also included appropriations to fund the USA Telecommunications Act to support the global telecom supply chain and counter the expansion of Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE. Provisions from the CHIPS Act are meant to further U.S. software advantages and to develop the Open Radio Access Network (ORAN), which would allow for a more interoperable telecommunications model and enable alternative vendors to enter markets for specific network components, rather than competing with end-to-end packages offered by companies like Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act provides $1.5 billion through a Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund to the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), in coordination with other agencies, to support investments in ORAN, developments of software-based wireless technologies, and funding for “leap-ahead” innovations in the U.S. mobile broadband market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Department of State&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act allocates $500 million over five years to a new International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund, which gives money to the Department of State to provide for international information and communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities, including to support the development and adoption of secure and trusted telecommunications technologies, secure semiconductor supply chains, and other emerging technologies. The State Department can use the fund for its own programming but can also allocate money to USAID, EXIM, and the DFC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the fund has been less on ICT and more on semiconductors. Funding has gone to new hires at the State Department and to partnerships with Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines, and Vietnam to explore opportunities to grow and diversify the global semiconductor ecosystem. In a March 2023 press release, the State Department communicated that $40.7 million in fiscal year 2023 ITSI funding would be used in the ICT space to provide capacity building training as well as technical advice on policy formulation and regulatory frameworks, cybersecurity tools, financing, project preparation support, and other investment de-risking measures to catalyze private sector investments in secure ICT networks, including field testing and pilot deployments of ORAN networks. The full scope and scale of these investments are not yet clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USTDA provides financial tools to support the export of U.S. goods and services for priority infrastructure projects in emerging economies. USTDA funds project preparation, feasibility studies, and partnership-building activities. Though it is typically involved on the front end of projects, USTDA has also financed ICT-related initiatives in the Indo-Pacific and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the agency awarded a grant to NOW Telecom Company to conduct a feasibility study and pilot project to support the development of a nationwide 5G mobile and fixed-wireless network in the Philippines. The company chose New Jersey-based Bell Labs Consulting, part of the research arm of Nokia, to conduct the study. The USTDA also awarded a grant to Malawian internet service provider Converged Technology Networks Limited (CTN) to conduct a feasibility study on the expansion of digital connectivity to underserved communities in the country. CTN selected California-based Connectivity Capital LLC to conduct the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID provides grants and technical assistance for an array of programs across the digital sector. In June 2022, the agency launched its Asia ORAN Academy as part of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy. The academy brings together officials and representatives from the private and public sectors, as well as academia, with an expectation to expand its initial work in the Philippines to the rest of the region. As of June 2024, USAID was in final negotiations to open an ORAN Lab at the University of the Philippines’ Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute. USAID’s Better Access and Connectivity (BEACON) Activity is also engaging the Philippine government and industry leaders in the country through a series of workshops and trainings on field testing and through the adoption of legislation and regulations that facilitate ORAN deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID is additionally engaged in the Digital Invest initiative, also launched in 2022, which works with investment partners to increase the ability of companies to qualify for commercial funding. Digital Invest provides an average of $500,000 per partner for investments related to resilient digital infrastructure, increased digital inclusion, and stronger economic development. Digital Invest partners have backed over 60 technology companies across 38 countries, with projects ranging from the expansion of broadband connectivity infrastructure in Liberia to a digital payment platform in Uzbekistan to a fund supporting female investors and tech founders across South and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Office of Strategic Capital (OSC)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly created OSC, established in 2022 within the Department of Defense, is mandated to mobilize and scale private sector capital. Its Fiscal Year 2024 Investment Strategy outlined its initial target priorities, which include ORAN as both a part of the DoD’s FutureG and 5G critical technology area and a mandated field in the FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. The OSC’s complete suite of financial tools is still under development, but at this time, it can provide direct loans for capital investment and equipment finance. These loans range from $10 million to $150 million, with long repayment tenor. The OSC announced its first Notice of Funding Availability in September 2024 and will be considering applications through the rest of the fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-partnerships&quot;&gt;GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. partners and allies have established several initiatives through the G7 to address critical infrastructure needs. In each of these, digital connectivity — particularly in the Indo-Pacific, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America — is a core part of cooperative engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The G7 partners announced PGI, known then as Build Back Better World, at the Carbis Bay summit in June 2021. This effort was intended to counter BRI and target critical infrastructure to support health care, gender, climate, and ICT. The United States has set the goal of mobilizing $200 billion in investments over the next three years as part of the larger $600 billion target made by the G7. Much of PGI’s focus has been on developing economic corridors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Angola, and the Philippines’ Luzon Corridor. Yet there have been few announcements on digital connectivity, which suggests that there is more to be done in this sector through this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, as part of PGI, Africa Data Centers received a $300 million loan from the Development Finance Corporation to construct data centers throughout the continent. The DFC, EXIM, USAID, and USTDA also announced they would build on DFC’s existing financing for Africell in Angola, the DRC, The Gambia, and Sierra Leone (all part of the Lobito economic corridor) to support the expansion of wireless services and a digital payments initiative. Additionally, in the DRC, USTDA and USAID announced the provision of programming and financial support for last-mile connectivity and ORAN equipment for the piloting of U.S. firm Parallel Wireless with Vodacom DRC in five villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trilateral Infrastructure Partnership (TIP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TIP is a partnership between the DFC, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation ( JBIC), Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), and Export Finance Australia (EFA). TIP partners are looking to cofinance infrastructure projects mainly in the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia. Though there are few projects under the TIP banner, two are in ICT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TIP’s first project has been the Palau spur, an approximately $30 million construction project for a subsea fiber optic cable to the Republic of Palau. The project is to connect to a DFC-financed subsea cable, the world’s longest, which stretches from Singapore to the United States. In May 2023, the TIP partners announced their support for the Australian telecom company, Telstra, in its acquisition of Digicel Pacific. The JBIC and DFC provided $50 million each in credit guarantees for EFA’s $1.33 billion financing package to support the acquisition. Telstra’s move is expected to further Digicel’s delivery of high-quality telecommunication services to more than 2.5 million subscribers in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga, and Nauru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad — Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — is also engaged on the ICT front and has announced ICT projects in the Pacific Islands, including on subsea cables and ORAN technology. At the Quad Leaders’ Summit in May 2023, the partners announced the establishment of the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, with the aim of bringing together public and private sector actors to address gaps in this type of infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this partnership, Australia is to establish a new Indo-Pacific Cable Connectivity and Resilience Program to share best practices and provide technical assistance to Indo-Pacific governments. The United States is providing technical assistance and capacity building on subsea cable system security through its $5 million CABLES program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partners also announced a cooperation with the government of Palau and the Palau National Communications Corporation (PNCC) to design, implement, and operationalize the deployment of ORAN capabilities. The USTDA is expected to fund a technical assistance grant to scope the size and scale of the project. This announcement marked the first planned deployment of ORAN technology in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Coalition on Telecommunications (GCOT)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCOT was launched in October 2023 by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Japan to increase cooperation and coordination on shared priorities such as telecommunications supply chain diversification and open network architectures, as well as the building of a broader international consensus on key areas of telecommunications policy and the promotion of innovation and growth opportunities in the sector. The U.S. Departments of State and Commerce are the key agencies involved in this initiative. There have been few details or updates since its launch nearly a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector&quot;&gt;PRIVATE SECTOR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major player in the promotion of diversity in digital equipment is the private sector. Private companies can both benefit from government support and mobilize their own capital and resources to be more competitive. One key argument from host countries is the lack of alternatives to Chinese or other high-risk providers for affordable and speedy installation of technology. However, the European Union, United States, Japan, and South Korea have a host of companies available for partnership that share similar values on information security, intellectual property, and high-quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies are identifying tools to de-risk markets and promote private sector mobilization and have worked with local governments in the developing world to create enabling environments for high standards of investment, but these efforts still lack the speed and the push for U.S.-based companies to invest. More engagement between the U.S. government and private sector is needed in order to implement tools to support U.S. companies and meet host government needs in faster and more transparent ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-india&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Case Study: India&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;India is at its own inflection point as it pushes to further its already impressive digital public infrastructure (DPI) efforts, attempting to expand resources and connectivity to more than a billion people. There are opportunities in the market, including in ORAN, but preference for competitive local telecom and ICT companies, as well as some skepticism around ORAN, may hamper major headway.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A part of India’s success so far is its regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). TRAI was established in 1997 with the objective of creating a fair and transparent market and pushing the country toward more connectivity. India now has the second-largest wireless and wireline subscriber base in the world: 1.72 billion, as of March 2023. India’s teledensity — the number of telephones per 100 population — stood at 84.15 percent as of March 2023, an increase of 10 percent in a decade. The prices of SIM cards and cellular data have also fallen significantly, allowing many more people to access mobile phone technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Within India, local talent and capable companies have enabled the country to create a strong foundation in data systems. Since India’s DPI endeavor, the country has created a data technology structure known as the “India Stack,” which consists of three different layers: unique identity (Aadhaar); complimentary payments systems (Unified Payments Interface, Aadhaar Payments Bridge, Aadhaar Enabled Payment Service); and data exchange (DigiLocker and Account Aggregator). The layered system enables secure online, paperless, and cashless digital access for a variety of public and private services.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The usage and benefits speak for themselves. United Payments Interface accounts for 68 percent of all payment transactions in the country. As of February 2024, more than 12 billion transactions are completed every month through UPI. In 2020, with this system in place, the Indian government was able to provide pandemic assistance and a platform for vaccinations. Government reports note that the use of digital payments has expanded the customer base of smaller merchants, which in turn has built a record of credit and cash flow, improving access to finance. In 2009, nearly 400 million Indians lacked a unique identity record, but Aadhaar’s campaign to bring about a national ID succeeded in covering roughly 95 percent of the population by 2022. Japan’s NEC, a company with extensive experience in biometric identification, laid the groundwork for Aadhaar with technologies such as facial and fingerprint recognition. DPI has also benefited government coffers: an estimated 8.8 million new taxpayers were registered between July 2017 and March 2022. Citizens can access documents issued by the central and state governments through one platform, which has streamlined bureaucratic procedures and services. The stack has digitized and simplified Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, lowering the compliance costs to banks using e-KYC from $12 to $0.06. The biometric system ensures that people cannot assume fake identities and that banks have access to reliable and secure data, both of which contribute to the lowering of compliance costs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Even with a strong foundation, India is looking to expand its digital infrastructure to more users in rural and unconnected areas. It is considering ORAN offerings to see if that approach would be cost effective, high quality, scalable, and secure. Official bilateral and multilateral exchanges on this topic are ongoing; Indian national security advisor Ajit Doval and his U.S. counterpart, Jake Sullivan, have discussed engagement in the ORAN space, and the topic has been included in Quad summits. India and the United States have also launched the Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) initiative, which promotes cooperation between the private sector and research and scientific institutions in both countries to advance next-gen technologies such as AI, telecom, ORAN, quantum computing, semiconductors, and space innovation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;India has already taken steps toward using ORAN technology in its own industries. In 2023, Tata Consulting Services and Tejas Networks formed a consortium to upgrade 4G and 5G networks; TCS will be the system integrator for the entire telecom network, while Tejas will be responsible for equipment and radio access network (RAN). Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has also traveled to the United States to pitch U.S. companies on partnerships with Indian companies that have investment and implementation experience in 4G, 5G, and ORAN, as well as 5G core, mobile edge cloud solutions, base stations, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and 5G smartphones. Indian telecom companies Airtel and Reliance Jio have supported ORAN; Airtel has reportedly conducted a trial of the technology and has signed a deal with U.S.-based Mavenir for its deployment to 4G and 5G sites in low-revenue-generating rural areas, with an initial target of 2,500 sites (to be scaled up to 10,000). Reliance Jio is also developing its own ORAN stack.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Questions remain around costs and scalability. Indian telecom market watchers have queried whether ORAN works for the higher configurations used for 5G networks by Indian telecom companies, noting that they find the technology neither cost effective nor mature. Scalability and feasibility are issues as well. The country head of Mavenir for India has said that he initially expected ORAN deployments to surge, but that the Indian market has proven to be one of the most complex in the world for ORAN rollouts due to a large user base, high population density in cities, and diverse terrain and temperature conditions. India’s more challenging geographic areas may be a better fit for basic 3G, 4G, or 5G infrastructure. Additionally, there are concerns around technology fragmentation; India has benefited from a global standard in which the whole country is integrated. Issues around equipment “super cycles” are also a concern, as each new technological upgrade — from networks to smartphones — comes with its own specialized equipment. With the advent of AI and the likelihood of related technologies emerging, there will need to be significant public and private investment in managing super cycles; most governments, particularly those in developing countries, will need to attract or support that investment in order to both manage the demand for new devices and technologies and build workforce capacity. Finally, questions remain around the viability of ORAN. Some experts would like to see a larger country like the United States pilot and deploy ORAN on a large scale before India undertakes such an effort. To skeptics, ORAN’s unproven elements seem risky for a billion-person country that is looking to keep costs down, integrate systems seamlessly, and ensure safe and secure connectivity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations-for-the-united-states-partners-and-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;Recommendations for the United States, Partners, and the Private Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications technology, including ORAN, is a strategic asset that can enable not only innovation and dynamism through competitive markets (including but not limited to ORAN), but also control, surveillance, and repression (including through closed systems with predatory vendor lock-in). As the United States and its partners work to build out telecommunications networks in the developing world, both the technologies themselves and the regulatory frameworks must be centered around principles of interoperability, security, and openness. Each stakeholder has a role to play to create an enabling environment for good governance and standards, creating the conditions for mobilizing private sector capital and providing safe and reliable access to connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the United States and its partners work to build out telecommunications networks in the developing world, both the technologies themselves and the regulatory frameworks must be centered around principles of interoperability, security, and openness.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Guiding Principles for Secure Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Governing frameworks and values are as important as technology itself. Governments are working to shape these frameworks as innovations emerge and new security concerns manifest alongside them. The Prague Proposals, PGI, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement, and others offer guidelines for trusted, safe, and secure networks. Development and export finance institutions of the United States and its allies should embed these principles in their financing operations. CSIS’s own criteria, the CSIS Criteria for Security and Trust in Telecommunications Networks and Services, also provides a foundation for shared principles and could complement the work of the Prague Proposals and the European Union’s 5G Toolbox. The criteria are designed to help governments and network owners and operators to determine trustworthiness and security. They provide a framework to assess potential suppliers and to implement domestic policies to safeguard telecommunications networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximize Coordination and Financial Resources among U.S. Agencies and Development Partners:&lt;/strong&gt; With the infrastructure finance gap widening and need soaring, DFC, EXIM, and partner development finance and export credit agencies need to work through existing mechanisms such as IPEF, TIP, and the Quad to maximize funds and extend reach. Cofinancing is notoriously difficult, but examples exist in which partners have seen more success when making specific contributions amid a broader project lifecycle, rather than trying to provide general support. Agencies and countries have different strengths that can be applied at various stages. Pooling funds to target specific and focused investments are another way for partners to utilize capital on shared objectives and in regions of shared interest. For example, at the recent Indo-Pacific Business Forum (IPBF) in Singapore, member countries announced the IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund to support the expansion of a clean economy infrastructure project pipeline in the forum’s emerging and upper-middle-income economies. Australia, Japan, Korea, and the United States contributed $33 million in grant funding, with a goal to generate up to $3.3 billion in private investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform or Expand EXIM’s CTEP to Support Partner Telecoms:&lt;/strong&gt; As CSIS recommended in the report, “The U.S. EXIM Bank in an Age of Great Power Competition,” released this year, CTEP should be more flexible and should include companies interested in participating to be exempt from the EXIM policies that can limit investor competitiveness. EXIM so far has come up short in maximizing CTEP, hampered in part by its requirement to ensure that loans will have a “reasonable assurance of repayment” and its 2 percent loss default ratio cap. To prevent EXIM from self-selecting out of deals and to allow it to take on greater risk (and thus be more competitive), the default cap should be raised in critical industries or on projects that fall under the CTEP umbrella. In line with this, EXIM should lower content requirements for financing. This would allow more U.S. and partner-country companies working in complex supply chains to get more involved in building trusted networks. Some U.S. companies have no choice but to source from abroad, which limits their ability to qualify for EXIM financing. Reasonable conditions for dropping content requirements, particularly for the sake of competitiveness and the promotion of trusted vendors, would almost certainly help the CTEP pipeline and U.S. businesses. The world has changed dramatically in the last 40 years: most supply chains are now global, and competitive manufacturing is a worldwide enterprise. In the same report, CSIS highlighted the U.S. Government Accountability Office’s 2012 report stating that EXIM’s domestic content requirements were too stringent compared to those of other G7 export credit agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Resources on Key Strategic Markets:&lt;/strong&gt; The ITSI fund and other pledged financial commitments are too small given the necessary financing needed to address the digital infrastructure gap. Focusing these funds in geographies and on technologies in which markets and offerings such as ORAN can be piloted and tested would be a better way to provide proof of concept and could later attract further public funding and mobilize private sector capital. Simultaneously targeting a large market such as India or Indonesia, a medium-sized market such as Kenya or Brazil, and a smaller market such as the Pacific or the Caribbean would offer a way to test different geographies, legal and regulatory systems, and population needs. This would provide lessons on successes and obstacles, as well as a road map for scaling up or moving to similar markets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Matchmaking Opportunities and Promote Alternatives:&lt;/strong&gt; Host countries and local businesses should work through organized business forums and initiatives to solicit public and private sector funding. Initiatives like PGI and relevant government departments and agencies — such as the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, DFC, and EXIM — should work with local chambers of commerce and other business and trade organizations to establish such forums where they do not exist or strengthen those that do. An example to emulate is the recent IPBF that kicked off the Singapore IPEF Clean Economy Investor Forum. The forum acted as a matchmaker between investors and projects as well as a platform for sharing expertise and best practices in climate-related investments. The forum showcased $23 billion in sustainable infrastructure initiatives in IPEF-member economies — $6 billion of which belong to reportedly shovel-ready projects — to investors and interested governments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain Leadership on R&amp;amp;D and Deployment:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly all initiatives and funds, including ITSI, have capacity building and technical assistance components. U.S. departments and agencies should offer training opportunities and foster an ecosystem of players involved in testing and integrating their interfaces and equipment, thus ensuring the openness and interoperability of ORAN solutions and other digital infrastructure efforts from trusted providers. This could build on some of the announced projects from the ITSI Fund, PGI, and IPEF, which include funding testing and integration centers, publishing reports and hosting conferences on proofs of concept, organizing workshops to develop and exchange ideas on new technologies, and helping operators test and verify the interoperability of ORAN equipment from different providers. This would be the first step in bringing down the costs of implementing ORAN and helping telecom companies scale their operations in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster Accountability in Major Initiatives:&lt;/strong&gt; The Quad, PGI, IPEF, and other initiatives have all announced major projects and deliverables at summits, conferences, and leader visits. While announcements are relatively easy, implementing projects and maintaining them amid changing political leadership is harder. An accountability tracker that measures the status of announcements and the impact of such initiatives should be put in place to ensure these projects get off the ground and that there is some way to measure if they are viable. This tracker will provide valuable data on government commitments, lessons learned, and the impact of projects on host communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote Good Governance and Transparent Regulatory Regimes:&lt;/strong&gt; Businesses often cite corruption and the lack of regulatory transparency as major hindrances to investment in developing economies. Much of this governance work has been done in capacity building programs through USAID and in initiatives like IPEF. The Fair Economy pillar has made significant progress; in a June 2024 IPEF ministerial meeting in Singapore, members announced measures to provide technical assistance and capacity building for fighting financial crimes like money laundering and terrorism financing, promote inclusivity in law enforcement on anticorruption efforts, and develop and implement anticorruption policies and measures. Ongoing efforts at the government-to-government level, as well as engagement with the private sector, will build on this foundation to establish a better environment for high-quality projects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries across the globe are at an inflection point in deciding the course of digital infrastructure plans. Some are looking to emerging technologies, ensuring their digitalization plans take into account future developments and anticipate the necessary equipment, providers, and workforce. Others are working to ensure that rural communities are connected and can receive important services that foster economic and social development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, any digital infrastructure plan must consider the importance of having a safe, secure, and trusted network. Short-term price and deployment considerations are important, but there are real long-term consequences to hosting personal, business, and government digital traffic on high-risk vendor equipment. The United States and its partners and allies must recognize the need for speed and affordability in host country decisionmaking and make the case that their provisions are a viable alternative. The foundation for doing so exists, but the road map calls for more focus and consistency, as well as further monitoring of results to track accountability and proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
