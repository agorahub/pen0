  &lt;li&gt;法官提醒陪審團 指污點證人有強烈誘因作供、有機會作假冤枉被告&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ib6TDiF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（16日）踏入第74日審訊。控辯雙方已完成結案陳詞，法官張慧玲開始引導陪審團。張官提醒，3名污點證人有強烈誘因協助控方作證，他們希望獲減刑，故有機會剪裁證供，甚至作出虛假證供，冤枉被告牽涉本案，因此陪審團需謹慎處理其證供。張官又指，陪審團毋須考慮是次檢控是否公平，並提醒「唔好畀自己個人嘅同情或者偏見影響，要用持平中肯嘅態度」。張官亦指，串謀者毋須以書面或正式的形式達成協議，可用身體、語言、手勢或動作等達成協議，其中3個情況則不屬參與串謀，包括：對串謀不知情、無意圖加入串謀、「詐諦」加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陪審團需考慮被告是否128計劃的串謀者&quot;&gt;官：陪審團需考慮被告是否12.8計劃的串謀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方已完成結案陳詞。法官張慧玲開始引導陪審團。張官指，2019下半年由於政府想修改《逃犯條例》，引發一連串社會事件，包括：遊行、示威、非法集會及暴動，當中亦有堵路及投擲汽油彈等破壞行為出現。而本案是關於12.8事件，有人串謀用炸彈及槍對付警察。控方指稱其中一名主謀是吳智鴻，他為一個無名組織的領導者，該組織負責準備槍械及炸彈。而另一組織「屠龍」，黃振強則自稱為隊長，並指他們會作「勇武」行為如投擲汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據證供所指，在12.8串謀之中，吳及其成員會將一大（12kg）及一小（8kg）炸彈放置軒尼詩道，即民陣遊行路線的一部分。而「屠龍」成員則負責「裝修」以引警察到細炸彈，並將他們推向大炸彈。槍手蘇緯軒會在大廈的高處以步槍射殺警察，然後各人會到場「執槍」。由於事前警方「收到風」，故串謀最終未有實行。警方在串謀當日的清晨6時拘捕部分被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱，本案首4名被告為「屠龍」成員，最後兩名被告則屬無名組織，上述6人均屬串謀者之一。第七被告劉佩凝則被指透過眾籌作恐怖主義活動。辯方的立場則指各被告沒有參與串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官提到，陪審團需考慮各被告是否12.8計劃的其中一個串謀者，而劉是否串謀籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為。張官指，舉證責任在於控方，被告無責任證明自己清白。陪審團負責考慮相信哪些證人的證供，本案共有31名控方證人，以及兩名辯方證人，當中包括選擇作供的李家田。張官指，就每名證人，陪審團可選擇相信部分或全部證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官污點證人有誘因協助控方有機會作假證供冤枉被告&quot;&gt;官：污點證人有誘因協助控方、有機會作假證供冤枉被告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官指，本案其中3名串謀者以「污點證人」身份作供，包括黃振強、彭軍壕及蘇緯軒。3人已認罪，承認自己是12.8串謀的一份子。張官提醒陪審團必須緊記，3人有強烈誘因協助控方作證，他們是希望獲得較輕判刑，最高可獲50%折扣。3名證人有可能會剪裁證供，甚至作出虛假證供，冤枉被告牽涉本案。因此，陪審團需要謹慎處理他們的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，由於黃及彭獲律政司的豁免起訴書，若他們誠實作供的話，即使其證供透露自己曾參與暴動及縱火等行為，亦不會遭起訴。張官表示，對兩名證人而言這屬於利益、「有著數」，或驅使他們作虛假證供，以免失去豁免起訴的保障。張官再次提醒陪審團要謹慎處理他們的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陪審團毋須考慮檢控是否公平勿被個人同情影響&quot;&gt;官：陪審團毋須考慮檢控是否公平、勿被個人同情影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官又指，陪審團毋須考慮律政司是次檢控是否公平，「唔好考慮點解告佢哋」，亦毋須考慮其他涉案者的去向。張官又提醒，「唔好畀自己個人嘅同情或者偏見影響，要用持平中肯嘅態度」考慮本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官串謀者毋須書面正式協議詐諦加入並不屬參與&quot;&gt;官：串謀者毋須書面正式協議、「詐諦」加入並不屬參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官解釋控罪的元素，以及控方需要證明甚麼。就首6名被告被控的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，及其交替的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪。張官表示，不能兩罪同時成立；若陪審團認為首罪不成立，就要考慮第二條控罪是否成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，張官指根據條例，本案控罪之「訂明標的」是指「公用場所」，串謀者計劃將炸彈擺放於灣仔軒尼詩道，明顯是公用地方。而本案的炸彈亦屬於控罪所指的「爆炸性裝置」，這點並不受爭議。另外，控罪亦要求控方證明被告是有「非法理由」作出此行為，並有意圖導致他人死亡或身體遭受嚴重傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控罪中的「串謀」，則需要證明有兩個人或以上達成犯罪協議。串謀者必須有意圖達成協議，而自己可促進犯罪目的。串謀者毋須以書面或正式的形式達成協議，可以用身體、語言、手勢或動作等達成協議。一旦協議達成，即使事後退出亦屬犯罪。串謀協議達成之前的商討，則可用作證明協議的存在。張官表示，有3個情況則不屬參與串謀，包括：對串謀不知情、無意圖加入串謀、「詐諦」加入串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不能以本案其他行為對被告有偏見&quot;&gt;官：不能以本案其他行為對被告有偏見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官總結，就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀謀殺」罪及「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪；控方需要證明4個元素，包括串謀協議肯定存在、協議是與控罪上的其他人達成、被告有意圖達成協議，以及被告或其他人打算將協議付諸實行。張官提到，就「串謀謀殺」罪，控方必須證明被告有意圖殺死他人，而非只是令其身體受嚴重傷害。張官最後指，陪審團需要決定串謀是否存在，以及被告是否屬串謀一方。張官又指，案發時被告沒有犯罪紀錄，其可信性較高，犯罪傾向性較低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官亦指，庭上證供顯示被告曾參與其他示威行為，但這些是「不被控告的行為」，只屬背景，不能作為對被告不利的揣測，亦不能因此對被告產生任何偏見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件下周一（19日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense industrial capacity commands increased attention among like-minded allies and partners around the globe in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The war has highlighted the need for defense industrial resilience in the West, given the rapid depletion of matériel and the limits on surge production capacity that have illuminated fragile defense supply chains. Meanwhile, the security environment in the Indo-Pacific region has continued to deteriorate. China’s coercive actions around Taiwan and across the East and South China Seas, combined with North Korea’s repeated provocations, are clear reminders that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,” as Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio famously said in a speech in June 2022. The United States and its allies, including Japan, have demonstrated a shared commitment to enhancing defense cooperation and promoting broader networks of security cooperation. Developing a more robust and resilient defense industrial ecosystem is a key element of this common strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this worsening regional security environment, Japan has taken unprecedented steps to strengthen its defense posture, with significant increases in defense spending and plans to acquire advanced capabilities, including long-range counterstrike. It is also taking steps to enhance defense cooperation with the United States and other partners, such as Australia and the Republic of Korea. As part of this broader strategy, Japan has identified strengthening its defense industrial base as “virtually defense capability itself.” Strengthening the defense industrial base dovetails with U.S. defense strategy, which also stresses the importance of building a resilient defense ecosystem and collaborating with allies toward that end. The Department of Defense’s (DoD) first National Defense Industrial Strategy includes supporting “a resilient defense industrial ecosystem among the U.S. and close international allies and partners” as one of its four strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan has taken unprecedented steps to strengthen its defense posture, with significant increases in defense spending and plans to acquire advanced capabilities, including long-range counterstrike.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeper defense industrial cooperation requires deliberate investment and planning, and it can take several forms, including codevelopment and coproduction of complete systems at the high end and supplying subcomponents to a shared system at the low end. The former is the hardest to achieve, given the need to identify common requirements and align technology and manufacturing capacity in a way that benefits both countries. Cooperation in integrating supply chains of subcomponents is often a more practical approach. The challenge in both cases is identifying appropriate opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) are an increasingly important capability where both the United States and Japan are making investments to counter new and existing threats. The U.S. Replicator initiative, which aims to field large numbers of small drones on a rapid timeline, is an innovative approach to counter China’s defense industrial scale and mass. Japan is focused on the critical need for UAS, necessitated in part by a declining population that is impacting manpower in the Self-Defense Forces. Japan’s Ministry of Defense (MOD) has announced a plan to invest JPY 1 trillion (USD 7.1 billion) over the next five years to develop uncrewed systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the subcomponent level, electro-optical sensors have become one of the largest needs for both the consumer and defense markets. They are critical components for weapons and platforms (including for long-range precision targeting, consistent radio communications, automation networks, cryptanalysis, etc.), but capacity shortages have limited their production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from the MOD’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency (ATLA), the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) conducted a study to explore avenues for enhancing U.S.-Japan defense equipment and technology cooperation, with an emphasis on UAS and electro-optical sensors as potential targets of opportunity. The methodology included a literature review of analysis on the two case study topics; reviews of government policy documents; case studies on previous examples of bilateral cooperation, as well as international trade data; and interviews with experts at nine U.S. and Japanese companies with relevant expertise. The team also held two private research workshops to discuss opportunities and challenges with a broader range of industry participants. The interviews and workshops were held under the Chatham House Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report starts with an overview of Japan’s defense industry. It next briefly summarizes the history of U.S.-Japan defense industrial cooperation and then presents the two case studies, examining current challenges in the industrial supply chain and assessing how Japan can best plug in to the U.S. defense ecosystem. The report also addresses structural impediments to U.S.-Japan cooperation and concludes with insights that can assist in overcoming those barriers to support the strategic objectives of both governments and help build a more robust and secure defense supply chain globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-overview-of-japans-defense-industry&quot;&gt;An Overview of Japan’s Defense Industry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following World War II and the introduction of Japan’s postwar constitution in 1947, the Japanese defense industry essentially collapsed. The war-renouncing clause in the constitution (Article 9) and Japan’s decision at the outset of the Cold War to prioritize economic development over investments in the military limited the development of Japan’s domestic defense industrial base (DIB). Throughout the Cold War, Japan focused on a policy of “exclusive self-defense” (senshu bouei), relying heavily on the United States for its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan introduced strict restrictions on arms exports as part of its postwar policies. The Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology, adopted in 1967, limited arms transfers by prohibiting exports to communist countries, countries subject to embargoes under UN Security Council resolutions, or countries engaged in or likely to be engaged in international conflicts. Japan imposed additional restrictions in 1976 that virtually prohibited arms exports, a policy that was sustained with little change for the next 40 years. These limits on exports were combined with policy that limited Japanese defense spending to about 1 percent of GDP. Consequently, Japan’s defense industry relied exclusively on the government for contracts to support the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), a small market that was adequate for meeting Japan’s defense needs but prevented the development of a robust and competitive defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, concerns about the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs and China’s rapidly advancing military capabilities prompted the Japanese government to place a renewed emphasis on defense. The government issued National Defense Program Guidelines in 1995, 2004, and 2010, all of which emphasized enhancing defense cooperation with the United States. Japan released its first National Security Strategy in 2013, adopting a more ambitious strategy aimed at further strengthening Japan’s defense capabilities — albeit still within the framework of strict 1 percent limits on defense spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Japan had previously taken modest steps to enable defense industry cooperation with the United States, during this period it began to ease broader restrictions on defense exports for the first time. In 2012, Japan introduced modest measures to allow exports of equipment for peacekeeping operations and participation in international joint development and production of equipment. In 2014, under the leadership of Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, Japan revised its policy to allow exports in several categories of non-lethal equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This history of limits on exports, combined with relatively small budgets centered on equipment for self-defense, has long limited opportunities for bilateral cooperation. Nevertheless, there have been a handful of high-profile bilateral projects. Most significant was collaboration in jointly developing the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) Block IIA ballistic missile defense interceptor that began in 2006. Japan also collaborated with the United States on the F-35 stealth fighter through in-country final assembly and maintenance of aircraft, as well as production of some components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release of Japan’s second National Security Strategy in December 2022 — and the attendant increases in defense spending and support for the defense industrial base — signaled a new era of opportunity in defense industrial cooperation. In December 2023, Japan further eased export rules to allow exports of complete systems manufactured under license, in addition to the export of parts and components. Restrictions on the categories of equipment approved for export (largely limited to nonlethal systems) remain in place, however — a factor that will constrain opportunities in the near term, absent broader reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-for-japans-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Challenges for Japan’s Defense Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s defense industry has a structure unique among advanced economies. As a result of the history described above, there are no dedicated defense “primes” in Japan. Rather, defense manufacturing is centered on a limited number of large industrial conglomerates for which defense is but a small share of overall business. The four major Japanese defense companies — Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), Fujitsu, and Ishikawajima Heavy Industries (IHI) — have secured positions on the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) list of top 100 defense companies worldwide, but the broader landscape reveals a more mixed story. Until recently, Japan’s defense industry risked entering a spiral of decline. Over 100 smaller enterprises that support the major firms have withdrawn from the defense industry since 2003, according to the MOD, and even some larger enterprises have cut back on defense business. For example, Sumitomo Heavy Industries recently halted machine gun production, while Komatsu discontinued armored vehicle development for the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors have contributed to this trend. As noted, limits on defense exports mean that the JSDF has been the sole customer for most of these companies. Japan has lacked state-run defense facilities and relies solely on the private sector to manufacture defense equipment for the JSDF. Low demand and meager profits mean that returns on investment were too low for Japanese companies to stay in the defense market: other nations’ defense companies enjoy operating profit margins exceeding 10 percent, while Japan’s defense industry remains at only 2–3 percent. Legislation passed in 2023 attempts to directly target these deficiencies and will be addressed further below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decline of Japan’s defense industry has been a source of deep concern in the Japanese government, which prompted the focus on strengthening the industrial base captured in the new National Security Strategy. The MOD has publicly recognized that the challenge with incentives “not only interferes with the stable procurement of defense equipment essential for the SDF operations, but also causes the loss of proper competitive environment and innovation in the long term, resulting in losing its ground on Japan’s technological superiority in security.” Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensuring that Japan’s defense industry remains capable of meeting national security needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-partnership-experience&quot;&gt;International Partnership Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defense industries of partner nations can contribute to their common defense in multiple ways. One is cooperative development, where common requirements lead partner governments to collaborate on complete systems. A second example is one in which a contractor in one nation serves as the lead integrator of a system and brings in companies from other nations to provide subsystems or components. Two recent examples of U.S.-Japan partnership are summarized as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SM-3 Block IIA, jointly developed by Raytheon and MHI, is an example of cooperative development. Japan agreed to fund roughly half of the project and manufacture critical missile components for use by both countries. The approach of “component compartmentalization” had the benefit of featuring clean dividing lines between each country’s contributions, with each government managing their respective industry partner and managing the budget for their portions. This approach to joint acquisition reflected constraints on policies and practices in place at the time, but kept industry-to-industry engaement at arm’s length. Future joint acquisition programs seem more likely to follow the precedents now being set by Japan’s participation in the Global Combat Aircraft Program (GCAP) and the Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is Japan’s participation in the F-35 fighter jet program. Though not one of the founding partners of the F-35 consortium, Japan “is acquiring the most [F-35s] of any international customer.” MHI operates a F-35A Final Assembly and Checkout (FACO) facility, where it conducts maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade (MRO&amp;amp;U) activities for Japanese and U.S. aircraft in Japan. Japanese companies, including MHI, Mitsubishi Electric (MELCO), and IHI Corp., manufacture radar parts, electro-optical distributed aperture system (EODAS) components, and engine parts for Japan’s F-35 fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While policy restrictions in areas such as export control and information security impacted the implementation of F-35 production and support in Japan, its eventual success now provides important operational as well as industrial base benefits for both countries that could be expanded further in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;revitalizing-japans-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Revitalizing Japan’s Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the SM-3 Block IIA and F-35 programs, Japan has a long history of manufacturing U.S.-origin equipment under license. Some examples include the F-15J (manufactured by MHI), the CH-47J Chinook (manufactured by KHI), and the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) air and missile defense interceptor (manufactured by MHI). Japan has exported components of both earlier PAC-2 systems and the F-15 engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these efforts, however, Japan has a thin record of international cooperation on defense equipment; it has recently introduced a range of new policies and regulations to strengthen its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defense Buildup Program, released along with the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy in December 2022, set out capability priorities for Japan’s buildup over the five years from 2023 to 2027. One of seven priorities listed in the buildup program is uncrewed systems, including “utility/attack UAVs and miniature attack UAVs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan has a thin record of international cooperation on defense equipment; it has recently introduced a range of new policies and regulations to strengthen its defense industrial base.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan subsequently enacted new legislation in October 2023 to enhance its defense industrial base. The new law aims to achieve three key priorities: ensuring national security independence, bolstering deterrence, and contributing to domestic industries through technology spillover. To achieve this, the legislation emphasizes strengthening the DIB as a top priority while also importing technology and pursuing joint development. The focus extends beyond finished products to maintaining technological superiority and stable manufacturing of parts and components. As the policy states, “both prime contractors and suppliers are equally essential to stably manufacturing defense equipment.” The law provides for the government to take ownership of defense manufacturing facilities; provides subsidies to strengthen supply chains, as well as for investments in areas like enhanced cybersecurity; and provides funding to modify equipment for export. Although Japan’s approach places a heavy emphasis on indigenous development and production, it recognizes the vital role of collaboration with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on these steps, and after lengthy discussions among Japan’s ruling political parties, export policies were revised in December 2023 to allow exports of complete systems manufactured under license to the country of origin and other likeminded states. These modifications expanded the scope of nations eligible for importing defense equipment from Japan and also opened the door for the export of lethal weapons, though exports to nations involved in conflict are still barred. In March 2024, Japan’s ruling parties announced an agreement to allow exports to third countries of a new fighter aircraft to be developed with the United Kingdom and Italy under the GCAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-potential-to-expand-cooperation&quot;&gt;The Future: Potential to Expand Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These recent policy reforms are sparking change in Japan’s defense industry and increased interest in international partnerships. According to interviews with industry representatives conducted for this study, some Japanese firms are increasing capital investment in their defense businesses and assigning more personnel to the defense sector. Simultaneously, U.S. companies have noticed increased engagement from their Japanese counterparts. Some U.S. firms primarily involved in commercial manufacturing have shifted their focus toward defense discussions with Japan in the last two years. Other U.S. companies are closely monitoring developments in the Japanese regulatory system and contemplating increased collaboration with Japan across a range of products. These dynamics suggest an evolving landscape that could further advance U.S.-Japan defense industrial cooperation over time. Three current efforts in particular highlight the potential for expanded Japanese defense industry engagement in the international marketplace: GCAP, the GPI cooperative development program, and the Loyal Wingman drone project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL COMBAT AIR PROGRAM (GCAP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Italy announced a multinational initiative to develop a sixth-generation fighter. With the goal of introducing the aircraft into service by 2035 — an ambitious timeline — it is the first major program undertaken by Japan with a partner other than the United States. The three partners have established a joint program office to oversee the effort, but as of this writing, they have yet to finalize agreement on workshare for the project. The recent revision of Japan’s export policy was instrumental in allowing this project to go forward, as it projected confidence in Japan’s defense market potential. After intense internal negotiations, the ruling coalition in Japan approved GCAP exports to third countries but did not announce broader reforms; steps to allow exports of lethal equipment were set aside for the time being. If successful, GCAP could serve as a driver for broader defense industry reform and revitalization in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLIDE PHASE INTERCEPTOR (GPI) COOPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida announced plans to pursue joint development of a glide phase interceptor to counter the threat posed by hypersonic missiles. On May 15, 2024, the Missile Defense Agency and MOD finalized the GPI Cooperative Development Agreement. This project will strengthen industrial base capabilities in both countries to develop and produce advanced counter-hypersonic systems. While project management will resemble that used for the earlier SM-3 Block IIA missile, its workshare provisions reportedly allow for more direct industry-industry collaboration in sharing experiences related to all areas of missile development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LOYAL WINGMAN DRONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is also exploring cooperation with the United States and Australia on developing drones for military operations through the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. In a statement released after Prime Minister Albanese’s visit to Washington in September 2023, the White House announced an “intention to explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on Unmanned Aerial Systems. Our cooperation aims to enhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.” This would be the first time that these three nations worked together on a specific project. In April 2024, the U.S. Air Force selected Anduril and General Atomics to build “production representative” test CCA, the first phase of the project. Future rounds of CCA acquisition are expected to involve “most strategic” U.S. partners. Japan’s role in future CCA projects remains under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-one&quot;&gt;Case Study One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-to-uas&quot;&gt;Introduction to UAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncrewed aircraft (UA) is a blanket term for flying vehicles without a human on board. The nomenclature for these systems has evolved over time, with the term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) common in the past and then replaced by the term remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). The U.S. Air Force popularized RPA to draw attention to the non-autonomous nature of these aircraft; ultimately, a human is still designing, controlling, and operating these systems. Uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) is the latest iteration in terminology; in this report, it is used to encompass UA, UAV, and RPA. (Note that “drones” is another common term.) UAS refers not just to the aircraft itself, but also to the various subsystems and operating networks required for successful flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD categorizes UAS into one of five groups depending on speed, operating altitude, and weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-uas&quot;&gt;The Role of UAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS have been used for decades, initially for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). UAS can collect information in greater detail over longer periods of time than crewed aircraft. Uncrewed aircraft also require fewer personnel and have somewhat lower operating costs per hour. Other defense applications include early detection of enemy aircraft or missiles, as well as delivering weapons to targets, much like a piloted aircraft delivers a missile or bomb. UAS can also be used for suicide missions where they divebomb targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aUI4TEj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: UAS Systems Classification.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/18249&quot;&gt;U.S. Army UAS Center of Excellence, “Eyes of the Army”: U.S. Army Roadmap for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (Fort Rucker, AL: U.S. Army UAS Center of Excellence, January 2010)&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-threat-and-proliferation/missile-basics/unmanned-aircraft-systems-uas/&quot;&gt;“Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Basics,” Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, July 17, 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militaries also use UAS for close air support, cargo and resupply, and communications relay. UAS can replace certain crewed missions, including aerial refueling, air-to-air combat, strategic bombing, battle management and command and control (BMC2), suppression and destruction of enemy air defenses, and electronic warfare. Looking ahead, UAS experimental concepts include aircraft system-of-systems (SOS) development, AI-enabled manned-unmanned teaming (MUMT), mission support or “loyal wingmen,” autonomous dogfighting, swarming, and lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS). The Missile Technology Control Regime, of which both the United States and Japan are members, has been a brake on some UAS cooperation for larger systems, but U.S. reinterpretation of the regime in 2020 loosened these restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS also have commercial applications. Examples include capturing video from above (e.g., for data mapping or even filming scenes for movies), but the most common commercial use is in agriculture. Farmers use drones to monitor both livestock and water levels, in addition to producing imagery to analyze details of crop health. Today, Japan uses more than 3,000 drones for agricultural purposes. Other notable applications include disaster recovery and surveying land, and parcel delivery has also been explored as a use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS offer advantages over crewed aircraft. If UAS are shot down, no warfighter is harmed or lost. UAS are effective against certain targets where a mission using crewed aircraft would be more risky and costly. They can be harder to detect and destroy given their minimal signature, and they are generally less expensive to produce. Cost efficiency allows more UAS to be deployed and therefore support a higher volume of fire. This has proven to be very effective in the Russo-Ukrainian war, with Russia using inexpensive Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses before deploying cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAS are especially significant for missions that can be characterized as “dull, dirty, or dangerous.” “Dull” refers to lengthy missions that might be repetitive, such as long reconnaissance missions that do not need onboard pilots. “Dirty” refers to potential human exposure to chemical, radiological, or biological contamination. “Dangerous” missions are those that directly put operators in harm’s way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in the figure below, the worldwide demand for UAS has increased, placing a premium on capability to produce UAS at scale. This could create an opportunity for the United States to partner with other countries by leveraging industrial base strengths, which would mitigate U.S. production challenges and supply chain constraints. Japan’s industrial capabilities could be useful in efforts to fill gaps in U.S. industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-uas-demand-collaboration-and-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Japan’s UAS Demand, Collaboration, and Industrial Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has been relatively slow to adapt military drone technology, primarily using UAS for reconnaissance purposes. In years past, Japanese authorities assumed that because low-cost drones were unable to fly across the ocean, they would add little value to Japan’s national security. Attitudes now reflect increased emphasis on the importance of UAS to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) in particular. For example, UAS could prove crucial to improving Japan’s situational awareness around the Senkaku Islands. UAS, in addition to uncrewed maritime vehicles, are arguably critical in providing consistent and cost-efficient surveillance of these islands, which are under near-daily pressure from Chinese Coast Guard vessels. The uptick in Japanese UAS interest also reflects JSDF recruitment and retention challenges. UAS can help ameliorate this shortfall.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of Japan’s drone manufacturers produce commercial systems. Japanese companies that develop and produce UAS for military use tend to be bigger players, such as MHI, MELCO, and Subaru Corporation. The Japanese government has steadily begun to increase its investments in domestic UAS technologies. The MOD is seeking to develop combat UAS capable of “breakneck maneuvers,” with Subaru working on remote and flight control systems and MHI and MELCO developing information dissemination capabilities between aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Japanese government has steadily begun to increase its investments in domestic UAS technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength of Japan’s UAS manufacturing capabilities varies across application (commercial vs. defense) and class (Groups 1–5 listed in Table 1). Japan has historically invested in its smaller commercial drone market, leading to the emergence of Japanese UAS manufacturers such as Autonomous Control Systems Laboratory. In contrast, the United States mostly relies on imports from other suppliers, particularly China, for smaller consumer and commercial drones. The company DJI China controls more than 70 percent of the global drone market via its manufacturing of consumer and commercial drones. However, even commercial drones have proven to be dual-use technologies, and civilian drones made by DJI can be adapted for battlefield use, as has been seen in the Russo-Ukrainian war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-opportunities-for-us-japan-uas-industrial-collaboration&quot;&gt;Current Opportunities for U.S.-Japan UAS Industrial Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States plans for significant investments in UAS systems, but collaboration with international partners could prove challenging. One issue is specific to existing systems with heritage supply chains. Bringing new suppliers into the network, including international partners, can require significant costs for engineering, testing, and other inputs, and even with those investments the components would start higher on the production cost learning curve. New programs offer fresh opportunities for industry, including from partner nations, to compete to become part of the initial supplier landscape. The United States has initiated two relevant efforts that may yield new opportunities to join the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New programs offer fresh opportunities for industry, including from partner nations, to compete to become part of the initial supplier landscape.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;replicator-initiative&quot;&gt;Replicator Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the DoD launched the Replicator initiative, a program to “quickly scale and field thousands of attritable autonomous systems within the next 18 to 24 months, leveraging AI, robotics, and commercial technology.” This initiative seeks to better integrate emerging private sector technologies into the military’s operational framework; lower costs by deploying smaller uncrewed systems that require less maintenance; and overcome the “valley of death” — the period between developing a new technology and introducing it to market in a viable application where new technologies often run into obstacles and get interest and funding to make the transition to a program of record. Accomplishing these goals could prove challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. government acquisition approaches are often complex and lengthy, with additional delays not uncommon when projects include multiple contractors from the defense and commercial sectors. Once UAS requirements are set, another challenge may be preparing the U.S. industrial base for rapidly scaling UAS production, as the smaller U.S. UAS industry has spent years struggling to compete against lower-cost imports from China. As a military program, Replicator will lead to an increase in domestic production of small UAS, but the United States will need to leverage ally and partner capacity to help meet its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan can make a significant contribution to Replicator via its strength in manufacturing small, commercial UAS. Japanese industry can be leveraged to fill the gap in U.S. production and enhance interoperability, especially considering that Replicator’s initial purchases will be small UAS. U.S. capability gaps in two specific areas offer potential opportunities for Japanese engagement: increased survivability for UAS and high-volume small UAS production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent challenge for allies and partners in industry is understanding the Pentagon’s requirements and knowing where to pitch their capabilities — a challenge often shared by small businesses in the United States. The Pentagon will need to provide more granular detail in its plan for operationalizing Replicator to enable Japanese industry to effectively plug in. In addition to a more detailed directive of what capabilities it wants these UAS to possess, the DoD will need to provide actual contracts with funding. Japan could usefully emphasize the importance of DoD information sharing as a tool to better facilitate cooperative efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;collaborative-combat-aircraft-cca&quot;&gt;Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, CCA is a U.S. Air Force initiative designed for UAS to accompany crewed missions. These UAS are intended to act as a force multiplier to offer ISR support and additional offensive firepower capability to fifth- and sixth-generation fighters. The United States plans to field around 1,000 CCAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Force has stressed that there is no single model for CCA, and that a variety of aircraft can offer different capabilities. This opens the potential for nations to develop UAS that are compatible with the larger CCA program. Japan and the United States could direct collaborative efforts toward a CCA that (a) is useful for Japan’s strategic threat environment and (b) effectively and efficiently utilizes its industrial capacity, with specific emphasis placed on its component production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE POTENTIAL FOR COLLABORATION ON COMPONENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s industrial capacity and skills could prove valuable when considering international collaboration under CCA. Interviews with industry conducted for this project identified several areas of potential strength for Japan, including microelectronics, wiring boards, UNICORN radar system and other radar systems, disaster relief pods, calibration services, avionics boxes, engines, landing gear, and other electronic components. Japan also has advanced capabilities in maintenance, repair, overhaul, and sustainment of batteries, engines, and actuators. U.S. industry additionally highlighted Japanese strengths in software development and data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations-for-uas-cooperation&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations for UAS Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New programs should provide opportunities for allies and partners to engage and invest in UAS programs. However, there are potential roadblocks specific to UAS technology worth highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States has used operational experience to inform its product development. UAS have made critical contributions across a range of conflicts since the beginning of Operational Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001. This has allowed the United States to capitalize on a feedback loop of combat exposure and innovation. Japan, on the other hand, lacks the combat experience that could shape its design and development plans and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the MOD has directed money into UAS research and development (R&amp;amp;D) but has yet to make UAS a formal procurement requirement. The MOD’s R&amp;amp;D push has allowed Japanese efforts to focus on building out a broad set of Japanese capabilities rather than gearing toward a partner-first approach. This incentivizes Japanese industry to focus on redeveloping and domestically reproducing technologies — from land-based vehicles to undersea vessels — that already exist. This limits Japan’s ability to enter effective partnerships if the partnering nation already has those capabilities. A continuing instinct for indigenous development of new systems thus poses risks for the future competitiveness of Japanese industry in the UAS market. Based on interviews with industry conducted for this study, the Japanese government is not sending a strong demand signal for UAS production. Unless the Japanese government invests in its industry or subsidizes production processes, Japanese industry may remain hesitant to partner with U.S. industry — and U.S. industry will be less likely to pursue partnerships with Japanese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-two&quot;&gt;Case Study Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electro-Optical Sensors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introduction-to-eoir-systems&quot;&gt;Introduction to EO/IR Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) systems consist of visible and infrared sensors that help the user to operate in adversarial environmental conditions. The use of EO/IR systems enables warfighters to achieve higher battlefield awareness through ISR capabilities. Other defense applications for EO/IR systems include night vision devices, visible-light cameras, laser range finders, and more. EO/IR sensors provide real-time situational awareness and surveillance capabilities — detecting, tracking, and identifying potential threats — which supply critical information for military operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are generally two types of EO/IR sensors: non-imaging EO/IR systems (point targets) and imaging EO/IR systems (extended targets). Depending on the mission, one sensor may be more appropriate than another. A point target sensor operates by detecting energy emissions rather than imagery. For example, if an adversary launches a missile, a point target sensor will detect the immense energy emitting from the launch and relay that to the operator. Conversely, an extended target sensor will generate detailed imagery rather than a point of heat. Extended target sensors are often fielded on satellites, aircraft, and other optics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-eoir-systems&quot;&gt;The Role of EO/IR Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EO/IR applications are segmented by platform: land-based, air-based, and sea-based. The sea-based segment of the market is experiencing large growth as maritime assets are becoming a priority for operational plans, especially in the Asia-Pacific theater. Unlike the radar technology traditionally used by ships, which relies on emitting active radiation signals and waiting for a return signal, EO/IR sensors are passive and detect signals naturally emitted by objects. This passive operation is a key strategic advantage as it assists Navy ships in avoiding detection and prevents them from becoming targets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is upgrading MSDF vessels by incorporating advanced sensor systems to allow them to identify targets, detect and perform threat assessments, and support weapons engagement for both offensive and defensive engagements. One example is the advanced integrated combat information center developed by MHI for the new stealth frigate commissioned by the MSDF. Mitsubishi Electric supplied the radar and the EO/IR sensor. Another is the Shipboard Panoramic Electro-Optic/Infrared (SPEIR) system developed by L3Harris for the U.S. Navy to enhance fleet protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airborne platforms are a major user of EO/IR systems. The explosive growth in the use of small UAS for this and other purposes has propelled industry to design smaller EO/IR systems that can be fitted to these platforms and that can dissipate heat so as not to disrupt the function of the UAS. EO/IR systems provide significant improvement over visible light surveillance cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Land-based EO/IR systems have a multitude of applications such as night vision goggles; drone detection; target recognition, identification, and location; and laser terminal guidance. Systems are continually being upgraded as threats evolve. For instance, the U.S. Army is developing a self-contained Laser Target Locator Module III (LTLM III) that meets updated performance requirements for its next-generation laser target locator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-eoir-sensor-history-collaboration-and-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Japan’s EO/IR Sensor History, Collaboration, and Industrial Capacity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, Japan has developed its national sensing architecture to counter Chinese and North Korean threats and has produced EO/IRs under license or indigenously toward this end. The foundations for Japan’s sensor architecture lie in its technical cooperation with the United States. In 1980, the United States and Japan established a joint Systems and Technology Forum between the DoD and the then Japan Defense Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this cooperation, the United States was able to access Japan’s advanced technology base in electro-optics and other electronics. Figure 2 shows the length and depth of U.S.-Japan trade in dual-use EO sensors within the context of global U.S. trade in the same. Long a source of U.S. imports, the rough trade balance parity since 2009 speaks to Japan’s ongoing comparative advantage in this sector. In 1983, the DoD dispatched a team of senior scientists to assess Japan’s electro-optical manufacturing base and identify any technologies that could be incorporated into U.S. defense supply chains. The technologies flagged by the DoD analysts in 1983 eventually found their way into U.S. systems and were credited with supporting the United States’ success in the 1991 Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1980s, the development of advanced sensors has been a priority for Japanese defense. In 1988, Japan awarded contracts for the development of Aegis destroyers as a component of its efforts to develop a robust sensor architecture. In 1989, the JSDF united its disparate sensor and shooter systems under the auspices of the Base Air Defense Ground Environment (BADGE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UED8rc8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: U.S. Dual-Use Trade in Electro-Optical Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dataweb.usitc.gov/&quot;&gt;“DataWeb,” USITC, May 2024&lt;/a&gt;; and CSIS analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan eventually began to procure more foreign-designed sensor systems at the turn of the millennium, generally featuring licensed production arrangements that preserved the Japanese EO/IR industrial base. Among others, these systems included Northrop Grumman’s E-2C Hawkeye and the Lockheed P-3 Orion. Additionally, Japanese military electro-optical production coincides with the development of indigenous systems, such as the OH-1 light helicopter or armored vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s sensor architecture was further strengthened by the procurement of air defense systems and other “shooters.” The United States is Japan’s primary source of missile defense systems, but Japan has long manufactured (under license) Patriot missile defense systems for its own use. The recent announcement of the export of these systems to the United States represents the culmination of U.S.-Japanese strategic cooperation in developing Japan’s sensor-to-shooter architecture over the course of several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunities-for-industrial-collaboration&quot;&gt;Opportunities for Industrial Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has been cultivating an interconnected regional security architecture with Australian, Japanese, and South Korean engagements and with increased multilateral sensor information sharing. In December 2023, the United States, South Korea, and Japan finalized an agreement to share real time missile-warning data from their various sensor networks to strengthen trilateral monitoring of North Korean missile tests. All three states possess sensor capabilities which are arrayed against North Korea; with the agreement to share data in place, allied cohesion is substantially strengthened. These initiatives are strengthened by other networking and digital lines of effort. During Prime Minister Kishida’s visit to Washington in April 2024, the two governments announced plans for an integrated air and missile defense architecture with Australia in the years ahead. At the industry level, in January 2024, Northrop Grumman and MELCO signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a joint networking solution for Japan’s air and missile defense systems to leverage the sensor-to-shooter architecture to its fullest with efficient fire controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;japans-eoir-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Japan’s EO/IR Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s EO/IR industrial base is concentrated around the capabilities of a small group of enterprises, with Mitsubishi Corporation listed as the prime contractor for the majority of identified EO/IR records in the data. Along with final assembly, Japanese EO/IR production includes subcontractor participation, opening up the market for a broader range of opportunities. For example, MHI’s sensors may include circuitry and optics developed by the Nippon Electric Corporation. This characteristic of the Japanese EO/IR sensor industrial base is important when considering the possibilities and limits of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GRbjdlJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Japanese Manufacturers of EO/IR Sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Janes Defense Markets Forecast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leading prime contractor for Japan’s recorded EO/IR sensors is MHI — even factoring in traditional U.S. defense contractors. In fact, most of the identified U.S.-made sensors belong to technologies fielded on the F-35, the Mitsubishi F-2, and select naval vessels. Across the recorded platforms, advanced fire control capabilities consistently recur as U.S. exports to Japan. In CSIS’s interviews with industry representatives, a continuous frustration highlighted by Japanese interviewees was the lack of codevelopment opportunities for higher-end systems. Japanese interviewees asserted that Japan likes to codevelop with the United States and wondered why their workers could not be brought into certain programs that are relevant to their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A continuous frustration highlighted by Japanese interviewees was the lack of codevelopment opportunities for higher-end systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has gradually developed its EO/IR industrial base to match its security needs. These investments are unlikely to decrease, as the threats that prompted the development of Japan’s EO/IR sensor architecture persist. Japanese EO/IR producers have consistently plugged into either U.S.-produced or U.S.-licensed systems. As Japan begins to deepen its security role in the region and as its concepts of counterstrike continue to materialize, this field will remain important for bilateral and multilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-insights&quot;&gt;Key Insights&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing defense industrial cooperation is a stated goal of the Japanese and U.S governments, and the two nations are well positioned to work together. The nations have a Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA), which allows them to request priority delivery for defense items. They also have a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Agreement, which has benefits including some exemptions from “Buy America” provisions. The nations have a track record of working together successfully, including on the SM3 Block IIA missile, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and other programs. Collaborations include both the codevelopment of systems and the integration of Japan into the supply chains of systems designed and produced in the United States, experiences which provide a foundation for future work. In the course of this research, the authors identified both opportunities and challenges for defense industrial cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for cooperation is the urgency of the security environment. Both countries view China as the core national security challenge, and they share a common view that action is needed to sustain deterrence. That said, the recognition that “production is deterrence” will open up opportunities only if governments create funded requirements and issue contracts for specific items. While collaboration in the form of codevelopment requires the buy-in of both governments, individual governments can encourage — and even fund — domestic industry with the goal of building capabilities and capacities to help them compete for participation in global supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors found a number of sticking points that government action could potentially alleviate or reduce, either directly or by providing incentives to industry. Other challenges are more intractable; the role of government in those can be education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-policy&quot;&gt;Government Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: Increases in equipment orders and the need to increase production may create challenges for firms involved in Japan’s defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. industry recognizes the opportunities in Japan that stem from budget increases and revisions to defense export policy. Many Japanese companies in the defense sector are responding to these changes, and some are making substantial investments in facilities to allow them to increase production of dual-use or defense-specific items. However, these developments also create new challenges, particularly related to industrial capacity. For example, while the defense budget has increased, the overall size of the workforce at most companies has not, although some firms are reallocating personnel into the defense business. Japanese defense manufacturers have nearly exclusively sold to the domestic market based on a near-flat defense budget for over half a century, so the increase in orders from the MOD puts a strain on defense companies as they look to grow across the full scope of capabilities necessary for production. MHI may be an exception, as the company moves personnel from its commercial aircraft or commercial shipbuilding business into its defense business, but other companies are less well positioned to do this. The challenge is that no matter the strength of the present-day demand signal, Japanese companies may be cautious about making significant investments in growing capacity given the uncertainty of demand over the longer term. Investment that grows capacity also increases costs — and without sustained increased demand over time, a higher cost basis could make companies less competitive for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 2: Broader defense equipment export reform in Japan will be essential to advancing international cooperation and building a globally competitive Japanese defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The still-limited reforms to defense export policy, coupled with the increased spending on defense, have resulted in Japanese industry continuing its principal focus on supplying the JSDF. While legislative reform will serve to make this business more profitable in the short term, it will do little to improve the competitiveness of Japanese industry internationally. Japan’s attractiveness to U.S. industry as a partner will hinge on increased confidence that items codeveloped or coproduced can be exported to third countries, not to mention that Japanese regulatory policy will adjust to encourage this possibility — a prospect that remains limited today. The mixed messages sent by the Japanese government about the priority to be placed on defense equipment exports continues to send a chilling signal to both U.S. and Japanese industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 3: Japan’s lingering instinct for indigenous, national solutions for high-end capabilities poses obstacles for international cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are promising areas of international collaboration under Japan’s new policies — including GCAP, GPI, and CCA — there are also numerous examples of the MOD seeking to develop indigenous capabilities despite the existence of international options that could be adapted to meet Japan’s requirements. Examples include Japan’s ambitious simultaneous investments in multiple variants of the Type-12 cruise missile; extensive R&amp;amp;D funding for multiple classes of UAS; and the stated intent to develop an autonomous “kill-chain” architecture to support counterstrike capabilities, tied together with an indigenous C2 network. While every industrialized country seeks to preserve some degree of autonomy in defense production, this focus on indigenous development — a long-standing feature of Japan’s defense strategy — over existing international options risks inefficient use of resources, delays in capability delivery, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 4: Increased early engagement between both Japanese and U.S. industry and government would facilitate industrial cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are important opportunities for U.S.-Japan cooperation on the horizon, such as the CCA and the Replicator program as discussed above. Japanese domestic programs could in future iterations tie into a larger U.S. program, but this incorporation could be at risk if early steps are not taken to lay groundwork for future cooperation. The U.S. Air Force has announced its intention to cooperate with partner industries in the future with regard to the CCA and is understandably focused on getting the details of this global approach right. Cooperation would benefit from increased and consistent forward-leaning communication to government and industry leaders in both countries on what steps they should be taking now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic&quot;&gt;Economic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: U.S. industry often views international codevelopment and coproduction of new systems as more expensive than indigenous production and may be hesitant to pursue opportunities absent government incentives and encouragement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International codevelopment and coproduction have clear benefits from an alliance perspective, including interoperability and expanded defense industrial capacity, but the challenges need to be recognized up front so that strategies can be developed to overcome them. International cooperation adds complexity and costs to programs because of the challenges of coordination, including requirements setting, decisionmaking timelines, different resources and acquisition systems, and cultural variance. Interviews conducted for this project revealed that U.S. industry often views international collaboration on new systems as challenging, particularly when partnering with an international company for the first time. A U.S. company may judge codevelopment or coproduction with a Japanese company to be more expensive than what a U.S. company can do either (a) on its own or (b) with another U.S. company — even when collaboration has clear technological and manufacturing benefits. Nevertheless, many U.S. firms express a strong desire to collaborate with Japan to take advantage of strong Japanese industrial capabilities and technological expertise, in recognition of the robust alliance between the two nations. (Project interviews highlighted particular interest in microelectronics and certain subcomponents, such as composite materials and airframe structures.) Government encouragement and policy focus, including through the creation of subsidies designed to support codevelopment by covering some of the costs of collaboration, could be useful and perhaps necessary to facilitate cooperation. Of course, without a requirement or a government contract with funding, cooperation is unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial&quot;&gt;Industrial&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: Japan has advanced manufacturing capabilities that prove especially important to U.S. commercial companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has advanced capabilities in various technologies — including microelectronics and carbon fiber composites — and is proficient in high-quality and high-volume commercial marketplace production. The United States has very limited capacity in some of these arenas, including wiring boards, which have been offshored to Southeast Asia. Japan’s comparative advantage in these fields underpins its bustling commercial industry, which has allowed it to become a key source of supply for a number of large foreign industrial producers, including Boeing. Bringing these capabilities and capacities to collaborative efforts could give Japanese industry market access while helping U.S. firms overcome their own limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 2: Modular open systems provide a framework for cooperation on codevelopment and coproduction, but current U.S. policy and industrial regimes do not tap into the full potential this architecture offers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modular open systems approaches, which allow for the incorporation of subsystems produced by different companies into standard interfaces, represent a possible means of expanding U.S.-Japan cooperation. Interviews with Japanese industry professionals conducted for this project found limited awareness of open systems approaches, however, which could be related to a lack of incentives for industry. The success of this framework is dependent on U.S. approval for technology developed and produced abroad to be incorporated into U.S. systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：控方將暴動歸類為恐怖活動、但從未聽過政府如此定性&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（15日）踏入第73日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表劉佩凝的大律師馬維騉表示，控方立場指毋須證明本案眾籌款項僅用作12.8的用槍及炸彈計劃，只需證明款項用作投擲汽油彈及破壞公共設施等恐怖主義活動。惟辯方反駁，控方沒有分析過2019年是否真的發生過恐怖主義活動。辯方反問：「警方發言人、政府、國際媒體有冇話香港好多恐怖份子？大小審訊入面，有冇話邊單係恐怖活動？有冇聽過任何人形容2019年事情係恐怖主義活動？」辯方指，2019年騷亂只是被定性為暴動，他從未聽說過政府將暴動定性為恐怖主義活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方舉例指恐怖主義活動包括911事件&quot;&gt;辯方舉例指恐怖主義活動包括911事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉佩凝的大律師馬維騉進行結案陳詞。辯方指，針對劉的控罪是「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，控方需要證明劉意圖及知悉籌得的金錢是用作進行恐怖活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bBmqLT6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表劉佩凝的大律師 馬維騉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，本案為香港首宗就《反恐條例》審訊的案件，控罪涉及恐怖主義活動，此罪並不常見。辯方舉例解釋甚麼是恐怖主義活動，包括2001年的911事件，當時阿爾蓋達組織挾持客機撞向美國的大廈；而1972年慕尼黑奧運，有巴勒斯坦激進份子挾持以色列代表團，導致十多人死亡。辯方續指，1995年奧姆真理教教主麻原彰晃指示成員在東京地鐵施放沙林毒氣；2005年倫敦地鐵爆炸案，目的是想推翻政府。辯方指，上述均為人所公認的恐怖活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方將暴動歸類為恐怖活動但從未聽過政府如此定性&quot;&gt;辯方：控方將暴動歸類為恐怖活動、但從未聽過政府如此定性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據條例，恐怖主義活動有數項要求，包括要針對人的嚴重暴力、導致財產嚴重損害、危害其他人生命，以及對公眾構成嚴重危險。而上述行為目的是為着推展政治、宗教或思想主張，並強迫政府、國際組織或威嚇公眾人士而作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，若本案12.8計劃得以付諸實行，相信沒有人會爭議這是否恐怖主義活動。但控方的立場卻指，毋須證明本案眾籌的款項只是用作12.8計劃，因投擲汽油彈、破壞公共設施亦屬恐怖主義活動，因此只需證明款項用作這些行為。控方又指，本案證據依賴「育龍」頻道的精華片段，內容包括投擲汽油彈。辯方卻認為，控方針對黃的「恐怖活動」指控一直是12.8計劃，從無提及其他活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，控方沒有分析過2019年是否真的發生過恐怖主義活動。辯方反問：「警方發言人、政府、國際媒體有冇話香港好多恐怖份子？每個禮拜都有恐怖活動？大小審訊入面，有冇話邊單係恐怖活動？有冇聽過任何人形容2019年事情係恐怖主義活動？」辯方指，2019年騷亂只是被定性為暴動，他從未聽說過有人將暴動定性為恐怖主義活動，且因此要受審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方若以2019年社會氛圍作考慮是不公道&quot;&gt;辯方：若以2019年社會氛圍作考慮，是不公道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於控方於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀不言而喻。辯方卻認為，這是絕對不可取的態度，「呢個好危險嘅思維」，因等同將法庭以外的訊息帶入案件，做法並不公道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，即使精華片段內容屬實，卻沒有證據顯示暴動屬恐怖活動。另亦沒有證據顯示理大及中大事件屬於恐怖活動。即使「育龍」頻道曾發布關於「五大訴求，缺一不可」的訊息，但辯方反駁合法示威人士亦會叫這個口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強為擔任控方證人將劉佩凝拖落水&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強為擔任控方證人，將劉佩凝「拖落水」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就污點證人黃振強，辯方批評他有很大誘因作供，即為了獲得減刑，而其供詞亦受到質疑。黃在2019年12月8日被捕後，直至2023年2月案件交付上高院，他仍維持不認罪。相隔一個月，黃被加控「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，劉亦被控同一罪名。警方於同年5月開始接見黃，其後黃去信與律政司商討認罪協議，最後選擇認罪。在協商條件下，黃更承認並非事實的事情。辯方認為，黃為了擔任控方證人，故將劉「拖落水」。他直至被捕後的3年7個月，才首次提及劉的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黃獲得律政司的豁免起訴書，但條件之一是要坦誠作供，辯方形容對黃而言「等同佢頭上嘅一把刀」、「睇吓佢乖唔乖」。辯方亦質疑，黃的證供並不可信、「大話連篇」，不應照單全收，「將事實真相舞弄喺手掌之中嘅人，我哋畀幾多信任佢？」辯方強調，不能以黃認罪這個因素，來考慮劉是否有罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方沒有證據劉看過屠龍精華片段&quot;&gt;辯方：沒有證據劉看過「屠龍」精華片段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就證供方面，辯方指控方必須證明劉有意圖或知悉黃振強將錢用作恐怖主義活動。控方指，劉得悉「育龍」頻道上的「屠龍」精華片段。但辯方反駁，沒有證據劉有看過上述片段。另外，黃在「育龍」成立後，沒有再參與示威行動，除了中大事件。辯方又指，黃只是將資金用作賭波，其紓壓的解釋亦站不住腳。他亦不肯將錢分給「出生入死嘅朋友」，亦拒提供10萬資金予「國難中醫」。辯方又指，黃與劉相識僅一個小時，黃就向劉表示要錢買槍，劉並不知道黃是否「講真」，而實際上黃沒有買槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方劉只是兼職會計文員妹老細叫佢做咩都做&quot;&gt;辯方：劉只是「兼職會計文員妹」、「老細叫佢做咩都做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再指，當黃向劉表示將會有大行動後，劉傳送掩面的表情符號。辯方指其意思是「冇眼睇」，因黃的說法虛無縹緲，兼「都唔知噏乜」。辯方指，黃聲稱曾與劉通電話，向她交代「屠龍」在大行動中會配合其他隊伍，並著她加緊眾籌力度，以準備「走佬Plan」。辯方認為黃實際是「看圖作故事」。辯方指，劉案發時為年僅20歲的「小女孩」，並對黃言聽計從。辯方總結，劉只是一個「兼職會計文員妹」，「老細叫佢做咩都做，佢冇人工收添㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方一度哽咽感謝陪審團專注聆聽&quot;&gt;辯方一度哽咽感謝陪審團專注聆聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，對劉而言公正、公義及公平的裁決，是被判無罪。辯方一度哽咽對陪審團說：「呢滴眼淚唔係關於劉佩凝嘅，而係見到你哋咁細心、聚焦、專注聽我嘅陳詞，我更加覺得感動，令我嗚咽。」他補充，陪審團制度是很多國家仍然採用的制度，「係一個好好嘅制度」，全靠市民願意犧牲時間，良好的司法程序才得以保存，「如果個個都話唔做，可能第日冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（16日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指控方「有殺錯冇放過」證據不足仍檢控 與彼拉多卸責交民眾審判耶穌相似&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4VxWkV7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（14日）踏入第72日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第六被告許湛榮的大律師陳偉彥指，許在串謀形成前已退出，控方針對許的證供「空洞無物」，不足以證明他有罪；但控方仍然堅持檢控，實屬不公，只是「有殺錯，冇放過」。控方又屢向陪審團表示「交畀你哋諗」，辯方認為實際目的是「拋個波畀你哋」，並引《聖經》故事為例子，指負責審判耶穌的羅馬官員彼拉多，明知耶穌無罪但不將他釋放，反而推卸責任，「任由民眾將耶穌送死」、「美其名交畀民眾決定」，上述例子與本案有「異曲同工」之處。辯方希望陪審團判無罪，並引用馬丁路德金的名言：「Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.」，又指「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義，不過遲到好過冇到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方針對許湛榮的證供空洞無物&quot;&gt;辯方：控方針對許湛榮的證供空洞無物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第六被告許湛榮的大律師陳偉彥進行結案陳詞。辯方指，控方針對許湛榮的證供「空洞無物」、「薄如蟬翼」，遠遠不足以證明許有罪，並強調：「控方舉證失敗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許在串謀成形前已退出&quot;&gt;辯方：許在串謀成形前已退出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，許在本案串謀協議成形之前已經退出，即「Left Before the Plan」，辯方以簡稱「LBP（Low Back Pain）」協助陪審團記憶。因此，許應該是無罪。辯方認為，控方模糊化協議成形的時間及內容。辯方希望陪審團以「3個W」考慮本案的串謀協議，即「What（何事）」、「When（何時）」及「Who（何人）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方解釋，本案的串謀協議是計劃在12月8日的民陣遊行途中放置炸彈。而協議是在計劃前的5天、即12月3日才成形，據證人黃振強的證供，吳當日透露計劃落實於12月8日執行。但當日許並不在場，因此他不知悉計劃。辯方指，控方沒有證據證明許在12月3日之後有參與過串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方不應將許歸為吳智鴻團隊即使好友亦唔係佢條蟲&quot;&gt;辯方：控方不應將許歸為吳智鴻團隊、即使好友亦「唔係佢條蟲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方將許歸納為吳智鴻的團隊，並指吳一方早於7月表示要找鄉黑「覆桌」，於10月已經有殺警察的「思維」，因他們曾討論打算在10.1遊行用真槍及炸彈攻擊警察，但最後煞停。辯方批評，控方的基礎是「荒天下之大謬」，因上述兩事件均與本案串謀無關，而且許當時並不在場，故此不知情。辯方質疑：「咁樣入佢數，公唔公道呀？」，並指控方一直模稜兩可，未能清楚說出串謀協議在何時成形。辯方認為，實際上根本沒有任何串謀協議，「因為佢哋（控方）知道冇任何串謀成形，梗係唔會認啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又批評，控方一直將許歸納為吳智鴻的團隊，「用呢個概念將所有人歸成兩邊」，但辯方希望陪審團獨立考慮針對許的證據，而「唔好好似控方咁鬆散、求其」。辯方強調，雖然許是吳的好友，但「唔係佢心入面條蟲」，因此不代表許知道吳參與「咁激進瘋狂嘅串謀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方做法是有殺錯冇放過&quot;&gt;辯方：控方做法是「有殺錯冇放過」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，吳獨自安排不同事情，故「好多嘢都係得佢知」。而控方卻含糊其詞、魚目混珠，將許及吳歸納成同一隊人，辯方形容其做法是「一竹篙打沉一船人，寧枉勿縱，有殺錯冇放過」。辯方強調，彭軍壕身為吳智鴻的「左右手」，作供時卻沒有提及許在行動中的角色及分工。另根據彭的證供，許在11月17日之後「消失咗」。辯方認為，彭是有動機指證被告的「污點證人」，但他卻不敢表明許是參與串謀者之一，因此這是最直接及最強的證據，證明許並非串謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指根據對話紀錄，有人曾問「群組入面有冇邊個唔可以知道最新訊息，榮係其中一個」。辯方指，這顯示許被排除在外，他根本不是串謀者，因此不能知道最新消息。辯方又指，有證據顯示許對吳的計劃並不知情，因許在吳被捕之後，發訊息指「認真，我個人唔係好信嗰把係真槍，我覺得一係改大咗嘅氣槍，一係一把閹槍」。辯方反問：「當大家一直話真槍，點解大行動佢（許）仲覺得係講笑，唔係真槍？」辯方強調，許根本不相信名校出身的中學同學兼好友，「夠膽死用真槍殺警察」，這再次顯示許並非串謀一份子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許得知吳有真槍後刻意疏離&quot;&gt;辯方：許得知吳有真槍後刻意疏離&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，許湛榮在參與西貢行山試槍後，拒絕與吳智鴻聯絡。辯方認為，可以想像許首次見到真槍及炸彈等危險品後，拒絕參與兼決定不與吳再有交集，因此刻意疏離並消失。控方指，吳於12月7日在香港華仁書院組裝炸彈時，兩度致電許，但許卻拒接電話。辯方認為，許明顯刻意不接聽，進一步顯示在行山之後，他刻意不與吳有交集。辯方提到，既然兩人都是「華仁仔」兼好友，許理應是協助組裝炸彈的「最佳人選」，但吳並沒有這樣做，「點解唔係揀信任嘅好朋友？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦提到，警方即使「地氈式搜證」，亦未能在閉路電視找到許的身影。辯方強調：「如果許湛榮一心想參與串謀，必然會出現喺準備行動之中，唔會完全消失。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方針對許的其他證供，包括許曾參與台灣軍訓，辯方指不能因此推論他有參與大行動。而且許亦沒有加入與其他被告商討迫政府妥協，顯示他並非激進份子。另一證據是警方在吳住所找到有許指紋的地圖，因此可推論許在行山之前曾與吳視察路線。辯方則反駁，沒有證據證明指紋何時出現，因指紋沒有時間指向性；再加上地圖上有其他人的指紋，證明有很多人接觸過。辯方強調，上述證據沒有價值，這正正突顯控方對許方面案情的絕望，陪審團不能由此推論許有份計劃行山路線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項控方提出的證據是，在吳被捕之後數小時，許在「台灣按摩旅行團」群組發訊息表示「清嘢」。辯方反駁，據吳電話的紀錄顯示，許在發訊息前已退出群組，因此許可能是得悉吳被捕後，為免被其他人牽連而重返群組，並作出提醒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許被捕後獲保釋但無離港因相信自己無辜&quot;&gt;辯方：許被捕後獲保釋但無離港、因相信自己無辜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後指，許在吳被捕後沒有離港，事隔一個多月至2020年1月8日，許亦被捕。辯方強調：「殺警察指控咁嚴重，如果佢有份，做乜嘢留喺度博拉？」另外，許在被捕後曾獲保釋，但他一直沒有離港，相隔1年3個月才被起訴，為本案最後一人被起訴。辯方反問：「如果真係有份串謀殺警察，可以走的話，會唔會真係留喺度？」辯方強調，許真的相信自己無辜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方盲目起訴許屬不公檢控&quot;&gt;辯方：控方盲目起訴許、屬不公檢控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提到，控方是「盲目起訴」許湛榮，是次檢控屬不公正。辯方指，由案發至今已達5年，控方在開審前一早閱畢所有文件，心知證據「幾多斤兩」，而許只是「局外人」。但控方仍堅持盲目起訴無辜的許，或有可能是同案其他被告棄保潛逃，因此才選擇起訴許。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方質疑控方明知證據不足-卻不撤控&quot;&gt;辯方質疑控方明知證據不足 卻不撤控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述律政司的《檢控守則》，其中一項為「檢控人員的角色及職務」，提到「檢控人員代表社會，行事不偏不倚，負責秉行公義。為此，檢控人員必須公正客觀地協助法庭找出真相，於社會與被控告之間，依法秉公行義」。至於另一項則關於「覆核和停止檢控」，提及「檢控人員有責任持續覆核已展開的檢控工作。隨著情況有變，假如在任何階段重新應用檢控驗證標準而顯示有關證據不再足以確保有合理機會達至定罪，或繼續進行檢控不會符合社會公義，便應停止檢控」。辯方續指，控方證據顯示許沒有參與本案串謀，「點解唔申請撤回對許湛榮嘅控罪，終止檢控？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方控方拋個波予陪審團與彼拉多要求民眾審判耶穌相似&quot;&gt;辯方：控方「拋個波」予陪審團、與彼拉多要求民眾審判耶穌相似&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方認為，控方在結案陳詞多次向陪審團表示「交畀你哋諗」，實際目的是「拋個波畀你哋」。辯方又引用《聖經》故事作為例子，指負責審判耶穌的羅馬官員彼拉多（Pontius Pilate），明知道耶穌無罪但不將他釋放，而「任由民眾將耶穌送死」。辯方形容，彼拉多「美其名交畀民眾決定」，實質上只是「wash their hands of」，即推卸責任。辯方補充：「我唔係話許湛榮係耶穌，但係係咪同樣推卸責任、有異曲同工嘅地方？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方許坐住監等審訊人生被摧毀&quot;&gt;辯方：許「坐住監等審訊」、人生被摧毀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方重申，刑事案件的舉證標準極為嚴格，必須達至毫無合理疑點，以「保護各位不會被錯誤不公檢控之下，無辜受罪」。辯方指，控方沒有可能在毫無合理疑點下證明許有罪，而許沒有案底、年僅二十多歲，但卻「坐住監等審訊，白白浪費青春，冇人賠畀佢」。辯方強調：「無理控告摧毀佢哋嘅人生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義不過遲到好過冇到&quot;&gt;辯方：「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義，不過遲到好過冇到」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後引用馬丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）的名言：「Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.」辯方對陪審團指：「控方唔公正起訴許湛榮，同樣可以起訴各位嘅親人、朋友、摯愛」、「唔好對不公視而不見，聽而不聞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，刑事法的金科玉律提到「遲嚟嘅公義唔係公義」，但補充：「不過遲到好過冇到」，「如果你哋還佢公義、自由，我依然衷心感謝你哋。」辯方指，基於疑點利益歸於被告下，許應該被判無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳偉彥完成陳詞，案件明（15日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IrNRF4o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（13日）踏入第71日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第五被告賴振邦的大律師是香媛指，賴在「3C 維修工作室」工作，雖然店舖是「黃店」並貼有「文宣」，但辯方強調：「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警。」辯方提醒陪審團考慮案情時，撇開賴的政治理念。辯方又指，涉案電話並非屬於賴，控方依賴電話有其生活照就確立推論，基礎十分牽強。對於「污點證人」彭軍壕指賴振邦別名為「Bobby」，而電話通訊紀錄顯示曾發訊息自稱「Bobby」。辯方反駁這是普通名字：「電視藝人歐陽震華都叫 Bobby，任何人都可以用。」辯方亦指，警員即使迫賴喝「滴露」，亦未能得到其招認，因此找彭協助將行為編派在賴身上。辯方最後指，賴振邦「踢保」後無離港，證明他是無辜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴的電話維修工作室為黃店但思想係黃唔代表會殺警&quot;&gt;辯方：賴的電話維修工作室為「黃店」、但「思想係黃唔代表會殺警」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第五被告賴振邦的大律師是香媛進行結案陳詞。辯方強調，賴振邦並沒有參與本案串謀。據早前證供透露，賴於2020年1月在位於香港工業中心的「3C 維修工作室」被捕。辯方描述警方拍攝的照片指，工作室門外寫明「10分鐘特快維修」、「破解密碼鎖」、「修復資料」，同時亦貼有2019年社會運動的「文宣」，明顯是俗稱的「黃店」。至於店內則有嬰兒圍欄，辯方指這證明不止賴一人出入工作室。辯方指，賴有胞姊，而姊夫為張堅順，他同涉本案曾經被捕。辯方強調，即使有政治理念亦不代表會做涉案行為，「就算思想係黃，唔代表佢會殺警。」辯方提醒陪審團考慮案情時，撇開賴的政治理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方電話並非屬於賴警方沒有查問過&quot;&gt;辯方：電話並非屬於賴、警方沒有查問過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方證據指警方在「3C 維修工作室」檢獲的 iPhone 8 Plus 電話，必然屬於賴振邦。電話內經復原的 Telegram 程式顯示，已登入用戶名稱「接完紙鶴未？」，這用戶為「行山討論區」的成員之一。至於「Google Maps」則登入了賴的帳戶。辯方則指，電話並不屬於賴，他並非唯一使用者；而帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」亦不是由賴使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，店舖內擺放多部電話，涉案電話「只不過係工作枱上，芸芸眾多電話嘅其中一部」，該電話是唯一毋須密碼開啟。賴沒有作出招認表示電話屬他。辯方認為，警方得悉本案牽涉 Telegram 訊息，而到場其中一個目標是要檢取電話。不過警方並沒有查問哪一電話屬於賴，辯方質疑，警員「只要搵到一部電話與案有關，就會話屬於賴振邦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方以電話有個人照判斷電話屬賴基礎非常牽強&quot;&gt;辯方：以電話有個人照判斷電話屬賴、基礎非常牽強&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;負責檢取電話的警員供稱，曾打開涉案電話查看相簿，發現部分是賴的生活照。辯方卻指，電話其中一個已登入的 Apple ID 屬賴，因此照片可能是從另一部電話經過 iCloud 同步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，該警員在查看前沒有獲上司批准，事後沒有記錄在記事冊，亦無匯報上級，「係咪可以信呢？」辯方另質疑，警員為了掩飾故虛構有向賴查問。辯方又指，電話內的炸彈相片來自吳智鴻，並非由涉案電話拍攝。辯方強調，控方以個人照片來判斷電話擁有人是賴，此基礎非常牽強。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方bobby屬普通名字電視藝人歐陽震華也用&quot;&gt;辯方：「Bobby」屬普通名字、電視藝人歐陽震華也用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「污點證人」、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕，指賴振邦別名為「Bobby」；而電話內的「Line」程式中，曾發訊息指：「Hi I am Bobby」。但辯方立場指「Bobby」並不是賴，「Bobby 係好普通嘅名，電視藝人歐陽震華都叫 Bobby，任何人都可以用。」辯方總結，控方未能在毫無合理疑點下，證明賴是電話的唯一使用者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員檢取店內4萬資金目的阻黃店運作&quot;&gt;辯方：警員檢取店內4萬資金、目的阻「黃店」運作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，警員在店內檢取4萬多元現金，明顯是店舖的營運資金及收入。辯方質疑，沒有證據顯示金錢與案有關，而警方目的是要阻礙「黃店」運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕逢大必縮遇到大事就會撇清關係&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕「逢大必縮」、遇到大事就會撇清關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後批評本案「污點證人」、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕。辯方指，彭為本案年紀最大的被告，案發時33歲及無業，其父親為警署警長。辯方強調，彭在本案中「逢大必縮」，每當遇到「大件事」，就會撇清關係並指與自己無關。另外，彭作供時「選擇性記憶」，他在細節上記得清楚，但被問及重要的事就表示不記得。辯方批評，彭作供期間亦經常背誦關鍵詞、在邏輯上表現混亂，內容亦自相矛盾，「一方面講到自己好叻，但係大件事就話唔關佢事，推落人哋到，自己只係睇，冇參與。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，從彭的證供可見吳智鴻與彭志同道合，吳想為7.21元朗事件復仇時，第一個是找彭。辯方認為彭是吳的左右手。但當彭參與示威活動時，則僅僅旁觀，並無親自行動。另外，彭有些說法並非屬實，例如他說在 Red MR 的會面中有交代台灣軍訓日期，但紀錄顯示當時尚未決定好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，在台灣宿舍期間聽到吳及賴談論要進行破壞「迫政府妥協」，辯方卻質疑屬彭虛構：「呢幾個字係咪好文雅？啲人講嘅時候會唔會用呢啲字眼呢？」，「點解咁啱次次都畀佢聽到呢啲咁嘅內容？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭曾供稱，自己於10月3日與吳、賴及許湛榮到灣仔「卓軒旅舍」打算投擲鏹水彈。辯方質疑沒有任何證供支持彭的說法，「又係得佢把口講。」而對話紀錄亦無顯示吳邀請其他成員參與。彭表示各人打算投擲時，自己則「落街買嘢食」。辯方質疑彭的說法不合邏輯：「去到重要時刻，點解會落街買嘢食？掟完先食又得嘅啫！又要作到無自己份。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭另稱，於11月14日與賴到城大及浸大的實驗室「爆 Lab」，但對話顯示由彭率先問誰人會參與。彭早前指，在被捕後抱「僥倖心理」，因此部分說法並非事實全部。辯方卻反駁，彭既然明知自己「走唔甩」，亦打算認罪，為何仍會抱着這個心理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭想拉人落水減低自己參與性&quot;&gt;辯方：彭想拉人落水、減低自己參與性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭證供透露，他與賴等人有參與11月16日晚的西貢行山試槍。惟彭卻強調自己負責「睇水」，沒有親自「落手落腳」。辯方質疑彭再次塑造出自己無份參與大事，「次次都係負責睇。」辯方亦指出，當日環境昏暗加上各人蒙面，而且沒有太多對話，因此彭未能確定參與者身份，他只是虛構賴有出席，目的「想拉人落水，盡量減低自己嘅參與性」。辯方最後指，若然如控方所言，賴有份參與行山，為何會容許其他參與者用電話拍攝並留下定位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴並非製造炸彈者&quot;&gt;辯方：賴並非製造炸彈者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的證供提及，賴負責製作炸彈及引爆器，但辯方強調根本沒有證據支持，實質彭「佢一個人鍾意講乜就講乜」。辯方補充，吳曾向被指為賴振邦的用戶表示：「我個炸彈佬要用」，這顯示賴並非製造炸彈的人。辯方重申，彭只是將其他人的行為放在賴身上。彭亦稱曾到「3C 維修工作室」的後樓梯進行「試爆」，在場人士包括賴，而自己只是旁觀角色。辯方質疑：「去到重要時刻，如果佢淨係去睇，使乜帶埋佢去？佢嘅作用係咩啫？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警方即使迫喝滴露賴亦拒招認故找彭協助虛構&quot;&gt;辯方：警方即使迫喝「滴露」賴亦拒招認、故找彭協助虛構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭又指，12月3日在荃灣酒吧內各人會面討論大計劃，在場的包括賴。閉路電視拍攝到賴出現。黃振強供稱，賴當時在酒吧內表示有閉路電視，要求各人不要討論計劃。辯方強調，賴沒有說過上述說話，亦無從猜測他有說過。辯方又指，不想揣測黃是否在警方探訪後改變證供。辯方亦強調，黃的證供顯示4名涉計劃的「首腦」已在「松記糖水」傾談好，因此毋須再次討論。辯方反問，既然彭想塑造成賴是小心謹慎的人，為何他會不設置電話密碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的證供提到，賴於12月8日應吳的要求拿電池盒到香港華仁書院協助製作炸彈。但辯方質疑，吳只是開始製作炸彈不久，為何電池盒如此快溶掉。對於控方指閉路電視並非360全角度，因此未能拍攝到賴在場，辯方質疑說法不合理：「冇就係冇，點能夠話有去不過影唔到。」辯方又指，在場的煙頭及擺放炸彈的背包，只驗出彭及吳的 DNA。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，彭在被捕後的供詞完全沒有提及過賴振邦的名字，直至警員向彭表示賴即是「Bobby」，他才知道。辯方認為，警員即使迫賴喝「滴露」，也未能得到賴的招認，因此最後找彭協助，「將 Bobby 做嘅嘢編派喺賴振邦身上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴振邦踢保後無離港證明無辜&quot;&gt;辯方：賴振邦「踢保」後無離港、證明無辜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，控方表明吳一方在9月30日的皇后街會議後，已經對用槍及炸彈襲擊警察有「思維」。惟辯方強調，思維與串謀是「兩碼子嘅事」。而賴並沒有參與上述會議，控方亦無提出賴何時加入串謀。另外，辯方指吳一方沒有在群組交代12.8計劃之目的及執行形式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，賴於2020年1月17日首次被捕，2日後獲保釋外出，同年6月16日獲警方批准毋須再擔保，直至9月他再次被捕。辯方指賴在6月後其實可隨時離港，但由於他是無辜，所以才繼續坦蕩蕩留港工作：「如果賴振邦真係控方所指嘅人，點會唔走佬？點會留喺香港等人拉啫？」辯方又指，警方在首次拘捕後已檢取賴的電話，若他知道電話內容對自己不利，就會選擇離港。辯方希望陪審團裁定賴罪名不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（14日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold War military bases frequently displayed the quote “Our Job in Peace is to Prepare for War”, reminding people that the peacetime role of the armed forces was to be ready for war. Hardly a new idea, variations on the theme appear in Sun Tzu, Clausewitz and in Vegetius’ famous dictum “si vis pacem, para bellum”. The connection between training and war is well established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At RUSI’s Land Warfare Conference 2024, the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) argued for more productive armed forces, and endorsed the new Chief of the General Staff’s ambition to increase the lethality of the Army. The Strategic Defence Review must consider these issues, alongside the size of the Defence budget needed to deliver the stated ambitions. And while many of the headlines will be focused on the physical elements of capability – the people, equipment and stockpiles – capability is more. In Ukraine, Russia’s numerical superiority in people and equipment has not delivered the quick victory it hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence describes capability as a function of many factors, encapsulated in the acronym TEPIDOIL. There is a reason that Training comes ahead of Equipment, People, Information, Doctrine, Organisation, Infrastructure and Logistics: it is the glue that binds the other elements and gives the force its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training (and education) not only coheres the elements of capability, but also connects the three components of fighting power. It ensures that the physical component can be used to the full, enhances the conceptual component, and underpins the moral component by building and sustaining trust and people’s willingness to fight for each other. Collective training forges strong and integrated units, Services and alliances. Just as capability is more than equipment, so too is interoperability – the ability to exchange data and cue each other’s sensors and shooters still requires people to cooperate, and human interoperability is founded on trust, which requires shared experience. Training, therefore, needs to be an integral element of the Defence Review and not the Cinderella function to be ignored in favour of its more glamorous sisters such as air and missile defences, artillery, cyber and digital backbones. Nor can training be confined to a human resources analysis independent of operational requirements, which the Strategic Defence Review’s terms of reference might suggest is how it is seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite renewed focus on training – the Royal Navy’s collaborative synthetic training that connects Portsmouth to the US Navy in Norfolk or San Diego, the Army’s Collective Training Transformation Programme and the RAF’s aggressor training, together with a more dynamic exercise programme in recent years, including through NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force – there are concerns that the current approach to training in the UK is outdated. While many of the issues impacting individual training are well known, collective training does not adequately prepare the forces for state-based conflicts, despite it being almost a decade since the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) which described a resurgence in state-based threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The content of training must change to reflect the threats and experience of recent wars, and this is currently not responsive enough&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commentary highlights a potential tension in the desire for enhanced productivity and preparing the armed forces for war, before considering four issues that impact on collective training’s ability to meet threats: capacity; the scale at which training takes place; the content, including questions about risk; and funding. So, while there is much that is positive about collective training and exercising, there are challenges that the Strategic Defence Review team should address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-productivity-gap&quot;&gt;A Productivity Gap?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having productive armed forces is important, but the yardstick against which productivity is measured is crucial. Productivity generally concerns how much input is required to produce a given output; how the output is defined is therefore crucial. If the measure is how much use is made of the armed forces in delivering routine peacetime activity that shows an immediate return against the Defence budget – greater equipment availability from the same fleet with fewer people, or military aid to the civil authorities – these tasks will be prioritised, even if the forces have less time to train to win the wars they may be called on to fight. If the job (output) of the armed forces in peace is to prepare for war, this is a different measure of productivity, one that is hard to gauge in advance, but which may require training for war to be prioritised above the forces’ routine use. However, it would be unrealistic to think that the defence budget should only fund the armed forces as a break-glass emergency capability; they must add value short of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice is not binary: credible, lethal armed forces can deter many adversaries, where they have the right type and volume of equipment that can be used to the full through realistic and demanding training. Where that training is conducted can have deterrent and reassurance effects, so whether the British Army Training Unit in Suffield, Canada (BATUS) is the right location for a European threat is worth consideration. BATUS offers permissive land and air space for large-scale training – including for the use of drones – that is hard to find in Europe, but is a long way from the potential fight, so there is a judgement between training value and deterrent effect. However, if technology can help coordinate live and virtual forces dispersed across multiple European training areas, Defence could step between the horns of that dilemma. And, if the definition of productivity as routine use is adopted, deterring adversaries and reassuring allies through practised interoperability in the likely theatre of operations makes an immediate contribution to outputs which should be just as legitimate as sending small training teams around the world, or providing military aid to the civil authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology, through simulation, also enhances productivity by reducing the use of physical equipment, increasing its life (for example, fewer live flying or sea hours allowing more of a fleet to be operational) and reducing the need for fuel, spare parts and maintenance. However, those who fuel or service the equipment (or people) also need to be trained for wartime conditions, and industry may depend on repeat orders of parts to keep production lines and supply chains open; simulation is therefore not the complete answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;capacity-constrained&quot;&gt;Capacity Constrained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of the individual and collective training systems is heavily constrained, both in the number of training places and the estate. The military flying training system’s problems are well-known, but capacity elsewhere has been “optimised” for the force size and requirements described in the 2015 SDSR, as adjusted by the Army cuts in the 2021 Defence Command Paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With training capacity already matched to small armed forces with a commensurately limited throughput, the situation will be worse if the Strategic Defence Review concludes – as it should – that numbers must increase. This will be a particular issue for the Reserves in the event of mobilisation. One deduction may be to give the volunteer reserve a role in training for mobilisation, creating a nucleus of trainers who can prepare the second and subsequent echelons, expanding capacity quickly when required. The way Reserves were involved in training the Ukrainian armed forces under Operation Interflex offers a potential template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another capacity constraint is the ability to release people or units for training. Justin Bronk observes that in several NATO air forces (including the RAF), pilots and engineers are overstretched by concurrent requirements for maintaining basic flying currency, major exercises and operational deployments. Consequently, many non-US NATO air forces cannot conduct the large-scale complex training sorties necessary to regenerate the skills needed for high-intensity missions. Similarly, the Royal Navy’s small fleet is regularly bounced between deployment and rigorous training packages, leaving little time for rest or maintenance, which contributes to retention and serviceability challenges across the fleet. Armed forces busy doing today’s tasks cannot be preparing properly for tomorrow’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;size-matters&quot;&gt;Size Matters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant weakness in UK collective training is its scale. At the Land Warfare Conference, Major General Mark Pullan described NATO’s aspiration for Corps-level training, which significantly exceeds the UK’s current training effort that often takes place below brigade level. Similarly, in the maritime and air domains, collective training and exercises often focus on small formations, not the larger ones that would be needed in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology could expand the ability to generate scale by combining live and virtual assets: the synthetic training system Gladiator – used by the RAF and the Australian, Canadian and US Air Forces – and the Advanced Tactical Augmented Reality Systems are good examples. Expanding the ability to connect all domains to such systems would also help training and exercise scheduling, enabling virtual participation with or from other Services or partners. This could overcome the limitation of platform numbers – for example, as the British Army expands its ground-based air defence capabilities, not having to wait for the RAF to provide a fast jet or drone might allow for more responsive, assured and predictable training. And something in the vein of a simulation Red Flag-like exercise (Sim Flag) could contribute to interoperability and mass without the high cost and lengthy planning involved in physical exercises. However, technology is not a complete replacement for live training – simulating the aggregate friction inherent in large-scale operations is still difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;train-hard-fight-easy&quot;&gt;Train Hard, Fight Easy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content of training must change to reflect the threats and experience of recent wars, and this is currently not responsive enough. Speakers on the multi-domain integration panel at the Land Warfare Conference highlighted how the design of many exercises and collective training remains rather traditional across the maritime, land and air domains. The modern battlefield’s ubiquitous intelligence gathering, swarming drones, unconventional weapons (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) and fast-adapting electromagnetic environment that undermines the ability to integrate forces are absent from too many exercises, and rarely present in combination. Moreover, with a primary focus on the learning benefit to combat forces, the logistics elements are often underplayed, whether supply, medical or engineering – including wet-gap crossings – meaning the vital enablers are not tested as they would be in conflict. Exercises also assume that the force is already at war, rather than testing the transition to war, which would stress different parts of the armed forces and society. Similarly, exercises often pay little, if any, attention to post-attack recovery. Greater integration of industry and partners across government is needed in exercises and collective training events to build the understanding, processes and trust that will be needed in war. And while there are examples of this, notably the Joint Expeditionary Force, it is not as common as it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk is another constraint on the conduct of training. Understandably, the safety risk in training is managed closely, but whether or not the balance is right is being challenged. The Defence Safety Authority (DSA) – which “aims to reduce and ideally prevent loss of life, avoidable harm and damage to the environment” – discharges its responsibilities seriously, but this can lead to a preference for risk that is “as low as reasonably practicable”. Whether the DSA and the wider legislative framework that impacts on the armed forces’ training for war are calibrated correctly should form part of the thinking during, or be tasked as subsequent work by, the Strategic Defence Review team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attitudes to operational risk also need review. Those playing the adversary need relevant capabilities, whether as organic functions – such as the US Air Force aggressor squadrons – or contracted capabilities such as Draken who support the RAF. This requires not only financial but also intellectual investment to understand how an adversary might fight you – not just how they have fought against others – and how to defeat them. This in turn requires a willingness, even an enthusiasm, to fail. But with few opportunities for collective training, unit commanders are disincentivised to be radical for fear that their only exercise report in command will indicate they did not pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The question of training is fundamentally one of the Defence mindset, and the Strategic Defence Review needs to help Defence reset how it thinks and acts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology can expand access to training, allow for experimentation, and confine the risk of death or injury to avatars in the virtual world. Moreover, the simulated/augmented reality environment may be the only place certain capabilities such as cyber attack, urban operations in cities and F35s can be tested without providing an adversary with intelligence on the extent of one’s capabilities, or for practical reasons. And while the temptation may be to invest in the front-end virtual/augmented reality systems, Defence needs the foundations to allow single Service systems to integrate, nationally and with key allies. Ideally, standards for technical architectures, acquisition and data would operate at the NATO level, but UK Strategic Command’s Integration Design Authority has an important role to play, and it needs to be enabled to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secure-funding&quot;&gt;Secure Funding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training is expensive, and funding represents a critical challenge. The money comes from in-year running costs – the resource departmental expenditure limit (RDEL) – (which is often overcommitted, frequently resulting in cuts to activity, including training. Moreover, while RDEL savings will impact on the regular component, they pose greater risks to the operational effectiveness of the Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predictability of funding over many years is hugely important for effective exercise planning, especially given the need to exercise at greater scale and with allies and partners whose own planning needs to be considered. A financial settlement that moves to the promised 2.5% of GDP, but that ties that growth to capital expenditure or specific RDEL elements, such as pension contributions – as happened under the last government’s 2019 spending review – or the new government’s pay award, which requires some of the 6% pay rise to be found by reprioritisation and savings, could leave training funding vulnerable. An option might be to protect the exercise budget by ringfencing the funding settlement, providing predictability for planners, both UK and allied. While this constrains budget flexibility, which is generally undesirable, it may be essential in protecting the capacity to train meaningfully. And while large-scale exercises are costly in both money and time, in Peter Drucker’s memorable words, “if you think training is expensive, try ignorance”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of training is fundamentally one of the Defence mindset, and the Strategic Defence Review needs to help Defence reset how it thinks and acts – an approach to preparing for war that avoids risk, prioritises routine activity over large-scale preparation for conflict and sees training as a cost to be reduced is not one that will deliver lethal, battle-winning forces that could prevent war by deterring those who would do us harm. With many of the constraints impacting on training and exercises, investing in technology in a more systematic and coordinated way could compensate for the limitations the forces are operating under, and raise their readiness to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapidly increasing lethality is most likely to be achieved through more effective use of what is currently available; the equipment and people are important, but training is as important for coalescing the components of capability and making them more than the sum of their individual parts. The Strategic Defence Review, therefore, must ensure that when decisions are made about the capabilities the forces need, the requirement for access to realistic, demanding and predictably funded training is secured. If the job of armed forces in peacetime is to prepare for war, this will also deliver CDS’s demand for enhanced productivity, perhaps more so than their use in delivering peacetime services to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：李家田視「屠龍」為「飲飲食食群組」、被警員「打嚇氹」後才招認&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/F9ce4iY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（12日）踏入第70日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第四被告李家田的大律師林芷瑩表示，李加入「屠龍」是希望訪問隊員及「攞錢」，對於當時經濟環境不佳、戶口僅剩個位數的李而言，他因有人資助「飲飲食食」而逗留隊內，李實際上是參與「飲飲食食嘅群組」。辯方指，只有黃振強及吳智鴻等知道大計劃，而被告則蒙在鼓裡，「你有你 plan，我有我打算，黐飲黐食。」辯方另指，李在家中廁所被警員「打嚇氹」之下，才作出招認，而控方未能解釋其中一個「謎團」，就是為何重點搜查隊沒有搜查廁所。雖然涉事警員否認，但辯方強調：「冇人會認自己打過人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田加入屠龍為有錢攞認為自己參與飲飲食食群組&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田加入「屠龍」為「有錢攞」、認為自己參與「飲飲食食群組」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第四被告李家田的大律師林芷瑩進行結案陳詞。證供顯示，李家田是「屠龍」成員，他曾加入 Telegram 群組「滅龍」並參與對話；至於「皇馬龍利號」群組，李則已經退出。辯方指，不能以被告等人經常去暴動現場，而推論他們必然會參與本案的串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何李家田會加入「屠龍」，辯方指他並非真的想加入本案的串謀，只是他對社會事件有興趣，並因在浸大修讀電影高級文憑課程，於是到暴動現場搜集資料及拍攝片段，同時希望訪問「屠龍」。辯方指，李加入「屠龍」的另一原因是「有錢攞」，對於當時經濟環境不佳、戶口僅剩個位數、「唔夠錢洗」的李而言，有人資助他「飲飲食食」而令他留在隊內，絕對是可以理解，「如果咁嘅經濟狀況之下，有人畀錢你飲飲食食，你會唔會留喺呢個 group？」辯方強調，李實際上是參與「飲飲食食嘅群組」。辯方指，只有黃振強、吳智鴻及林銘皓知道槍械炸彈計劃，而被告則蒙在鼓裡，「你有你 plan，我有我打算，黐飲黐食。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田並非核心人物&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田並非核心人物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方屢質疑李為何不詢問群組訊息的意思，辯方則反駁：「用生活邏輯去諗，係咪每一樣嘢都會問到篤？」辯方強調，李家田並非核心人物，「佢喺群組係咪咁重要？」，加上李並不在「行山討論區」群組。辯方補充，李並沒有與隊員前往泰國旅行，「如果李家田係咁重要，點解成隊人唔等埋佢？」他對於隊員去了泰國亦不知情。辯方亦指，李並非在警方的監察名單當中，閉路電視亦拍攝不到李的出現。辯方質疑：「證供咪好似好弱雞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強證供不可信屬一派胡言&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強證供不可信、屬「一派胡言」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方依賴的背景證供包括，李曾參與11月16日凌晨至17日早上的西貢行山試槍，並接收吳智鴻提供的手槍，其後他參與11月17日晚的大鴻輝會議，並匯報過程。「屠龍」於11月18日開始加入本案串謀，因此控方依賴這日之後的證供，作為串謀的證據。據污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供，李有出席11月25日的荃灣三陂坊會議，以及12月5日何文田訪問後的會議，會上黃交代吳團隊會使用槍械炸彈，而「屠龍」將負責引警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方批評，黃振強的證供不可信亦不可靠，屬「一派胡言」，實際上李沒有出席上述3個會議，並多次缺席「屠龍」的會議。根據李供稱，他於11月17日晚上被困理大，根本沒有出席會議，而且當時理大遭圍封，李沒有可能離開後再進入，「警方重重包圍之下，點樣入返去呢？幾鍾意參與社會事件嘅人，都唔會想咁嘅情況被警方拘捕。」辯方又提到，證供透露吳是一個小心謹慎的人，他不會將手槍交給不認識的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強有作供動機為減刑及罪行一筆勾銷&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強有作供動機、為減刑及「罪行一筆勾銷」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方解釋，黃振強有作供動機。黃原被控5罪，成為控方證人只需承認兩罪，其餘3罪則可獲存檔法庭，當中包括最高判囚終身的「串謀謀殺」罪。另外，黃獲得豁免起訴書，內容涵蓋暴動及非法集結，可以「將佢以前干犯嘅罪行一筆勾銷」。辯方續指，如黃的口供被接納，他最高可獲50%減刑。辯方質疑：「佢會唔會作假口供指證其他人呢？一定會！」辯方又指，黃在錄影會面、無損權益口供及庭上的證供，均有眾多出入之處，部分亦不合邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕拒提供電話密碼可在法庭天花龍鳳咁講&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕拒提供電話密碼、可在法庭「天花龍鳳咁講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一污點證人、屬吳智鴻團隊的彭軍壕，辯方亦指他在作供後獲撤回「串謀謀殺」罪，因此他亦有作供動機。辯方批評，彭供稱被捕後一心打算認罪，並交代事情始末，但他在錄影會面期間卻行使緘默權，並拒絕提供電話密碼予警方。辯方質疑，沒有獨立證供支持彭的說法，因此他可以「齋噏」、「喺法庭天花龍鳳咁講」，而且令人懷疑彭所說的是謊話，加上其證供有多處前後矛盾，「可唔可以相信一個唔肯開電話嘅人嘅片面之詞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，由於警方知道針對李的證供薄弱，因此才要求彭在口供表示吳智鴻將槍交李，而彭起初並無提及此事。辯方指，這個版本是警方重組而成，務求令彭及李的說法一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李家田證供可信他被警員打嚇氹下才作招認&quot;&gt;辯方：李家田證供可信、他被警員「打嚇氹」下才作招認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，李家田的證供則是可信，他本人亦在庭上表示，作供目的是希望法庭能夠找出真相及還他公義。即使陪審團不信任李的證供，亦不代表控方能證明他犯罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦依賴李的招認口供，李分別作出口頭招認、記事冊上的招認，以及進行錄影會面。辯方指，李家田在家中廁所被警員「打嚇氹」之下，才作出招認。辯方指出，控方未能解釋其中一個「謎團」，就是為何重點搜查隊沒有搜查廁所。辯方指，顯而易見的是警員在廁所對李「打嚇氹」。雖然涉事警員否認，但辯方強調：「冇人會認自己打過人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方進一步指，拘捕李的警員早前亦曾拘捕黃振強，而證供顯示黃當時也受到毆打。辯方遂指：「點解同一批警員唔會做同樣嘅嘢？」辯方指，由於黃身上有傷痕，故警員改為對李使用不留痕跡的「水刑」。控方一度質疑為何李記憶清晰，他當時回應：「冇經歷就會唔明白，係性命攸關嘅狀態」，辯方又指：「佢經歷你哋不能想像、你哋冇人經歷過嘅事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，李被捕期間一直沒有見過同在家中的母親，因此不敢即時作出投訴。辯方另指，李承認對他最有害的招認，即自己曾接收吳給予的手槍。辯方質疑，李若非被打，根本毋須承認。對於控方指「肥警察好難彎腰」，辯方卻反駁：「一個人有肚腩唔代表佢唔可以打人」，並補充：「加上我唔覺得佢肥。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方招認內容並非屬實&quot;&gt;辯方：招認內容並非屬實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，李被捕時，警方已經成功檢獲涉案的3支手槍，分別從吳智鴻、摩星嶺及蘇緯軒檢到。辯方質疑，警方卻沒有就手槍向李查問。辯方另指，李沒有必要「大模廝樣」保留曾裝手槍的綠色袋在家，因這屬對他不利的證據。辯方又表示，控方沒有提出證據證明手槍上找到李的指紋。而李的招認當中，大部分是為了迎合警員而虛構的，否則，「點解李家田咁傻，要作一啲對自己不利嘅版本？」辯方強調招認內容並非屬實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員曾捏造證供不可信&quot;&gt;辯方：警員曾捏造證供、不可信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦批評，警員的證供不可信亦不可靠，有部份是謊言。辯方舉例指出，警員沒有即時向李發出羈留人士通知書，原因是不想李知道自己有找律師的權利。警員亦無應李的要求給他閱讀搜查令。辯方總結，警員對上司的訓示置之不理，沒有讓同僚搜查廁所，因他們當時在廁所毆打李。辯方又指警員曾捏造證供。當被問為何有相片顯示桌上有被指裝過手槍的綠色袋，有些相片卻沒有時；警員回應起初把手槍放在證物袋，經提醒下才記起未拍照，因此再放回桌上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後對陪審團指，希望大家細心考慮證供，「呢個公義係你哋先可以畀到佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師林芷瑩完成陳詞，案件明（13日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黃振強斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備 辯方：諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SoCUnan.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（9日）踏入第69日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。代表第三被告嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷指，為「污點證人」的「屠龍」隊長黃振強，其證供屬「爛牌」，但由於需要證明「屠龍」有參與串謀，因此控方「冇咗呢隻牌唔得」。辯方又指，證據顯示「屠龍」成員沒有打算參與行動，因黃在群組批評隊員在行動前一日推搪表示未能協助搬運裝備。辯方質疑：「如果聽日係6月6號，諾曼第登陸，唔知你哋有冇聽過，第二次世界大戰，會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強口供屬爛牌&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強口供屬「爛牌」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第三被告嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷進行結案陳詞。辯方指，嚴沒有參與軍訓，而警方的監視名單中亦沒有嚴。辯方其後就污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強的證供作出評價。辯方指，控方在結案陳詞階段沒有表示黃是誠實可靠的證人，「係唔記得，定唔方便講？」辯方又形容黃的口供屬於「爛牌」，但由於需要證明「屠龍」有參與串謀，因此控方「冇咗呢隻牌唔得」，否則罪責程度會有分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃有莫大誘因說出對自己有利的事情&quot;&gt;辯方：黃有莫大誘因說出對自己有利的事情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃本人卻持有3張「好牌」，有莫大的誘因說出對自己有利的事情。首先黃因作供指證隊友而獲豁免起訴「串謀謀殺」罪，其次他因獲得豁免起訴書，即使在庭上透露曾參與暴動及縱火的行為，亦不會被起訴。第三，他可因此獲得減刑。辯方形容黃作供有如「意識流」，會在不同時間調整字句。當黃被問及有否被警察打，他卻迴避地回答遭對方使用一定程度武力，辯方表示：「以為係警務處長解釋警察點解打人𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警員三顧草廬探訪黃質疑他們稱心理輔導是否屬實&quot;&gt;辯方：警員三顧草廬探訪黃、質疑他們稱心理輔導是否屬實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，警員三顧草廬到羈留所拜訪還柙中的黃，警員在作供時表示，黃希望認罪，而在探訪過程中他們著黃通知律師、向他提供心理輔導，以及閒話家常。辯方指：「3個警員加埋唔知有冇10萬蚊人工，閒話家常3個鐘，有冇話畀審計署長聽？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，串謀協議需要一方提出想法，另一方真心同意及了解。根據黃的證供，他無法肯定其他隊員已經答應。辯方又指，即使有海量的 Telegram 訊息，但未能知道他們所說孰真孰假。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警方以小學畢業邏輯推論避彈衣屬嚴&quot;&gt;辯方：警方以「小學畢業邏輯」推論避彈衣屬嚴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，嚴在12月7日於安全屋被捕，警方否認將嚴按在床上。警方在嚴及張銘裕的房間內發現兩件避彈衣，並以「小學畢業邏輯」推論避彈衣屬他們。惟辯方質疑：「點解要擺兩件避彈衣？準備出擊？咁其他 Gear（裝備）呢？」警方亦搜出嚴藏有數十張餐廳及超市現金券，包括：麥當勞、肯德基、唐記包點蒸飯及百佳。辯方質疑證物與案無關，「證案喎！高等法院！喺全香港審案最高級法院，（控方）畀呢啲你哋？」他又指上述現金券，「證明咗啲咩？證明咗佢成日唔喺屋企食飯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備-辯方諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢&quot;&gt;黃斥隊員推搪未能搬裝備 辯方：諾曼第登陸會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃在群組批評隊員在行動前一日推搪，表示未能協助搬運裝備。辯方質疑：「如果聽日係6月6號，諾曼第登陸，唔知你哋有冇聽過，第二次世界大戰，會唔會有人話唔得閒搬嘢？」辯方另指，黃供稱嚴當晚應其要求留在安全屋陪他，「咁顯示佢哋準備參加大行動咩？」辯方又指，嚴是「冷淡教友」，經常以「陪女友」為由不參與小隊活動，而且嚴並非最積極的隊員。辯方指，嚴「錯在嗰晚喺安全屋」及平日「口多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方形容黃是商業奇才&quot;&gt;辯方形容黃是「商業奇才」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指：「個個都話黃振強唔好，但係天生我才必有用，每個人都有優點，佢好似幾得到女仔歡心。」辯方形容黃是「商業奇才」，不但「喊苦喊忽叫人捐錢」，又找泰國女友為他開戶口，更有「一班傻仔幫佢跑出跑入」，「如果唔係呢個情況，可能佢喺商界有好大作用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黃在行動前一晚沒有在安全屋向隊員講解計劃，反而不斷與「閃燈隊」的 Kristy 對話。黃問 Kristy「有冇得偷走？」，對方回覆「出面凍冰冰」，黃再指「我好熱，暖吓你」。黃其後稱：「你唔驚俾佢睇到你啲 message 咩？佢喺你隔離喎」、「我真係唔想認，但係真係掛住你」。辯方質疑：「咁點解冇時間同隊友講計劃？好懷疑佢聽日係咪去打。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，黃在不同場合有不同面目，是「度身訂造的語言藝術」。他在錄影會面期間表現淡定，在庭上接受主問及盤問時則有其他態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（12日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y6FOLAC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（8日）踏入第68日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。辯方指「屠龍」隊長黃振強承認刻意不讓隊員知道炸彈及槍手位置的地圖，「唔講 Location，分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」，這導致隊員未能衡量自身安全，亦未能選擇是否參加。至於另一污點證人彭軍壕，辯方指他亦非誠實可靠。辯方解釋，彭一早認罪，其父親是警察，故「有冇包庇我唔知道、唔想講」。辯方又形容他是「Police baby」，「差人見到佢就閒話家常、安撫情緒。三十幾歲人喇！」辯方亦指，彭一直拒絕交出電話密碼，警方卻未有破解並擷取其電話內容，「點解唔用？我唔知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方隊員不知炸彈接近油站分分鐘自己都畀人炸死&quot;&gt;辯方：隊員不知炸彈接近油站、「分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第二被告張銘裕的大律師姚本成進行結案陳詞。辯方指，吳智鴻一方沒有要求「屠龍」成員協助製作引爆器及遙控。辯方又指，即使張曾向群組發送遙控器的照片，但不代表照片是從吳一方收到，因沒有相關紀錄，而且成員經常會將收到的資訊分享並公諸同好。辯方續指，不能因此推論張參與殺警計劃。辯方又指，「屠龍」隊長黃振強隱瞞事實，在隊員背後自行計劃在12月1日使用炸彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另指，對話顯示直至行動前兩日，有隊員仍然問將會執行哪一計劃，這顯示隊員仍然不知道計劃。辯方提到，隊員不知道行動「好大鑊」，而且後果不堪設想，導致「會死好多人」。另外，辯方引述黃承認刻意不讓隊員知道炸彈及槍手位置的地圖，只有黃、吳及槍手知道。辯方指，地圖顯示炸彈地點接近油站，但黃卻隱瞞地圖，「唔講 Location，容乜易連自己都畀人炸埋，分分鐘自己都畀人炸死」，這導致隊員未能衡量自身安全，亦未能選擇是否參加。黃在盤問下承認交由隊員自行判斷，辯方形容其說法是「你死你事」。辯方又指，黃承認未有向隊員交代行動後要離港。辯方質疑，黃沒有為隊員提供後路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強的證供可靠性是零&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強的證供可靠性是零&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，即使張在行動前一晚身處安全屋及管有避彈衣，亦不等於準備要執行大行動，因黃在行動日的凌晨才知悉行動實際內容。黃在視察路線後更沒有向隊員交代情況。辯方最後指，黃的可靠性及信用是零，其證供亦前言不對後語，不能以其證供定任何人的罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭軍壕父親為警察-辯方質疑是police-baby有冇包庇我唔知&quot;&gt;彭軍壕父親為警察 辯方質疑是「Police baby」、「有冇包庇我唔知」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一污點證人彭軍壕，辯方指他亦非誠實可靠的證人。辯方解釋，彭一早認罪，鑑於其父親是警察，故「有冇包庇我唔知道、唔想講」。辯方又形容他是「Police baby」，因此：「差人見到佢就閒話家常、安撫情緒，三十幾歲人喇！」辯方認為，彭的證供原本是用作針對吳，因彭是其「左右手」，但後來吳選擇認罪，因此其證供變為針對本案被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方警察未有破解彭電話&quot;&gt;辯方：警察未有破解彭電話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，彭一直拒絕交出電話密碼，警方卻未有破解並擷取其電話內容，「點解唔用？我唔知道。點解電話內容唔畀人知呀？因為有啲嘢唔可以話畀人聽？」辯方總結，沒有證供證明張自11月18日起，在知情下參與串謀，因此唯一合理的決定就是判張無罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（9日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

While it is often treated as a luxury, it builds the baseline of defence and enables a whole host of terrestrial capabilities that are essential to modern-day warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is essential to everyday life – think GPS, for example – but its equally vital role in defence is often forgotten. This is partly because, unlike the other domains, space is not immediately obvious or visible. Space is often the invisible enabler and, because it is usually operating smoothly, it is not just taken for granted, but altogether forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Ministry of Defence has stated that “the vast majority of operations could not be sustained without space capabilities”. This includes several elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GPS for navigation and crucial timing signals, used not only for the tracking of troops, but also for guided munitions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Satellite Communications (SATCOM) for beyond line-of-sight communications (including ships and aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Space-enabled intelligence (such as satellite imagery and radar information) that provides surveillance and reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is not altogether new to space and as such owns the legacy system Skynet, which provides secure SATCOM links. In other areas, however, the UK is still in the process of collating its capabilities. For example, the sovereign constellation ISTARI, intended to supplement ISR, was announced at the same time as the Defence Space Strategy in 2022, but the project launch is not planned until 2026. Often, the UK relies on other states for capabilities. For navigation, for example, the UK is entirely reliant on the US for the availability of GPS (the European version, Galileo, is no longer accessible to the UK as a result of Brexit). The UK also depends on commercial providers – for example, Babcock manages and operates the Skynet constellation. With UK sovereign space assets limited, this spells two necessities for the future: resilience, and commercial tie-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-importance-of-resilience&quot;&gt;The Importance of Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has highlighted the fact that space is by no means off limits in modern conflict: the satellite-enabled internet provider Viasat experienced a cyber-attack on the morning of the invasion in February 2022. Shortly after, Starlink seemed to have been targeted via electromagnetic and cyber means. Since the Russian troops achieved their originally planned positioning, widespread GPS jamming and spoofing has been taking place, also affecting Western weapons systems such as Excalibur, HIMARS and JDAM. It is evident that disruption in the electromagnetic spectrum is to be expected in any future conflict; this could mean the limited availability, if not complete absence, of certain communications systems and navigational data. This means that resilience is required to ensure the availability of crucial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Space is often the invisible enabler and, because it is usually operating smoothly, it is not just taken for granted, but altogether forgotten&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications systems already have a PACE approach – primary, alternative, contingency and emergency – to ensure there are several layers on which to fall back. It would be useful to apply a similar thinking to space systems, especially for positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), where the UK is entirely reliant on the US GPS system. The MoD’s Space Industrial Plan included a proposal for “MoD Time” as a “system of last resort” to ensure that timing signals are available continuously. A further way to increase the resilience of space systems is the use of the commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-with-the-commercial-sector&quot;&gt;Working with the Commercial Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial space sector has seen exponential growth over the past decade, in some cases outpacing the developments of sovereign space actors with its innovations. Making use of the commercial sector – by buying into already existing services, rather than procuring a sovereign asset – makes sense. This is happening to some extent already; however, the commercial sector often laments the lack of clarity for requirements and the overbearing bureaucracy of procurement processes, which are often unfit for smaller space companies. Meanwhile, the lack of communication around long-term planning and asset procurement makes it difficult for industry to plan ahead and provide services accordingly. This is despite the promise stated in the Defence Space Strategy that “defence investment through a blend of assured commercial and military grade solutions will continue to increase flexibility, adaptability, tempo, resilience and overall agility of the Armed Forces”. One solution might be found in the communication of a clear strategy that guarantees open channels of communications – similar to the US Space Force Commercial Space Strategy, which further sets out questions of increased risk for commercial companies – for instance, what happens when a commercial asset is attacked while in the service of a government actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defence Space Strategy outlined the concept of “own, collaborate or access” (OCA): the ways in which space services can be procured. The realisation has already set in at Space Command that perhaps the order of priority of OCA is misguided, and tie-ins with the commercial sector and allies should be prioritised more, similar to the US Space Force approach of “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build what we must”. Clear priorities must be set in accordance with the diversity of space services and assets required – there is no “one size fits all” approach when it comes to the complex and multi-layered system of space defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-detection-of-and-response-to-space-threats&quot;&gt;The Detection of and Response to Space Threats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final consideration is the detection of and response to space threats. While we have observed non-kinetic attacks on satellites through electromagnetic and cyber countermeasures in Ukraine the UK’s competitors and adversaries are capable of further threats – not only kinetic anti-satellite weapons, but also in-orbit surveillance and potential intercepts. Russia demonstrated its capability to kinetically destroy a satellite in 2021, using a direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon – a system that China tested back in 2007. Further, Russian satellites have been seen moving close to US military satellites and a joint French-Italian constellation. Whether these missions served the purpose of photographing the sensitive assets, or potentially intercepting their signals, or if they were simply activity intended to cause concern is difficult to tell. However, not all threats to satellites are of a nefarious nature: space debris does not choose its victims and neither do solar flares that can expose satellites to increased radiation and atmospheric drag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lack of communication around long-term planning and asset procurement makes it difficult for industry to plan ahead and provide services accordingly&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether environmental or nefarious space threats, the UK must be able to keep an eye on its own assets and their surroundings, and be able to respond to potential threats in a timely manner. With the radar facility at RAF Fylingdales, the UK receives access to the space data provided by the US, which host the most comprehensive space data collection available. It is important, however, that the UK continues to invest in its own Space Domain Awareness capabilities to improve its threat assessment processes, enabling fast and apt reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What Now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the new UK government sets its sights on a new defence review, it is evident that space can and should not be forgotten – to do so would be to undermine the very foundation on which UK defence capabilities are built. Not investing now in the ability to detect and respond to threats, as well as the resilience of space assets, risks limiting the UK’s ability to act and react in potential conflict scenarios in the future. It is important to invest now in the resilience of systems and guarantee access to systems through tie-ins with allies and commercial partners. NATO, as it builds up its space capabilities through its member states, will continue to be a crucial conduit for Western space collaboration. This, however, should not prevent the UK from looking for further like-minded allies with whom to invest in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, both in the Western and Ukrainian media, there has been a discussion about the problems associated with the recruitment of new military personnel into the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This coverage presents the current situation in a distorted form, which often does not correspond to reality and completely misdirects uninitiated and even partially initiated observers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, this concerns the very facts of mobilisation in Ukraine. From the end of 2023 to the beginning of 2024, changes to the Law “On Mobilisation Preparation and Mobilisation” were adopted in Ukraine, which were supposed to simplify its procedures, and were accompanied by sharp political debates regarding some of its controversial proposals. In connection with this, much speculation began to appear to the effect that Ukraine allegedly has not mobilised, and therefore is not able to provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the necessary manpower. Such assessments are incorrect and do not reflect the real problems that Ukraine is trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Constitution of Ukraine, the protection of its sovereignty and territorial integrity – although entrusted to the Armed Forces of Ukraine – is the duty of every citizen. From the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Ukrainian government decided to impose martial law and declared general mobilisation, along with a ban on men aged 18 to 60 leaving the country. Although general mobilisation was announced, this did not mean that all men were to be drafted into the Armed Forces at the same time. In accordance with procedure, general mobilisation is carried out in several waves: first, the mobilisation of the operational reserve – that is, persons who already had combat experience in the course of repelling Russian aggression in Donbas in the period after 2014 – is carried out; in the second wave, there is a mobilisation of former military personnel who did not have such combat experience; in the third wave, persons who underwent military training while studying at civilian universities are mobilised; and only then are all other persons who do not have age or health restrictions called up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The number of volunteers traditionally falls after the first year of a war, as other European countries have repeatedly experienced before – for example, during the First World War&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, the number of people willing to join the army significantly exceeded the Armed Forces’ needs, and at that time there were queues at enlistment offices. In total, as of July 2022, the Defense Forces of Ukraine numbered almost 1 million people, most of whom were mobilised. Throughout 2022 and 2023, constant mobilisation measures were carried out to replenish losses, replacing the dead and seriously wounded. These measures also did not require excessive efforts; usually, the military commanders simply sent out a significant quantity of summonses and the number of people who appeared for them was sufficient to complete the necessary reserves. Difficulties with the recruitment of new military personnel began to arise only at the end of 2023, after the Ukrainian counteroffensive was choked off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the decrease in the number of those willing to mobilise was the general awareness that the war has acquired a protracted nature – that is, it can and will last for years – as well as the lack of demobilisation mechanisms. In other words, mobilisation began to be perceived as a one-way ticket, where the only way to end service is to die or become disabled. Under such conditions, joining the army entailed a practical rejection of hopes for a normal life, destroyed families, and being forced to leave one’s profession forever. After more than two years of war and without any indication of when soldiers could be demobilised, military service began to be perceived as slavery, and not as a temporary, albeit very difficult duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, this did not change Ukrainians’ perception of the war as an existential threat, nor did it significantly reduce the country’s readiness to resist aggression, but it did reduce the number of people who are willing to join the ranks of the Armed Forces without coercion. There is nothing surprising in this, since the number of volunteers traditionally falls after the first year of a war, as other European countries have repeatedly experienced before – for example, during the First World War. With the decrease in the number of volunteers, it became clear that the system of recruiting and even registering conscripts in Ukraine was working extremely unsatisfactorily, and enlistment officers often do not even have a clear idea about where exactly potential recruits live. Mobilisation began to demand certain efforts from the government for which it was not ready, and experiments with the use of coercion in mobilisation were not always successful. The public debate about the problems facing the government has not been very helpful either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has become a pattern for Ukraine, modern technology came to the aid of the government. Understanding the military’s inability to form a single system of accounting for conscripts, the Ministry of Defense launched the mobile application “Reserve+”, in which every man could update data about his location, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as clarify his military accounting specialty, rank and state of health. In the first days of the application’s operation, more than a million reservists were registered; as of the beginning of July 2024, more than 2 million people had been registered in “Reserve+”. Taking into account the fact that before the occupation of the south of Ukraine – where several million Ukrainians live – the total number of people suitable for military service was about 6 million, as well as the fact that Reserve+ is not the only system for joining the reserve and works in parallel with the usual appeal to the enlistment offices, such results are more than satisfactory. It can be hoped that by the end of August 2024, the vast majority of reservists will be registered on the mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It must be recognised that in today’s highly mechanised and hi-tech war environment, manpower without weapons and military equipment has no meaning&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the positive prospects of such an initiative, which has significantly improved the situation with regard to mobilisation by immediately finding several million potential soldiers, it is not able to solve the most fundamental shortcoming. The new Law “On Mobilisation Training and Mobilisation” did not provide an answer to the question of when demobilisation should take place and how many years a mobilised person should serve, which in the conditions of a protracted war creates unnecessary uncertainty and reduces motivation to join the army. Solving this problem is possible by changing approaches to the composition of the Armed Forces of Ukraine – namely, increasing the total number of military professionals who must sign three-, five- and seven-year contracts, as well as establishing a maximum limit of service for those who are mobilised, which could be three years. Ukraine had such an experience in 2015–2016, when demobilisation and replacement of mobilised persons by professionals took place while maintaining the total strength of the Armed Forces. At that time, a significant number of those who had been mobilised signed contracts and continued to serve. In Russia, where the government has tried to avoid an unpopular mobilisation, recruitment into the Armed Forces is largely done through individuals signing short-term – even one-year – contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, one must recognise that in today’s highly mechanised and hi-tech war environment, manpower without weapons and military equipment has no meaning. Ukraine definitely needs to increase the manpower of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and replenish losses, and initiatives such as “Reserve+” demonstrate that it is capable of doing this. However, the combat effectiveness of units depends not only on their number, but also on the level of provision of military equipment. There are still more than 30 territorial defence brigades in the Armed Forces, armed only with small arms and mortars, although they could be transformed into full-fledged mechanised brigades if they were to be provided with armoured vehicles, artillery, electronic warfare equipment and so on. The insufficient amount of weapons and military equipment is also a problem for regular brigades. For example, the 14 reserve brigades created by Ukraine cannot be used in combat zones due to the delay in the delivery of equipment that was promised by partners. Thus, success depends in the end not only on the improvement of Ukrainian recruiting, but also on the quality of Western logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security situation in Europe is rapidly worsening, with several concurrent trends making direct conflict with Russia before the end of the 2020s a serious risk. In conjunction with serious financial constraints, this will likely force the new UK government to make major course correction decisions in the Strategic Defence Review (SDR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most pressing concern is that Ukraine is increasingly struggling to contain slow but steady Russian advances on multiple parts of the frontlines, especially near Pokrovsk. The situation can still be salvaged, but doing so will require increased support over a sustained period from the UK and other allies, as well as changes on the Ukrainian side to reform mobilisation and training. Second, the US is increasingly militarily overstretched and unable to defeat aggression by China and Russia at the same time. Third, a potential second Trump presidency would likely weaken the political credibility of US security guarantees to NATO. Fourth, Russia’s economy is now on a war footing, and is producing large quantities of equipment, ammunition and vehicles, alongside a sustained mobilisation and training rate which has seen its forces in Ukraine grow to over 470,000 by early 2024. By contrast, the UK’s own stockpiles of ammunition, equipment and trained personnel have been left dangerously hollowed out by decades of underinvestment relative to political ambitions. Worse, the situation is similar in many other European countries, despite notable exceptions such as Finland and Poland – so relying on allies to fill the gaps is not a credible strategy in key capability areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine is defeated either in part or in full, and/or if the US is perceived as either unable or unwilling to come to Europe’s defence at scale, then there is a serious risk that Russia might invade part of a NATO member state’s territory within the next 3-5 years. Such aggression would likely be intended to trigger an Article V call from a member state over a limited amount of territory, gambling that European states could be deterred from taking the risk of going to war to eject Russian troops by force. The incentive for Russia to take such a gamble if it thinks it can get away without a coherent military response from Europe is huge, since such an outcome would fatally undermine the credibility of collective defence through NATO on which the whole European security architecture is based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, defence may not have been a key vote-winner at the last election, but the scale and potential imminence of the threat to European security from Russia means that this government may be tested on the readiness of the UK’s defences within the term of this Parliament in a way that has not been seen since the Falklands War. Being perceived as having failed such a test in the face of Russian aggression is one of the few foreseeable scenarios that could all-but-guarantee a defeat at the next election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is very significant combat potential that could be rapidly unlocked with the right investments in core aircraft fleets that the RAF and Royal Navy already have&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, investing in regenerating the combat power of the UK’s existing combat aircraft fleets offers a route to rapid increases in meaningful combat capabilities that Russia would have to take significant account of in any decision to risk war with NATO. Russian military strategists and leaders alike rightly fear NATO airpower, because they understand that the Russian Army would be rapidly and decisively destroyed by multirole fighters and attack helicopters if NATO was able to gain air superiority over a contested area. The Russian Army is not some insurgent force that can try to hide from air strikes among the civilian population; to pose a threat it must deploy its tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery, logistics and electronic warfare equipment in the field and keep them there. If air superiority can be gained and exploited, Europe’s relatively large numbers of fourth-generation jets and helicopters could efficiently conduct close air support and interdiction missions to rapidly destroy the Russian Army in any contested territory. While the specialised standoff weapons needed to gain air superiority are very expensive, direct-attack munitions such as Paveway and JDAM series bombs cost only a few tens of thousands of pounds per weapon, and each fighter can use them to destroy multiple Russian vehicles per sortie once air superiority is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat is why Russia has invested so much resource and effort in developing its formidable ground-based air defence (GBAD) network. Currently, only the US has the capacity to conduct a full suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) campaign against that GBAD network, so Europe on its own would struggle to win air superiority against Russian forces. However, these GBAD systems are finite, have suffered some attrition in Ukraine already and have known weaknesses. They also represent a target set that NATO Air Command fundamentally understands how to defeat in technical and operational terms. The problem is not that solutions are not available, but rather that no European member states have yet invested in the necessary combination of suitable aircraft, weapons, specialist training and enablers, although some are making progress in this area. As one of the leading European NATO members, the UK can and should help plug this gap. Doing so would help rapidly reestablish Europe’s ability to fight for, win and exploit air superiority in a way that would mean Russia would be highly unlikely to risk a direct military clash. Achieving the same deterrent effect with UK land forces or maritime assets is almost certainly impossible, at least this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the British Army, which has struggled to effectively design and procure replacement vehicles for its Warfighting Division after configuring for counterinsurgency, the RAF has already been largely recapitalised with a balanced mix of relatively modern platforms across all its core mission sets. In a somewhat ironic twist, the slow nature of defence procurement programmes – especially in the air domain – now makes it easier to adapt the RAF to the new Russian threat paradigm. This is because many RAF aircraft and weapons systems were originally designed for Cold War scenarios against Russia’s currently deployed capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Typhoon FGR.4 was designed specifically to overmatch Russian “Flanker” family fighters in air-to-air combat, especially using the very long-range European Meteor air-to-air missile, which was also designed with the same threats in mind. In addition, it is a capable close-air-support and long-range cruise missile launch asset. Its primary weakness is that as a multirole aircraft that forms the bulk of UK combat air capability, the fleet is constantly deployed all over the world for a range of operations, international exercises and standing commitments. Pilots also fly significantly less than they did a decade ago, and much of the flying that they do get is on long transits or patrols as part of overseas deployments that provide little training value for high-intensity mission sets. With so many mission sets to train to, even modernised and well-employed synthetic training in the simulator cannot allow the Typhoon crews to be adequately trained and ready across the board with such a task load. To regain the very high levels of capability in the air-to-air domain that they had in the mid-to-late 2010s, the Typhoon force needs additional financial and maintenance resources to increase core flying training hours; additional stocks of AIM-132 ASRAAM, AIM-120 ARMAAM and Meteor air to air missiles; and above all a reduction in discretionary overseas activity to allow the Force to focus on training for high-intensity mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the F-35B flown by the RAF and Royal Navy was designed specifically to destroy Russian GBAD networks. It features a combination of stealth, onboard electronic attack capabilities and unmatched sensors and software that can rapidly identify, locate and designate hostile radars for attacks. Despite drawbacks including high operating costs, and delays to new deliveries and retrofit schedules for important TR3 hardware and software upgrades within the programme, in the air the aircraft already provides genuinely unmatched combat capability against high-end Russian threats. The author has seen both from the ground and from the cockpit during NATO exercises how even a few F-35s can greatly enhance the survivability and lethality of the fourth-generation fighters around them by providing electronic attack support and real-time situational awareness on threats, as well as using their own limited internal weapons capacity to destroy particularly serious threats. However, the RAF/RN F-35B fleet is very small, with only 34 aircraft at the time of writing, and 48 due to be in service by the end of 2025. Royal Navy Carrier Strike Group deployments also take the bulk of the operational fleet far from the UK for months at a time every few years. Plans were at an advanced stage under the previous government to purchase 27 additional F-35Bs, but with delivery spread out over dates up until 2033. The UK has a high level of dependency on the F-35 not only for the Carrier Strike Group, but also as an essential force multiplier and SEAD/DEAD asset for the RAF against Russia in Europe, and for the British Army to provide targeting data for its planned long-range precision strike assets. Therefore, since the fleet is manifestly too small to meet the many requirements of it, there is a strong argument for the planned additional tranche of aircraft to be acquired as fast as possible, in order to deliver increased capacity in the mid-to-late 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest limitation for the UK’s F-35Bs at present, however, is the lack of suitable weapons. For ground attack the fleet only has Paveway IV free-fall bombs, which are totally unsuitable for use against high-end Russian GBAD systems or targets protected by them. No other F-35 operator has such illogically constrained air-to-ground weapons options, and the SDR should prioritise fixing this deficit as fast as possible. The UK has developed the MBDA SPEAR 3 missile, designed specifically to work with the F-35’s sensor suite to reliably destroy Russian air defence targets from safe stand-off ranges even when those targets have ceased emitting and are repositioning. It is an almost ideal weapon to allow UK F-35s to address the core challenge preventing European NATO forces from gaining air superiority over a Russian force by destroying their GBAD network. However, in classic UK fashion a combination of very small order quantities, slow development and disagreements between industry and the Ministry of Defence has led to a very high cost-per-weapon. Large-scale orders in exchange for aggressive investment by MBDA in speeding up deliveries and increasing production capacity should be explored. Multinational production deals with allies should also be explored, since the weapon is not only ideal for the F-35 but could also provide significant SEAD/DEAD capabilities for Typhoon and potentially other fourth-generation jets due to its powered standoff range. In the interim, the UK should procure an urgent stopgap order of the US-made GBU-53/B. This is a relatively affordable glide bomb with an active millimetric radar seeker for terminal guidance against hostile vehicles like SAM systems, and is available quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The E-7A Wedgetail airborne warning and control system is ideally suited for providing early detection and wide-area tracking of incoming Russian cruise missiles fired from bombers in the Arctic. However, too few have been ordered to guarantee one on station for the medium term – a task which requires at least four and ideally five, rather than the three on order. The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is the finest airborne anti-submarine asset available today, and is already operated by the UK’s most important allies in the task of tracking Russian submarines in the North Atlantic and the Arctic – the US and Norway. The RC-135W Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft, meanwhile, has been instrumental in collecting vital signals and electronic intelligence on Russian forces in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is very significant combat potential that could be rapidly unlocked with the right investments in core aircraft fleets that the RAF and Royal Navy already have. The fleets are smaller than they would ideally be, almost across the board, but the more urgent problem is a lack of sufficient weapons stocks to fulfil the RAF’s key potential combat roles within NATO against Russia in a conflict. By investing urgently in procuring significantly increased numbers of key weapon types, increased spares and maintenance capacity to enable more flying hours and focusing training time on core high-intensity mission sets, the combat power of the RAF in a NATO context could be greatly enhanced in just a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The SDR should prioritise investment in weapons, maintenance capacity and high-end training to regenerate the combat power of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm as part of NATO over the coming years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, combat capability is not the only consideration for the government when looking at balance of investment choices. There will be a natural desire to invest in long-term programmes that bring value to the UK defence industry, international partnerships and trade. The most obvious and high-profile of these is the Global Combat Aircraft Programme (GCAP) with Japan and Italy. Perhaps the defining political choice of this SDR will be the degree to which the government invests limited resources in these long-term projects as opposed to plugging the capability gaps in the current force to enable it to play a core role in defending NATO against Russian aggression this decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to those for whom long-term ambitions such as GCAP or AUKUS submarines are the top priority, it is worth stressing that those programmes are themselves dependent on avoiding a wider war with Russia in Europe this decade. Unless swiftly and decisively repelled, a Russian attack on NATO territory would see a scramble to desperately shore up national defences with whatever was immediately or rapidly available, coupled with serious economic destabilisation. Such an outcome would almost certainly spell disaster for long-term industrial programmes like GCAP that aim to deliver capability in the mid-to-late 2030s. Furthermore, if the UK’s current fast jet fleets fail to perform as they should against the Russian threat they were designed to fight due to inadequate weapons and core flying training resources, it would undermine the political narratives in the UK and elsewhere about the unique edge that such combat aircraft supposedly bring to defending countries against aggression. That too could be devastating for the long-term prospects of the UK’s combat aircraft industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SDR should prioritise investment in weapons, maintenance capacity and high-end training to regenerate the combat power of the RAF and Fleet Air Arm as part of NATO over the coming years. The UK will then be able to look to future programmes from a position of much greater strength and security against the enduring belligerence of Russia and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：黃振強未經隊員同意下擅自決定配合行動、其他人「被賣豬仔」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xt91aVU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（7日）踏入第67日審訊，辯方繼續結案陳詞。審訊期間，「屠龍」隊長黃振強供稱答應吳智鴻會配合其用槍及炸彈行動，惟辯方指，黃承認事前沒有問過隊員，而隊員亦不知道行動內容，更無同意過會配合行動。辯方強調，黃未經「屠龍」隊員同意下擅自決定，導致其他隊員「被拉落水」及「被賣豬仔」。辯方亦指，黃振強並非「事事都代表屠龍」，而他個人的串謀，不等於其他隊員亦有參與其中。辯方又強調，不能對「勇武派」有偏見：「勇武唔係等於想殺差人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方屠龍隊長黃振強無向隊員解釋計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：「屠龍」隊長黃振強無向隊員解釋計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第二被告張銘裕的大律師姚本成進行結案陳詞。辯方表示，控方指控3項與張有關的事件，即張參與9月台灣軍訓、於10月1日向吳索槍及11月16日到西貢試槍，均並非串謀一部分。辯方解釋，「屠龍」的隊長黃振強於11月18日才加入吳智鴻的串謀協議，但黃從沒有向張清楚解釋12.8計劃，因此張沒有可能參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強自把自為代表屠龍答應配合計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強自把自為代表「屠龍」答應配合計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，張並不知道吳一方的計劃牽涉槍及炸彈，亦不知道黃振強自把自為代表「屠龍」答應配合。張的立場是不會親手用槍及炸彈。辯方續指，即使黃表示在12月7日在安全屋已向隊員解釋計劃，但說法並不可信。而張曾於11月27日在群組發送引爆器片段，辯方指這是資訊分享，與行動部署無關。辯方又指，3名從犯證人有作供動機，因此處理他們的證供時要小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃承認隊員不知道計劃內容&quot;&gt;辯方：黃承認隊員不知道計劃內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就首名作供的污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強，辯方逐一指出其證供有問題之處。根據黃與「閃燈隊」Kristy 在12月3日的對話中，以及他接受盤問時的說法，黃承認隊員當時不知道計劃內容，亦承認只有自己想殺警察。黃另承認隊員之間沒有共識於12月8日要執行哪一計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方勇武派不代表殺人犯不能有偏見&quot;&gt;辯方：勇武派不代表殺人犯、不能有偏見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黃另承認12月7日前，不肯定有否與隊員談及計劃，亦不肯定他們是否知悉。辯方指出，於行動前一日、即12月8日的凌晨，黃沒有向隊員解釋計劃。辯方強調不能對「勇武派」有偏見：「勇武唔係等於想殺差人」、「勇武唔代表殺人犯」，仇恨警察亦不等於要殺警。辯方又指，不能因為作為主犯的黃振強認罪，而牽連其他「屠龍」成員，「香港沒有連坐法，唔係一個人犯罪，全部都有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃自告奮勇做主導代表其他成員&quot;&gt;辯方：黃自告奮勇做主導、代表其他成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，「屠龍」實際上是很鬆散的組織，雖然黃自認隊長，但李家田卻指無人承認過黃是隊長。辯方指，黃是一個「無認受性、無牙力」的隊長，隊員不一定要跟隨隊長的意見，同時可以選擇不參與示威活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，黃經常「自告奮勇做主導」，在沒有授權之下代表屠龍行事及面對其他人，例如自行管理及使用資金、以「屠龍」名義受訪。黃亦以「屠龍」名義利己，包括賭錢及還債。辯方指，黃在短短3個月內突然獲得過百萬，但他只是21歲的年青人，「畀啲錢浸死，咁多錢包圍住佢，唔壞都變壞。」而隊員並不知道黃手上有大量金錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃甚少向隊員交代部分人被賣豬仔&quot;&gt;辯方：黃甚少向隊員交代、部分人被「賣豬仔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃亦承認通常與「軍師」計劃行動，甚少向隊員交代，只著隊員到時候聽從其指揮。辯方指，這情況同樣適用在12.8計劃，「隊員係唔知佢搞邊科」、「畀人賣豬仔」、「畀佢點到頭都暈」。辯方舉出黃未經授權擅自行事的例子，包括向吳建議12月1日在尖沙咀用槍及炸彈、於12月6日擅自向吳索槍。辯方引述李家田證供，指小隊成員沒有授權黃代表「屠龍」與吳一方商討或交涉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃承認隊員沒有同意過配合用槍炸彈計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：黃承認隊員沒有同意過配合用槍炸彈計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;小隊曾經舉行過兩次會議，於11月17日的大鴻輝會議，及11月23日的三陂坊會議，前者有成員表示：「人哋用槍人哋嘅事，用槍殺警察咪搞我」，後者則是成員之間達成共識不會用槍及炸彈殺警。黃亦承認成員沒有同意過配合吳一方的用槍及炸彈計劃。辯方引述黃與「閃燈隊」Kristy 的對話，黃承認其他隊員不想殺警，只有黃自己想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方張銘裕出發點是唔會殺差人&quot;&gt;辯方：張銘裕出發點是「唔會殺差人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方指控張的3項事件，辯方認為不屬串謀協議部分。第一是參與台灣軍訓，辯方指軍訓在9月進行，當時「屠龍」尚未加入串謀協議，而且黃承認當時未知道有12.8計劃，亦無附加條件例如之後要用槍殺警，因此與控罪無關。辯方補充，張並不認識吳智鴻，只是在軍訓前兩人有聯絡，惟吳「好狼」地提出「玩暗殺狗」，張馬上回覆自己未必是適合的人選。辯方指，這顯示張的出發點是「唔會殺差人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方張因一時憤怒提出索槍其後不了了之&quot;&gt;辯方：張因一時憤怒提出索槍，其後不了了之&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二，是控方指張於10月1日向吳索取手槍一事，辯方指關注點是為何要索槍，並指僅屬憤怒下的情緒反應。辯方指，黃振強於作供時承認10月1日有示威者遭警方以真槍射傷後，勇武派包括「屠龍」都很憤怒，稱「個個都話要擸架生」。辯方總結，張因為一時激動而索槍，但其後不了了之，沒有證據顯示他改變立場要殺警。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第三，是張於11月到西貢行山試槍，辯方指張「臨時畀人拉夫入去」參與，黃在事件前早一晚才「臨急臨忙」找他代替。辯方強調，「屠龍」參與行山試槍並非希望參與串謀，目的只是「睇吓佢哋係咪吹水」，以證實吳一方是否管有槍械炸彈。辯方又指，吳之所以在試槍後將手槍交李家田，而非張銘裕，是因吳知道張不想用槍，因此不可信賴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃未經隊員同意下擅自決定&quot;&gt;辯方：黃未經隊員同意下擅自決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃供稱，11月18日，他與吳在觀塘康寧道球場見面，吳表示正預備槍械及炸藥，行動期間「屠龍」會負責引警方，黃回應會配合吳的行動。在盤問下，黃承認答應前沒有問過隊員，而隊員亦無同意過配合行動，但黃相信與隊員的共識一致。辯方強調，黃在未經「屠龍」隊員的同意下，自行作決定，即「behind members’ back」，導致其他隊員「被拉落水」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指黃亦「屠龍」亦沒有共識如何使用「20 kg」炸彈，因此黃稱「我哋 Team 諗好點用」是謊言。辯方最後強調，黃振強並非「事事都代表屠龍」，同時指他個人的串謀，不等於其他隊員亦有參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（8日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指「屠龍」隊長黃振強是「騙子」、為減刑而「作故仔」牽連隊友&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NRS8FEC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（6日）踏入第66日審訊。辯方開始結案陳詞，指作為污點證人的「屠龍」隊長黃振強，其證供不盡不實，而且「呃隊友、係欺騙感情嘅騙子、一個大話冚另一個大話」，而就他私吞資金賭錢方面亦「鐵證如山」。辯方指黃利用隊友以獲得報酬，惟隊友一直被蒙在鼓裡，對計劃內容不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方需肯定被告知道最終目的&quot;&gt;辯方：需肯定被告知道最終目的&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表首被告張俊富的大律師李國輔進行結案陳詞。他指控方需要舉證至毫無合理疑點，才可證明被告犯罪，而「懷疑」、「可能」、「應該係」、「好似」等均不屬完全肯定的舉證標準。辯方強調，就串謀控罪，參與者需要知道最終非法目的；若陪審團未能肯定張俊富知道串謀的最終目的，則要裁定罪名不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方行動不牽涉對無辜公眾造成傷害&quot;&gt;辯方：行動不牽涉對無辜公眾造成傷害&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指控方在開案陳詞階段，曾表示炸彈會導致非警務人員受傷，因此辯方誤會「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的對象只涉公眾，但不牽涉警員，後來他作出澄清。辯方強調，本案不會牽涉對公眾人士造成傷害，他引述污點證人彭軍壕的證供指，吳智鴻表示預計爆炸時不會有其他「唔關事」的人。以另一證人蘇緯軒的理解，行動執行時不會傷及無辜。就「串謀謀殺」罪，辯方強調控方必須有證據證明被告是有意圖殺警員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方並指，不能因張管有彈叉等攻擊性武器，而推論其犯案傾向性較高；即使他有參與「屠龍」的示威，亦不代表他有參與本案的計劃。對於控方指考慮2019年背景後，本案串謀呼之欲出，辯方表示：「我不敢苟同。」他提醒陪審團，絕不能夠考慮案發時的社會氛圍後，就裁定被告必然知道及參與計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃振強利用隊友-且是感情騙子&quot;&gt;辯方：黃振強利用隊友 且是「感情騙子」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就首名作供的污點證人、「屠龍」隊長黃振強，辯方指黃「言行不一、講一套做一套、呃隊友、係欺騙感情嘅騙子」。辯方又指，黃會利用隊友並隱瞞對方，「係一個機會主義者」，而張俊富或被蒙在鼓裡及被利用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃證供不盡不實屢砌詞狡辯&quot;&gt;辯方：黃證供不盡不實、屢砌詞狡辯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦指，黃的證供不盡不實、充滿疑點，他作供時經常砌詞狡辯、閃縮迴避，「一個大話冚另一個大話。」在盤問階段，黃被發現用小隊資金賭錢，控方在結案時一度問：「係咪可以用貪威識食、爛賭嚟形容？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃為獲更多減刑而作故仔牽連其他人&quot;&gt;辯方：黃為獲更多減刑而「作故仔」牽連其他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，認罪被告作為控方證人，會獲得比一般認罪較多的減刑折扣。前者可獲五成折扣，後者則僅三分一，故辯方認為黃作供存在誘因。辯方續指，黃為「攞著數」而「作故仔、加鹽加醋、故弄玄虛」，把不相關的人牽連在內，並剪裁事實令其他被告入罪。辯方建議，陪審團處理黃的證供時要小心。辯方又指，黃獲得豁免起訴書，他毋須承擔犯法行為，因此需考慮他會否作出虛假及誤導的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方私吞資金賭錢鐵證如山&quot;&gt;辯方：私吞資金賭錢「鐵證如山」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黃起初否認有賭錢習慣，後來在辯方展示馬會投注紀錄後，黃才承認有用小隊資金賭錢。辯方強調，黃私吞資金賭錢屬「鐵證如山」。他在社會運動期間的5個月，共賭錢約170次，總共48萬，最大一次的投注金額為5萬元。對於黃多次表示「唔記得」及「無印象」，辯方質疑他是砌詞狡辯，「相唔相信佢會唔記得自己賭錢，呢個唔係咁好嘅行為呢？」辯方補充，如非有馬會紀錄，「相信真相一定石沉大海。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃以誇張失實說法作招徠籌錢&quot;&gt;辯方：黃以誇張失實說法作招徠籌錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述「育龍」頻道的訊息，內容提及「絕非帶有偷呃拐騙目的」，但黃實際上將錢自用，更隱瞞隊友及捐款者，例如到泰國進行「點到即止嘅嫖妓」，以滿足一己私欲。另外，「育龍」頻道曾發訊息表示「公會目標集齊30粒龍心」，黃承認意思指殺害30名警察。辯方指他以誇張失實的說法作招徠，以籌集更多金錢。辯方又指，黃聲稱以10萬元買100支汽油彈，平均每支1,000元。辯方質疑，黃的說法誇張，他利用差價將資金據為己有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃漠視隊員共識私下索取手槍&quot;&gt;辯方：黃漠視隊員共識、私下索取手槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指黃知道屠龍成員反對親手使用炸彈及槍，仍漠視隊員之間的共識，瞞着隊友向吳智鴻索取手槍。辯方指，吳明知隊友反對仍一意孤行，由此可見吳亦會隱瞞12.8計劃，「越少人知，就越少人阻止。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黃提出第二次到台灣，只屬軍訓，並非他所指的「走佬 Plan」。辯方解釋，黃只打算獨自離港，若然隊員清楚事態如此嚴重，則「冇可能佢哋唔一齊走」。辯方認為，黃「賣隊友豬仔」，利用完他們後「自己走先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃淡化罪責用謊言保障自己&quot;&gt;辯方：黃淡化罪責、用謊言保障自己&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃在錄影會面表示，訛稱自己受傷而缺席行山試槍，又指自己不想接觸槍械，只是為了獲得吳的百多萬而投其所好。但他卻在庭上解釋，回答警方問題時狀態欠佳、記憶混亂。辯方認為，黃是在淡化自己罪責、混淆視聽。辯方又指，黃可能捏造被警方毆打的說法，不斷用謊言保障自己，這反映其證供不盡不實，若依賴他的證供會很危險。辯方亦提醒，不能單憑訊息字面推論，張必然對串謀有認知及參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方20-kg不一定指炸彈可指煙花炮仗&quot;&gt;辯方：「20 kg」不一定指炸彈，可指煙花炮仗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方曾表明，各被告在群組提及的「20 kg」是指吳一方的炸彈。但辯方認為，「20 kg」可以是指煙花炮仗，因黃曾與隊員分享用煙花炮仗嚇公安的片段。辯方又指，只有黃及「軍師」知道用槍及炸彈的計劃，其他成員並不知道。黃只是誇大其他隊員的參與性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，在11月25日的飯局並非全數成員出席，他質疑黃會否在不齊人的情況下講述計劃。辯方提醒，不能單憑訊息對話而「斷章取義」，例如成員談及要用避彈衣，但不代表在真槍情況下才要使用。辯方指，張沒有參與大部份「滅龍」群組的討論，亦不能肯定他閱畢所有訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方隊員被蒙在鼓裡不知實際計劃&quot;&gt;辯方：隊員被蒙在鼓裡、不知實際計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃曾稱行動前一日、即12月7日，在安全屋向隊員講述行動。惟辯方指，據監視警員所見，當時亦有陌生女子進入大廈，因此質疑黃會否在有外人的情況下，向隊員講解行動。辯方又質疑，黃所說的行動版本沒有彭所稱般詳細，黃沒有提及「屠龍」要掩護吳，並讓他擺放炸彈。因此對於計劃細節，張被蒙在鼓裡，而且他不會在完全不知情，兼不顧自身安全之下參與計劃，「係咪咁兒戲？可以參加咁大咁恐怖嘅活動？」辯方指，黃之所以不將計劃告知其他成員，實際上是知道成員會打斷計劃，並妨礙他在事成後到台灣獲取100萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，黃作供不盡不實、大話連篇，而且充滿疑點，因此懇請陪審團將疑點利益歸於被告，並緊記「寧縱毋枉」，裁定控方未能在毫無合理疑點下證明張參與串謀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（7日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on 24 July on the heels of reports that Turkey and a handful of European states are reconsidering their engagement with Syria. The EU suspended relations with Damascus in 2011 following the outbreak of the civil war, but in late July eight EU foreign ministers, including those of Italy and Austria, called on the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell to “review and assess” the bloc’s approach to Syria after 13 years of conflict. On 25 July, Italy became the first G7 member to announce it would restore diplomatic relations with Syria. This move signifies a shift that echoes the Arab world’s normalisation of Assad last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 7 July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would extend an invitation to Assad “any time” for possible talks to restore relations. This set off speculation about Assad’s potential response and any preconditions he might insist upon before agreeing to such talks. Previous attempts at diplomacy between the Turkish, Syrian and Russian defence ministers in December 2022 did not result in policy convergence. Syria experts have suggested that low levels of engagement between intelligence and security officials date back to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a major breakthrough in Turkey–Syria ties is unlikely, one explanation for the abrupt interest in restoring ties with Assad is that Turkey is seeking to navigate new rules of engagement ahead of a scenario where the US withdraws its remaining 900 or so troops that are currently stationed in northeastern Syria, a step that is likely to be expedited in the event of a Trump win in the November US presidential election. But rising regional tensions following a series of high-profile assassinations in Lebanon and Iran mean that a US withdrawal is not imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria was readmitted to the Arab League in May last year, but despite this regional pivot on Assad, US and European policy on Syria has remained stagnant, with little indication of what a long-term strategy would look like. There are unquestionably economic incentives that seem to justify a reset. War-torn Syria represents an opportunity for reconstruction and investment, and international actors are recognising that humanitarian funding and efforts require engagement with Assad’s government to have sustained impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite external support from Russia and Iran, Damascus still controls only 70% of Syrian territory. Turkey controls a sizeable area including towns such as al-Bab, Azaz, Jarabulus, Rajo, Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn. The Syrian Democratic Forces control most of the northeast, including Hasaka governorate as well as areas in Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-mediation-over-turkey-syria-talks&quot;&gt;Russia’s Mediation over Turkey-Syria Talks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, a steadfast ally of Assad, has been pushing for normalisation as part of its broader strategy to consolidate its influence in the Middle East. Despite overarching agreement on the need to stabilise Syria, there is scepticism on all sides. In 2019, Russia pledged to clear a 30-km strip along the Turkish-Syrian border from the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Syrian Kurdish militia that Turkey considers to be an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). While Ankara has been irritated by Russia’s ongoing engagement with the YPG since then, it continues to lobby Putin to seek concessions from Assad given its frustration that the US will not abandon its support of the YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces. Moscow is likely weighing up whether Turkey, a NATO member, may succumb to US pressure to prevent Russian companies from evading Western sanctions through Turkey. Unconfirmed reports suggest that in anticipation of talks, Turkey and Russia are considering restarting joint patrols on the M4 highway which runs from eastern Aleppo to western Latakia via Idlib through areas controlled by the Syrian opposition. Patrols had stalled for four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The presence of Syrian refugees in Turkey has become a contentious issue, with many in the opposition and the public as a whole perceiving them as unfair beneficiaries of state aid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 12 July, Iraq’s Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein stated that Baghdad may host the first meeting between Erdogan and Assad in over a decade. Holding the initial talks in Iraq would undoubtedly open them up to meddling and pressure from Iran, but also reflects Iraq’s own interest in stability along the Turkey–Syria border, which has implications for the Kurdistan Region of Iraq due to PKK strongholds there that are targeted by Turkish military strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-interests-driving-turkeysyria-normalisation&quot;&gt;Strategic Interests Driving Turkey–Syria Normalisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Erdogan’s governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) performed poorly in the 31 March local elections, losing most larger cities to the secular opposition Republican People’s Party. The AKP attributed the loss mainly to rising public anger about the 3.6 million Syrian refugees residing in Turkey, as well as what was seen by its core constituency as a weak response to Israel’s military action against Palestinian civilians in Gaza following the 7 October Hamas attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of Syrian refugees in Turkey has become a contentious issue, with many in the opposition and the public as a whole perceiving them as unfair beneficiaries of state aid. Concerns are also growing over socioeconomic and demographic changes, with far-right nationalists warning of an “Arabisation” of Turkish society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his brutal crackdown on civilians throughout the civil war and alleged war crimes, the fact that Assad has so far defied calls for a political transition agreement likely gives him an impression of strength vis-à-vis Turkey. The gap between the military, political and strategic objectives pursued by Ankara and Damascus that are driving normalisation is significant, however, and complicates efforts to identify common ground for negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Turkey’s role in the historic US–Russia prisoner swap deal revealed on 1 August is an indication of Ankara’s influential broker role in the region, Erdogan will justify meeting Assad as necessary to address chronic disputes between the neighbouring states. If a meeting is to take place – as early as this month according to some Syria experts – it is likely that Erdogan and Assad will agree on a preliminary but low-stakes framework of principles as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several longstanding public demands voiced by Ankara and Damascus provide clues as to the negotiating positions of each side. Damascus seeks the withdrawal of Turkish Armed Forces outposts and troops in northern Syria, which were installed during successive military operations: Operation Euphrates Shield (2016), Operation Olive Branch (2018), Operation Peace Spring (2019), and Operation Claw-Sword (including targets in northern Iraq, 2022). Damascus favours a return to the status quo that prevailed before 2011 and wants Turkey to lay out a timeline to withdraw militarily from the areas it controls. But regime forces are too weak to unilaterally control northwestern Syria, and lack sufficient sustained territorial control to alter the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara and Damascus agree that the Syrian Kurdish movement is a source of instability, but differ in their threat and opportunity perceptions. Turkey sees the PKK-YPG as an existential threat that justifies its military presence on counterterrorism and stabilisation grounds. Ankara argues that its departure will consolidate PKK-linked groups and their military, administrative and political structures in northern Syria. Damascus appears unwilling to entertain a military option to root out the group and sees the Kurds as valuable leverage against Turkey—as it has done for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other demands likely raised by Damascus include the transfer of border crossings between Syria and Turkey that are under opposition control to regime forces; that Ankara bans Syrian opposition groups from operating inside Turkey and hands over wanted dissidents to the regime; and that Ankara pressures the US to hasten its troop withdrawal from northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is more likely is that through a process of step-by-step talks, Turkey may greenlight a phased confidence-building approach that could lead it to scale back its support for certain opposition and jihadi groups in Idlib and opposition-held areas through security agreements with Damascus. Turkey backs the opposition Syrian National Army, an umbrella coalition of armed Syrian opposition groups (previously known as the Free Syrian Army). The possibility of developing a coordination mechanism for joint patrols with Syrian regime forces and opening up crossing points to facilitate trade between regime and Turkish-held areas and allow food and basic supplies to reach the civilian population are also on the table. Seen as steps to open up the north to regime control and exploitation, such measures are opposed by the Syrian opposition, with Turkey accused of betrayal. In a sign of the volatility of local opposition-held areas in the north, anti-Turkey protests broke out in early July in Afrin and Jarablus as some local factions fear the repercussions of any deal Erdogan may make with Assad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How future normalisation may impact Syria’s northern Idlib province is difficult to predict, with few options that Ankara and Damascus find mutually palatable. The area is controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a coalition of Islamist Sunni anti-government armed groups affiliated with Al-Qa’ida that has been listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU and the UN. Turkey has a complex relationship with HTS but will try to use its leverage over the group as a bargaining chip with Damascus. At the same time, a Russian-backed regime offensive against Idlib risks instability and a major outflow of Syrian refugees that will put pressure on the Turkish border, a scenario Ankara is desperate to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ankara’s proposed blueprint for normalisation is rumoured to include provisions for Assad to agree to the repatriation and resettlement of around 2 million Syrians. A strategy to empower the Syrian state’s capacity to absorb the en masse return of Syrians has also been defended by European states that are concerned with limiting migration flows across the Mediterranean. Down the line, Ankara may claim that it received assurances that those returning would not face any criminal prosecution, and that moderate Syrian opposition voices would be granted political representation. In reality, Ankara will have little or no influence over the fate of Syrian returnees, and such proposals ignore the fact that Syrians in regime-controlled pockets continue to flee Syria, while those outside the country cite Assad’s uninterrupted and brutal rule as the reason for not returning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-war-in-gaza-on-turkeysyria-ties&quot;&gt;The Impact of the War in Gaza on Turkey–Syria Ties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria is effectively a proxy state of Iran, serving as a lifeline for the transit of weapons and fighters travelling onward to reach Hizbullah in Lebanon. Since 7 October, Syrian territory has been regularly targeted by Israeli airstrikes against Iranian proxy military infrastructure. The killing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps commander in charge of Iran’s Syrian and Lebanese operations in the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus in early April led to the barrage of over 300 rockets and missiles that Iran launched at Israel in retaliation on 13 April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;International actors may have no choice but to engage with Assad to address the ongoing threat posed by extremist and terrorist groups such as Islamic State&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapidly deteriorating regional security situation between Israel and Iran-backed armed proxies will alter Turkey and Syria’s baseline demands and the normalisation timeline, as will the results of the November US presidential election. Even before the double killings of Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Ismail Haniyeh, the political chief of Hamas, in Tehran, it was unlikely that the Turkish security establishment saw strategic value in a full-scale withdrawal from northern Syria. Now, a substantial Turkish force withdrawal is less likely given that Ankara would see this as destabilising northern Syria at a time when Iranian proxies there and in Iraq may escalate a multi-front confrontation with Israel and regional allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s vulnerability in the crossfires of the proxy war between Israel and Iran has pushed Assad to remain on the sidelines as much as possible, while trying to balance Russian interests. Should the Israel–Lebanon border heat up further, Assad may prefer the Turkish status quo in the north to the expansion and entrenchment of Iranian-backed forces. At the same time, ties between Turkey and Iran are evolving. While Iranian infiltration inside Syria has historically restrained Turkish objectives there, common solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza has inched Ankara closer to Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Russia, Turkey seeks to assert a role over the post-war Syrian political economy, and will look to balance its interests with and against US and European positions depending on the trajectory of the conflict. Turkey’s renewed leverage strategy in Syria should also be read alongside growing Russian and Chinese claims and interests in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International actors may have no choice but to engage with Assad to address the ongoing threat posed by extremist and terrorist groups such as Islamic State, as evidence suggests that the group is exploiting the current volatility to reconstitute. Moreover, calibrated cooperation with Assad could be viewed as a necessary evil to address the plight of the Syrian civilian population, who face dire prospects under crippling US and European sanctions which have had little impact on the Assad system’s resilience. Turkey’s own calculus aligns with these considerations, but extends beyond them given the complex history of Turkey–Syria relations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指「屠龍」眾籌為作嚴重暴力逼政府就範 意圖宣揚「五大訴求」政治主張&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jA2Oxsc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（5日）踏入第65日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，女被告劉佩凝被控「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。控方指，法例上單純眾籌並非罪行，本案控罪是眾籌意圖作出危害他人的嚴重暴力，對象需為作出行動以外的人，因此自焚或自殺不屬干犯控罪。至於眾籌目的是要意圖強迫政府或國際組織，或恐嚇公眾人士，或推展政治、宗教、思想上的主張。控方指，「屠龍」以嚴重傷害他人為目的而籌錢，並意圖宣揚政治主張如「五大訴求，缺一不可」，逼使特區政府就範。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方賴振邦必然知道行動牽涉槍更曾協助製作炸彈&quot;&gt;控方：賴振邦必然知道行動牽涉槍、更曾協助製作炸彈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第五日結案陳詞。就第五被告賴振邦，控方指警方在3C維修工作室搜到的電話必然屬於賴，而非其姐夫、同涉本案的張堅順，因其電話內有賴的個人照片。另外，控方指賴有參與台灣軍訓，他亦曾透露自己進入浸大的實驗室「爆 Lab」。控方又指，據證人彭軍壕的證供，他表示賴有到台灣軍訓，並且聽到賴與另外兩人討論如何進行破壞迫政府妥協。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，彭指他與賴等人於10月4日到灣仔打算向警方投擲鏹水彈。控方指，這顯示賴知悉他們曾計劃襲擊警察。控方指賴亦有參與西貢行山試槍，他必然知道吳智鴻管有槍械及炸彈，專家報告提及子彈相片是由賴的電話所拍攝。控方強調，吳一方的行動不斷升級，最終演變至12.8用槍及炸彈的計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於吳與賴的對話顯示，吳稱打算製作炸彈，賴回應吳時表示可以協助問人如何購買硫酸。賴亦有與吳討論如何延長發熱線。控方強調，賴必然知道有製作炸彈的環節。控方又指，「滅龍」群組有一張由張銘裕傳送的引爆裝置相片，警方發現該地點為3C維修工作室外的後樓梯。控方指，直至11月27日炸彈及引爆器經已製作完畢。警方在賴電話內發現一條片段，介紹引爆器的結構。其結構及原理與警方在華仁書院找到的炸彈一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，辯方或會認為彭與警方人員根據 Telegram 訊息「夾故仔」，但控方卻指相關對話內容詳細，希望陪審團自行考慮。控方續指，據彭的證供，賴於12月7日晚曾應吳的要求，帶備材料到華仁協助製作炸彈。紀錄顯示兩人曾通話。彭亦指，吳等人於12月8日早上被捕，賴卻不停問炸彈是否還存放在華仁，似乎想繼續執行計劃。專家檢驗後亦發現賴的電話拍攝了兩張華仁書院的炸彈照片。綜合上述原因，控方表示賴必然知道12月8日會進行用槍及炸彈的行動，而他必然是串謀中的同謀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方許湛榮曾與吳智鴻在試槍前探路&quot;&gt;控方：許湛榮曾與吳智鴻在試槍前探路&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第六被告許湛榮，控方指他為「台灣按摩旅行團」群組的成員之一。紀錄顯示，許在黃及吳被捕當日的中午，曾表示「清嘢」。控方指，許必然知道自己是群組成員，他亦下令其他人「清嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又引述彭的證供指，許於2014年已經是吳的「左右手」。辯方於盤問階段一度指出，原在外國留學的許，在得悉吳為情試圖自殺後，立即停學回港陪伴他。控方提醒，辯方的問題並非證供，證人的答案即回答「冇聽過」才是證供。控方強調：「各位唔好畀啲問題混淆，證人口供確認咗嘅就係證供。」控方指，彭表示吳提及正式到西貢試槍前，曾與許前往探路。而警方檢獲的地圖上亦發現許的指模。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在吳被捕後，張堅順轉發有關新聞連結予許，提及警方檢獲半自動手槍。許表示「認真，我個人唔係好信嗰把係真槍，我覺得一係改大咗嘅氣槍，一係一把煙槍」。控方指陪審團要考慮如何解讀相關訊息。另外，許亦有參與西貢行山試槍，因此他一定知道有真槍。控方總結指，上述訊息除促進串謀之用外，亦作為背景予陪審團考慮。控方亦指，需要單獨考慮各被告的參與，不能夠說「因為佢哋係一個群組，一個有份就其他都有份」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方控罪眾籌目的是要強迫政府恐嚇公眾或推展政治主張&quot;&gt;控方：控罪眾籌目的是要強迫政府、恐嚇公眾、或推展政治主張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後就第七被告劉佩凝，她被控「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。控方指，法例上單純的眾籌並非罪行，眾籌以供應口罩及黑色衫亦不是罪行。本案的控罪是眾籌並意圖作出針對及危害他人的嚴重暴力，而對象為作出行動以外的人，因此自焚或自殺亦不屬干犯本控罪；最後一個元素是要導致財產受嚴重傷害。至於眾籌目的是要意圖強迫政府或國際組織，或恐嚇公眾人士，或推展政治、宗教、思想上的主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Uwsxv5c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 第七被告 劉佩凝&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，本案控罪不一定需要與12.8的用槍及炸彈計劃有必然關係，投擲汽油彈也可以考慮為針對人的嚴重暴力，或導致財產受嚴重傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方頻道發布屠龍小隊示威精華片段後-吸引大批人課金&quot;&gt;控方：頻道發布「屠龍小隊」示威精華片段後 吸引大批人「課金」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方的立場是，劉作為「育龍」頻道管理員，藉此發起眾籌，尤其是頻道曾發布「屠龍小隊」進行縱火及攻擊警察的精華片段，事後吸引大批人「課金」。劉的戶口獲存款400多次、總存入金額為104萬多。控方又指，紀錄顯示「屠龍」的黃振強曾向劉表示想買槍，又指資金用作補充「魔法」，即汽油彈。控方指，每次「育龍」有新訊息發布後不久，劉都會問黃的意見，顯示劉對「育龍」動向「跟得好貼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方意圖宣揚政治例如五大訴求缺一不可&quot;&gt;控方：意圖宣揚政治例如「五大訴求，缺一不可」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，「育龍」曾有訊息提及「我哋係貫徹呢個精神嘅小隊之一，五大訴求，缺一不可」；另亦提及要取得30粒「龍心」，據黃的證供是要取30名警員的性命。控方指，「屠龍」的確是以嚴重傷害他人為目的而籌錢，並意圖宣揚政治例如「五大訴求，缺一不可」，逼使特區政府就範。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又引述劉與另一人的對話，劉於黃被捕後表示：「我條 Team 俾人拉晒」，並確認該隊伍為「屠龍」及警方搜出槍械。劉其後表示：「Healer 應該唔會爆我住，我肯定無嘢」、「冇人知道我係屠龍，得你」、「Healer 做鬼，屈返龍隊，啲彈頭係警用子彈，根本冇可能龍隊有槍」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方已完成陳詞，案件明（6日）續審，將由辯方進行陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指吳智鴻一方早有串謀協議 「屠龍」近兩個月後加入&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（2日）踏入第64日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，指吳智鴻一方早於2019年9月30日有串謀協議，其後吳「摻咗屠龍入嚟玩」，而「屠龍」於11月18日起加入，因此串謀協議是不斷演變。控方又指，部分 Telegram 訊息有促進協議之用，可證明串謀是存在，以及串謀者的參與程度；另有部份訊息卻並非促進之用，陪審員只可考慮作為背景資料，以及判斷被告是否知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方部份-telegram-對話訊息有促進協議之用&quot;&gt;控方：部份 Telegram 對話訊息有促進協議之用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第四日結案陳詞，她總結指，本案的串謀協議建基於吳智鴻與「屠龍」落實在2019年12月8日，在軒尼詩道放置炸彈及使用槍械的大計劃。控方指，吳一方早於9月30日有串謀協議，其後吳「摻咗屠龍入嚟玩」，「屠龍」於11月18日起加入，因此串謀協議是不斷演變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，在串謀協議中每名參與者各有角色，並不會明確分工，甚至毋須見面或知道其他人的角色。但若能證明各人的共同目的是在公眾地方使用炸彈及槍攻擊警方人員，就已屬參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方解釋，部份 Telegram 對話訊息有促進協議之用，可證明串謀是存在，以及串謀者的參與程度；另有部份訊息卻並非促進之用，陪審員只可考慮作為背景資料，以及判斷被告是否知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方依賴促進串謀的訊息包括，黃於11月19日在「滅龍」群組表示：「聽日去到泰國有新 Plan 講」、「唔使行眼鏡 Plan」、「諗定 20 kg」。嚴文謙問：「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避？」林銘皓則提出「喺嗰個位我哋引戰」。控方亦依賴吳與黃討論行動位置的對話內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方尚未完成陳詞，案件下周一（5日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指在「時代背景」下串謀呼之欲出：唔好用2024年睇2019年&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zuEiSZj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（1日）踏入第63日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，提及「屠龍」成員嚴文謙知道在12月8日的行動中，他們的崗位是負責「引戰」，即引警察到場。而有參與台灣軍訓的「屠龍」成員張銘裕，則會知道吳智鴻一方打算使用槍械。控方另質疑，另一成員李家田聲稱留在隊內是為取資助並「有飯食」，但他卻不出席小隊的飯局，明顯「一反自己嘅品性」。控方一度強調：「大家唔好用2024年嚟睇2019年嘅事件」，「2019喺香港係好特別嘅時間，用時代背景去睇事情，根本串謀係呼之欲出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方成員對大-plan沒有疑問&quot;&gt;控方：成員對「大 Plan」沒有疑問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第三日結案陳詞。控方指，本案共有兩幫人，但他們一同參與串謀協議，相關協議在「屠龍」的黃振強與吳智鴻於11月18日見面後已形成。據對話顯示，黃振強與張俊富討論如何使用「20 kg」，而黃在庭上供稱「20 kg」指炸彈。控方引述黃的證供，11月25日「屠龍」已達成共識不會親自用槍及炸彈，只會配合吳一方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃於12月3日在群組表示「同大家講個壞消息，今個星期要入港島」，其後黃又指「認真，星期日有大 Plan」。控方指，此時已經落實行動的日期及地點。另外，群組並沒有人問甚麼是「大 Plan」，顯示各人對此沒有疑問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方成員知道行動崗位是引戰&quot;&gt;控方：成員知道行動崗位是「引戰」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述黃稱，他與成員於12月4日完成訪問後開會，並在會上交代在12月8日行動中，「屠龍」只需要負責「引戰」。成員的對話中，亦提到「淨係引班狗嚟就掂，走得」。控方指據證人口供提及，「屠龍」引警方人員到某一位置後，小炸彈就會被引爆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指，黃在12.8行動前提醒隊員不要攜帶裝備、工具及武器，顯示當日有別於一般示威行動。嚴文謙問黃：「聽日會唔會打近身？」控方指這顯示成員知道他們在12.8行動的崗位是「引戰」。控方最後指，上述對話在2019年8至10月出現，並不可能是事後捏造。雖然辯方指黃可以為了令自己獲最大減刑，再加上在警方指示下，「深思熟慮作故事」指證被告，但這交由陪審員衡量相信多少證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方張銘裕與吳智鴻有私下聯絡&quot;&gt;控方：張銘裕與吳智鴻有私下聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後簡述每名被告的角色及言行。就首被告張俊富，控方指他為「屠龍」成員，並知道協議的存在。他曾出席11月17日晚的大鴻輝會議，會上有人討論試槍及炸彈的情況。當黃與吳見面後，黃在泰國旅行期間解釋「新 Plan」，張當時亦有去泰國。另外，張有出席11月25日的三陂坊會議，會上黃表示「屠龍」會配合引警察。張俊富自己亦有談及如何使用「20 kg」。控方另指，辯方在盤問階段指出「20 kg」實際指煙花炮仗，但黃不同意。控方亦指，黃、張及林銘皓討論在哪一位置擺放炸彈，亦算是串謀的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃作供時表示，張在小隊中作為「運輸工人」的角色，曾協助收取裝備。但控方卻質疑：「佢係咪只係一個倉務員？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二被告張銘裕，他亦為「屠龍」成員。控方指，張與吳早於8月27日已有私訊，因張於9月隨吳前往台灣軍訓，期間張提及「如果要用槍，可能我唔啱」。據彭軍壕的證供，軍訓內容包括開槍、搶槍、近身搏鬥、製作汽油彈及鋁熱彈。因此，張會知道吳一方將會使用的武器是甚麼。張其後亦有問吳是否可取得 C4 手槍。另外，張有參與西貢行山試槍，他更與吳聯絡，並告知對方自己會攜帶柴油。控方希望陪審員考慮當時張有否親手試槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，張曾於11月27日在「滅龍」群組傳送引爆器的影片，這顯示張與吳一方必然有聯絡。控方補充，證人曾表示吳為人謹慎，因此他不會將影片傳送至一個不信任的人手中。至於群組成員亦沒有詢問影片內容，這顯示他們知道引爆器的存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方用時代背景看串謀呼之欲出&quot;&gt;控方：用時代背景看、串謀呼之欲出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第三被告嚴文謙，他亦為「屠龍」成員。控方指，嚴必然知道12.8計劃牽涉用槍及炸彈攻擊警方。對話紀錄顯示，嚴於11月18日稱：「睇嚟有人早過我哋去台灣，佢哋出咗嘅話，我哋用眼鏡（槍）都唔使走」、「認真，準備好搶槍」。他亦曾談及「20 kg」，又問：「引戰都要避彈呀？」、「係咪直接打近身？」、「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調「大家唔好用2024年嚟睇2019年嘅事件」，「2019喺香港係好特別嘅時間，用時代背景去睇事情，根本串謀係呼之欲出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱貪便宜留隊內無參與示威-控方質疑為何仍獲資金&quot;&gt;李家田稱貪便宜留隊內、無參與示威 控方質疑為何仍獲資金&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第四被告李家田，他亦屬「屠龍」成員，並是本案唯一作供的被告。李供稱加入「屠龍」是為搜集資料，同時發現黃振強會向他提供資金，「錢銀上好疏爽、有求必應」，因此他為了「貪小便宜」而逗留隊內。李強調自己一直無參與投擲汽油彈及堵路等行動，只是在場旁觀。他又解釋在「滅龍」群組所發出的訊息，僅屬藉口、推搪、轉移話題、評論及「搲水吹」。控方指，陪審員需要考慮李作供時的神態舉止，以判斷他是否「吹水」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，既然李一直在隊內行動都是「行行企企」甚麼也不做，為何仍獲隊員關心，「黃振強會唔會咁對佢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李不出席飯局-違反為了有飯食的品性&quot;&gt;控方質疑李不出席飯局 違反為了「有飯食」的品性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另表示，實際上李有出席11月17日晚的大鴻輝會議，並非如他所指被困理大。控方反駁，若李真的被困理大，就不會提議去「M記」開會，「佢仲有冇閒情興致講『M記』，應酬或者敷衍滅龍一方？」控方亦質疑，李聲稱留在隊內是為「有飯食」，但他卻不出席這次飯局，明顯「一反自己嘅品性」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方李部分錄影會面證供屬脫罪說法&quot;&gt;控方：李部分錄影會面證供屬脫罪說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱被捕後遭警員毆打，並強迫說出手槍下落，因此在錄影會面時，他應警方指示捏造部分證供。控方提醒陪審員考慮李是自願說還是被打後受驚而說，「佢講嘅意識形態係點，你哋信唔信？」，「佢似唔似畀人打完之後講？」控方亦指，李被捕時警方已搜獲全部3支槍，因此毋須迫他說出下落。控方又指，李在錄影會面中有部份是脫罪的說法，例如他說沒有打算參與12.8行動。因此，陪審員需要自行判斷哪些證供屬實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提醒並非所有對話訊息皆可視作真實證據&quot;&gt;官提醒並非所有對話訊息皆可視作真實證據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方要求下，控方向陪審員解釋他們會依賴哪些訊息作為背景，哪些訊息可考慮作為真實證據。控方指在串謀罪下，某些訊息可視作促進串謀協議。在本案中，黃及吳在11月18日達成協議後的訊息，部分可作為證據。至於11月18日前的訊息，則僅視作背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲指，雖然控方提及很多對話訊息，但她提醒陪審員「唔好以為每一句說話都係真嘅」，因部分屬「傳聞證供」，稍後她及控方會再講解，哪些訊息牽涉促進串謀，而陪審員需要考慮其真實性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（2日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes and will continue to do so in the long term. Procurement networks with tentacles all around the world have been used by the country to obtain technology from willing exporters and naive businesses, and to dupe those trying to comply with export controls over the past decades. These networks will continue to be key to the sustainment of North Korea’s programmes and further technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper analyses North Korea’s procurement networks, particularly in view of North Korea’s programmatic successes and recent geopolitical shifts in Russia’s relationship with North Korea as a result of the war in Ukraine. The paper draws on underexploited source material to offer an overview of North Korea’s procurement networks over the past five years. It finds that North Korea’s networks are active and will remain so, and are likely seeking to make up for the slowdown in procurement during the period of Covid-19-related border closures, and to fulfil recent Russian orders for missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The networks are largely focused in China and Russia, where North Korean operatives – trading company personnel, diplomats, intelligence officers, and scientists and researchers – have been able to operate largely unhindered, allowing them to establish supply chains. However, there are still some needs that see North Korea looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets to fulfil. North Korea’s renewed relationship with Russia is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of the country’s procurement networks. Any formal offer of strategic technologies by Moscow to Pyongyang, or actions that see North Korean operatives openly purchase on a larger scale from Russian providers, would be bountiful for North Korea’s procurement needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s procurement networks into the future, including evolving needs and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies provided by a smaller number of niche suppliers. Overall, the paper concludes that despite North Korea’s successes, seeking to prevent the country’s access to, and procurement of, technology is still valuable. It makes 10 recommendations to those seeking to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes. Long subject to extensive UN sanctions prohibiting exports of many of these technologies to North Korea, Pyongyang has made extensive use of illicit procurement networks to access these technologies. These networks, with tentacles all around the world, obtain the goods from a mix of willing exporters and naive businesses, and by duping those trying to comply with export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These external technologies – from materials and components, to machine tools and other manufacturing equipment, to sensitive design information and expertise – have allowed North Korea to advance its nuclear and missile programmes. The goods, manufacturing technologies and expertise, along with extensive domestic investment, have allowed North Korea to build up its indigenous WMD-related expertise and industrial base. This has led to the apparent growth of the country’s nuclear arsenal, which – while public estimates are scant – has been said by US intelligence sources to number up to 60 warheads. North Korea has also successfully developed ICBMs and systems with shorter ranges, seemingly of domestic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reassessment of North Korea’s procurement of foreign technology is timely. In the medium to long term, North Korea will continue to rely on imported technologies and its procurement networks as its nuclear and missile arsenals develop. Recent geopolitical developments have also worked to open up North Korea’s opportunities to benefit from external sources of technology. After North Korea’s renewal of its relationship with Russia, rumours emerged that Moscow will offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang in return for arms transfers for use in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s flagrant violation of the UN arms embargo, as well as China dragging its feet over sanctions, has put the UN sanctions regime on life support. These states, both with extensive strategic industries, have been significant targets for North Korea’s technology procurement efforts. China is also the main transhipment hub for goods en route to North Korea. However, despite the potential impending disintegration of the UN sanctions regime, seeking to implement supply-side controls and continuing to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement is still valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Russia and China, many states with companies that produce technology of value to North Korea’s procurement – particularly the US, Europe and Japan – remain on board with sanctions on North Korea. There are also many other states that have sought and will continue to seek to prevent technology leaking out to North Korea’s programme. States seeking to counter North Korea’s procurement will also continue to make the case for sanctions implementation to a range of states that can and will occasionally act as transhipment or re-export hubs for nuclear- and missile-related technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this continued role for UN sanctions and the need to make the case to partners, an up-to-date examination of North Korea’s WMD-related procurement efforts is a timely and important aid to sanctions implementation. Analysis is also pertinent given the expiry of the mandate of the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1718 Committee Panel of Experts (PoE) in April 2024. The dissolution of the PoE represents a blow to sanctions monitoring and implementation. This paper offers a baseline analysis for further outreach on sanctions implementation to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement. It is hoped this is especially useful for governments, their intelligence and customs bodies, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-challenges-and-existing-research&quot;&gt;Data Challenges and Existing Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been some focused research on North Korea’s nuclear and missile procurement activities, no recent works have considered them in detail. The limited work in this area is largely due to the challenges of access to data, with much of North Korea’s programmes completely hidden from view. Studies of North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have tended to provide broader overviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically on the nuclear side, lack of access to North Korean facilities – and, indeed, as key elements of North Korea’s uranium enrichment programme are unknown to outsiders – means that little is understood about the scope of North Korea’s programmes and the technologies that are used. There is more information in the public domain on the missile programme, with images and footage of increasingly frequent missile tests, parades and factory visits published by the regime, as well as missile test wreckage fished off the bed of the sea, or more recently from impact sites in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discerning the balance of North Korea’s import of technology from overseas, either by overt assistance or illicit procurement, and its domestic industrial capacity, has been a particular challenge. For the nuclear programme, on top of the lack of insights into North Korean facilities, there have been few cases of seizure of goods destined for the programme, providing little insight into foreign dependencies. There is more, albeit limited, data on the missile programme that can be used to analyse North Korea’s successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While limited in number, there are some more focused works on North Korea’s procurement networks. Some analysis has considered the procurement of specific technologies, while others have focused on the role of certain types of entities in North Korea’s procurement and arms trading activities. Still others have looked at North Korea’s knowledge networks and the procurement of “intangible” technology – the design information, sensitive data and knowledge that accompanies tangible goods, components and systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these more focused works are based on information from almost a decade ago, with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes having since progressed significantly. Taking stock of the situation as much as is possible through an up-to-date and more holistic treatment will help frame future efforts to counter the country’s procurement networks. This is particularly necessary in view of the dissolution of the UN PoE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-hypothesis-and-structure&quot;&gt;Methodology, Hypothesis and Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper seeks to provide an up-to-date analysis of North Korea’s illicit procurement – the technologies it is seeking, its procurement apparatus and modus operandi – focusing on the period since the last UN North Korea sanctions resolution was passed in 2017. The paper uses a range of newer sources that have so far had limited consideration. The more recent reports of the now defunct PoE have included details on procurement efforts, including several detailed cases since 2017. US designations from as recently as 2023 and detailed guidance on countering North Korea’s illicit procurement for its missile programme from 2020 also offer new insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wreckage of North Korean missiles recovered from the battlefields of Ukraine also offers new perspectives on the contents of North Korean weapons. In addition, the paper fills in some gaps in the history of North Korea’s procurement from recent UK National Archives finds from the 1980s and early 1990s. The data from these under-used sources is combined with insights from several interviews with nuclear and missile proliferation experts, cited anonymously due to the sensitivity of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that in the medium to long term, North Korea will continue to rely on imported technology and its procurement networks as its nuclear and missile arsenals develop. Since 2017, these procurement networks have been active in a range of areas, and particularly in dual-use technologies (those with both military and civilian applications). The paper shows that these networks will continue to be active as they make up for the slowdown in procurement during the period of Covid-19-related border closures, and as they work to procure technology for domestic uses, as well as to compensate for the goods used in producing missiles exported to the new Russian market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper contends that North Korea’s procurement networks are largely focused on China and Russia. In these jurisdictions, North Korea’s agents operate with little risk of reprisal, and have been able to establish supply chains for a growing number of requisite technologies. However, North Korea still has needs or interests that result in Pyongyang looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets through intermediaries, as is demonstrated by the electronic components inside North Korean missile wreckage recovered from Ukraine. Desire for certain quality products, or a preference for goods from these countries, could ensure continued interest in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang’s renewed relationship with Moscow is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. North Korea has supplied arms and ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine, and Pyongyang and Moscow signed a mutual defence treaty in June 2024. If Moscow were to formally offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang, or to allow North Korea’s procurement operatives to openly shop on a larger scale from Russian providers, this could be bountiful for North Korea’s needs. Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s networks into the future, including evolving technological developments and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies held by a smaller number of niche suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, which seeks to provide insights to non-governmental analysts, government officials and industry practitioners, has five chapters. Chapter I gives a historical overview of North Korea’s technology procurement, emphasising that it has been a long-term buyer from the international marketplace, and highlighting continuity in approaches. Chapter II considers a loose typology of the equipment and goods that North Korea is pursuing and the UN sanctions that have sought to prevent technology transfer. Chapter III analyses North Korea’s more recent illicit procurement activities to understand current procurement priorities. Chapter IV takes a closer look at the entities involved in North Korea’s WMD-related illicit procurement, while Chapter V considers its future. The paper concludes with 10 recommendations to counter North Korea’s future illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-historical-sources-of-technology&quot;&gt;I. Historical Sources of Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has long exploited external sources of technology to develop its nuclear and missile programmes. This chapter provides a brief historical overview for context and asks two pertinent questions: Where has North Korea’s WMD technology come from? And what was the role of illicit procurement? The chapter highlights the continuity in North Korea’s procurement approaches and methods over the past 50 years, showing that Pyongyang has, through necessity, used illicit procurement networks and methods to obtain military and strategic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply-side controls have been used since at least the 1980s to prevent support to North Korea’s WMD programmes (see Box 1). During the Cold War, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCoM) sought to prevent the transfer of Western technology to communist states, including North Korea. According to declassified CIA assessments, North Korea went on a “buying spree” of Western technology in the mid-1970s and again in the mid-1980s. As one assessment from 1988 notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Much of the technology and equipment P’yongyang wants is proscribed from export to North Korea; this makes clandestine acquisition, supplemented by dual-use purchases that can be modified to meet military requirements, a key element of the North’s effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;P’yongyang has focused much of its technology acquisition operations in Japan and Western Europe, where ethnic Korean communities or willing collaborators have helped in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment also noted the importance of Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau as sources of microelectronics and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-the-value-of-supply-side-controls&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 1: The Value of Supply-Side Controls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Supply-side controls” is a broad term used to denote the range of tools used to prevent the supply of technology to WMD proliferators (as opposed to demand-side measures that might address the reasons that states want WMD). These include export controls and technology-based sanctions, border and customs checks, actions against procurement networks, efforts to protect dual-use training and research from being exploited by proliferators, and counter-proliferation-financing measures.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given that North Korea has achieved a nuclear weapons and ICBM capability, what is the value of continuing to implement supply-side controls to try to prevent North Korea’s procurement of WMD-related technologies? While the true impacts of supply-side controls are difficult to gauge, there are several arguments for their continued application.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Long-Term WMD Dependencies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea will continue to rely, in the short to medium term, on imported technologies and its procurement networks as its arsenal develops. Indeed, more mature nuclear and missile programmes – for example those of Russia, which has been a nuclear weapons state for 75 years – are known to still rely on imported technologies decades after crossing the nuclear threshold.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Battlefield Use and Exports&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recent North Korean sales of missiles to Russia have seen their use against civilian populations in Ukraine. While supply-side controls are unlikely to prevent further transfers across the North Korea–Russia border, preventing the transfer of technologies, particularly of Western-manufactured micro-electronics, to North Korea could help to disrupt the production of missiles in North Korea for Vladimir Putin’s war machine. The ongoing resurgence of North Korea’s arms exports enterprise provides further rationale for continued supply-side controls.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Slowing Production and Increasing Costs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If supply chains are disrupted by supply-side measures, it will be more difficult for North Korea’s procurement agents to obtain the components and materials they need. This could slow production and potentially increase the costs of procurement, as agents pay above market rate to compete with legitimate buyers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Providing Intelligence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Export licence applications completed by exporters can provide governments with valuable intelligence about the needs of North Korea’s WMD programmes and its procurement networks, in particular intermediaries, transhipment points and shipping routes. Exporters are required to provide details of technologies, entities and stated end-uses, which can provide useful insights.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Exploiting Existing Tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The main states capable of supplying technology – members of key multilateral export control regimes such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) – already have export control systems and border controls in place. However, in some of these supplier states, for example China, export control implementation and enforcement are far from perfect. This, and the existence of a wide range of third-country hubs that proliferators can exploit, makes for large and significant loopholes in global supply-side controls. Nevertheless, great effort has been expended on developing these control systems, and the benefits of their continued use to counter North Korean procurement are clear.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-nuclear-programme-procurement&quot;&gt;Historical Nuclear Programme Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its pursuit of nuclear weapons, North Korea developed reactor and reprocessing technologies and also, as recognised later by the international community, uranium enrichment technology. While the plutonium side of the programme benefited from the construction of reactors and reprocessing facilities at Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, less is known about the uranium enrichment side, with one large facility at Yongbyon revealed to foreign visitors in 2010. There are likely other facilities of unclear size and capability in other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides of the fuel cycle have been developed with extensive use of imported technologies. The Yongbyon reactor itself was based on a simple and ageing design, likely requiring little imported technology. But other elements of the plutonium programme required technological support and, at the time, the Soviet Union, China and other communist states were seemingly unwilling to provide it. As a result, North Korea turned to the international marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after US intelligence identified in the early 1980s that North Korea was constructing a reactor, attempts by a North Korean entity to procure a wide range of technologies from West German companies were detected by the US government. The list included: 50 manipulators used to handle radioactive materials; remote control equipment; hot cells; shielding walls; ventilation and filter systems; glove boxes; and facilities for the manufacture, distribution, packaging and transport of radionuclides. As a November 1984 West German government paper noted: “In particular the last few items in the list … give rise to concern, as they seem to indicate North Korean plans to construct a (possibly unsafeguarded) reprocessing plant”. This led the US and the UK to consult with partners on efforts to prevent North Korean procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea also sought other technology from a West German company in the 1980s, including a small furnace in 1987, possibly through East Germany. Technicians and an official from the same company visited North Korea in 1989 and 1990. Further evidence of dual-use material and equipment procurement from West German and Swiss household name companies came to light in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1986, a North Korean diplomat, Yun Ho-Jin, was based at the North Korean mission to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. Building a network of contacts, Yun organised trade delegation visits to Europe, some of which resulted in purchases that ended up in Yongbyon. After North Korea withdrew from the IAEA in 1994, Yun took his networks and expertise “private”, establishing the Beijing-based Namchongang Trading Corporation (NCG), which would be added to the UN North Korea sanctions list in 2009 for its proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yun was far from the only diplomat active in procurement in Europe. Kim Jong Ryul, a procurement agent for the regime with a diplomatic passport, recalls procuring US-manufactured, NSG-controlled mass spectrometers in the 1990s, of use in “identifying uranium and plutonium particles”, using European front companies. North Korea also made use of other overseas connections. During the 1980s, the country turned to Korean residents in Japan through the Chongryon, the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a kind of de facto embassy, to provide scientific support and dual-use goods from the Japanese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s centrifuge efforts became apparent much later, but in hindsight drew heavily on external support. Pakistan and the black-market network, run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A Q Khan, would provide North Korea with centrifuge design information. North Korea and Pakistan initially exchanged technology and knowledge in the 1990s. Later, around 2000, Khan’s network provided North Korea with about two dozen P-1 and P-2 centrifuges and measuring equipment, as well as allowing access to Pakistan’s centrifuge workshops at Khan Research Laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 1999 and 2003, Japanese authorities sought to prevent the export of frequency converters to North Korea – items of use in controlling centrifuges. In the early 2000s, North Korea attempted to procure extensive quantities of aluminium tubes for centrifuge construction. Yun Ho-Jin, the director of NCG, would be implicated in one unsuccessful – and possibly one successful – effort to import tubes for several thousand centrifuges. In 2002, the CIA noted that in the previous year, North Korea “began seeking centrifuge-related materials in large quantities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN sanctions listing, NCG was also involved in procurement for North Korea’s plutonium-related activities, procuring Japanese-origin vacuum pumps, likely of use in the fuel fabrication facility at Yongbyon. According to reporting, NCG had allegedly been procuring “gas masks, electric timers, steel pipes, vacuum pumps, transformers and aluminum tubes” from European markets in the early 2000s using the Beijing office, and that these procurements, some of which were destined for the Syrian Al-Kibar nuclear reactor project, had alerted the US to North Korea–Syria nuclear collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-missile-programme-procurement&quot;&gt;Historical Missile Programme Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s missile programme has also relied on external sources of technology from both states and the international marketplace, although recent developments in the longer-range programmes have resulted in systems unique to North Korea. The programmes began with short-range Soviet Scud systems obtained from Egypt, which were reverse engineered and scaled up to create the Nodong ballistic missile. North Korea allegedly benefited from human capital leaking from the collapsed Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and Soviet design influences were seen in the failed Musudan IRBM (intermediate range ballistic missile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the external technology that has supported North Korea’s missile programme has come from the international marketplace. As with the nuclear programme, North Korea likely imported a range of missile and dual-use technologies from the early days of its indigenisation efforts. This included speciality steel from the Soviet Union and later Russia, and commercially produced power systems for the transporter erector launchers (TELs) carrying missiles from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong and Macau formed a key node in North Korea’s procurement networks from the 1980s. As a document from the UK National Archives notes, in 1993 the Hong Kong authorities raided the premises of a company with “extensive North Korean links”, which was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the subject of numerous intelligence reports indicating its involvement in procuring strategic items on behalf of North Korea. The items are imported to Hong Kong and then exported to Macau for onward transmission to North Korea … using hand couriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following year the company admitted the export of thousands of integrated circuits and components to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also sought trucks on which to carry its missiles, especially larger systems. In the early 1990s North Korea allegedly imported 30 Italian trucks carrying Austrian lifting equipment to produce TELs for its Nodong missiles. Around the same time, North Korea imported truck chassis from Germany for use in TEL production. Dependence on external sources for large truck chassis seems to have persisted into the UN sanctions era, when in 2012 six large eight-axle TELs were exhibited during a Pyongyang parade carrying an early ICBM design. The trucks had been procured from China in 2011, with the end use purported to be the lumber industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also procured machine tools – manufacturing technologies with civil, military, missile and nuclear applications. The public record shows the role of entities in Taiwan in supplying machine tools since the 1990s. The network persisted into the UN sanctions era, when a Taiwanese businessman was indicted by a domestic court for the re-export of three types of US-origin machine tools to North Korea. In 2013, the Taiwanese businessman and his US-based son were arrested by the US authorities, with the son accused of establishing a US-based company to facilitate exports of hundreds of thousands of dollars of machine tools to his father for re-export to North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, around the time of North Korea’s first successful ICBM test in 2017, debate raged over the genesis of North Korea’s achievements. Some experts alleged that North Korea likely relied on rocket engines imported from Russia or Ukraine, or even on a Russian design, although no clear evidence was presented to support shipments of goods from either country. Doubts about the domestic origins of North Korea’s more recent ICBM designs have also been largely unfounded. North Korea’s recent success in its missile efforts appears to have been largely achieved with domestic designs and expertise honed over decades and built on external expertise and imported technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iitechnology-and-un-sanctions&quot;&gt;II.Technology and UN Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, North Korea has sought to obtain a wide range of different types of technology for its weapons programmes – complete systems, constituent parts, materials and components, expertise, and sensitive information. This chapter digs deeper into the types of technology and the UN sanctions seeking to prohibit their transfer. It provides a loose typology of the technology; addresses the question of the role of North Korea’s technology imports, as opposed to domestic production and indigenisation; and explores key concepts, including “dual-use” and intangible technologies, in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-loose-typology&quot;&gt;A Loose Typology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in Chapter I, North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have been built on imported technology. This is just part of North Korea’s procurement picture: imports of technology and illicit procurement networks have had a much wider application for North Korea’s strategic, defence and other development (see Box 2). They have allowed a country that long had a limited domestic industrial base to develop relatively advanced capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-chemical-biological-and-conventional-weapons-and-other-commodities&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 2: Chemical, Biological and Conventional Weapons and Other Commodities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes may be its most impactful and well-recognised procurement area, but the country’s illicit networks seek a much wider range of prohibited goods that benefit a range of strategic efforts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chemical Weapons&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has an active chemical weapons programme, as demonstrated by the assassination in 2017 by North Korea of Kim Jong Un’s half-brother, Kim Jong-Nam, with the VX nerve agent. North Korea has relied on imported precursor chemicals (chemicals used to produce chemical weapons) for its programmes in the past.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Biological Weapons&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea is believed to have an active biological weapons programme. Analysis of images from a 2015 visit to a fertiliser factory suggested that the facility could produce bioweapons, and that modern equipment seen in the facility suggested an “active large-scale sanctions busting effort to illicitly procure the equipment” for the programme.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Military Technologies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has sought to illicitly procure military technologies, in breach of the UN arms embargo in place since 2006. Many dual-use materials used in WMD programmes will also have utility in military production. A 2013 interdicted shipment of arms from Cuba to North Korea also demonstrates North Korea’s interest in procuring spare parts for existing weapons systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Other Commodities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea also illicitly procures a range of other goods prohibited by UN sanctions – from oil to run its economy and military, to luxury goods to maintain the regime.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 summarises the broad types of technology that North Korea has sought. These include technologies with direct and specialised applications in the nuclear and missile programmes. They include goods controlled by the NSG and the MTCR in their respective control lists: the NSG’s Part I “trigger list”; and the MTCR’s Annex Category I. Technologies sought include tangible materials, goods and components, as well as related intangibles – design information, sensitive data and knowledge relating to these items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5K0BIqW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Broad Types of Nuclear and Missile Technologies Sought by North Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual-use technologies, those listed in the NSG guidelines’ Part II “dual-use list” and the MTCR Annex’s Category II list, also underpin North Korea’s programmes. In simple terms, dual-use technology describes those materials, goods, components and related intangibles that have both military and civilian applications. This loose category includes a wide range of technologies, everything from advanced materials and components to manufacturing capabilities. For example, alloys used in producing centrifuges could be used in the manufacture of civilian airliners, and carbon fibre used in centrifuges and missiles could have applications in high-end racing cars and yachts or even golf clubs. Machine tools used to machine centrifuge or missile components could be used in a wide range of high-end manufacturing applications. Many of the technologies used in centrifuge and missile plants – for example programmable logic controllers to control industrial processes, pumps, valves, pipes and hoses to facilitate the movement of liquids and operate centrifuges under vacuum – have applications in a wide range of other manufacturing facilities. Not all dual-use technology with applications in a WMD programme will be listed by the NSG and the MTCR, with items falling below the control thresholds still of utility to WMD programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-technological-needs&quot;&gt;Evolving Technological Needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What parts of this broad nuclear and missile technological picture is North Korea currently seeking outside its borders? There is very limited evidence of North Korea’s procurement activity, especially in the nuclear area, which is a challenge for judging continued dependence. Nuclear and missile technology experts interviewed for this paper suggested there is likely a declining range of areas where North Korea is truly dependent on external sources of technology. North Korea is likely capable of producing most of the nuclear-specific goods it needs domestically after more than 40 years of effort, and this is probably also true for missile-specific technologies. Many of these most sensitive technologies are more challenging to obtain from the international marketplace and therefore have likely been priorities for North Korea’s indigenisation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, North Korea’s programmes are still far from self-sufficient, with the country looking externally for a range of technologies, including many dual-use goods. With such a wide range of dual-use technologies required for these programmes, North Korea would expend significant effort to try and produce all of them domestically. These dual-use technologies are also readily available from a wider range of international manufacturers than they were a decade ago. The present-day Chinese market is likely able to provide most, if not all, of the dual-use technologies required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interest in certain types of goods from certain manufacturers or other countries for quality or prestige reasons might see procurement operatives target technology from the US, Europe and Japan, for example. Much of the evidence discussed in Chapter III supports this hypothesis. Many of the tangible technologies for which there is evidence of North Korea’s pursuit in recent years have been dual use. In terms of the missile programme, an expert interviewed remarked that Western goods “are not make or break for the programme”. There are, obviously, areas where procurement of very specialised goods or intangibles may be necessary or helpful, particularly in areas of more exotic and “emerging” technologies where North Korea has less experience, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above analysis therefore calls into question the utility of the term “chokepoints”, often used to refer to areas where proliferators are dependent on foreign sources of technology and can be squeezed by export controls. As one expert interviewee noted, the term is “problematic”, especially when used in relation to proliferators that have been seeking technology for decades and, recently, in an era when the global manufacturing base for dual-use technologies has grown. With dual-use technologies more readily available, states such as North Korea are more likely to be able to procure such technologies from states with weak export control implementation and enforcement, as well as from entities that are willing to sell to proliferators, or ignore red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several transfer vectors relating to the intangibles of design information, sensitive data and knowledge. These include espionage, entering into technology transfer agreements, attending technical exchanges, training workshops or conferences, and engaging in research collaboration with entities overseas. More recent procurement of intangibles has likely taken the form of engaging in research collaborations, stealing information and data through hacks, and downloading open source research papers, as well as building domestic expertise through hands-on testing and refinement. Efforts to attract the expertise of external scientists and engineers, as occurred in the early 1990s following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, are less prominent in North Korea’s current efforts to access nuclear- and missile-related knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;un-sanctions-and-illicit-procurement&quot;&gt;UN Sanctions and Illicit Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the nuclear, missile and dual-use technologies that North Korea is seeking are covered by the UN North Korea sanctions regime, which prohibits the transfer of goods to, and technical collaboration with, North Korea. The regime, imposed by the UN Security Council through its Chapter VII powers, is legally binding on all UN member states. The first UNSCR in 2006 (UNSCR 1695) required all states to “exercise vigilance and prevent” the transfer of missile and WMD technology to North Korea. A further resolution the same year (UNSCR 1718) was more specific, declaring that all member states “shall prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to the DPRK, through their territories or by their nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, and whether or not originating in their territories” of nuclear and missile technology, and linking to the list of technologies in the 2006 version of the NSG guidelines and the MTCR’s “Equipment, Software and Technology Annex”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lists associated with these technologies have been updated periodically as the NSG and MTCR lists are updated annually. Resolutions in 2013 (UNSCR 2094) and 2016 (UNSCR 2321) provided annexes that included further goods to which the existing prohibitions would apply. The technology lists were last updated by the Sanctions Committee in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2006 (UNSCR 1718) there has also been a “catch-all” provision on the transfer of any technology that could contribute to North Korea’s WMD programmes. The Committee also notes that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All Member States are further required to implement a binding dual-use “catch-all” provision to apply the above measures on any item if the State determines that it could contribute to the DPRK’s nuclear or ballistic missile programmes, other weapons of mass destruction programmes or other activities prohibited by the resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond prohibitions on the transfer of controlled technology that should be implemented through UN members’ national systems for implementing export controls and sanctions, there are also various provisions for inspecting cargoes. Earlier UN Security Council resolutions “called upon” states to inspect cargo to and from North Korea, particularly if they had “information that provides reasonable grounds [for] believ[ing]” that the cargo contained prohibited items, including nuclear or missile technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolutions also include prohibitions on activities that might allow North Korea to obtain intangibles relevant to WMD development. For example, as early as 2006 (UNSCR 1718), the sanctions decided that all UN members “shall prevent any transfers to the DPRK … of technical training, advice, services or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use” of the nuclear, missile or military items prohibited for transfer to North Korea. Three years later, UNSCR 1874 called upon UN members to “exercise vigilance and prevent specialised teaching or training of North Korea nationals within their territories or by their nationals, of disciplines which could contribute to North Korea’s proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolutions in 2016 further tightened restrictions. UNSCR 2270 required that “all Member States shall prevent specialised teaching or training of DPRK nationals within their territories or by their nationals of disciplines which could contribute to the DPRK’s proliferation sensitive nuclear activities”. UNSCR 2321 in 2016 provided more detail on the ban on training, and also decided that all UN members should “suspend scientific and technical cooperation involving persons or groups officially sponsored by or representing the DPRK except for medical exchanges”. UNSCR 2375 in 2017 also decided that states should prohibit joint ventures with North Korea entities, which could potentially involve collaboration on technology with overseas partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions regime was monitored by the UNSCR 1718 Committee PoE, which was set up in 2009 and conducted investigations into various breaches and potential breaches of UN sanctions over the next 15 years. Through more than 20 mid-term and final reports, the PoE put significant information about North Korea’s illicit procurement into the public domain. The PoE was disbanded at the end of April 2024 following Russia’s veto of and China’s abstention on a resolution to extend its mandate to April 2025. The dissolution of the PoE significantly reduces scrutiny of the implementation of the UN sanctions on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, including those relating to technology transfer. Sanctions effectively remain in place, but unmonitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-procurement-evidence-activity-and-needs-since-2017&quot;&gt;III. Procurement Evidence: Activity and Needs Since 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the closure of many international borders between 2020 and 2023 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea has continued to procure controlled technology for its nuclear and missile programmes. As a UN PoE report noted in 2021, “foreign representatives of trading companies … including Korean Mining and Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) and Saengpil Associated Corporation, who have been stuck overseas during the pandemic, have continued to import and export munitions materials to earn foreign currency and to assist with the development of weapons”. Indeed, the US government designated seven North Korean procurement agents, based in China and Russia, during the pandemic years, along with a range of other operatives involved in cybercrime, arms sales and other revenue-raising activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the reopening of North Korea’s borders, and short-range missile transfers to Russia in the latter half of 2023, North Korea’s procurement networks are likely working at full speed to compensate for difficult business environments during the pandemic, and probably also to fulfil increased production for Russia’s orders, on top of meeting domestic needs. This chapter considers North Korea’s current procurement needs, focusing on evidence, largely from the past five years, of North Korean procurement activity and related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-procurement-secretive-but-ongoing&quot;&gt;Nuclear Procurement: Secretive but Ongoing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is publicly known about North Korea’s nuclear procurement efforts, particularly in recent years, due to the secrecy surrounding its nuclear programme and the limited number of seizures of nuclear-related goods. There is some limited evidence on the public record that goods of use in nuclear applications have been procured in recent years, some as recently as 2021. However, these were goods with both nuclear- and missile-related uses and were procured by networks that allegedly benefited entities linked to the ballistic missile programme, discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most recent publicly known example of nuclear procurement involved vacuum equipment, between 2013 and 2016. A North Korean national, Kang Mun Kil, working on behalf of NCG-related entities, was involved in the procurement of pressure transducers – used to regulate pressure in centrifuge-enrichment facilities – from a Chinese company in 2013 and 2016. Kang also likely used a Hong Kong-based company for nuclear-related procurement until it was dissolved in 2017. Besides information about these purchases, little is publicly known about where the technology for North Korea’s centrifuge programme originated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is believed that North Korea manufactures the centrifuges domestically, for which it requires imported advanced machine tools. State media visits to factories have shown that North Korea possessed many of the machines required to produce centrifuge parts a decade ago. As R Scott Kemp noted in 2013, “it appears that North Korea is, at a minimum, well on its way to freeing the centrifuge program from dependence on foreign supplies and technology”. These machine tools are mostly imports, with the public record showing North Korea’s efforts to procure tools from the US, Europe, Japan and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 list of “chokepoint” items put together by the UN PoE, detailing “items for its nuclear program which North Korea could seek to procure overseas”, included a range of centrifuge-related technologies. Among these were technologies for centrifuge manufacture (autoclaves, computer numerical control machine tools and high-strength materials) from composite materials (basalt fibre, carbon fibre, filament winding machines, glass fibre, para-aramid fibre) and metals (flow-forming machines, maraging steel); centrifuge facility pipework (bellows-sealed valves); vacuum systems (pressure gauges, pressure transducers, vacuum pumps) and control systems (inverters); and tools for isotopic analysis (mass spectrometers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has also been seeking goods for its fuel cycle assets used in the production of plutonium. In December 2023, the country first operated its experimental light water reactor, which had been under construction since 2010. Procurement for this project, as well as for the existing 5 MW and IRT-2000 reactors and reprocessing facilities, is likely to be ongoing. An unnamed UN member state expressed concern that at the end of 2018, North Korea had been looking to procure several dual-use nuclear items. These included: lithium hydroxide, “added to reactor coolants and functions to curb metal corrosion of nuclear reactor cooling pipes in military use”; high-purity graphite, used as a reactor moderator; and Austenitic stainless steel, a material used in nuclear reactors (and also with missile-related applications).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the UN PoE’s 2020 nuclear chokepoint list included technologies related to the plutonium side of the fuel cycle. These included technologies related to reactors (pressure vessels) and reactor fuel (zirconium for fuel cladding), as well as reactor moderators (deuterium, heavy water), materials for neutron absorption (boron powder, boron-10, graphite), and equipment for handling plutonium and other isotopes (manipulators, radiation shielding windows), as well as neutron detectors that are used in reactors and elsewhere where there are criticality-related safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond procurement for fissile material production, the PoE has suggested that North Korea continues to procure weaponisation-related technologies. Some of these were included in the 2020 nuclear chokepoint list, including those for preparation of fissile material cores (controlled atmosphere furnaces, isostatic presses), components for a nuclear device (beryllium, capacitors, triggered spark gaps) and nuclear testing instruments (flash X-ray equipment, high-speed cameras). While limited cases have been seen in the public domain, analysis by the PoE suggests that North Korea’s nuclear procurement needs remain wide ranging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missile-procurement-persistent-and-more-prominent&quot;&gt;Missile Procurement: Persistent and More Prominent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more publicly available information about North Korea’s recent ballistic missile procurement, likely in part due to the high levels of concern surrounding recent ICBM testing and the efforts of the US and allies to counter related procurement networks. Indeed, the most recent details about North Korea’s reliance on Western components have come from analysis of the wreckage of short-range missiles fired by Russia at targets in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research published by Conflict Armament Research (CAR) in February 2024 showcased 290 imported components including 50 unique component types in the wreckage of a single missile, likely a KN-23 or KN-24, recovered from Ukraine. These components provide insights into North Korea’s procurement needs for electronics. According to CAR, the components were procured from 26 companies based in eight jurisdictions: China; Germany; Japan; the Netherlands; Singapore; Switzerland; Taiwan; and the US. CAR noted that more than 75% of the components originated in the US, and more than 75% that could be dated were produced between 2021 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s reliance on imported electronic components for its missiles is well known, seen in analysed wreckage from the Unha-3 rocket launches of 2012 and 2016. That the wreckage from 2024 contained more than 150 components procured in the past two calendar years shows how active North Korea’s procurement networks continue to be. Recent press reports, however, suggest that at least some of the electronic components that appeared to be from European and Japanese sources were counterfeit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other procurement efforts, from as recently as 2023, also suggest North Korea’s reliance on imported materials and components. A 2024 PoE report suggests that in 2023, North Korean procurement operative Choe Chol Min (see Box 4) was “among other activities … involved in attempts to buy inertial measurement units”, likely of use in missile guidance systems. Choe’s wife, Choe Un Jong, was also said by US authorities in 2023 to be purchasing dual-use bearings of use in missile production. The report further noted that in 2023, North Korean procurement operatives “sought to import multiple tons of AlMg6, an aluminium-magnesium alloy, as well as stainless steel sheets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showcasing the quantities of materials imported, at least four orders were also placed in early 2021, overseen by North Korean national Kim Jong Dok. These included “1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel, a special alloy used in missile applications”, with orders totalling more than 80,000 kg, as well as “other missile related technologies, including valves, pumps and ball bearings” and a total of 149,000 kg of other types of steel. A leaked US State Department cable detailing a démarche to China in 2008 notes that 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel was previously used “in a variety of structural parts in Scud B and C missiles”, and the material may have similar uses in more modern North Korean systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 and 2020, Rim Ryong Nam, a North Korean procurement operative based in Shenyang, China, allegedly shipped several tons of aluminium powder, a material of use in solid missile fuel production, to North Korea “on multiple occasions”. A 2020 PoE report noted that North Korea likely needs around 10 tons of aluminium powder annually to support its programme. In early 2018, Rim Ryong Nam was also known to be seeking aluminium powder, as well as other commodities of use in solid-propelled rocket manufacture, including: MAPO, a chemical of use in bonding solid propellant; industrial-use argon; electrolytic copper; metallic chrome; acetone and steel plates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the evidence relating to specific efforts to procure goods, the PoE, the US and an unnamed UN member state have provided information about the types of missile-related goods and materials that North Korea has been trying to source in recent years. Most recently, a 2024 PoE report included a schematic of 60 types of “critical items needed” by North Korea for its ballistic missile programme, noting that 23 of these constituted an “identified target of North Korea international procurement between 2018 and 2023”. While the report highlighted the extensive procurement efforts, it also noted that North Korea had “increased its self-sufficiency” in the manufacture of equipment and components for missile production. This included areas related to manufacturing casings and other complex metal parts, airframes and TELs. The report, drawing on UN member state information, also suggested that North Korea continued to be dependent on imports of “specialty steels and aluminium” and higher-grade carbon fibre, although lower-grade materials would suffice for many requirements in the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2020 US government North Korea Ballistic Missile Procurement Advisory, central to recent US outreach on North Korea procurement, listed eight categories and almost 30 different types of technologies, with a special emphasis on alloys. The information in the Advisory appears to have formed the basis of a 2020 briefing delivered to the PoE which provided more details about North Korea’s capabilities, including chokepoints in production. The construction of extra-large TELs appeared to be something that North Korea had struggled with “for reasons of cost and technology”. In terms of metals, North Korea had “had  difficulty” producing the “quantity and quality” of speciality steels and aluminium. With regard to chemicals used in solid propellent motors, the member state noted that “although the DPRK had manufacturing capacity”, its plant “might not be operating well”, with North Korean engineers having difficulty “producing such materials at the right degree of purity and particulate size”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were similar statements about North Korea’s procurement needs in previous years. Information passed to the PoE by a member state, and published in 2019, indicated that North Korea was procuring goods for processing missile-related chemicals. This included digital indicating controllers, lithium carbonate, sodium fluoride, epichlorohydrin and activated charcoal. A member state also noted that at the end of 2018, North Korea was looking to and may have succeeded in procuring MAPO, “Martensitic stainless steel”, of use in rocket engine parts, and “Austenitic stainless steel”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intangible-technologies-by-any-means&quot;&gt;Intangible Technologies: By Any Means&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond tangible goods, North Korea has also widely sought related intangible technologies. As Philip Baxter and others have noted, North Korea has “pursued a multi-prong strategy to acquire nuclear intangible technology”, adapting its scientific collaborations around sanctions and “coalesc[ing] a cluster of individual researchers and research institutions that are interconnected with each other and with foreign researchers and institutions”. Beyond its international collaborations, North Korea has pursued and likely will continue to pursue, in a more constrained environment, educational and training opportunities overseas, and conduct hacks of technology-holding entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2016 UN ban on scientific and technical cooperation, a 2017 investigation noted that China was home to the “bulk” of North Korean scientists abroad, quoting official Chinese education ministry statistics indicating that 1,086 North Koreans were studying at postgraduate level in China in 2015. The same investigation noted one North Korean scientist studying topics at PhD level related to missile development at one of China’s elite aerospace universities (see Box 3). North Korean students at this institution also downloaded 57,000 research papers on a single day in 2017. A further 2018 study identified 100 published journal articles jointly authored by North Korean and external scientists in areas with significance for WMD and dual-use technologies. This included articles on space- and missile-related technologies, precision machine tools, optical tracking and GPS technology, all authored with Chinese colleagues in 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-spy-scientists-north-koreans-on-chinese-campuses&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 3: Spy-Scientists: North Koreans on Chinese Campuses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An investigation in 2017 by The Wall Street Journal highlighted the role of North Korea’s scientists studying in China, and particularly the role of one individual, a scientist named Kim Kyong Sol, who was based at China’s elite Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). The institute ranked highly in areas such as aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, automation and control, and metallurgical engineering. Kim’s area of study was “mechatronics—a blend of mechanical engineering, electronics and programming”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Kim’s work concerned “MR damping”, a technology used in stabilising spacecraft and absorbing shock in missile-launch systems, including in submarine platforms. He published some results from his research in 2016 with Chinese colleagues, listing his affiliation as “Department of Mechanical Engineering, Kim Chaek University of Technology, Pyongyang, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”. He also published an article in 2017 co-authored with a senior engineer in the Chinese space programme. In 2021 Kim published an article on a similar topic in a North Korean journal.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Footnotes in the 2016 paper Kim co-authored show the research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, a research foundation directly linked to the State Council of the People’s Republic of China. The funding related to hypersonic vehicles. HIT signed an agreement on cooperation with Kim Il Sung University in 2011.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2013, North Korea sent the first group of 12 doctoral and post-doctoral students to enrol at HIT, with 28 working there by 2015. Kim, and at least 11 other North Koreans, left HIT in summer 2017, with others switching to subjects not covered by sanctions, such as management. According to university staff interviewed by The Wall Street Journal, “The North Koreans all had Chinese government scholarships, they said, which provided free housing and tuition and monthly stipends of about 3,000 yuan ($450)”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean operatives have also hacked foreign companies, including the systems of NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a Russian missile and space company that produces ICBMs, hypersonic missiles and satellites. This intrusion began in late 2021 and continued until the company uncovered it in May 2022, allowing the hackers “the ability to read email traffic, jump between networks, and extract data”. Beyond hypersonic technology (the company produces the Russian 3M22 Zircon hypersonic cruise missile), North Korea could have been interested in other technologies developed by the company, for example, ampulisation technology, where liquid-fuelled missiles are fuelled and sealed in the factory, allowing higher combat readiness for extended periods. More broadly, Microsoft noted in a 2023 report that the “North Korean government is assigning multiple cyber groups to meet high-priority collection requirements to improve the country’s military capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-procurement-entities-organisations-and-operatives&quot;&gt;IV. Procurement Entities: Organisations and Operatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such wide-ranging procurement needs, North Korea relies on a diverse network of procurement operatives based in a range of countries, but mostly focused on China and Russia. This chapter considers the organisations, the types of actors working on their behalf, the industry targets these networks seek to exploit, and the procurement intermediaries. Case studies are used to provide further details on the types of actors that coordinate and make up these supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organisations-and-front-companies&quot;&gt;Organisations and Front Companies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many entities involved in North Korea’s illicit procurement operations for nuclear- and missile-related goods, as well as for broader military, chemical and biological warfare, luxury goods and other commodities. North Korea’s sanctions-busting networks are near to global in scope, and their procurement aspects represent a narrower sub-section, based in and around economies with advanced technologies. The entities for which there is open source information likely represent the tip of the iceberg, and also may already be inactive. As a member state has noted: “In order to circumvent sanctions, North Korea changes its import/export-related organisation structures every eight months”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these constraints, Figures 1–3 offer an overview of North Korea’s WMD-related procurement apparatus, showing selected parent entities, state trading companies and front companies. There are likely other front companies and operations that are not detailed in open sources and may even be unknown to interested intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s nuclear- and missile-related procurement infrastructure is spread across several government entities that run front companies which both raise revenue and purchase goods. Of these, least is known about nuclear-related procurement, undertaken by entities such as NCG, falling under the control of the General Bureau of Atomic Energy (GBAE), or the Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry (MAEI), as it appears to have been named since 2013. The UN describes both the GBAE and the MAEI as having oversight of the operation of the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement for the ballistic missile programme is largely undertaken by entities which fall under the Munitions Industries Department (MID), “responsible for overseeing the development of the DPRK’s ballistic missiles”. Under MID is the Academy of National Defense Science (ANDS, previously the Second Academy of Natural Sciences, SANS), which UN sanctions lists note is “involved in the DPRK’s efforts to advance the development of its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs”. Information provided by an anonymous UN member state notes that ANDS has a “procurement office” that oversees the front companies and procurement agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also falling under MID is the Second Economic Committee, which, the UN has noted, is “responsible for overseeing the production of the DPRK’s ballistic missiles, and directs the activities of KOMID”. MID may also oversee some procurement for the nuclear weapons programme, because it includes the Nuclear Weapons Institute. A third entity, the Ministry of Rocket Industry (MORI), was sanctioned by the US in 2022 and noted to be “owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the MID”. The US State Department has noted that MORI “works with DPRK overseas representatives from other DPRK organisations to support Ministry of Rocket Industry procurement goals”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement is also undertaken by entities connected to the Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces and the Korean People’s Army. The Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), “DPRK’s premiere intelligence organization”, oversees the arms trading company Green Pine Associated, which has been involved in procurement. The RGB also has been connected to cyber actors such as the Lazarus Group, which in a high-profile case in 2023 hacked a Russian missile manufacturer for sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;notes-applying-to-above-figures-13&quot;&gt;Notes applying to above Figures 1–3:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lines suggest subordination and loose control, rather than necessarily being indicative of supplier relationship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The figures do not include entities for which there is no evidence of a WMD-related procurement role, even if they are known front companies involved in arms trading or other related activities. Information on entities’ role in procurement can be found in RUSI’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dprk-reports.org/&quot;&gt;“DPRK Reports Database”&lt;/a&gt;, which uses information from the PoE reports and details involvement in illicit WMD-related procurement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following entities are either not listed in the database or are listed without information about procurement: Korea Kumsan Trading Corporation; Tosong Technology Trading Company; New East International Trading; Ryonbong General Corporation; Korea Kwangsong Trading Corporation; Korea Hyoksin Trading Corporation; Korea Ryonhap Trading Corporation; Korea Ryungsong Trading Company; and Green Pine Associated Corporation. Evidence of the procurement role of these entities (rather than of arms sales, some of which pre-dates the first PoE report in 2010, and even UN sanctions in 2006) has been drawn from US designations, leaked US State Department cables and media articles. The US Treasury suggests that at least one of the four trading companies subordinate to MORI has imported “large equipment manufactured by a European company to North Korea”, without specifying which (all four are included in the figure). See &lt;a href=&quot;https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0695&quot;&gt;US Treasury, “Treasury Targets Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction Organization and Subsidiaries”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opaque nature of these networks means that it is unclear to which parent entity some of the front companies are subordinate. The front companies likely change frequently to avoid scrutiny. Procurement is known to not have been undertaken by some of the entities in Figures 1–3 (at least according to what can be gleaned from open sources) for a decade or longer. Demonstrating North Korea’s flexibility in managing overseas business affairs, there are also cases (including those detailed below) where individuals working for another part of North Korea’s government, for example as diplomats for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also work on behalf of these procurement entities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;network-actors-broker-diplomat-scientist-spy&quot;&gt;Network Actors: Broker, Diplomat, Scientist, Spy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean operatives work for these entities overseas. There may be tens or even more than 100 of these individuals operating at any one time, although, as a UN member state noted in 2019: “The number of DPRK procurement agents overseas is decreasing and those remaining are focusing on the procurement of critical missile related components as well as dual-use and below-threshold items”. These procurement operatives likely remained overseas during the years of Covid-19 border closures, with Pyongyang only starting to rotate senior diplomats for the first time since the 2020 border closures in late 2023. This section takes a closer look at these procurement agents, as well as other diverse actors involved in technology acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Nodes in North Korea’s WMD-Related Procurement Network (Asia, 2018–present)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures 4 and 5 provide a geographical overview of North Korea’s procurement networks, drawing together data from 2018 to the present. Designations over the past few years have highlighted the role of North Korea’s procurement operatives in China and Russia. For example, in 2022, the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated one Russia-based and four China-based North Korean nationals for their roles in procurement representing “SANS-subordinate organisations”. These included one person in Vladivostok who had procured telecoms-related items from Russian firms, two in Dalian who had procured steel, and two in Shenyang who had procured software and chemicals. This followed the designation of 10 China-based representatives of the Korea Ryonbong General Corporation in 2018. As the press release noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many of these individuals are located at Ryonbong representative offices in China near the China-North Korean border, where they support the regime in a variety of ways: the Ji’an office handled large quantities of a wide variety of multi-purpose goods such as chemicals, drilling equipment, hoses, metals, and machines; the Dandong office procured multi-purpose items for North Korean arms proliferators; and the Linjiang office often was tasked to fill orders consisting of high quantities of goods worth several millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recent cases have also involved procurement operatives in China and Russia. In 2023, the US sanctioned a Beijing-based husband and wife procurement team (see Box 4). Recent PoE reports have also emphasised the role of North Koreans based in China, including Kim Jong Dok, who placed orders with another Dandong-based North Korean national, and Rim Ryong Nam, based in Shenyang (see Chapter II).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-procurement-operatives-keeping-it-in-the-family&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 4: Procurement Operatives: Keeping it in the Family&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2023, the US Treasury sanctioned two North Korean nationals for their involvement in the procurement of technology for North Korea’s missile programme. These individuals were Choe Chol Min, “a Beijing-based SANS representative who has worked with DPRK weapons trading officials, PRC [Chinese] nationals, and other associates” and his wife, Choe Un Jong, a Beijing-based North Korean diplomat.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Born in 1978, Choe Chol Min appears to have a background in scientific research. An individual with the same name appears to have published a series of academic papers under an affiliation at the Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang. These papers on materials and castings – if written by the same person – suggest he was well placed to understand procurement requirements and assess potential suppliers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The US sanctions notification noted that Choe “received procurement requests from the DPRK for items and coordinated with associates to fulfill those orders”. It also identifies other activities, including collaborating with SANS representatives “to facilitate the dispatch of over a thousand DPRK workers” to China. These appear to be forced labourers, used to generate funds which are made available for the regime’s use, rather than missile technicians or scientists. The listing also notes Choe’s support to North Korea’s “primary weapons trading entity”, likely to be KOMID, in line with similar US language use, and his work with “DPRK weapons trading officials to purchase electronic equipment for Iranian customers”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Choe Un Jong, “officially assigned” to the North Korean embassy in Beijing, allegedly supported her husband’s work, and “helped coordinate an order with one or more SANS associates for dual-use bearings that are used in DPRK ballistic missile production”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the procurement operatives, North Korea’s diplomats have long played a role supporting the country’s nuclear and missile programmes. This was seen from the earliest days of North Korea’s procurement operations, as they sought to breach the CoCoM embargo. Chapter I describes the role of diplomats such as Yun Ho-Jin and Kim Jong Ryul in Western Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s. North Korean diplomats have continued to play this procurement role, alongside their role in holding together North Korea’s broader sanctions-busting networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embassies in several locations have emerged as procurement hubs for North Korea’s WMD programmes, particularly those in more developed countries with close access to advanced manufacturing technologies. In Europe, Germany and Switzerland have traditionally been a hunting ground for North Korea’s procurement operatives. In 2018, a senior German intelligence source noted that the North Korean embassy in Berlin was being used for WMD-related procurement. The North Korean embassies in Moscow and Beijing also appear to have played an important role in procurement. The embassy in Moscow has featured in two recent cases, including one involving O Yong Ho (see Box 5). The embassy in Beijing hosted Choe Un Jong, one half of the husband and wife procurement team described in Box 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other types of diplomatic missions and those adjacent to states hosting WMD-related technologies have also been utilised. For example, diplomats connected to a North Korean trade delegation in Belarus were found to be targeting sensitive rocketry-related information in Ukraine around 2011. The 2018 sanctioning of 10 North Korean procurement operatives included an individual noted to be the “Vice Consul of North Korean Consulate General in Nakhodka, Russia”. A representative of North Korea’s state airline Air Koryo, based in Dandong, is also noted in a US sanctions listing to have been “involved in the transportation of electronic parts from China to the DPRK on behalf of the DPRK’s Ministry of Rocket Industry (MORI)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-5-dodgy-diplomats-technology-from-russia-with-love&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 5: Dodgy Diplomats: Technology from Russia with Love&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O Yong Ho, a commercial counsellor in North Korea’s embassy in Moscow, is alleged to have acted as a procurement agent for ANDS in Russia. A UN member state provided information that alleged that he was “in charge of procurement of civilian production-related and consumer goods in the country” and attempted to procure a wide range of strategic commodities between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These strategic goods included aramid fibre (brand name Kevlar – a type of composite material of use in body armour, missiles and potentially centrifuges), aramid fibre production equipment, “a spinning nozzle”, four chemicals, stainless steel used in liquid-fuelled ballistic missiles, and steels used in submarine manufacture and bearings. The largest quantity of any individual product was submarine steel – the diplomat sought to purchase 3,000 tons (worth more than $10 million). This amount of steel is significant, with the Romeo-class submarine on which North Korea’s new missile submarine is based weighing around 2,500 tons. In 2016, O allegedly brought a delegation of North Korean officials to inspect the metal. In 2017, he sought hot and cold isostatic presses, used in manufacturing nose tips for re-entry vehicles, and nozzle inserts for rocket motors.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;O also allegedly sought intangibles. He obtained handwritten instructions for using a specific catalyst in solid rocket fuel from a Russian contact. He also received CAD drawings for a TRDD-50 cruise missile, a Soviet nuclear-capable system first deployed in the 1980s, from a now “allegedly deceased” Russian rocket scientist.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond procurement agents and diplomats, North Korea has also relied on other North Korean nationals for procurement of intangibles – notably scientists and hackers. North Korea has long sought to benefit from scientific expertise overseas, including through trying to attract scientists to North Korea, and sending North Koreans overseas to benefit from education and training. China has been a long-time target of North Korea’s sensitive information gathering, especially in recent years, as its scientific capabilities have grown (see Box 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;targeted-industry&quot;&gt;Targeted Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean procurement operatives target a variety of types of companies that produce the technologies described in Chapter II. This ranges from those who are willing to knowingly supply North Korea to those willing to ignore the full background of those they are selling to, to those who are unwittingly targeted and exploited. The use of procurement agents outside North Korea, intermediaries in third countries (those not hosting the supplier or customer), and the use of a range of deceptive practices have historically allowed North Korea’s procurement operatives – and indeed those of other proliferating countries – to dupe industry that is trying to comply with export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s interest in Russia and China stems from the availability of technology and the prevalence of manufacturers for the goods. Recent cases have reflected this, with Kim Jong Dok placing orders through a North Korean-controlled front company with “several Chinese companies”, allegedly including firms in the cities of Zibo and Shandong. Elsewhere it was noted that he regularly placed orders with unspecified “third country based” companies – presumably those outside North Korea and China. In the case of Rim Ryong Nam, aluminium powder and chemicals were procured from another company in Shandong province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these contexts, some cases show that North Korean agents have built relationships with specific local companies over a longer period – indeed, this would probably be their aim, in order to create a steady supply of technologies. One Russian businessman who sold bearings to North Korea and was sanctioned by the US Treasury noted that he maintained a relationship with a North Korean diplomat based at the embassy in Moscow for several years, and was passed on to the diplomat’s successor when he returned to Pyongyang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and especially China, with its rapidly expanding manufacturing base, likely can provide many of the dual-use technologies required by North Korea. However, North Korea’s procurement operatives may still look elsewhere for some technologies to sustain its programmes, either because they seek particular items of the highest quality, or because of a bias in favour of items from specific manufacturers or jurisdictions such as the US, EU states or Japan. These goods may include high-end semiconductors similar to those found in the missile wreckage from Ukraine, or high-end machine tools and spare parts. Procuring from third countries such as China, an enormous and important market for normal and benign exports, likely helps to alleviate some concerns of export compliance officers based in these exporting companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political will on the part of many supplier states to implement both sanctions and export control systems, and their willingness to engage industry to counter illicit procurement, mean that WMD-related procurement efforts more frequently rely on deception. To this end, WMD-related procurement operatives, including those working for North Korea, have developed a range of deception methods over time (see Box 6). Many of these are not new, having also been used by other proliferators to procure technologies in breach of embargoes – from the Soviet Union during the Cold War to Iran, Iraq, Israel, Pakistan and Syria – to supply their WMD programmes. These means of deception are also designed to make it more difficult for export control enforcement, intelligence and customs authorities to uncover illicit procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-6-means-of-deception-how-does-north-korea-dupe-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 6: Means of Deception: How Does North Korea Dupe Industry?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Goods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By carefully selecting the types of goods they are looking to procure, North Korea operatives enhance their chance of successful procurement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sub-control-threshold items being procured, rather than controlled items, can result in less scrutiny. In some cases, sub-threshold items (for example, electronic components) can be used in WMD programmes, but are more likely to fail in these applications.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Second-hand items are less likely to be viewed as sensitive and are more likely to be sold by those who do not understand the risks of illicit procurement&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Industry Targets&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Certain types of industry targets will be more susceptible to North Korea’s illicit procurement and WMD-related illicit procurement more broadly, particularly those that work in ways that avoid direct contact with sellers or permit procurement without approaching the manufacturers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Second-hand markets are likely to be less regulated and may facilitate North Korea’s procurement operatives’ avoidance of approaching the manufacturers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Business-to-business websites can allow procurement agents to retain more anonymity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Distributors generally have a lesser understanding of the products and what they can be used for and may be less concerned about reputational risk, since their logo is not on the product.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Naive exporters, for example those new to export or with weak domestic compliance programmes, may undertake limited due diligence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Methods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s procurement operatives will commonly use several methods to deceive exporters and export controllers, often to obscure the true end user or end use.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Third-country entities or transhipment hubs – for example, China, Russia and Hong Kong – are used to route goods and obscure the end-user.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Multiple intermediaries are used to help to obscure the true buyer.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Aliases and a range of different letterheads are used to get around being listed or designated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Falsifying end-user undertaking, making it look as if the end-user has a legitimate civil use for the products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Transfer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Once successfully procured, certain methods will be used to reduce the chances that shipments are interdicted on their route to North Korea.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mislabelling goods in documentation – “machinery” or “spare parts” are less likely to gain attention than listing specific products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Falsifying shipping documentation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Concealment of the goods, for example at the back of a shipping container, or underneath similar but uncontrolled items.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intermediaries-chinese-cross-border-networks-and-moving-the-goods&quot;&gt;Intermediaries: Chinese Cross-Border Networks and Moving the Goods&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of intermediaries in China has been extensive in North Korea’s procurement networks. China has long accounted for the bulk of North Korea’s international trade, and has also emerged as a significant producer of dual-use technologies in recent decades. This has made the border between China and North Korea, and specifically the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge across the Yalu River in the town of Dandong, central to North Korea’s procurement operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large mixed Chinese networks illegally selling North Korean coal in China and using the proceeds to purchase general commodities such as sugar and fertiliser as well as dual-use goods – and potentially nuclear- and missile-related items – and moving them across the border have provided a lifeline for North Korea’s economy and its strategic programmes. A 2020 RUSI report noted the close-knit nature of these networks, highlighting that a small set of 150 Chinese companies accounted for around 20–25% of global exports to North Korea in 2015 and 2016. The report also noted that of these 150 companies’ shipments to North Korea, 93.4% were moved by motor vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the activities of these networks has been more challenging since shipment-level trade data for exports from China to North Korea became unavailable in 2017. However, indictment of two of the larger networks by the US in that timeframe, including that of Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd and Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material (see Box 7), provides insights into the workings of these mixed procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-7-the-dealers-of-dandong-the-role-of-chinese-intermediaries&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 7: The Dealers of Dandong: The Role of Chinese Intermediaries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Large cross-border trade networks run by Chinese intermediaries have acted as procurement proxies, enabling North Korea’s designated entities to access the global financial system, and selling North Korean commodities to raise funds in China that are then used to buy much-needed commodities and WMD-related goods.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Co. Ltd (DHID), part of a wider network overseen by Chinese national Ma Xiaohong, was indicted in 2017 for efforts to evade sanctions and allowing North Korea to access the US financial system using a dual-ledger system and many front companies. An internal company PowerPoint slide deck from 2010, published by the US Justice Department with the indictment, claimed that the company accounted for 20% of China–North Korea trade at that time. Other analysis from trade data has echoed the importance of this network, including DHID accounting for $93 million of exports to North Korea between 2014 and 2017, and $532 million of China–North Korea business between 2011 and 2015. Some of the commodities procured through the network included dual-use goods such as aluminium ingots, aluminium oxide and a tungsten compound.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dandong Zhicheng Metallic Material (also known as Dandong Chengtai Trading Co., Ltd), established in 2005, was part of a second network of companies, overseen by Dandong-based Chinese accountant Chi Yupeng. A confidential source quoted in a 2017 US complaint noted that Dandong Zhicheng imported nearly $700 million of North Korean coal between 2013 and 2017. RUSI analysis of trade data suggests that the company accounted for nearly $500 million of North Korean exports between 2014 and 2017, making it the biggest of the 150 Chinese companies analysed.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The proceeds of coal sold through Chinese intermediaries were used to purchase a range of products, including “bulk commodities (sugar, rubber, petroleum products, soybean oil), cell phones, luxury items, or dual-use technology”. A RUSI report identified several companies in Shenyang as likely purchasing front companies, which trade data indicated had exported goods such as arc welding machines and electrodes, thermostats, barometers and spherical roller bearings to North Korea between 2011 and 2017.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As noted by a defector who had first-hand knowledge of Office 39, the office generating revenue for the Kim regime’s personal finances, 95% of funds generated through coal sales are put “toward the advancement of North Korea’s military, nuclear missiles and other weapons programs”. Defector testimony summarised in the case also noted a small number of individuals were key nodes in North Korea’s networks, including Chi Yupeng, who had gained a “trusted position with, and maintained close ties to, North Korean government and North Korean military”.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The US sought civil asset forfeitures against these two networks, seeking $74 million from DHID and $4.08 million from the network surrounding Dandong Zhicheng.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these Chinese intermediary networks move vast quantities of goods across the border, other means are also used to move more sensitive goods to North Korea. In the case of O Yong Ho (see Box 5), he planned to move goods – a large quantity of steel – by rail from Moscow to the rail terminal at the border with North Korea. The US designated representatives of state airline Air Koryo for “engaging in transportation and procurement activities”, noting that they “help the airline transport goods back to the DPRK on behalf of two UN- and U.S.-designated entities involved in intelligence activities, arms trade, and the DPRK’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs”. One of these individuals, an Air Koryo “logistics manager”, worked in Beijing to transfer goods to the RGB in Pyongyang, likely by air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the diverse nature of the entities involved in these networks, their geographical locus in China and Russia, and their long experience in illicit procurement activities have made these networks challenging to counter. North Korea’s declining dependency on manufacturing bases beyond China and Russia, its successes, and the changing geopolitical situation necessitate consideration of future trends that will shape North Korea’s procurement networks, which is the focus of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-north-koreas-future-procurement-networks&quot;&gt;V. North Korea’s Future Procurement Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent developments, including those outside the technical developments in North Korea’s programmes, have implications for the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. This chapter considers some of the main factors that will shape the future of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-procurement-needs&quot;&gt;Evolving Procurement Needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s procurement networks and the technologies they are targeting will evolve in line with the country’s technological needs. As the UN PoE noted, North Korea has been successful in indigenising the production of technologies in certain areas, which may reduce the need to import certain goods. The evolution of North Korea’s programmes will also shape needs, with two examples provided in a recent PoE report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the ongoing shift towards solid-fuel systems, including the potential mass production of the new solid-fuelled ICBM for domestic use, and the short-range KN-23 type missiles for sale to Russia, will create greater requirements for the import of solid-fuel precursors, on which North Korea appears to have some dependency. North Korea’s Five-Year Plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems lists “solid fuel propulsion for submarine-launched and ground-based ICBMs” as a priority area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as North Korea seeks to create greater accuracy for its missile systems, also an objective listed in the 2021 Five-Year Plan, there may be greater demand for guidance components, including “foreign-procured high-quality gyroscopes, accelerometers, complete inertial measurement units and electronics”. Other priority areas listed in the Five-Year Plan may create new procurement requirements, including in relation to military reconnaissance satellites, R&amp;amp;D in hypersonic glide vehicles, nuclear-powered submarines and UAVs. This will likely create greater needs for imports in the shorter term, although North Korea’s indigenisation efforts may offset this in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-north-korearussia-axis&quot;&gt;The North Korea–Russia Axis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s recently renewed relationship with Russia may provide it with access to certain technologies for its WMD programmes, undermining the need to source them from the international marketplace. Media reports surrounding Kim Jong Un’s September 2023 visit to Russia, which included stops at a cosmodrome and a fighter jet factory, suggested that North Korea was interested in “advanced technology for satellites and nuclear-powered submarines”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could potentially supply many of the technologies that North Korea is seeking for the Five-Year Plan for the development of defence science and weapons systems it adopted in 2021. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated in September 2023 that the UN sanctions were “adopted in a completely different geopolitical situation”. Further technological transfers are likely, although these may stop short of direct support to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes, which would be highly controversial. Russia may be incentivised to provide technology to North Korea as a further means of challenging the US and partners, although North Korea’s need for other commodities, including food and fertiliser, for example, means that such sensitive technological barter is not a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-specialised-targets&quot;&gt;More Specialised Targets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is likely to continue to import tangible items for ongoing production at the same time as seeking more niche and advanced tangible and intangible technologies for its development efforts to fulfil its objectives under the Five-Year Plan. The pursuit of technologies related to hypersonics, missile front-end development, satellites and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, for example, means there must be efforts to tap into a smaller pool of highly specialised targets for key technologies, particularly for intangibles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the possibility of some technology being willingly provided by Russia, the expansion of North Korea’s cyber capabilities means that hacks to obtain sensitive information, such as the hack (linked to the Lazarus Group) of a Russian missile manufacturer, are likely to be more common. A 2023 Microsoft report noted that North Korea’s hackers had targeted national defence industries in at least 16 countries, with the five countries most frequently targeted being Russia (14% of attacks recorded), the US (10%), Israel (10%), Germany (9%) and India (7%). Some of the targets that develop very specialist information, such as universities, research organisations and tech startups, for example in the NewSpace industry (developing access to space and spaceflight technologies), may represent softer targets than government facilities and larger corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;procurement-for-partners&quot;&gt;Procurement for Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement of missile- and potentially nuclear-related technologies may also be undertaken by North Korea for partners, alongside the transfer of technology from North Korea itself. North Korea has a long history of overseas missile sales for profit, as well as previously selling nuclear technologies to partners (see Box 8). The risks posed by a return to North Korean missile and potentially nuclear exports are growing. From under the security of a nuclear deterrent, with a greater range of products to offer, some of which have been visibly battlefield tested in Ukraine, a sanctions regime near to collapse and a strengthening partnership between existing customers such as Russia, Iran and Syria, North Korea could be in a good place to benefit from sales. The country’s procurement networks, therefore, may be more likely to undertake this procurement for partners in the near future, as well as to fulfil domestic needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-8-a-nuclear-and-missile-supermarket-north-korea-as-procurement-contractor&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Box 8: A Nuclear and Missile Supermarket? North Korea as Procurement Contractor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea has long been an exporter of missile, and in a smaller number of cases, nuclear, technologies. A wide range of customers for missile technology in the 1980s and 1990s has been slimmed down to a smaller number of collaborative relationships, with countries such as Iran and Syria at the forefront. The recent transfers of missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine may lead to a broader renaissance for North Korea’s missile-exporting industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The most significant example of nuclear exports was the assistance that North Korea provided to Syria in the construction of a nuclear reactor at Al-Kibar, which was bombed by Israel in 2007. In a 2017 case, North Korea apparently marketed H-bomb isotope Lithium-6 on a Chinese business-to-business website in an open advert that could be linked through a telephone number to North Korea’s embassy in Beijing.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;North Korea’s activities in these areas have involved sourcing materials, goods and components for joint projects, whether Iranian missile projects being undertaken jointly with North Korean technicians in Iran, or goods for the Al-Kibar reactor project. In this sense, North Korea provides a contracting service to its partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-collapse-of-un-sanctions&quot;&gt;Potential Collapse of UN Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s violation of UN sanctions through arms and missile purchases from North Korea could lead to a more extensive collapse of the UN sanctions regime. The regime has been on life support for several years, with a failed attempt to secure a further sanctions resolution in May 2022, and no new entities added to the sanctions list since 2017. The 2024 demise of the PoE due to a Russian veto and Chinese abstention from a vote to extend its mandate is a further sign. Besides Russia, China has long dragged its feet on implementation and enforcement of existing sanctions, and could potentially become a more active spoiler, making life easier for North Korea’s procurement networks. If other UN members recognise that Russia is openly violating sanctions with few repercussions, this could cause other states – many in the Global South are already struggling to implement the resolutions – to ignore sanctions evasion activity on a greater scale. Given that these are not technology supplier states, this may have a limited effect on North Korea’s illicit procurement, but some of these states are well suited to act as third-country transhipment or re-export hubs, which could provide new opportunities for North Korea’s procurement networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evolving-networks&quot;&gt;Evolving Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entities and geography of North Korea’s overseas networks will continue to evolve in a broader sense. The recent decision by North Korea to close around a quarter of its overseas diplomatic missions is an example. As noted above, a 2019 PoE report also noted that the number of procurement operatives overseas was declining. Given the core of North Korea’s procurement networks is already focused on Russia and China, these mission closures are more likely to affect broader sanctions-busting efforts, rather than procurement. However, some of the specific missions closing – such as the one in Hong Kong – could have an important impact on procurement operations. The genesis of the closure of so many missions is unclear, but likely reflects the declining benefits of such a network for sanctions busting, the risks posed by defections and foreign intelligence monitoring, and North Korea’s risk aversion. It also may reflect newer remote-work models of sanctions busting, for example earning revenue through IT labourers or cryptocurrency hacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together these potential developments suggest that North Korea’s procurement networks will continue to shop for a wide range of technologies, and likely in a more permissive environment. If the UN sanctions regime continues to weaken, a more focused effort to prevent procurement will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite successes in its nuclear and missile programmes over the past few years, North Korea still relies on external sources of technology to supply its weapons programmes. Judging by its own technology trajectory and other proliferation cases, it will continue to do so in the long term. Over the past decades, procurement networks with tentacles all around the world have been used by North Korea to obtain technology from willing exporters and naive businesses, and through duping those trying to comply with export controls. These networks will continue to be key to the sustainment of North Korea’s programmes and further technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has analysed North Korea’s procurement networks, particularly in light of the successes of the country’s nuclear and missile programmes, and recent geopolitical shifts relating to Russia’s relationship with North Korea in terms of the war in Ukraine. It has drawn on underexploited source material to provide an overview of North Korea’s procurement networks, focusing on the past five years. The paper has found that North Korea’s networks have been highly active, and this is likely to continue as they seek to make up for the slowdown in procurement during the Covid-19-related border closures, and to compensate for goods used in recent Russian orders for missile technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s procurement networks are largely focused on China and Russia. In these jurisdictions, North Korea’s operatives – trading company personnel, diplomats, intelligence officers, and scientists and researchers – have been able to operate with relative impunity and establish supply chains for a growing number of requisite technologies. However, there are still some requirements that see North Korea looking to manufacturers in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets to fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changing dynamic in North Korea’s renewed relationship with Russia is perhaps the most important factor that will shape the future of North Korea’s procurement networks. If Moscow were to formally offer strategic technologies to Pyongyang, or to allow North Korea’s operatives to openly shop on a larger scale from Russian providers, this could be bountiful for North Korea’s procurement needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors will also shape the nature of North Korea’s networks into the future, including evolving procurement needs and greater requirements for highly specialised technologies from a smaller number of niche suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the paper concludes that despite North Korea’s successes, there remains value in seeking to prevent access to, and procurement of, technology (see Box 1). Given this, the paper provides 10 recommendations for those seeking to counter North Korea’s illicit procurement, including government officials, staff at international organisations and researchers outside government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Continue to hone export controls in the West and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls clearly have value, even if they do not prevent all transfers. Resurgent interest in export controls to prevent technology transfer to China and Russia could provide opportunities to identify and build on synergies, particularly given that China and Russia are the two most prominent “third countries” where North Korea’s procurement networks operate. North Korea also clearly relies on many of the same sectors to supply its programmes, including potential overlaps in challenging areas such as microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Continue to build supply-side relationships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Export controls are more effective if a wider range of states agree to implement them. Since February 2022, the US and key partners have built a coalition to implement sanctions against Russia. North Korea should also be factored into this coalition-building, especially given Pyongyang’s growing relationship with Russia. Other forums may also be useful in this context. Regarding Iran, an October 2023 joint statement on ballistic missile activities was released by the US and a group of “Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)-endorsing states” the same day that restrictions under UNSC 2231 expired. Forums such as the PSI may provide opportunities for coordination, given that Russia is a member of other forums where illicit procurement is discussed, such as the NSG and the MTCR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Replace the dissolved UN PoE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demise of the UN PoE in April 2024 was a blow for the sanctions regime. However, the PoE’s reports were also heavily constrained by the Russian and Chinese panel members. For example, the 2024 report has minimal references to the recent large-scale arms and missile transfers from North Korea to Russia, which were in breach of the arms embargo. A new body needs to replace the PoE and continue its role in investigating breaches of sanctions and putting valuable information into the public domain. A spectrum of options is available, each with pros and cons. Key trade-offs in any solution will need to be balanced between a broad, official – and likely constrained – UN body with greater powers to solicit information and legitimacy, perhaps through a UN General Assembly monitoring arrangement, and an unofficial body outside the UN with greater freedom and less legitimacy. Other non-UN forums could also form the basis of an effort, for example the G7 or the PSI, although each will bring its own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Apply open source intelligence to procurement networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of North Korea’s illicit networks have either been uncovered or knowledge of them has been expanded by open source intelligence. This has been used by the PoE, as well as non-governmental organisations, think tanks and academia. Most recently, open sources have shed light on Russian arms purchases from North Korea. Further resources should be devoted to ongoing open source efforts to explore North Korea’s trading networks, particularly those in China and Russia, as well as connections to its remaining diplomatic networks. Business-to-business websites have provided insights into North Korea’s nuclear marketing activities in the past and may also provide insights into procurement. More resources should be dedicated to ongoing efforts and starting new efforts, potentially in conjunction with a body replacing the PoE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Continue UN sanctions outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outreach on UN sanctions by the US and partners should continue, to ensure that third countries see the importance these states continue to place on a North Korea sanctions regime. This should include outreach on broader sanctions issues, as well as illicit procurement and proliferation finance. Funding states should work together to coordinate their outreach efforts to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Employ new tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New tools should be used to complement this outreach. These include those collating the insights of open source investigation and understanding the entities involved in North Korea’s networks and their corporate structures. This would allow governments to better dig into cases, and the private sector to conduct due diligence and understand their risk exposure. RUSI’s DPRK Reports Database, which collates data on entities from the PoE reports in a structured way – previously unavailable outside the near 6,000 pages of the PoE reports – is an example of an innovative solution that can have real-world benefits for governments, the private sector and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Engage “chokepoint” manufacturers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the debatable utility of the “chokepoint” terminology, the evidence suggests that North Korea does still seek certain items from outside China and Russia. This likely includes certain types of machine tools, and extensive microelectronics. There is much to gain from continuing to engage the private sector, from raising awareness, helping to understand procurement methods and identifying suspicious enquiries. This engagement could also be undertaken jointly on issues related to North Korean, Russian, Iranian and even Chinese illicit procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Engage softer targets on cyber security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National governments should make efforts to engage softer targets, such as start-ups, research institutions and universities, that hold sensitive information, particularly about emerging technologies that North Korea is pursuing, on the threat posed by North Korea’s cyber efforts and relevant cyber-security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Challenge the North Korea–Russia relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burgeoning relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang poses a significant proliferation risk, given Russia’s technology capability and need for weapons and materiel. Russia, and previously the Soviet Union, have historically played a role in nonproliferation efforts, so the willingness to provide North Korea with any technology it requests should not be assumed. North Korea also needs other, more benign, commodities, such as food and fertiliser, as well as strategic technology, so technology transfers are not a given. In view of this, there may be opportunities for quid pro quos with Russia to limit the transfer of nuclear and missile technologies to North Korea – although this is unlikely. Furthermore, the issue of Russia–North Korea bilateral strategic trade could be linked, for example, to potential South Korean provision of missile systems to Ukraine for use against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Consider further use of extraterritorial tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, and to a lesser degree its partners, should consider the use of other extraterritorial tools that have been developed and tested on a handful of nodes in WMD-related procurement networks in China and Russia. However, careful consideration should be made regarding possible political and diplomatic blowback.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指黃振強與吳智鴻見面後已達協議 毋須「10個串謀者舉手投票或簽紙」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pTTkkjG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（31日）踏入第62日審訊。控方繼續結案陳詞，提及「屠龍」隊長黃振強稱，起初以為另一隊的吳智鴻表示有槍械及炸彈是「吹水」，但經過行山試槍及炸彈一事後，他已知道屬實。控方指，兩人其後在觀塘康寧道球場見面，黃供稱吳談及之後的行動會用槍及 20kg 炸彈。控方表示，吳智鴻一方早有用槍計劃，而經過兩人的見面後，「屠龍」一方與吳已達成協議，12.8計劃已有雛形。控方強調：「串謀無需要10個串謀者坐喺度舉手投票，或者簽紙證實。當然有做就最好，但基本上犯法，所以唔會咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方張銘裕與吳智鴻曾對話有密切關係&quot;&gt;控方：張銘裕與吳智鴻曾對話、有密切關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈第二日結案陳詞。控方指，屬「屠龍小隊」的被告張銘裕與同謀者吳智鴻在 Telegram 曾通訊，兩人有密切關係，亦明顯知道吳有槍。張曾跟隨吳前往台灣軍訓，其後黃振強聲稱受傷，找張代為出席11月16日晚的西貢行山試槍。黃向張表示「鴻仔未見過其他 Teammates，淨係見過你，咁淨係信你囉」。另外，黃著張在 Telegram 上找吳，因張當日會應要求帶備柴油，而吳亦有照做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指李家田知行山目的是試槍-又指圍封理大非銅牆鐵壁&quot;&gt;控方指李家田知行山目的是試槍 又指圍封理大非銅牆鐵壁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一被告李家田早前供稱，他以為到西貢行山是一般的行夜山。控方卻質疑，李根本知道行山目的是試槍，因黃曾向李表示「你安全度過今晚先」。李又指，他在行山後進入理大但未能離開，並以「吹水」的語氣向成員表示會出席當晚的大鴻輝會議。控方說法是李當時短暫離開理大，並有出席會議。控方表示：「（警方）圍封 Poly 係事實，但圍封並非銅牆鐵壁。」控方引對話紀錄指，黃問「食乜」後，李回應「M記」。控方質疑，若李真的身處理大未能離開，「會唔會跟得咁貼？」李其後表示「好肚餓」、「等我一陣，好快到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在會議後的一至兩小時，李自行退出群組。控方質疑，成員沒有詢問原因，因他們在開會期間已得知李將會前往理大，「無論佢哋幾後生幾勇武，但係已經一齊作為屠龍群組一段時間，冇提及過佢哋完全冷漠到唔理啲隊友，無端白事走，冇人問過一句。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黃振強與吳智鴻在康寧道見面後128計劃有雛形&quot;&gt;控方：黃振強與吳智鴻在康寧道見面後，12.8計劃有雛形&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黃起初以為吳聲稱有槍械及炸彈是「吹水」，但經過行山試槍及炸彈後，他已知道屬實。吳及黃於11月18日在觀塘康寧道球場見面，黃供稱對方談及之後的行動會用槍械及 20kg 炸彈。事隔兩天黃問吳：「你嗰 20kg 幾時到？」、「我哋夾一夾」、「我哋 Team 諗好點用」。控方指，黃與吳見面後，黃就開始提及 20kg 炸彈。控方說法是，吳智鴻一方早有用槍計劃，而兩人在康寧道見面後，12.8計劃已有雛形，「屠龍」一方與吳已達成協議。控方強調：「串謀無需要10個串謀者坐喺度舉手投票，或者簽紙證實。當然有做就最好，但基本上犯法，所以唔會咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，對話顯示黃曾問「有冇人可以 Keep 眼鏡？阿檸出唔到嚟」。控方提醒，需要考慮為何黃會知道李手上有槍。其後黃表示，翌日去泰國將會向隊員談及有「新 Plan」，同時指不用行「眼鏡 Plan」。其後，黃在群組內談及「20 kg」，控方指沒有成員問是甚麼，他們似乎都理解。控方亦指，張銘裕於11月27日將引爆器影片傳送至「滅龍」群組，但沒有成員詢問是甚麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（1日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方指只需證被告加入協議但毋須實行、提陪審團勿帶入政治立場&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qIkLGPS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（30日）踏入第61日審訊。控方開始作結案陳詞，提及本案控罪屬「串謀罪行」，即達成「協議」作不合法行為，控方毋須證明協議成功實行。控方續指，一旦達成協議後，可以「有人進、有人出」，後來加入者只需知道協議目的及自己的角色，毋須知道他人崗位。她引用「打劫」的例子：「我只需要知道目的係打劫銀行，知道我係負責揸車；我唔需要知道邊間銀行，唔需要知道邊個踩線。」至於牽涉籌錢作恐怖主義行為的控罪，則毋須證明與用槍及炸彈相關，只需證明款項用作破壞公共設施及投擲汽油彈等。控方亦提醒陪審員，不論對2019年社會運動取向如何，支持還是反對，但考慮本案時「唔好將自己嘅立場放喺入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方可選擇性相信證人證供&quot;&gt;控方：可選擇性相信證人證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈今作結案陳詞。控方指，陪審員為法理機制中重要的一環，他們作為事實的裁斷者，需考慮控方是否能在毫無合理疑點之下，證實本案罪行。控方指陪審員要考慮是否相信證人或專家的證供，但他們可選擇性相信，毋須盡信。控方舉例，陪審員可選擇是否相信李家田的錄影會面內容：「唔可以話覺得佢靚仔，或者講嘢好聽就信，要聽晒其他證供去選擇」，陪審員亦可以其人生經驗或智慧作出判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方需證明在公共場所或政府建築物-擺炸彈意圖致他人死傷&quot;&gt;控方：需證明在公共場所或政府建築物 擺炸彈意圖致他人死傷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，控方引法例表示，「訂明標的」意指「基建設施、公共場所、政府建築物」。而控罪的元素牽涉在上述地點擺放爆炸性裝置，意圖導致他人死亡或遭受身體嚴重傷害。若陪審員未能就首罪達成裁決，就要考慮作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，但此罪的分別在於「相當可能」會導致相關後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「串謀謀殺」罪，控方指謀殺的對象為警方人員。而在本港法例之下，只需要證明被告有意圖令被殺者受到嚴重身體傷害。控方的立場是，上述3罪均聚焦於12.8計劃，被告是有串謀用槍及放炸彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方籌錢罪毋須證明意圖用錢作128計劃&quot;&gt;控方：籌錢罪毋須證明意圖用錢作12.8計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方指就「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，則毋須證明意圖「籌錢」作12.8計劃，亦毋須證明與槍械炸彈有一定關連性，只需要證明「籌錢」作為恐怖主義行為，包括破壞公共設施及投擲汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方毋須證明非法協議成功實行&quot;&gt;控方：毋須證明非法協議成功實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，本案控罪屬「串謀罪行」，即達成「協議」作出不合法行為，毋須證明協議目的最終成功實行。控方舉例指：「大家可以想像我同我團隊決定打劫銀行，我買槍、你買炸藥、再搵人踩線，咁嘅協議冇可能咁蠢，白紙黑字寫低。」她指加上現代科技的發展，現時有 WhatsApp 及 Telegram 等程式，因此未必會清楚寫下協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方加入協議者只需知目的及自己角色毋須知他人崗位&quot;&gt;控方：加入協議者只需知目的及自己角色、毋須知他人崗位&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，一旦達成協議後，可以「有人進、有人出」，而後來加入者只需要知道協議目的及自己的角色，毋須知道其他人的崗位。她續引用「打劫」的例子：「我只需要知道目的係打劫銀行，知道我係負責揸車；我唔需要知道邊間銀行，唔需要知道邊個踩線」。控方指，在本案中吳智鴻團隊一開始已提及要用槍，其後「屠龍」慢慢加入計劃。控方最後指，雖然警方的拘捕行動令計劃未能完成，但關鍵基礎是本案有協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黃突收錢故賭大咗有幾多後生仔二十出頭見過百幾萬&quot;&gt;控方指黃突收錢故「賭大咗」：有幾多後生仔二十出頭見過百幾萬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就案情方面，控方首先簡述作為污點證人的黃振強的證供。控方指由於黃是認罪後作供，因此陪審員在考慮時要特別小心。控方亦強調，不論陪審員對2019年社會運動的取向如何，是支持還是反對，但在考慮本案的時候「唔好將自己嘅立場放喺入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示，黃接受辯方盤問時，遭指出他為人「貪威識食」、「爛賭」、「賭錢幾大手」。控方又稱，辯方指出黃為人不可信，「明顯想攞最高著數」，而且經常在隊員不知情之下「揸主意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟控方亦指，黃當時任職搭棚工人，正值社會運動之時，「突然不停有錢湧入嚟，百幾萬⋯⋯難聽啲講，有幾多後生仔喺二十歲出頭見過百幾萬。」控方指，黃因此「賭大咗」，並借「屠龍」之名獲取資金，繼續縱容自己的賭博習慣。據黃的證供，「屠龍」成名後獲吳主動接觸，吳亦透露可以找到槍，並想「拉攏」黃的成員加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方炸彈威力大&quot;&gt;控方：炸彈威力大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，警方於2019年12月9日在香港華仁書院檢獲的兩個炸彈，經檢驗後發現內藏金屬釘。控方引述軍火專家報告指，炸彈威力可造成直徑400米內的人死亡或嚴重受傷。控方補充：「炸彈好似好細，但專家話威力就係咁大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;證據顯示吳智鴻及彭軍壕於12月7日至8日，三度前往香港華仁書院。其間吳向黃傳訊息表示：「組裝緊炸彈」、「完成咗個細」。其後兩人要求賴振邦將物資送到港華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方要考慮李家田在錄影會面的狀態-是否似被警打&quot;&gt;控方：要考慮李家田在錄影會面的狀態 是否似被警打&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案僅李家田有出庭作供。控方指，陪審員需要考慮哪些證供屬實。李供稱被警方人員毆打及施行「水刑」共30至45分鐘，但控方卻指：「佢喺錄影會面嘅神態，似唔似俾人打咗30至45分鐘？」控方又質疑，李聲稱遭警方要求記住其他涉案者的姓名，但他在錄影會面時一個姓名都說不出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（31日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap, widely available equipment, from drones to laptops propagating viruses, present asymmetric opportunities to terrorists. At the same time, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has restored the threat of peer-on-peer warfare. A range of new technologies, from cyber to artificial intelligence to biological weaponry and, soon, quantum computing, threaten a sudden leap forward in conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This matters, as an example from as far back as 1982 reminds us. In an attack on Syrian surface-to-air missile sites in the Beqaa Valley, the Israeli Air Force destroyed all 19 sites, together with an astonishing 64 Syrian fighters, without a single loss. With aerodynamically comparable aircraft – and highly motivated pilots – on both sides, it was a single Hawkeye airborne early warning and control system and superior avionics which turned a battle into a turkey shoot. Yet today’s attrition rates in Ukraine emphasise the importance of quantity as well as quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquisition reform is critical, but also a well-trodden area of discussion. While improving defence procurement is a classic “wicked problem” with no easy solutions, we believe there are two areas that the new government needs to focus on. The first is how requirements are generated, and what organisational reforms can improve this process. The second is supply chain management, to enable the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to take advantage of the innovation ecosystem that the UK has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defining-procurement-requirements&quot;&gt;Defining Procurement Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernard Gray’s seminal report of 2009 on defence procurement had a major impact on the operation of Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;amp;S), the sharp end of defence procurement, and he was subsequently put in charge of that organisation. But Gray also had some trenchant analysis on the confused arrangements by which elements of the MoD acted as the “customer” for DE&amp;amp;S. He recommended:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a) DCDS(Capability) to be responsible for the creation and control of requirements, and required to control the budget of the agreed EP as a single point of MoD contact with DE&amp;amp;S for equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;b) Clear ownership of each project/requirement to be allocated to a single individual within DCDS(Capability) team, including business case formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The average timeline and onerousness of MoD procurement rules out a large proportion of companies with which Defence would benefit from engaging&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, when the UK produced world-class equipment across many categories, the operational requirements branch of each service (as capability directorates were then called) had a cross-section of military officers. These branches included the head at each level, scientists, engineers and finance staff and – crucially – controlled their own budgets, up to certain limits. Ironically, the same period when the sharp end of procurement was greatly improved through the Levene Reforms, with the setting up of the Procurement Executive (now DE&amp;amp;S), the highly effective operational requirements branches, which acted as the “supervising customers” for the Procurement Executive and its predecessor organisations were broken up. In the quotation above, Gray effectively recommended the reintroduction of that original structure for operational requirements. This was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complication was that Lord Levene’s second batch of reforms in 2011 involved delegating more powers to the four relevant top-level budget-holders (TLBs) – the Royal Navy, the Army, RAF and StratCom – but each simply took over its share of each central function, capability, technical and financial, replicating the same stove pipe approach with military, technical and financial staff brigaded separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, each capability function continues to be composed almost entirely of uniformed staff, commissioning work from scientists and engineers concentrated in the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), or in a separate part of their individual service branches, while the budget and – crucially – the authority to spend is held by a third body, such as, in the case of the Army, D Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of innovation units has been set up in each of the four TLBs, starting with JHub in StratCom. Early evidence is that these are getting some small projects from conception to fruition with commendable speed. Helping to take forward their work, and innovation more generally, is the Defence and Security Accelerator. These innovation hubs seem to be structured and to operate in a remarkably similar fashion to the old cross-disciplinary operational requirements branches, but they are effectively operating in parallel with the main capability departments; it would seem to make more sense to fix those structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists from DSTL and the individual services, and relevant financial staff, should be reintegrated, and authority returned for smaller projects. This should empower and motivate staffs, and having technical capability in-house and part of each team’s culture should temper any temptation to go for the first shiny offering from an existing contractor. A further point is that all the uniformed officers are regulars, so there is only reserve input when they choose to ask for it. We believe that this has two serious disadvantages. First, reservists may identify opportunities early in the process of designing a capability so as to make it easier to integrate citizen elements – as the Russians did with the simple and robust T34C, and the Germans failed to do with their excellent but over-complex Panzers. Second, civilians often bring knowledge of civilian tech alternatives (from simulation, to communications, to the software lifecycle) more advanced than military equivalents. So reservist officers should be included in the capability function, on the usual part-time basis as on other staffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the MoD has made remarkable progress is breaking down the traditional structures by which personnel train and upskilled. PUBLIC delivered an innovation programme called the Percy Hobart Fellowship, where Royal Navy personnel were exposed to business, digital, and innovation skills, provided a short secondment into a technology startup, and asked to develop an innovation project predicated around a problem that they had experienced. One of these, the development of a mobile onboard operating theatre, has been taken into the formal procurement process, and is projected to save the Royal Navy £8 million per year against the retrofitting of a standard ship’s medical centre. Although a small example in the grand scheme of defence spending, this illustrates that an empowered individual, with the support of a cross-functional team, can develop requirements that help the MoD buy fit-for-purpose equipment that saves money and delivers what is required to the warfighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also shows that, in the upstream identification of requirements, key MoD decision-makers would benefit from secondments and a general exposure to the innovation, science, and technology world outside Defence. The MoD should provide additional structures and opportunities to encourage networking and knowledge-sharing across different units within Defence, leading to a diffusion of ideas and cooperative networks that can help drive better requirement development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;broadening-the-supply-chain&quot;&gt;Broadening the Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent concern that arises from both defence suppliers and investors is the so-called “valley of death”: the gap between the capital available for small-scale pilots and the funding required to develop a production-ready capability. As a result, defence technology is largely seen as an un-investable market for start-ups, given the level of risk capital required to build the competition and supply chain needed to deliver benefits to MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few factors drive this. The first is the disappointing level of market engagement with a diverse set of suppliers. This is partly caused by strict rules around market engagement, many of them rolled over from EU regulations. However, efforts such as Digital Exploitation for Defence (DX4D) aim to increase the touchpoints with digital solution providers. This is important because the best solutions to a problem have often been identified in adjacent markets. Let us not forget that the genesis of Silicon Valley was the defence industry, with Hewlett Packard selling microprocessors to the US Navy. Hewlett Packard selling audio oscillators to the US military To truly take advantage of dual-use technologies and bring a more diverse set of suppliers into the defence market, the MoD must look to expand its market engagement activities beyond the typical avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second factor is the length of procurement timelines for defence. Particularly for specific technology or software applications, as opposed to platforms, the average timeline and onerousness of MoD procurement rules out a large proportion of companies with which Defence would benefit from engaging. The MoD announced in July 2023 that it intends to reduce the maximum timeline for digital acquisition programmes to three years. However, this remains well outside the typical lifespan of a typical early-stage digital start-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to the procurement length is the typical size and structure of MoD procurements. The fact that requirements all too often focus on platforms rather than the weapons and capabilities they carry often means that the MoD misses out on applications, tooling or software that might impact specific, well understood opportunities. This leads to a disproportionate amount of spend going through prime contractors. 2022/2023 MoD spend with SMEs totalled only 5%, well below central government’s target of 25%, which shows the degree to which primes and large businesses dominate this market. This compares to 25% of prime contracting value for the US Department of Defence going to SMEs in 2022. While primes have SMEs and innovative businesses in their supply chains, UK primes are under no obligation to produce figures around how much spend makes its way to SMEs. That power differential is felt by companies in Defence; many start-ups in this space report a reticence to engage with primes because of their ability to dictate terms around important issues, such as intellectual property ownership and transfer of risk, that are disadvantageous or even threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if we want to bring greater diversity, competition, and therefore quality into defence supply chains, we must incentivise the risk capital required to scale disruptive digital and technology businesses. Equity investing in defence companies in the UK from 2021–2023 was 0.6% of that in the US. Investors note the availability of small funding sources for pilots, as well as later stage private equity, but a lack of venture investment in mid-tier funding to carry promising businesses through that “valley of death” to implementation. Therefore, the current route to market is to sell early to a prime, or hopefully gain enough traction in adjacent markets that the challenges mentioned above can be mitigated. This is not an effective way of stimulating a market that delivers good value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By reshaping the formulation of requirements and the cultivation of the defence supply chain, the UK could bring British innovation back into the heart of its armed forces&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several approaches that the MoD can adopt to address these challenges. There should be central guidance to dramatically increase the pace of acquisition for digital programmes. One approach is to use a procurement method known as a Challenge Programme, which allows departments to demonstrate multiple solutions around a particular problem space, allowing them to see what the market has to offer and create a clear pathway to procurement for successful suppliers. The Home Office Accelerated Capability Environment has been a successful example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the clarity and attractiveness of the defence market to start-ups and innovative SMEs, we would like to see greater pre-market engagement, accompanied by a genuine dialogue with the proposed reconstituted integrated capability staffs, to help define requirements and detailed specifications. Primes should be required to make public their spend with SMEs. This will both make the attractiveness of the market clear, and help government hold these suppliers to account for SME spend targets. A greater effort to break down platform procurements into smaller lots would attract more businesses and increase competition and value for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have seen positive efforts from NATO’s DIANA accelerator programme to create not only funding, but also paths to market for leading defence startups. But this is not enough if we want to build a world-beating domestic defence innovation ecosystem. Investors need to be brought into the dialogue to understand and feed into MoD priorities, changing the rules of market engagement where necessary. This would provide valuable insight on the state of the art technologically for government, as well as where spending priorities are for the MoD. A funding mechanism, possibly following structures pioneered by the Enterprise Capital Funds programme at the British Business Bank, to incentivise the creation of funds that focus on mid-stage rather than early-stage growth would go a step further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK used to be a shining example of innovation across the G7 and NATO, from Frank Whittle and Percy Hobart to Alan Turing. There are still points of light, like today’s Government Digital Service. Our warfighters and defence staff deserve the very best that the market has to offer. By reshaping the formulation of requirements and the cultivation of the defence supply chain, the UK could bring British innovation back into the heart of its armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, warfare at sea has been conducted at a higher level of intensity than has been seen for decades. The conflict in Ukraine, in which the Russian Black Sea Fleet was rendered “functionally inactive” by a country without a surface fleet, and the ongoing battle in the Red Sea have provided analysts and practitioners of naval warfare with a wealth of empirical evidence. It is thus germane to consider what lessons the Royal Navy might draw from these conflicts as the force continues a process of recapitalisation which will extend into the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-anti-accessarea-denial-threat-a-challenge-to-be-contextualised&quot;&gt;The Anti-Access/Area Denial Threat: A Challenge to be Contextualised&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remarkable success enjoyed by an overmatched Ukrainian Navy and the country’s security service against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has, understandably, led some to ponder the question of whether we are approaching a tipping point in the conduct of warfare at sea. The ability of the Ukrainians to combine anti-ship cruise missiles, uncrewed surface vessels and land attack missiles such as Storm Shadow into a layered anti-access area denial threat that has partially forced the Russian Navy out of Sevastopol raises important questions regarding the risks which surface vessels face, particularly in confined waters. The proliferation of these capabilities, many of which are now employed by weaker states and indeed non-state actors, will mean that what would have been largely uncontested deployments at sea in the past will involve contested theatre entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, claims regarding the risk to surface combatants themselves should be scrutinised. In the Black Sea, despite high losses in aggregate, the Russian fleet has not endured a historically high loss rate. Over the course of the two and a half year conflict, Russia has lost 22 vessels, which amounts to a loss rate of 0.03 per 100 ship days in theatre. For reference, the US loss rate against Japanese Kamikazes off Okinawa was roughly 0.2 per 100 ship days (with vessels sustaining damaging hits at a rate of 0.44 per 100 ship days), and the UK task force in the Falklands endured 1.35 damaging hits per 100 ship days – despite which both navies prevailed. In effect, then, it is not clear that the vulnerability of vessels to the anti-access threats of yesteryear, be they crewed suicide aircraft or Exocet missiles, was less acute than is the case now. The importance of not overstating the risks to surface vessels has been reinforced in the Red Sea, where the Houthis have thus far failed to successfully engage a coalition surface combatant and where UK and US vessels have enjoyed tactical successes against complex salvos incorporating capabilities such as C-802 anti-ship missiles, Samad-3 UAVs and Asef anti-ship ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, a limited loss rate can have crippling cumulative effects on a fleet over time, as it has had on the Russian Navy. This is true of all forces, but the risk is especially acute in maritime warfare as vessels are increasingly difficult to replace. This in many ways reinforces a classical principle: if a navy has a choice between seeking decision early (even at some risk to its forces) or conserving capability, it should generally opt for the former option. A conservative approach creates false efficiencies, reducing loss rates at any given time but raising the risks of a long war which many navies may not be able to sustain, irrespective of how low they can keep their loss rates. Of course, a navy cannot always force a decision in war – in truth, there was no way the Russian navy could have shortened the conflict. However, its losses in a long war still reinforce the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If a navy has a choice between seeking decision early (even at some risk to its forces) or conserving capability, it should generally opt for the former option&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in both the Black Sea and the Red Sea large surface combatants have been relatively safe, the same cannot be said for less heavily armed vessels and the fixed infrastructure that supports the fleet. Many of Ukraine’s successes have been achieved against platforms such as the Ropucha-class landing ship (which serves as a logistical workhorse for the Russian army) as well as minesweepers and patrol boats. In the Red Sea, the Houthis have enjoyed a comparatively high hit rate against merchant shipping. While warships themselves may not be more vulnerable, the threat that anti-access systems pose will be most acute for the lightly armed (or unarmed) oilers and solid support vessels that enable the Royal Navy’s operations. The effect of this will be significant when limited numbers of support vessels are available. Additionally, while tasks such as mine countermeasures have always had to be conducted under some risk of an air threat, the UK’s (Royal Fleet Auxiliary-operated) mine countermeasures vessels will face an increasingly multilayered anti-access challenge, incentivising uncrewed solutions which can be employed from greater distances and multiple vessel types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed infrastructure has also proven vulnerable even under optimal conditions. The ability of Ukraine’s armed forces to progressively target both vessels and structures in Sevastopol, which is defended by a robust integrated air defence system, illustrates that over time even relatively well-defended fixed bastions will be challenged by cruise and ballistic missiles, among other threats. For the UK, home ports such as Portsmouth are relatively safe. In the absence of a Russian intermediate-range ballistic threat, the primary threat is posed by cruise missiles, which – if launched from the eastern flank – would have to traverse a considerable amount of territory. There is a real threat posed by cruise missiles launched from Russian bombers, surface vessels and submarines from the northern flank, although even in this case, once an Allied maritime component command is stood up, the vulnerability could only be exploited if Russia was willing to risk losing key strategic assets. At home, the risk is likely to be most acute in the early stages of a conflict. That said, key seaports of disembarkation on which elements of the Royal Navy (and the wider UK joint force) would depend in an expeditionary context are far more vulnerable by dint of proximity to likely theatres of combat. Examples include Duqm in Oman and Gothenburg in Sweden. The latter, as Scandinavia’s largest port, has been an important logistical lynchpin of exercises such as Trident Juncture, which included the Royal Navy and Marines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way in which Russia had to eventually defend Sevastopol with not just air defences but also helicopters and barriers (to respectively slow and engage UAVs) also carries more tactical lessons. Of note is the important role played by Russian helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft against unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), which are able to remain below a surface vessel’s radar horizon for extended periods, but which are vulnerable to air attack. This could have ramifications for the Royal Navy’s Merlin and Wildcat fleet, which will also be needed to support other functions such as anti-submarine warfare (ASW), among other tasks. The addition of roles for an already stretched helicopter force might be avoided through the use of autonomous systems, and engaging surface targets in clutter may be an area where machine learning and computer vision – as well as the non-lethality of the engagement – can allow autonomy to be exploited quickly (as contrasted with more complex tasks such as ASW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk to logistical nodes will reinforce another challenge: the difficulty of achieving magazine depth. This is partially a function of cost, since interceptors such as the Aster-15 and 30 cost much more than many of the missiles they may have to intercept. It is also, however, a function of the fact that vertical launching systems (VLS) cannot be safely replenished at sea in even moderate sea states. The likelihood that vessels will expend their VLS loadout, coupled with a risk to any allied or sovereign forward bases on which they may have planned to rely, could – in extremis – force the rotation of Royal Navy vessels to home ports, significantly impacting their operational tempo. Fleet sustainment, rather than protection, may be the biggest challenge in contested theatres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final notable feature in both the Black and Red Sea has been the role of third-party ISR provision. While the extent of the Allied role in providing ISR to Ukraine in the Black Sea cannot be known, it is understood that the US is providing data from space-based ISR to Ukraine 32 times per day, and that Western surveillance platforms have conducted patrols over the Black Sea. In the Red Sea, Iranian special-purpose vessels such as the Behshad have provided cueing to Houthi missile batteries ashore, a role also performed by the Iranian vessel Saviz during the Saudi-led coalition’s campaign. A sub-peer opponent backed by a state source of adversary ISR that cannot be targeted for political reasons will pose a challenge to many concepts for countering anti-access/area denial (A2AD) which depend on destroying or crippling an opponent’s sensors (which may not be an option in indirect conflict). A range of options of varying complexity and risk – from jamming and cyber attacks to covert sabotage (likely conducted against the Saviz by Israel) – are available to navies, but the risks and costs of these options need to be weighed ahead of time as do the cross-service and cross-government dependencies they create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-regarding-the-pacing-opponent&quot;&gt;Lessons Regarding the Pacing Opponent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two conflicts have also illustrated a number of things about putative opponents that the Royal Navy may face, most notably Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s failures in engaging dynamic targets at sea over the course of the Ukraine conflict have been considerable. To use one example, the Russian navy and air force failed to fix and engage the Ukrainian navy’s last surface vessel – the Yuriy Olefirenko – for months, even when it was deployed at relatively close proximity to Kherson to provide naval gunfire support. The inability to engage the vessel at sea (it was eventually sunk in port), despite Russia enjoying air and naval superiority in the Black Sea during 2022, would appear illustrative of broader problems with aggregating data from multiple sensors and tasking platforms dynamically. This may reflect challenges in the stated desire to aggregate information from multiple service branches without reaching back to a higher headquarters or involving multiple separate command chains. While the failure to track a relatively conspicuous amphibious vessel was likely a failure of organisational structures rather than sensors, Russia will struggle in the latter regard as well. Though it aspired to replace the Soviet-era Tselina and Legenda constellations with a robust network of Pion-NK, Lotos and Persona satellites equipped with ELINT, COMINT and EO sensors, it had by 2021 launched only one Pion-NKS satellite, and fields a very limited EO capability. In the absence of a space-based ISR capability, Russia’s ability to track dynamic targets at long distances (except through very non-granular tools such as the Polsodnukh-E OTH radar) will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the methods which NATO has used to employ maritime power as an asymmetrical competitive tool vis Russia – including the deployment of ELINT spoofing on islets in the Aegean during the Haystack exercises and Ocean Venture, which saw emissions-dark carrier operations in Norway (where terrain added an additional layer of complexity to air-based tracking) – may be tactically feasible vis a Russia that does not employ the sophisticated A2AD capability that China does. Towards the end of the Cold War, an inability to perform dynamic tracking led the commander of the Soviet Northern Fleet to request a trebling of his budget, and was a major factor in Soviet assessments of the conventional balance. This is, in principle, good news for a Royal Navy that will be built around aircraft carriers for the foreseeable future. However, the ability to perform these actions during the Cold War depended in great measure on US aircraft carriers and was, moreover, a product of sustained training in complex waters such as those on the Norwegian coastline where operating large vessels requires considerable skill. Any European effort to replicate this (of which the Royal Navy could be an important part) would need to account for fewer available US capabilities in the event that the Indo-Pacific absorbs more capacity. Munitions sustainment and enablement will have to be accounted for, particularly given the small numbers of munitions capable of suppression of enemy air defences, such as SPEAR-3, that are likely to be available. In effect, then, Cold War concepts for employing forces forward to impose multiple dilemmas on a continental power remain tactically valid, but this will only be true if they can be resourced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many of the challenges of greatest significance relate to generating the capacity to leverage existing capabilities and competencies effectively&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major lesson regarding the Russian navy as an opponent, which became particularly stark after the loss of the Moskva, is that the Russian navy is designed to have strategic effects from relative proximity to its ports. From positions in Crimea, the Russian fleet – which is the only service equipped with the 3M-14 Kalibr cruise missile – has been a key component in Russia’s strike campaign against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure which is fixed and easier for Russia to target with complex salvos. Ukraine has progressively degraded this threat, but at a likely considerable cost in missiles. While it is not known exactly how many Storm Shadow/SCALP and Neptune missiles have been used against Russian ports, it is understood that 300 missiles were provided to Ukraine and that striking the Black Sea Fleet was a priority line of effort for Ukraine’s strike campaign. Moreover, each reported cruise missile strike appears to have been preceded by days of attacks using UAVs, possibly alongside other shaping activity. For navies such as the Royal Navy (and indeed the UK joint force), the challenge is not that sinking the Russian surface fleet will be inherently difficult, but rather that if the fleet opts to launch cruise missiles against civilian infrastructure from positions close to air defence networks in Kaliningrad and the northern bastion, there will be a political demand to engage it (irrespective of the military value of doing so) and the task will be a burden in terms of both planning and munitions expended. Given the likely demand for standoff munitions elsewhere in the theatre, this is of importance. Surface strike, then, is a priority line of effort even if the Russian surface fleet is a decrepit force. The requirement to engage targets within well-defended bastions while accounting for limited VLS capacity into the 2030s, even after vessels such as the Type 26 and Type 31 enter service, will make it of particular importance that weapons such as FC/ASW are able to achieve a high Single Shot Probability of Kill in defended airspace, since the smaller a salvo, the more important penetration and successful engagement becomes. Though Russia’s nuclear-powered submarines are its most potent capability, the Russian naval threat is not just a submarine threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflicts in the Red Sea and Black Sea carry a number of important lessons which might inform the Royal Navy’s efforts to generate its future fleet. In many ways, the technological dimensions of these conflicts – though the most heavily studied – have been less important than the fundamental lessons that they carry regarding how a fleet must structure and prioritise tasks to prepare for major contingencies. The lessons learned from these conflicts, then, have an evolutionary quality where many of the challenges of greatest significance relate to generating the capacity to leverage existing capabilities and competencies effectively. Technology can be an important enabler in this regard, but is not a solution in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, Jordan is rarely spoken about in politics or in the media as much more than an anchor of stability in an increasingly fragmented Levant region. To its north lies southern Syria, where Assad has managed to wrestle back nominal control of provinces by striking deals with warlords who collect rent from drugs production. Iraq and Lebanon, two of Jordan’s close neighbours, are captured states, where non-state actors supported by Iran have taken control, and strengthen their grip on power every day through normalising corruption and dispensing patronage to their supporters. To Jordan’s west are the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel, where Israel’s war on Gaza continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan, in comparison, maintains an air of stability, with a stable monarchy and democratic elections. Despite this, Jordan is in a uniquely difficult position due to instability caused by Israel’s war in Gaza and the worsening economic conditions within the Kingdom. Before the 7 October attack, Jordan already struggled with high unemployment, particularly among young people (aged 15–24), at over 40%. Since the conflict began, this problem has been exacerbated by a catastrophic drop in tourism and trade. Tour guides and tourist businesspeople this author spoke to reported almost endemic booking cancellations, with no promise of future work. Jordan’s economic model relies heavily on tourism, and the collapse of that market leaves thousands more unemployed or without income. Jordan’s economy also relies on foreign aid and support, much of which comes from multilateral institutions such as the UN. The withdrawal of US support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is a sobering prospect for Jordanian policymakers, who rely on the work of UNRWA to support the two million registered Palestinian refugees currently in Jordan. In this way, UNRWA, UNHCR and the myriad NGOs within Jordan cover gaps in welfare that the Jordanian civil service simply does not have the money or capacity to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socially, Jordan is in similar disarray. There have been almost daily protests in Amman and other major cities regarding the country’s close relationship with Israel. There have also been specific cases where protestors have targeted government buildings, a recent example being a protest attempting to storm the Israeli embassy in March 2024. At the heart of these protests is the long-established Palestinian community. Palestinians make up over half of the Jordanian population, and feel frustrated that Jordan continues to cooperate with Israel politically and militarily. Particularly incendiary was Jordan’s participation in the Middle East Air Defence Alliance response to Iran’s strikes on Israel in April 2024. The Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, replied to accusations by explaining that the motivation was simply to defend Jordanian airspace, but many within Jordan continue to interpret the intervention as a stance in defence of Israel. In an era of unprecedented social media use, Jordanians are consistently confronted with harrowing images and videos from inside Gaza, further inflaming tensions. Antisemitism is also widespread in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As a pivotal UK ally in the region, Jordan and its stability should be of paramount concern for UK policymakers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence of an anti-Israeli sentiment in Jordan or the wider Middle East is hardly a novel phenomenon, and neither is Jordan relying on foreign aid to stave off economic collapse. However, the region’s fragmentation brings a set of novel and unique challenges to Jordan. One of these challenges is that Iran and its proxies are increasingly identifying Jordan as a potential vector for their shadow war with Israel and the West. Iran has excelled in its policy of establishing a network of dissident groups across the region, whether in Lebanon with Hezbollah, Iraq with Shiite Militia Groups, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen or Polisario in the Maghreb. Iran has continued this opportunistic support of groups in Jordan. Examples of this include weapons- and drugs-smuggling across the vast Iraqi and Syrian borders; hacking support targeting the Jordanian government; rhetorical support of dissident groups; and criticism of the monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an era of increased great power competition, Keir Starmer and his ministers have stressed at every opportunity that their focus and priority is European security. While the UK has clear economic and energy security dependencies on the Gulf, the same is not true of the Levant region. It is clear that there is very unlikely to be new funding from the UK in the region, and we can also rule out interventionism of the kind we saw under past Labour governments, as the US looks set to concentrate resources around China. The combination of a lack of resources and the fact that what limited resources are available are focused on Europe leaves UK policy on the region at an inflection point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;securing-jordan-actions-for-the-uk-and-international-partners&quot;&gt;Securing Jordan: Actions for the UK and International Partners&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan’s long-term economic weakness, coupled with an increasingly fragmented regional security landscape, poses an increasing threat to the only stable country in the Levant. As a pivotal UK ally in the region, Jordan and its stability should be of paramount concern for UK policymakers. A weak Levant region directly impacts the UK through migrationary pressures, the export of terrorism, and the disruption of key supply lines and international trade. So what can the UK and its allies do to mitigate Jordan’s instability and support Jordanians in their struggle for a better future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, ending the conflict in Gaza would significantly alleviate pressure on Jordan. David Lammy began his tenure as Foreign Secretary by correctly pointing out that the UK has limited influence in bringing this about, then visited Israel, and the OPT, and called for an immediate ceasefire. Realistically, the UK has very limited scope for unilaterally bringing about an immediate ceasefire, though Lammy may feel that calling for one will begin to tip the pressure dial in Washington. The UK government should instead concentrate on supporting the US in its negotiating efforts and ensuring that post-conflict initiatives include steps towards establishing a Palestinian state. Still, while the UK has limited prospects for singlehandedly bringing about an immediate ceasefire, it has enduring credibility that can be leveraged with future Israeli governments. UK officials should emphasise to future Israeli governments the dangers of allowing internal political struggles to lead to breaches of conventions regarding the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and settler activity in the West Bank. Additionally, the UK should maintain and expand its policy of identifying and sanctioning those involved in illegal settler activities in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the UK must persist in providing direct support to Jordan, particularly through government projects aimed at capacity building. Historically, UK spending in Jordan has largely been directed towards military training and democratisation. A shift in focus towards enhancing the capabilities of increasingly strained Jordanian government departments is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the UK should advocate for sustained regional and international support for Jordan. This includes ensuring the continued operation of multilateral aid agencies in Jordan, especially given the critical gaps left by the US withdrawal of support for UN organisations like UNRWA and UNESCO. If direct economic aid from the UK is not feasible, diplomatic efforts in the Gulf should prioritise generating and coordinating regional aid for Jordan. This could include bilateral aid packages as well as multilateral regional and international agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Jordan stands at a critical juncture amid regional turmoil, grappling with economic fragility exacerbated by external conflicts and internal dissent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the UK should engage in regional and international discussions on addressing Iran’s influence. Since the collapse of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal – there has been a lack of coherent strategy, contributing to tensions on the Israel–Lebanon border, the security vacuum in Yemen, and instability in Iraq. Acknowledging this issue is crucial for any UK efforts aimed at regional stability. The new government should prioritise convening and supporting regional initiatives, in collaboration with the US and European allies, to prevent Iran from perpetuating instability. Iran’s threat to regional peace and security must be taken seriously and acknowledged for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jordan stands at a critical juncture amid regional turmoil, grappling with economic fragility exacerbated by external conflicts and internal dissent. The country’s stability remains pivotal for the broader Levant region, making it imperative for the UK and its allies to take proactive measures. Addressing the conflict in Gaza, advocating for Palestinian statehood, and maintaining diplomatic pressure on Israel are immediate steps, but the UK government needs to delineate a coherent strategy. While Jordan currently outperforms its troubled neighbours, complacency will not ensure sustained stability unless proactive measures are taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，辯方昨日作中段陳詞，要求法庭就黎面對的3項控罪裁定表證不成立。3名國安法指定法官今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）宣布，裁定黎所面對的3項控罪表證成立，需要答辯。經30分鐘休庭，辯方指給予法律意見後，黎選擇親自作供，另擬傳召一名專家證人就社交軟件 Signal 作供。由於3名法官在8至10月均有其他案件要處理，未能立即聽取黎的證供。經商討後，最終押後至11月20日續審，屆時黎將出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3罪表證成立-黎智英選擇親自作供&quot;&gt;3罪表證成立 黎智英選擇親自作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首被告黎智英（76歲）由懲教人員押解往法院應訊。法官杜麗冰宣布，黎所面對的3項控罪均表證成立，需要答辯。辯方隨即申請休庭30分鐘以向黎索取法律指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再次開庭之後，辯方代表、資深大律師彭耀鴻指，已給予黎法律意見，而黎選擇在本案親自作供。另外，辯方擬傳召一名專家證人，就社交軟件 Signal 作供，預料證供內容圍繞技術層面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3法官均另有案件處理-控辯雙方商討後-押後至11月&quot;&gt;3法官均另有案件處理 控辯雙方商討後 押後至11月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，就時間而言，法官李運騰下周有個人事務，難以出席本案；另外，3名法官在8月有其他案件要審理，直至8月29日之前都未能處理本案。至於10月，法官杜麗冰表示有一宗高院案件需要續審，料需時3星期，而該案已經押後多時，不能再調動。法官李運騰則關注，黎已還柙一段時間，案件應盡快續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及黎智英的證供需時多久。辯方指，預計主問需時5日。法官李運騰聞言則指，本案涉及文章數量眾多，預料控方會以雙倍時間作盤問，因此主問連同盤問應該合共需時3至4星期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經休庭商討，控辯雙方最早可以出席續審的日子為今年11月20日，這樣黎作供可以一氣呵成，而毋須打斷。辯方表示，辯方案情需時約30個工作天。最終法官杜麗冰押後至11月20日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方中段陳詞黎網上節目提及制裁-不等於呼籲外國制裁&quot;&gt;辯方中段陳詞：黎網上節目提及制裁 不等於呼籲外國制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀發布煽動刊物罪，辯方的中段陳詞指，涉案報導和評論牽涉公眾利益，發布僅為了引起公眾關注，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且言論和新聞自由均受憲法保障。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀勾結外國勢力罪，辯方指黎在2020年7月起的網上對談節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」中，的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁；黎與嘉賓僅評論國際事務，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法前協議均為合法-國安法後便沒有達成新協議&quot;&gt;辯方：國安法前協議均為合法 國安法後便沒有達成新協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀」這一項控罪元素，辯方指在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他被告協議做的事，包括「一人一信救香港」、國際登報計劃等行為，均是合法；即使在《國安法》生效之後，上述行為變得不合法，但是黎與他人再沒有新的犯罪協議，因此不存在「串謀」。惟法官質疑，控方的說法是指稱黎在《國安法》生效之後，相關協議仍然繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given these contradictions, what are the ties that bind these two figures?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cement of the relationship between Venezuela and Iran is perhaps best described by the adage “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” Their shared priority is to ensure their respective regimes’ survival in the face of perceived threats, with the United States as the primary foe. Ayatollah Khomeini, the first leader of the Islamic republic, dubbed the United States the “Great Satan,” while Chávez referred to former U.S. president George W. Bush as “the devil.” This rhetoric and outlook matches that of Russia and other active rejecters of the U.S.-led international order; indeed, Russian president Vladimir Putin has spoken out against the “collective West” in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Western observers have focused their attention on joint connivances of Russia and Iran in Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East, where Russo-Iranian military-security operations directly affect U.S. and European interests, the Western Hemisphere is not isolated from the two countries’ quests for global influence. In fact, in many ways it is an essential piece of the puzzle. First, both Iran and Russia perceive Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) as a fertile ground for exploiting popular resentment vis-à-vis the United States and the “collective West,” which they — rather successfully — harness to advance their view of a multipolar world. Second, LAC partners could prove instrumental in offsetting the impacts of Western sanctions against Moscow and Tehran by mitigating their diplomatic and economic isolation. Finally, certain LAC countries could also serve as less scrutinized partners for further developing Russo-Iranian warfare capabilities or cooperation, sheltering mercenaries or militias — such as Hezbollah — and acting as vectors for “horizontal escalation” of conflicts in which Russia and Iran are currently involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Western observers have focused their attention on joint connivances of Russia and Iran in Eastern Europe, Eurasia, and the Middle East, where Russo-Iranian military-security operations directly affect U.S. and European interests, the Western Hemisphere is not isolated from the two countries’ quests for global influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines Russia’s and Iran’s creeping influence over the Western Hemisphere, assessing the historic legacy as well as the current diplomatic, economic, informational, and military-security links that contribute to the region’s continued willingness to engage with these two countries. It then offers analysis and recommendations to Western policymakers, outlining new approaches the transatlantic community should adopt to contain potential Russo-Iranian coordination in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anti-western-sentiments-as-historical-entry-points-for-russia-and-iran-in-lac&quot;&gt;Anti-Western Sentiments as Historical Entry Points for Russia and Iran in LAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a long history of engagement with LAC countries, dating back to the nineteenth century, when the Russian Empire opened embassies in Brazil and Mexico in 1828 and 1890, respectively. Moscow’s presence on the continent only grew under the Soviet Union, and especially during the Cold War era. The Soviet leadership focused on countries where it could capitalize on existing anti-U.S. sentiment and interstate and intrastate rivalries. For instance, the Kremlin provided extensive military-security and economic assistance to Argentina, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Peru to support revolutionary movements. By doing so, the Soviet Union aimed to undermine U.S. standing and strengthen its footprint on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly established Russian Federation was unable to provide financial or security aid to LAC countries and was forced to disengage. Furthermore, in the 1990s, as Russia sought rapprochement with the United States under President Boris Yeltsin, the strategic significance of LAC in the eyes of Moscow diminished. While Yeltsin visited the United States four times during his eight years of presidency, he did not make any trips to LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attempt to establish and maintain amicable relations with the United States did not mean, however, that the Russian political elite had fully disregarded the geopolitical importance of LAC countries. The Primakov doctrine — named for Yevgeny Primakov, a foreign minister and prime minister under Yeltsin — famously posited that, as the West was meddling and exerting influence in Russia’s “backyard” through NATO expansion and the imposition of the U.S.-dominated world order, Russia’s presence in its opponent’s “near abroad” was crucial to level the playing field. Consequently, as U.S.-Russian bilateral relations became more tense starting in the mid-2000s, Moscow began resuscitating diplomatic, economic, and security ties with its former Cold War allies Cuba and Nicaragua and built new relationships with other regional powers antagonistic toward the United States, such as Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Russia, albeit comparatively limited in scale, Iran’s entry into LAC was preceded by revolutionary regime change and the anti-U.S. sentiments it unleashed. In 1979, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a leftist insurgency spearheaded by Daniel Ortega, deposed the dictator Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua. That same year, the shah fled Iran, ushering in the modern Iranian theocratic state with Ayatollah Khomeini at its head. While the two movements had starkly different ideological origins, they shared a common opposition to the United States, rooted in Washington’s support for the regimes they had ousted. By the early 1980s, Nicaraguan and Iranian leaders were discussing cooperation and efforts to balance vis-à-vis both the United States and the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the close of the Cold War, Iran found its appeals to anti-U.S. sentiment losing saliency in the hemisphere as many of the militant leftist groups in the region laid down their arms or negotiated peace. In their place, Iranian proxy Hezbollah established a beachhead in the region. Its affiliate, Islamic Jihad, claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, while Hezbollah allegedly masterminded the devastating 1994 bombing of the Argentinian Israelite Mutual Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it was not until the mid-2000s and the height of LAC’s “pink tide,” which carried a series of socialist and otherwise U.S.-skeptical governments into power, that Iran’s engagement with the hemisphere took on a more robust, institutional character. The Chávez government in Venezuela was especially important in opening the door for Iran. In addition to their shared derision of the United States as a geopolitical demon, Chávez and former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad actively worked to cultivate like-minded LAC governments. Venezuela’s oil wealth and diplomatic clout gave it a powerful platform to advocate for an expanded role for Iran in the hemisphere, and between 2005 and 2009, Iran opened embassies in six new countries in the region: Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Uruguay. This policy has continued for the most part, especially as the Trump administration’s pursuit of a maximum-pressure sanctions campaign against both Venezuela and Iran caused these two governments to double down on their bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, as Russia and Iran continue to face mounting political and economic pressure from the United States and its Western allies, expanded ties to countries in LAC, rooted in history, can serve as an important release valve for both Moscow and Tehran. Strengthened relations, not only with staunch anti-U.S. governments like those in Cuba and Venezuela but also with regional powers such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, could help Russia and Iran mitigate the impact of sanctions and offer them much-needed legitimacy on the world stage. Regular visits by high-ranking Russian and Iranian officials to the region have proven a comparatively low-cost means of challenging Washington’s preeminence in LAC. While these visits often tend to focus on the hemisphere’s three consolidated dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — Russia and Iran continue to seek political, economic, and military-security relations with a broad array of LAC countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;converging-patterns-of-russian-and-iranian-engagement-in-lac&quot;&gt;Converging Patterns of Russian and Iranian Engagement in LAC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing consensus among policymakers in the United States acknowledges the Western Hemisphere as a new frontier in geopolitical competition, especially following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which has emboldened authoritarian regimes to more directly challenge the U.S.-led international order. However, most analyses of great power competition in the region have focused their attention on China as the U.S. rival with both the desire and resources at its disposal to challenge Washington in its neighborhood. By contrast, neither Russia nor Iran (commonly considered “junior partners” to China in the region) possess the economic heft to comprehensively engage all countries in LAC. Instead, both have relied on asymmetrical strategies to undermine U.S. objectives and support a small set of regional allies who serve as springboards for further influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a lack of economic clout may in fact make Russia and Iran more threatening actors in the short term. Unencumbered by China’s need to manage perceptions and diplomatic relations across more than two dozen countries, Russia and Iran can double down on disruptive and destabilizing practices. More troubling still, there is mounting evidence that, in some sectors at least, Russia and Iran may not merely be pursuing parallel strategies but could be moving toward a more coordinated approach to engagement with the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomatic-relations&quot;&gt;Diplomatic Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s post-invasion diplomatic approach to Latin America has been guided by its updated foreign policy concept, which posits an imminent decline of Western hegemony and the emergence of a multipolar world order. For instance, during his tour of the region in April 2023, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov emphasized Russia’s respect for the sovereignty of Latin American nations, referring to the region as one of the emergent centers of the multipolar world despite U.S. “bullying and imperialism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cnXstoy.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro meet at the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas in April 2023. Lavrov called for like-minded countries to “join forces” against Western sanctions “blackmail” as the longtime diplomat continued his tour of Latin America.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a majority of the region has voted in favor of UN resolutions decrying Russia’s war on Ukraine, Moscow has managed to secure sympathy and tacit support from regional powers. For instance, Brazil, under the presidency of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula), has repeatedly championed peace proposals for the Ukraine war, most recently with the release of a set of “common understandings” between Brazil and China on the contours of a possible settlement. However, Lula has faced criticism for his perceived bias toward Russia in these negotiations. Indeed, following a 2023 tour in which he claimed that both Kyiv and Moscow shared the blame for the conflict, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby accused the Brazilian president of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula is joined in the bid to forge peace in Ukraine by outgoing Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (colloquially known as AMLO), who put forth his own peace plan in the summer of 2022. AMLO, who has previously rejected U.S. intelligence claims that Mexico City is the world’s biggest Russian espionage hub, proposed a plan calling for an immediate ceasefire and the launch of a dialogue to address the war’s underlying causes. Ukrainian diplomats rejected this option as a de facto freezing of the front lines that would allow Russia to maintain its military presence in occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tellingly, neither Brazil nor Mexico signed on to the final communiqué issued at the June 2024 summit on peace in Ukraine. Regional dissonance over the correct path to a negotiated settlement in Ukraine helps muddy the waters on peace and indirectly allows Russia to undermine efforts to build a truly broad-based international coalition dedicated to a just settlement to the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Iran’s diplomatic approach toward Latin America is built on its claims to be “a nation unjustly harassed by the West,” which help it gain sympathy and secure political and economic support from the states that are either antagonistic or ambivalent at best toward the United States. For instance, in June 2023, when now-deceased Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi visited Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela for the first time since taking office, he highlighted the need for the revolutionary movements in both Iran and LAC to reassert their independence and sovereignty. “The Americans have always considered you, Latin America, as their backyard. But thank God, now you have sovereignty,” the Iranian president remarked. Raisi left the region having secured dozens of agreements with his LAC counterparts in the energy, agriculture, healthcare, education, information technology, and maritime transportation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, Iran has maintained close diplomatic relations with Bolivia. The two nations have signed defense and security agreements that might have included the delivery of Bolivian passports to Iranian citizens. As Argentina’s minister of security, Patricia Bullrich, pointed out, such an agreement, if confirmed, would open a door to Iranian citizens with Bolivian passports across the hemisphere — a strategy that Tehran has already used in Venezuela to infiltrate the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza has also severely damaged its relations with LAC, presenting another opportunity for Iran to make inroads in the region. Keystone countries including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico have condemned the Israeli government’s prosecution of the war. The broad support among LAC governments for the Palestinian cause is primarily driven by domestic political dynamics, not foreign influence. However, as the rift between Israel and the region grows, Tehran could seize on these new openings to advance its diplomatic rhetoric as the self-proclaimed leader of the “axis of resistance.” The recent election of a more reform-minded candidate, Masoud Pezeshkian, as the country’s new president is also unlikely to significantly change Tehran’s engagement with LAC as, in his own words, “[t]here is significantly more potential for cooperation between Iran and the countries of Latin America than what is currently being realized.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javier Milei’s Argentina is nevertheless a major outlier, being one of the most outspoken supporters of Israel and of Benyamin Netanyahu in particular, the first leader whom the Argentinian president visited after his election. Argentina was the sole LAC country to vote against the UN General Assembly’s motion to recognize Palestine as a full member of the body, and it has designated Hamas as a terrorist organization. This political dissonance with the rest of the continent is a source of tension, with Argentina’s security minister Patricia Bullrich accusing Bolivia and Chile of being hotbeds for Islamist groups and ordering reinforcements to the borders with these two countries, prompting them to pull their ambassadors from Buenos Aires. It also created a major spat between Argentina and Iran, with the latter’s integration into the BRICS in January 2024 having been a key factor in Milei’s decision to walk back his predecessor’s decision to join BRICS+. Following Buenos Aires’ designation of Hamas as a terrorist group, Tehran issued a stark warning that it “will make [Argentina] regret its enmity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s and Iran’s diplomatic engagement with LAC, especially following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has in large part been based on presenting the West as an oppressor, which LAC countries could counter by exercising their right to sovereignty and supporting the establishment of a new, multipolar world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;influence-operations&quot;&gt;Influence Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media environment in LAC presents the lowest barriers to entry and consequentially has been a sector where both Iran and Russia have made significant strides separately and, at times, in coordination. The Kremlin has been relying on the Spanish-language affiliates of state-backed outlets, such as RT Spanish (television and online) and Sputnik Mundo (radio and online), to spread Russian propaganda and disinformation on the continent for more than a decade. With Mexico often serving as a hub for Russian disinformation operations, these outlets overwhelmingly focus on the United States, questioning its domestic and foreign policies. According to U.S. intelligence reporting, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has used media contacts in 13 countries across the continent, including Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela, to weaken international support for Ukraine. RT, Sputnik, and their regional affiliates have disseminated conspiracy theories about “denazifying Ukraine,” alleged Ukrainian aggression against Russia, NATO expansionism, and “staged recording” of civilian deaths in Ukraine. They have also depicted ongoing sanctions against Russia as beneficial for the West but harmful for the global economy and food security. In December 2023, RT Spanish even won four prestigious awards from the Mexican Press Club for its coverage of the war in Ukraine, illustrating a stark disconnect in regional perceptions of Russian news sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The media environment in LAC presents the lowest barriers to entry and consequentially has been a sector where both Iran and Russia have made significant strides separately and, at times, in coordination.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian influence operations are not only concerned with shaping attitudes toward foreign policy. In Colombia and Mexico, Russia has reportedly sought to sway the results of key elections in favor of Moscow’s preferred candidates, through its official media platforms as well as through networks of trolls, bots, and regional pro-Kremlin affiliates. In Mexico, RT Spanish broadcast a long-running video series entitled “The Battle for Mexico,” which cast then-candidate López Obrador in a favorable light as the only leader willing to confront the United States and preserve Mexican sovereignty. In Colombia, Russia-linked bots on Twitter (now known as X) were found to have promoted Gustavo Petro’s candidacy in 2022. The extent to which such efforts swayed the final result should be treated with a degree of caution, as both Petro and López Obrador won due to a confluence of factors. Nevertheless, election interference efforts remain among Moscow’s most corrosive tools to undermine democracy and sovereignty worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s Spanish-language media agency HispanTV has made similar strides in the region. In doing so, it has benefitted from partnerships with fellow authoritarian-leaning media outlets, which help amplify and advance its messages. National security analysts Douglas Farah and Alexa Tavarez have demonstrated, for instance, how Venezuelan outlet teleSUR, RT, and HispanTV often cite and recite one another’s work and rely on similar sets of pro-authoritarian journalists based in the region to convey their messages. These so-called “super spreaders” advance common messages critiquing U.S. policy toward the region as imperialist and uplifting the approaches of Iran, Russia, and China as seeking to challenge malign U.S. hegemony while encouraging economic development among LAC countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convergence between Russian and Iranian influence operations could be observed less than a month before the onset of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On January 28, 2022, an article by Pablo Jofré Leal appeared in HispanTV calling for an “alliance against [U.S.] hegemony” to be spearheaded by Russia, China, and Iran. Leal, a Chilean journalist and frequent contributor to HispanTV, RT Spanish, teleSUR, and many affiliated websites, has acted as a key node for translating messages from Moscow and Tehran for a regional audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the traditional media space, organizations like Nova Resistência, a neofascist organization and part of the broader New Resistance organization inspired by the ideas of Kremlin-backed philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, have worked not only to advance pro-Russian messages but also to praise the actions of Iran and Hezbollah. A 2023 U.S. Department of State report found that the Brazilian Nova Resistência chapter was “particularly active” in convening events, writing articles, and disseminating physical pamphlets and posters advancing pro-Kremlin narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even absent formal coordination between Iran and Russia in the information space, their methods and objectives for fomenting anti-U.S. sentiment enjoy strong complementarity. As the cases of Pablo Jofré Leal and Nova Resistência also demonstrate, the audience for such messaging within LAC enjoys a high degree of overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-and-economics&quot;&gt;Energy and Economics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s economic clout in LAC is marginal, especially when compared to that of the United States and the European Union, which remain the key investors in the hemisphere, comprising 38 percent and 17 percent of Latin America’s foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in 2022, respectively. The major recipients of Russian FDI in the region include Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and these investments tend to focus on the extractive sectors, including minerals, oil, and gas. Bilateral trade between Russia and LAC countries stands at around $12 billion, with Russia mainly exporting fertilizers, mineral fuels, iron, and steel to the region (primarily to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s small economic footprint in LAC, the Kremlin has expressed strengthened interest in the region’s energy sector in recent years and, in certain cases, has even managed to challenge the Western companies operating on the ground. Brazil presents a noteworthy example in this regard, replacing Turkey as the largest purchaser of Russian diesel in October 2023. Overall in 2023, Brazil imported 6.1 million tons of diesel with a value of $4.5 billion from Russia — a 6,000 percent increase from the 101,000 tons of Russian diesel worth $95 million that it imported in 2022. Such a sharp rise in Russian diesel market share in Brazil, from virtually zero in 2022 to 50 percent in 2023 and 70 percent in 2024, has in large part resulted from its competitive pricing — one of the effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine. Highly reliant on cheap diesel to keep its economy moving, Brazil’s decision to pivot away from the United States in favor of Russia can further increase Moscow’s diplomatic and economic ties with Brasília, securing support from the largest country in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides Brazil, Cuba and Venezuela also represent interesting case studies for Russia’s renewed focus on making inroads into the Western Hemisphere’s energy sector. In March 2023, Igor Sechin, the head of Russia’s state oil company Rosneft, visited Havana and Caracas to discuss energy cooperation with the two countries. A year later, 90,000 metric tons of Russian oil arrived in Cuba to offer some relief to an island mired in power outages and gasoline shortages. Sanctioned by the United States, Cuba’s communist government has once again found itself beholden to the Kremlin, bringing additional revenue and economic and political opportunities to Russia. In the case of Venezuela, while Rosneft was pressured to cease its operations in Venezuela in 2020, Sechin’s visit amid the war in Ukraine and international sanctions imposed against Russia might imply and lead to renewed energy cooperation between the two countries. (In the past, Moscow relied on Rosneft to both expand the company’s portfolio and advance the country’s geopolitical interests vis-à-vis Caracas.) These intentions were reiterated during Lavrov’s visit to Venezuela in February 2024, with the Russian foreign minister promising to boost joint oil and gas production and foster “peaceful use of nuclear energy” in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, however, Moscow’s efforts have gone nowhere. In Argentina, Novatek — Russia’s largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) — reportedly offered the Argentinian government the technology to build an LNG plant, but talks between the two parties broke off without a deal. In Bolivia, Gazprom — a Russian state-owned oil and gas company that has been present in the country for more than a decade — has failed to drill and develop any natural gas or oil fields during this period, prompting criticism from local experts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has nevertheless made some advances in the clean energy and mining space, with state-owned firm Rosatom signing a $450 million deal in 2023 as part of a bid with China to develop Bolivia’s lithium reserves, estimated as the largest in the hemisphere. Overall, while Latin America’s energy sector is promising for Russia — especially following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has forced Russian companies to look elsewhere for energy deals and investments — it is still rife with risks, limitations, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Russia, Iran’s economic influence in the hemisphere has been limited and primarily focused on energy cooperation. In Venezuela, Iran’s presence has had an outsized impact on the ability of the government of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, to remain in power. Iran’s expertise navigating mass international pressure was invaluable for the Maduro regime to retain oil revenues in the face of U.S. sectoral sanctions on the energy sector after the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis. Venezuela shipped crude oil to Iran, Russia, and China in return for financial assistance and cheap gasoline to maintain fuel subsidies in a time of economic turmoil. Venezuela has also relied upon Iranian technical assistance, inking a deal with Tehran in 2022 to help repair Venezuela’s El Palito refinery to the tune of some €110 million (up to $120 million). Iranian technical support has been essential as Venezuela struggles to bring its hollowed-out oil sector back to life in anticipation of the lifting of sanctions. Tehran also significantly benefits from this arrangement, having leveraged its partnership with the Maduro regime to build and sell Iranian cars and reportedly acquire over a million hectares of farmland in Venezuela to support Iran’s agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases discussed above show that the energy sector could be another area ripe for cooperation between Iran, Russia, and their allies in the Western Hemisphere, especially Venezuela. While all three countries are ostensibly competitors in the global oil market, the layers of sanctions they face have engendered a peculiar form of covert camaraderie. Russian joint oil ventures with Venezuela produced an estimated 120,000 barrels per day in 2022, or more than one-sixth of the country’s total oil production. Venezuela, in turn, has relied heavily on Iranian tankers to launder its oil and deliver it to buyers — most often to China. Each country has therefore seemingly intuited that they have more to gain from attempting to subvert U.S.-led sanctions together than by forging their own path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This arrangement appears to have frayed in the months following the October 2023 Barbados Accords, when the United States began issuing licenses to companies to resume oil production in Venezuela. Now able to trade oil with U.S. firms for cash in hand rather than fuel, Venezuela’s trade with Iran plummeted from 2022 to 2023, leading to a diplomatic scramble by the two countries to restore their alliance. However, with the reimposition of U.S. oil sanctions on Venezuela in April 2024, energy cooperation between Venezuela, Iran, and Russia may be set to increase once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Military-Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s engagement with LAC countries has been guided by the aforementioned Primakov doctrine — the idea that Russia should engage with the “near abroad” of the United States in response to Washington’s meddling in internal affairs of the countries Moscow views as its “near abroad.” This is particularly true against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. For instance, in June 2022, Nicaraguan president Ortega authorized the entry of Russian troops, military ships, and aircraft into Nicaragua to assist with military training, law enforcement, and humanitarian aid. Russian state media has linked the Russian military deployment in the country to U.S. engagement with Ukraine, with one television host stating, “If American missile systems can nearly reach Moscow from Ukrainian territory, it is time for Russia to roll out something powerful closer to the American city upon a hill.” According to some estimates, up to 3,700 Russian troops have participated in different military trainings and exchanges with the Nicaraguan army between 2014 and 2024. Russia has also operated a Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) satellite ground station in Nicaragua since 2017 (Moscow also operates four other ground stations further south in Brazil). Located just outside of the capital, Managua, the facility has raised concerns that it could be used to intercept satellite communications close to the equator, where many of the U.S. critical assets are located in geostationary orbits. Finally, Moscow has helped train the Nicaraguan National Police, implicated in serious human rights abuses, from its U.S.-sanctioned counternarcotics center, also in Managua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2022, Nicaraguan president Ortega authorized the entry of Russian troops, military ships, and aircraft into Nicaragua to assist with military training, law enforcement, and humanitarian aid. Russian state media has linked the Russian military deployment in the country to U.S. engagement with Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another especially symbolic display, a contingent of Russian soldiers took part in Mexico’s Independence Day parade in 2023. Meanwhile, Russian military exercises in the Caribbean, which included port calls in Cuba and Venezuela, have been framed by some analysts as a direct response to the Biden administration’s decision allowing Ukraine to strike targets inside Russia with U.S. weapons systems. While the detachment posed little practical threat to U.S. national security, similar deployments may become more frequent as Russia looks to convey power and prestige on the world stage and continue to apply pressure to the United States within its neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k3fpDtQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A woman and a girl wave as frigate Admiral Gorshkov, part of the Russian naval detachment visiting Cuba, leaves Havana Harbor. The detachment visited Cuba in June 2024 amid major tensions over the war in Ukraine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to military deployments and joint training exercises with its partner countries, Russia has been supplying Latin America with arms. From 2000 to 2023, Russia was the number three supplier of weapons in the hemisphere, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), behind only the United States and United Kingdom in sales. However, since 2019, according to SIPRI data, Russia has not made any major sales in the region, and with the Russian defense industrial base geared primarily toward its own war effort, it seems unlikely that Moscow will be able to reenter the market in a meaningful way anytime soon. Still, Russian arms provide continued influence over Latin American states. Countries such as Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru, which operate stocks of Russian-supplied weapons, still rely on Moscow for maintenance and upkeep. Colombia, for instance, is struggling to maintain its fleet of Soviet-designed Mi-17 military helicopters, which the local authorities have said is the direct result of the war in Ukraine. The region has also rebuked efforts by U.S. and European leaders to sell their legacy Russian and Soviet arms to Ukraine, even with assurances of replacements. Ecuador came closest in February 2024, offering to sell $200 million worth of outmoded Russian and Soviet equipment to the United States (which could presumably pass this along to Ukraine), only to backpedal in the face of Russian economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While joint trainings, dual-use facilities, and the deployment of military assets have all featured prominently in Russia’s playbook in the region, these tactics have also increasingly become part of Iran’s tool kit for engagement in the Western Hemisphere. For instance, the drop in Russian arms sales has been accompanied by a spike in Iranian weapons to the hemisphere. This has been driven by one country, Venezuela, which in 2023 acquired at least six Peykaap-III fast attack boats, along with an estimated 25 anti-ship missiles. In April 2024, reports also surfaced that Venezuela’s National Bolivarian Armed Forces were developing a loitering munition dubbed the “Zamora V-1” based on Iranian Shahed 131/136 drones. These drones have been widely used by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, thus enabling Tehran to combat test, improve, and promote Iranian-made weapons and technology globally. Details at the time of this writing are scarce, but Venezuela has demonstrated a capability to replicate Iranian designs, with an undisclosed number of Mohajer drones having previously been produced under license in Venezuela. Cooperation on drone production and local upgrades to Iranian drone models have helped Venezuela build technical expertise and capacity within the country’s arms industry, helping state aerospace company EANSA to become a capable manufacturer of combat drones in its own right. The Maduro regime’s growing partnership with Tehran in the defense space is especially troubling in light of Venezuela’s escalating rhetoric toward its neighbor Guyana over the disputed Essequibo territory. Cruise missile–toting fast attack craft and loitering munitions could allow the regime to menace shipping and oil platforms off the coast of Guyana, mimicking the tactics of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea and imperiling Guyana’s burgeoning offshore oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond arms sales, Iran’s security cooperation with the hemisphere has been far less mature, often relying on non-state proxies. In 2022, for instance, a Venezuelan 747 cargo plane with both Venezuelan and Iranian nationals aboard was detained in Argentina over suspicions of conducting espionage and smuggling on behalf of Iran’s Quds Force, a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps sanctioned and designated as a terrorist entity by the United States. Iran’s 2023 naval world tour, which included stops in Brazil and transit through the Panama Canal, also illustrates how the rotation of military assets through LAC provides a means of asymmetric escalation against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;proxies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Proxies and Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow and Tehran are both proficient in the use of non-state proxies to advance their interests, and the Western Hemisphere is no exception to this. The Iranian-backed militia group Hezbollah embodies this dynamic. The group’s successes at orchestrating large-scale terror attacks in the 1990s continue to shape regional perceptions today. With a decades-long presence in the region, Hezbollah continues to operate in the so-called Triple Frontier region between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Hezbollah’s operations have shifted northward to Venezuela, where it has allegedly embedded itself in criminal networks to facilitate money laundering and illicit financial activity. Former Venezuelan vice president Tareck El Aissami reportedly served as the intermediary between the Maduro government and Hezbollah, helping launder money for the group through contacts in the Colombian company Importadora Silvania. Furthermore, during his tenure, El Aissami was said to have arranged for members of Hezbollah to train on Margarita Island with members of the colectivos, Venezuela’s pro-regime paramilitary, thus maintaining a level of distance from formal state-to-state relations. A string of other high-profile money laundering cases over the past 20 years, from Paraguay to Colombia, has led one analyst to remark that Hezbollah “has achieved what other large terrorist groups could not, entrenching itself within the complex web of TCOs [transnational criminal organizations] and substate actors in a region far removed from its founding territory and spiritual heartland.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC’s varied reactions to the war in Gaza will likely shift these dynamics in unpredictable ways. Brazil and Colombia have both taken steps to curtail their relations with Israel over its conduct of the war, with the latter going so far as to sever relations entirely. Both countries had long-standing security cooperation with Israel, including a joint operation between the Mossad and Brazilian police in November 2023 that resulted in the arrest of two alleged Hezbollah operatives planning a series of attacks. However, strained relations with Israel may complicate future cooperation and intelligence sharing on Hezbollah activities in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, by contrast, is a comparatively recent entrant in its use of armed proxy groups within LAC. Perhaps the most notable episode occurred in 2019 when, amid mass unrest and fears of a potential coup against Maduro, some 400 Russian mercenaries, allegedly from the Wagner Group, arrived in Caracas to provide security for the embattled president. Similar to Wagner’s activities on the African continent, the private military contractors reportedly remain active, training the Venezuelan armed forces and protecting mining operations in the country’s Orinoco region. In May 2023, leaked U.S. national security documents showed that Wagner may have attempted to reprise this role, this time leading a scouting visit to Haiti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As LAC continues to grapple with resurgent transnational criminal organizations, there may be opportunities for Russia or even Iran to provide further security assistance. China has already exploited a perceived gap in U.S. security sector support to stand up at least 11 private security firms in the region. Meanwhile, Russia has proven adept at leveraging security challenges in Africa to expand its influence and fill its coffers. Russian private military contractors like the Wagner Group and its successor, the Africa Corps, are by now infamous for their ruthless counterinsurgency deployments in the Central African Republic, Mali, and Sudan. As electorates throughout the Western Hemisphere call for forceful action to be taken in the face of worsening criminal violence, the “brutal but effective” methods employed by authoritarian proxies may take on heightened appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and Iran are selective in their engagement with countries in LAC. While they cultivate close ties with the hemisphere’s three anti-U.S. dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — they simultaneously work to gain ground in more neutral or U.S.-skeptical countries, such as Brazil and Mexico. Furthermore, as this paper has argued, Moscow and Tehran do not act in isolation from one another and are in fact increasingly pursuing convergent and coordinated goals in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia and Iran are selective in their engagement with countries in LAC. While they cultivate close ties with the hemisphere’s three anti-U.S. dictatorships — Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — they simultaneously work to gain ground in more neutral or U.S.-skeptical countries.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should strive to do the same in its response by partnering with like-minded allies both within LAC and across the Atlantic. In doing so, Washington should seek to strengthen its relationships with friendly nations, disrupt the ability of its foes to coordinate, and devise a resource-backed counteroffer for those countries within LAC that currently prefer to sit on the fence between the United States, Iran, and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen partnerships with friends.&lt;/strong&gt; Building partner capabilities in the media and cybersecurity space are essential elements to helping counties in LAC better insulate themselves from malign influence operations. These sectors present the lowest barriers to entry and are the areas where Russia and Iran are most clearly coordinating. To counter Moscow’s and Tehran’s inroads in the media space, the United States should look to expand scholarship programs for journalists based in LAC to help cultivate a new generation of reporters. By investing in young reporters from a diversity of backgrounds, the United States can help shape a media environment that is more discerning, critical, and capable of counteracting authoritarian political narratives organically.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;LAC’s cyber defenses face a shortage of resources and strategy across the board. However, there are promising signs that like-minded countries are beginning to take concrete steps to shore up these vulnerabilities. Costa Rica may be an especially key ally: it was the only LAC country to sign on to U.S. sanctions against Russia in 2022, and it was the victim of a devastating ransomware attack by the Russia-affiliated Conti hacker collective. U.S. Southern Command has already allocated nearly $10 million to assist Costa Rica in building up its cybersecurity capabilities. Broadening these efforts to bring in additional interested parties by establishing a cybersecurity center of excellence within the hemisphere, among other measures, could help elevate the conversation and further insulate allies from malign interference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disrupt and deter coordination among authoritarian adversaries.&lt;/strong&gt; It has become increasingly evident that dictatorial regimes across the world pursue a common “playbook” to stifle domestic opposition and resist international pressure. Countering this requires the democratic powers of the world to devise and articulate their own playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Curbing illicit financial flows is one especially important effort in the Western Hemisphere, as governments like Venezuela and Nicaragua rely on their international connections to keep their hands on the reins of power. A new investigation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control into the universe of trade ties from Russia and Iran in LAC could provide novel insights and help better calibrate sanctions efforts against these regimes as well as the hemisphere’s dictatorships.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should also pay close attention to military-technical cooperation between autocratic regimes. Chinese, Iranian, and Russian arms have all been used as part of Venezuela’s effort to intimidate and coerce Guyana, while Venezuela’s interest in coproducing loitering munitions with Iran would provide Caracas with a worrying new capability if carried to fruition. Limiting the extent to which hemispheric adversaries can benefit from this cooperation will be crucial to managing interstate tensions and escalation dynamics in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Articulate a counteroffer for fence-sitters.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, for its part, should continue to emphasize and draw attention to Russian war crimes and abuses in Ukraine. But messaging will not be enough on its own, and a more fulsome, resource-backed effort is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While Russia and Iran lack the economic dynamism of China, they remain capable of applying significant pressure to regional governments unprepared for it. The case of Ecuador’s about-face on delivering arms to Ukraine following Russian sanctions on its banana industry is particularly illustrative. Russia also remains a key supplier of fertilizer to Brazil’s all-important agricultural sector. The United States, in partnership with the European Union, should look to map potential vectors for Russian and Iranian economic pressure and seek to strengthen U.S. and EU cooperation to minimize these.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States should also seek to compete more effectively in the energy and minerals sectors. Like its engagement on the African continent, Russia has used targeted overtures in nuclear power and conventional fuel sales to expand its leverage even as a web of international sanctions encircles Moscow. Bolivia and Brazil, for instance, have both cooperated with Russia on nuclear power projects in the past two years. Meeting regional demand for power and clean energy investment will be crucial to weakening this hold, and in doing so will clearly demonstrate that the United States and its allies can deliver on the economic front for their partners in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Because the perception of the United States can sometimes be negative across the continent, Washington could also benefit from cooperating with other non-LAC like-minded partners that do not face similar levels of public wariness. Chief among them is the European Union, which is showing increasing interest in the region, as displayed during the Spanish presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2023 (despite the irritant of stalled free-trade agreement negotiations between the European Union and Mercosur — the trade bloc consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay). This could also be the case with some of the closest U.S. Indo-Pacific partners who have a history or expressed interest in closer ties with the continent, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Although all these countries are trade competitors, they share similar strategic objectives, and while their focus has been on the threats and challenges posed by China, Iran, and Russia in Eurasia, they should consider LAC a full-fledged — not marginal — theater of strategic competition. They should harness their respective competitive advantages to build offers catering to LAC’s most urgent needs in terms of infrastructure, energy, security, and defense, as well as in the informational space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

It also highlights the serious challenges Washington and Taipei must address to have a ready response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 18, 1931, a Japanese infantry regiment conducted a “false flag” attack on the Japanese-owned South Manchuria Railway, detonating an explosive near a stretch of the track and blaming the operation on Chinese troops nearby. The next day, in response to the alleged sabotage, Japanese troops attacked a Chinese military garrison. Within months, the Japanese army had conquered Manchuria and made it a puppet state. Although a commission formed by the League of Nations eventually unraveled the deception and concluded that Japan had illegally invaded China, the international community took no meaningful action, in part because the active period of crisis had settled into a new normal and political will had evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 80 years later, in February 2014, soldiers wearing uniforms without insignias or other identifying information surrounded Ukrainian military bases and seized strategic points in Crimea. Although many observers immediately suspected that these “little green men” were Russian troops, Moscow claimed that they were “local self-defense units” acting on their own initiative. The Ukrainian government quickly lost control of Crimea, which was formally annexed to Russia. Meanwhile, Russian special operations forces began quasi-surreptitiously supporting separatist uprisings in Eastern Ukraine, an operation that eventually led to the full-scale Russo-Ukrainian war that is still underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States and its allies are focused on the threat of an even bigger war: a possible Chinese assault on Taiwan and the cataclysmic, world-changing conflict it could provoke. But in contemplating Chinese moves against Taiwan, it is worth keeping these earlier incidents in mind because they highlight an important if underappreciated fact: great powers pursuing revisionist aims often seek to disguise their actions, create a cloud of uncertainty around them, or achieve gains through a sequence of “salami slices” in order to increase the odds of a successful fait accompli that will decrease the costs they must pay for their aggression. As Washington ponders China’s next steps vis-à-vis Taiwan, it is vital to understand how Beijing might utilize subterfuge, “salami slicing” tactics, and wedge-driving strategies to isolate Taiwan and ultimately compel “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper does not take the position that China has abandoned or will abandon the possibility of a more dramatic, full-on invasion of Taiwan, should Chinese leader Xi Jinping conclude that the road to “peaceful” annexation is closed (although the two authors of this report do differ in their views on how likely this scenario is). The potential for an outright invasion is real, and the consequences of such a gambit would be dire. A Sino-American war over Taiwan would be a global catastrophe, and it is imperative for Washington and its allies to do all they can to deter such an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet China has more than one way of coercing Taiwan into political capitulation. Indeed, the more successful Washington and its friends are in deterring the “D-Day” scenario, the more Beijing may be incentivized to focus on lower-intensity, or less obvious, forms of aggression instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper puts aside the prospect of an invasion or direct blockade and instead discusses four coercive approaches that Beijing could use to change the status quo: (1) a decapitation strike meant to exploit uncertainty in Taipei’s continuity of government arrangements; (2) a quasi-disguised maritime quarantine; (3) the taking, perhaps through ambiguous means, of one of Taiwan’s outlying islands; and (4) the staging of a catalytic incident in the Taiwan Strait. Each of these approaches would feature some degree of ambiguity and deception. Each would also target key vulnerabilities in Taiwan and in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, not the least of which include Taiwanese political will and Taiwanese confidence in the availability of U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that China will conduct any of these operations — each of which could fail and each of which would entail significant risks for Beijing. Nor is the argument here that a conflict with China over Taiwan is preordained. In the authors’ judgment, China would only dramatically increase its coercion of Taiwan — whether disguised or overt — if it believed it had a decent chance of success and it had run out of other, less violent options for shifting the status quo. Yet it is entirely possible that Beijing could arrive at this juncture sometime in the coming years. As is on display in Ukraine, dictators make decisions that often conflict with rationality. Thus, it is crucial to understand that the parameters of possible Chinese action vis-à-vis Taiwan are more expansive than is commonly understood, if only so that the United States and its allies can forge a comprehensive response. A complete deterrence strategy must keep Beijing from salami-slicing its way to victory in the Taiwan Strait, even as the United States also races to deter a deadly high-end fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A complete deterrence strategy must keep Beijing from salami-slicing its way to victory in the Taiwan Strait, even as the United States also races to deter a deadly high-end fight.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assumptions&quot;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis rests on several assumptions about Chinese preferences and behavior:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, China wants to annex Taiwan or otherwise bring about its political capitulation to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This has been a consistent desire of Beijing’s since 1949. Although there is a lively debate about Xi’s sense of urgency in achieving this goal, there is no doubt that he — like generations of Chinese leaders before him — seeks to bring Taiwan to heel, or that China is developing the tools, from hard military power to disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks, to do so. The fact that China is actively seeking multiple ways of achieving its long-held goal of annexation or forced capitulation means that the United States, its allies, and most importantly Taiwan itself should be contemplating all potential angles of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Second, Xi or any future Chinese leader would prefer to take Taiwan with minimal international blowback. That blowback could include immediate repercussions such as economic sanctions or war with the United States; it could also include longer-term costs, such as a region that rallies against Beijing after Taiwan falls. The more dramatic the action China takes against Taiwan, the stronger the regional and global reaction might be. Beijing’s grand strategy encompasses goals beyond taking Taiwan, and so it will seek to balance its global aspirations with the important objective of achieving “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third, and related, Beijing would prefer to take Taiwan in ways that make it harder for the United States to intervene effectively and rally regional and global support if it does get involved. This puts a premium on pursuing annexation in ways that mask Beijing’s intentions, or at the very least sow doubt about what is happening and who is at fault. Over the past 15 years, for instance, China has often blamed the Philippines or Japan for escalating tensions in the South and East China Seas — and then used the resulting crises to strengthen its presence around key hot spots. More recently, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) launched joint military exercises in the waters and airspace around Taiwan in response to a “provocative” inauguration speech by Taiwanese president William Lai. Decisions to use military force are ultimately political choices, and the more China can move in ways that complicate the politics and geopolitics of a U.S. response, the bigger the head start it will have toward achieving a fait accompli.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fourth, Beijing would ideally like to avoid the most vexing governance and security challenges that could occur after a direct, full-bore assault. Put differently, Beijing would prefer to rule a Taiwan that is not ruined, physically and economically, by conflict or roiled by a raging insurgency. Coercing Taipei to accept a political settlement, even an unpopular one, minimizes the governance and security challenges in comparison to a post-invasion scenario. Assuming that Beijing cannot find a (coerced) political path forward, it may still prefer to use tools other than the PLA — such as the People’s Armed Police, the Chinese Coast Guard, or the intelligence services — to precipitate a change in the status quo. Of course, the realities of pursuing an annexation strategy may complicate Beijing’s desires; nonetheless, from a planning perspective, the cleaner and less violent the path to “reunification,” the easier the security and governance challenges that follow annexation will become.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fifth, China does not necessarily have to pursue annexation in a single bite. It could try, instead, to coerce Taipei into formal political negotiations that would have unification as the eventual endpoint, on the assumption that those negotiations would be consummated after Taiwanese resolve and U.S. credibility are shattered. Again, recent experience is instructive: Beijing’s periodic assertiveness around Scarborough Reef and Second Thomas Shoal in the South China Sea is driven, in part, by the desire to put pressure on the U.S.-Philippines alliance by demonstrating that Washington can do little to help Manila uphold its economic rights and territorial claims in scenarios short of all-out war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these assumptions in mind, some might look to Hong Kong’s recent experience as the model for Beijing’s preferred Taiwan strategy. Yet this analogy is both instructive and misleading. It is instructive in the sense that Beijing eventually achieved a decisive outcome — a significant blow to Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” arrangement — but it did so through measures meant to minimize collateral damage to the city’s position as a global financial hub. China did not, for instance, send the PLA into the city’s streets — a step that likely would have provoked greater global blowback. Instead, it used local police forces to quell the demonstrations and then — utilizing bureaucratic and legal channels — pushed through a draconian national security law that dealt the critical strike to Hong Kong’s autonomy. Because Beijing used lawfare to achieve its aims, it was politically and diplomatically challenging for the United States, the United Kingdom, and other stakeholders to do much beyond symbolic sanctions. The Chinese leadership calculated that this combination of measures would achieve their desired result — breaking the back of independent politics — with minimal geopolitical cost. Rather than demonstrating Xi’s unbridled appetite for risk, the Hong Kong example demonstrates his preference for lawfare and salami-slicing as a means to fundamentally alter the strategic landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Hong Kong analogy also has limitations, the most important of which is that the city had been Chinese de jure territory for more than 20 years by the time the culminating actions came. This gave Beijing legal channels through which to constrict Hong Kong’s political liberties. It also meant that China could use non-military forces, such as the police, to suppress the popular response. Such options would not be available to China in a Taiwan scenario, so Beijing would need alternative ways of generating the leverage necessary to achieve a decisive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, just because Beijing might want to take Taiwan through actions short of invasion does not mean it can do so. It is possible that increased, but not immediately decisive, coercion of Taiwan could actually encourage a stronger U.S. commitment to the island or incentivize Taiwan to take stronger measures to defend itself. It should be remembered that Mao Zedong’s shelling of Taiwan’s offshore islands in 1954 encouraged President Dwight D. Eisenhower to push through a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. Something similar has happened in recent years, as the PLA’s provocative military exercises have led to increased U.S. arms sales and more explicit promises of U.S. support by President Biden. Indeed, options beneath the threshold of outright war all suffer from this potential liability, which is why the notion that Chinese leaders might opt for dramatic, decisive military action meant to solve the Taiwan problem once and for all cannot be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the extreme risks and potentially disastrous costs of invasion also must weigh heavily on Beijing’s calculus, which is why options short of invasion must be considered, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-1-decapitation-strike&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Decapitation Strike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 19, 2004, President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu were traveling in an open-top Jeep in the southwest city of Tainan for a campaign stop when two bullets tore through their vehicle, injuring both Chen and Lu. The pair won reelection the following day, but before the authorities could complete their investigation into the assassination attempt, two of the suspected gunmen died under mysterious circumstances. Although some, including Vice President Lu, blamed the PRC for the attack, no conclusive evidence was found to support this assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, an assailant carrying a stolen Japanese sword attacked a military police officer outside of the Presidential Office Building. According to police reports, the man, surnamed Lu, had a PRC flag in his possession at the time of the attack. More recently, a member of the Presidential Office’s Department of Security Affairs and an officer from the National Security Bureau’s Special Service Center were convicted of leaking information to Chinese intelligence about then-president Tsai Ing-wen’s itinerary. According to media reporting, the intelligence included a “hand-drawn organizational chart of the Special Service Center,” as well as “the names, titles and work phone numbers of senior security officers guarding the Presidential Office and Tsai’s residence in the heart of Taipei.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These incidents highlight two underappreciated risks to Taiwan’s political resiliency: there is insufficient security around Taiwan’s elected leadership, and perhaps more worryingly, there is insufficient legal clarity on the line of succession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Taiwan reportedly has an internal plan for leadership transition, Article 49 of its constitution merely stipulates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In case the office of the President should become vacant, the Vice President shall succeed until the expiration of the original presidential term. In case the office of both the President and the Vice President should become vacant, the President of the Executive Yuan shall act for the President; and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of this Constitution, an extraordinary session of the National Assembly shall be convoked for the election of a new President and a new Vice President, who shall hold office until the completion of the term left unfinished by the preceding President.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This language raises several worrying questions: What is the timeline for the convocation of the National Assembly? Hours? Days? Months? Article 30 stipulates that the president of the Legislative Yuan (LY) “shall issue the notice of convocation,” but it does not clarify under what timeline and what occurs should the president of the LY fail to issue the notice in a timely manner. Furthermore, what happens if all three individuals listed are incapacitated or killed? How can the National Assembly be convoked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing may consider exploiting these vulnerabilities to create a sharp constitutional crisis, and it could use the resulting chaos to alter Taiwan’s political orientation. It might do so if years of accumulating political trends in Taiwan — such as continued Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) dominance of the presidency — convince Chinese officials that inaction would be the greater risk. Alternatively, Beijing might act if it believes that a dramatic change in cross-Strait dynamics — such as a formal declaration of de jure independence or the reestablishment of the U.S.-Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty — was highly likely to occur. In other words, an assassination attempt on Taiwan’s political leadership would be intended to serve as a substitute for a full-on invasion, carried out in a way that is designed to create confusion for the Taiwanese people and the United States. And it would not come out of the blue; it would instead follow a progression of political and diplomatic developments that Beijing considered to pose a near-existential risk to its cross-Strait strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in 2004, Beijing would be the early and obvious target of recrimination, but the key question is how or if Taiwan and the United States would be able to formulate an effective response. In the absence of clear proof, accusations would remain just that. And as was the case in Crimea in 2014, or Manchuria in 1931, even after the truth becomes apparent, the window of opportunity to take effective action might well have closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might this scenario play out? A successful attack on Taiwan’s president and vice president, perhaps during a presidential inauguration or during the president’s annual National Day address on October 10, would immediately throw the island into turmoil. If the president of the LY were unharmed, this individual would bear enormous responsibility for bringing political order to a badly shaken nation. Such an effort would be difficult even in the most mature of democracies. In this early chaos, Beijing would have ample opportunities to stoke fear and uncertainty through disinformation and covert political meddling. If the LY president were killed, Taiwan would face an even graver crisis due to the acute leadership vacuum. Even if Taiwan had an internal line of succession, the absence of a publicly and constitutionally recognized process for transferring political power would call into question how legitimate that transfer is in the eyes of a shell-shocked public. Turning again to current events, the current fractious nature of Taiwan’s legislative politics, owing to an extraordinarily divisive partisan political environment, should put a damper on how likely the prospect of the three main political parties “coming together” is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might Beijing take advantage of the ensuing chaos? There is the prospect of Beijing unilaterally sending “security assistance” to help stabilize the situation, but even as Taiwan’s people reel, this might be seen as too direct an effort. A more realistic path is for pro-Beijing voices in Taiwan’s political system to seek to utilize the confusion and constitutional crisis to seize political power or otherwise open up space for a dramatically transformed political leadership on Taiwan. Success would not be guaranteed, of course, and Beijing would only consider such a move if it saw the cross-Strait situation as dire and felt the need to take drastic steps to reorient the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, this type of brazen attack would be a huge gamble. Any assassination attempt may fail, exposing Beijing’s complicity in the process. Even if the attack were successful, there is no guarantee that a post-decapitation strike plan would be carried out with any precision. Moreover, if Beijing intended to send “security assistance” to Taiwan following an assassination, it would presumably have to build up its forces opposite the island beforehand, which might give the game away. And any attack on Taiwan’s leadership would likely be seen by many in Taiwan and the international community as obvious Chinese aggression, calling forth a punitive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s bet, in other words, would have to be that this option nonetheless carries less risk than either allowing Taiwan to drift further away from the mainland or taking more overt military action to change its trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-2-quarantine&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Quarantine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, making her the first speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives to do so in a quarter-century. Beijing responded with military exercises meant to show off the PLA’s improving capabilities to conduct a blockade, bombardment, or invasion of Taiwan. Chinese missiles overflew Taiwan (albeit through outer space) and splashed down in its surrounding waters — a clear demonstration of Beijing’s ability to choke off vital sea lanes. In May, just after the inauguration speech of President William Lai, Beijing again launched massive military exercises encircling Taiwan, including “comprehensive law enforcement operations” by the Chinese Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent exercises highlight an option available to Beijing short of invasion and formal blockade: a quarantine meant to probe Washington’s risk tolerance and potentially strain its relationship with Taipei while sending a clear signal to the people on Taiwan that they are isolated. As a recent CSIS report on the prospect of a PRC quarantine of Taiwan concluded, “The purpose of a quarantine is not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to assert China’s control over Taiwan by setting the terms for traffic in and out of the island.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing might seize on any variety of potential pretexts: a “provocative” statement or policy departure from Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te; a trip to the island by another high-ranking U.S. official; or a U.S. arms sale that, from Beijing’s perspective, threatens the status quo in the strait. A quarantine would be meant to mimic the effects of a more traditional naval blockade, without necessarily emulating its forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Beijing could announce that the Chinese Coast Guard, rather than the PLA Navy, would conduct customs inspections of shipping headed to and from Taiwan. It could further disrupt maritime traffic into Taiwan by conducting missile tests that terminate in frequently used shipping lanes in the international waters off the island’s major ports. Related, the PLA could announce a series of air and sea exercises in international waters off of Taiwan’s major western ports with no indication of duration, disrupting maritime trade under the pretext of “normal” military training. China could also ratchet up the pressure by having the PLA Air Force “escort” traffic into Taiwan’s air space, as some observers feared it might do at the time of Speaker Pelosi’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China certainly has the capabilities for any of these scenarios. Its coast guard is the world’s largest; it features significant surface combatants and is, in essence, a second Chinese navy. Beijing also boasts the world’s largest conventional missile force, with a deep magazine of short-range missiles that can target the waters around Taiwan. Its inventory of fighter aircraft dwarfs Taiwan’s and whatever contingent the United States has available in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What might make this option even more attractive is the dilemmas it would create for the United States, its regional allies, and Taiwan. Of the 193 UN member states, only 11 (plus the Holy See) diplomatically recognize Taiwan. So even though Washington and its allies would strenuously object to Chinese actions, a customs quarantine would be a less clear-cut act of international aggression than an invasion or even a conventional naval blockade of a fully sovereign state. By relying primarily on the Chinese Coast Guard and shore-based assets, this option would also reduce the danger of high-seas encounters between war-fighting navies (at the outset, at least). Similarly, this approach offers China the ability to achieve some effects of a blockade without crossing into what Taiwan deems as its territorial waters; missiles splashing down just outside of that limit could scare off shipping or at least drive insurance rates skyward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The soft quarantine would thus highlight, in a very public way, Taiwan’s inherent vulnerability as an island nation dependent on imports of food, energy, and other vital resources.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft quarantine would thus highlight, in a very public way, Taiwan’s inherent vulnerability as an island nation dependent on imports of food, energy, and other vital resources. Even if a quarantine were only enforced selectively or intermittently, it would remind Taiwan of the economic noose Beijing can cinch tight around its neck. The United States and other friendly countries might try to defeat the quarantine by organizing a relief expedition and escorting planes and ships into Taiwan. But Washington might struggle to do so indefinitely, especially if this crisis happened when U.S. naval assets were already stretched thin by other commitments — for example, threats to freedom of navigation in the narrow waterways around the Arabian Peninsula. Indeed, the true goal of this strategy might be to expose the limits of U.S. support of Taiwan — and thereby soften the island up for further pressures meant, eventually, to cause its capitulation. There is also the possibility that the voices calling for “restraint” in the United States and other Western capitals would win out, after debate on whether Washington really wants to risk a conflict with China over some ships being boarded in waters thousands of miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not to say this approach is risk-free for Beijing. A limited quarantine would still be seen as aggression by Washington, Tokyo, Canberra, Manilla, and Seoul, to say nothing of Taipei, and so while it may “succeed” in the short term, it might also strengthen international support for Taipei, just as Beijing’s firing of rockets into Japan’s exclusive economic zone in August 2022 helped galvanize a more assertive Japanese approach vis-à-vis China. This approach could still turn into a high-stakes game of chicken, if U.S. warships and aircraft escort relief shipments into Taiwan and dare Beijing to get in the way. If China does not blink, in that scenario, it could have a war on its hands; if it falters, that could undermine the credibility of its coercive threats. Moreover, blockades and quarantines have a poor record of convincing countries to give up their independence; just as often, the suffering they cause strengthens, at least for a time, the will to resist. But a quarantine might still appeal to Xi, not least because it would also force the United States to decide if it wants to escalate to a full-blown crisis — and to sustain Taiwan indefinitely — in a situation where the PLA has not yet fired a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-3-offshore-island-seizure&quot;&gt;Scenario 3: Offshore Island Seizure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of Taiwan’s outer islands already live in the shadow of U.S. ambiguity, as the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act — which directs the president and congress to consider “appropriate action” in response to “threats to the security or the social or economic system of the people of Taiwan” — covers only “the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores [‘Penghu’].” This means that one of the only legally binding commitments the United States has to Taiwan does not extend to its outlying islands — Pratas, Kinmen, Itu Aba, the Wuchiu Islands, and Matsu. As a result, these islands are potential targets for a Chinese takeover, not necessarily as a stepping stone for a full invasion of Taiwan, but as a way of probing U.S. and Taiwanese risk appetite and exposing the limits of American commitment and credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculus has been demonstrated to exist in modern U.S.-China relations. During the two Taiwan Strait crises of the 1950s (1954 and 1958), Mao Zedong repeatedly used the shelling of Taiwan’s offshore islands as a way to probe the United States and test its relationship with Taipei. As Mao stated in August 1958 meeting of the Politburo, “although we have fired dozens of thousands or rounds on Jinmen [Kinmen], we only mean to probe [America’s intention].” He added, “we need to see if the Americans want to carry these islands on their back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An appealing target might be Pratas Island, which is sparsely populated with only a small contingent of Taiwanese coast guard and military personnel. The island is of little inherent strategic value to Taiwan, and its seizure might not provoke any substantial military response from either Taiwan or the United States, assuming casualties are low to zero. At a minimum, the takeover of the island would force the United States to confront the dilemma of whether it wants to risk major war with China over a small island of just 430 total acres that sits in the middle of the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Beijing has multiple options for taking Pratas Island. It could announce military exercises in the waters and airspace surrounding the island that would have the functional effect of cutting Pratas off from its regular shipments of water, food, and other supplies from Taiwan’s main island. Beijing might then signal through lower-tier diplomatic channels that Taiwan can rotate existing military and coast guard off the island, but it cannot bring new troops and coast guard on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a more confrontational — and riskier — approach would be simply to directly overpower the tiny contingent of coast guard and marines stationed on the island. This would, of course, invite condemnation from Taipei, Washington, Tokyo, Manila, and other capitals that would see such a move as naked aggression. But it is not at all clear that any of these countries, including the United States, would be able and willing to muster a proportionate punitive response. For the United States, the challenge would be explaining to the American people why a tiny island nearly 300 miles from Taiwan, and which is not covered by the Taiwan Relations Act, is worth a possible conflict with China, the world’s second-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any of these scenarios, geography would severely constrain the response from Taipei and Washington, who would have to decide whether to tolerate the loss of a small, geopolitically insignificant chunk of Taiwan’s territory or risk a much bigger fight just a few miles from China’s shores. As Lancaster University’s Andrew Chubb has written, an outer island seizure “would offer Beijing greater flexibility and escalation control, lower risk of civilian casualties, and less likelihood of sparking a strong Taiwanese response or U.S. intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common objection to such scenarios holds that the capture of an outer island yields China little to no strategic benefit if the goal is the full annexation of Taiwan, as it would still need to attempt a direct attack on the main island of Taiwan, which would presumably be on high alert. Further, even if the PLA were to cleanly seize Pratas, it would simply confirm the fears of many countries in the region — its initial gain of Taiwan territory would have come at the expense of “tripping the alarm” and therefore galvanizing action in Tokyo, Manilla, and Canberra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But such objections are premised on the idea that Beijing’s immediate goal in undertaking such actions would be “reunification.” A more plausible objective for Beijing would be to cut a slice of salami that the United States and Taiwan will not be willing or able to defend. Here, the main goal would be a clear provocation that is met with an underwhelming response, for it would publicly demonstrate that Washington’s bark is worse than its bite when it comes to defending Taiwan. This strategy could thereby erode Taiwan’s confidence in U.S. support — to say nothing of its confidence in its ability to protect itself — while also provoking anxiety in U.S. allies and partners over Washington’s inability to credibly defend against incremental Chinese aggression. And at the point that Beijing is willing to undertake such a gambit, it may already be pricing in the erosion of its remaining goodwill in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenario-4-false-flag&quot;&gt;Scenario 4: False Flag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final scenario involves a false flag operation — akin to what Japan perpetrated in Manchuria in 1931 — meant to justify subsequent military action against Taiwan. The current situation offers plenty of possibilities. Chinese aircraft regularly fly across the center line of the strait or into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, where they are tracked by Taiwanese air defenses or intercepted by Taiwanese fighters. Run-ins between Taiwan’s coast guard and Chinese civilian vessels have occasionally turned deadly. Chinese drones overfly Taiwanese territory; Chinese forces intercept — and dangerously crowd — planes and ships belonging to Taiwan’s friends. The air and waters of the Western Pacific are becoming crowded, dangerous, and primed for some catalytic incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China could concoct a Taiwanese “provocation” — a collision between Taiwanese and Chinese ships or aircraft, or perhaps even an alleged Taiwanese attack on Chinese forces operating in or around the strait. It could then use full-throated propaganda and disinformation to pin the blame on Taipei and exploit the incident to obliterate the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One option would be to use the incident as justification for a large-scale, potentially decisive attack on Taiwan, in which case the point of the subterfuge would be simply to complicate the domestic and coalition politics of the U.S. response. Or Beijing could use the incident as pretext for something more limited, such as “retaliatory” strikes on Taiwanese bases and military assets. Likewise, the PLA Air Force could simply conduct large-scale, persistent intrusions into Taiwan’s airspace, meant to assert its ability to overfly the island at will — forcing Taipei to choose between submitting to this confidence-crushing humiliation or contesting these intrusions at the risk of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach offers many benefits for Beijing. It would showcase China’s overwhelming escalation dominance in the area around Taiwan, which leaves Taipei with few good options for responding to limited strikes or stepped-up military pressure. It would exploit the ability of China’s state-directed propaganda apparatus to rapidly disseminate a false or misleading narrative, as officials and media outlets in the United States, Taiwan, and other nations would struggle to respond. It could also strain the U.S.-Taiwan relationship by forcing Washington to decide how much risk to run in pushing back against limited Chinese aggression — a real dilemma, given that U.S. officials would presumably not wish to see matters escalate further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a false flag incident led to more dramatic forms of aggression, this approach could — by sowing ambiguity and confusion — slow U.S. decisionmaking and exacerbate the severe time pressures a distant United States faces, even in the most favorable circumstances, in rushing to Taiwan’s aid. A false flag operation does not have to fool everyone forever. It just has to foul up the international response long enough for Beijing to create new facts on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downsides are also considerable. The United States has shown, during the war in Ukraine, that it can sometimes detect and reveal false flag operations before they occur (although this may hinge on remarkable intelligence penetration of the sort Washington seems to have achieved in the Kremlin). Even if a false flag operation created momentary confusion, any further use of force against Taiwan could quickly bring clarity to the debate in Washington and other capitals. And if the false flag were merely a prelude to more limited military actions, the United States could still respond in ways that would make Taiwan a tougher nut to crack — by deploying larger numbers of troops on Taiwanese territory, for example. If this was the case, the outcome might actually be to increase Taiwan’s resilience by strengthening its faith in U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these options is a silver bullet for Beijing. Deceptions can be unraveled. Coercion, even when clouded by confusion, can invite strategic blowback. To return to an earlier example, Russia’s ambiguous aggression in Crimea gave it control of that peninsula, but at the same time, Kyiv responded to the loss of Crimea by accelerating its alignment with the transatlantic community — and thereby confronted Putin with the dilemma he tried to solve, disastrously, with a full-on invasion in 2022. Yet China might still consider limited options — both because the near-term risks associated with them remain lower than the risks associated with a large-scale, overt aggression such as a direct invasion, and because these options could create significant political dilemmas for Taiwan and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the scenarios reveals a weakness China could try to exploit: from Taiwan’s deficient continuity-of-government procedures, to its inherent economic vulnerabilities, to uncertainties around how the United States would respond in crises short of all-out conflict. Most fundamentally, these approaches would target Taiwan’s political will to resist and its confidence in U.S. support — the two vital, interrelated intangibles that Beijing must weaken to achieve unification without a brutal fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these scenarios illustrate how Beijing might try to thread that needle, they also highlight some of the challenges Washington and Taipei must address. Taiwan’s survival may hinge as much on its internal security and continuity-of-government procedures as on its stockpile of anti-ship missiles and sea mines. The United States, for its part, needs to be developing contingency plans for cases of limited aggression. The specifics of those plans will vary according to the contingency. But the crucial point is that they must include sharp, non-kinetic punishments that allow the United States to inflict damage on China without sparking a larger military confrontation in places where the escalation dynamics are unfavorable — as well as measures that defeat the intended Chinese political effect of ambiguous aggression by significantly deepening U.S. military, diplomatic, and economic support for Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States might communicate to Beijing that any significant coercive change in the status quo would render the norms and agreements governing U.S.-Taiwan-China relations a dead letter — thereby clearing the way for, among other things, a thicker, more robust military-to-military relationship between Washington and Taipei, and perhaps even a larger, more capable, and more visible U.S. troop presence in Taiwan. Or it could indicate that aggression against outlying islands is likely to lead to more explicit U.S. security guarantees for the Taiwanese territory that remains. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act already sets the groundwork for such messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the United States might — in coordination with allies and partners — preload packages of economic sanctions that could be applied in cases of ambiguous aggression. The challenge here is that the magnitude of sanctions needed, and the importance of signaling them credibly and early, are all difficult to pull together, especially under scenarios where Beijing’s actions are in the gray zone, and therefore not always seen as sufficiently provocative to risk a possible global recession. It would also be useful to wargame scenarios short of outright conflict with Taiwan and other friendly countries, if only to form a stronger shared understanding of the difficulties those scenarios might create in the capitals whose combined effort would be needed to forge an effective response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In a contest short of war, the center of gravity is Taiwan’s confidence in its relationship with Washington and in its own ability to resist.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a contest short of war, the center of gravity is Taiwan’s confidence in its relationship with Washington and in its own ability to resist. The goal should thus be to convince Beijing that violent half-measures will backfire strategically even if they succeed tactically, as they would strengthen U.S. and international support for Taiwan and thereby harden Taipei’s hostility to unification at the point of a gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most broadly, the upshot of this analysis is that Washington needs to expand its conception of deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. If the United States prepares only for incremental or ambiguous aggression, it risks making a full-scale invasion more attractive for Beijing. But if it focuses only on high-end deterrence, it could lose on the installment plan as China uses creative tactics that erode Taiwan’s sovereignty and its confidence in the United States. Beijing has many ways to change the status quo in a sensitive area. The United States will need a holistic deterrence strategy to match.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方指黎智英對談節目就如市民在茶餐廳評論政府 從沒籲外國制裁 官押明早裁表證成立與否&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ipEp6A0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，控方早前舉證完畢，辯方今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）作中段陳詞，要求法庭就黎面對的3項控罪裁定表證不成立。就串謀發布煽動刊物罪，辯方指涉案報導和評論僅為了引起公眾關注一些牽涉公眾利益的事情，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且言論和新聞自由均受憲法保障。就串謀勾結外國勢力罪，辯方指黎在網上對談節目中的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁；黎與嘉賓僅評論國際事務，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做等。法官押後至明日上午（25日）宣布裁定表證是否成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方言論及新聞自由受憲法保障-涉案文章僅引公眾關注為一般報紙工作&quot;&gt;辯方：言論及新聞自由受憲法保障 涉案文章僅引公眾關注、為一般報紙工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻指，言論自由和新聞自由均受到憲法保障。控方的案情指稱黎利用《蘋果日報》作為平台發布煽動刊物，辯方形容指控「奇怪」，因他們發布的報導和評論均為了引起公眾關注一些牽涉公眾利益的事情，這是一般報紙本來就會做的工作，而且不同報紙本來就帶有光譜上不同的政治立場，不應被視為「煽動刊物」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 資深大律師 彭耀鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官杜麗冰指，法庭判斷文章是否「煽動刊物」時，不單只要看文章內容，也要視乎發布的背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法生效後沒有新的犯罪協議-官控方指稱犯罪協議持續&quot;&gt;辯方：國安法生效後沒有新的犯罪協議 官：控方指稱犯罪協議持續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀」這一項控罪元素，彭耀鴻指「串謀」涉及多於一人協議做非法事情，或者協議用非法手段去做合法事情。彭力陳，即使在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他《蘋果》高層之間存在犯罪協議，但是在《國安法》生效之後，便再沒有新的犯罪協議，因此不存在「串謀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，控方的案情是指稱犯罪協議在《國安法》生效之前形成，當2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之後，相關協議變得不合法，然而黎與其他被告繼續。李官又指，這個議題是一個事實判斷，而非如辯方所說是一個法律議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎叫撐住意味繼續犯罪協議-辯方僅籲同事繼續經營報紙&quot;&gt;官質疑黎叫「撐住」意味繼續犯罪協議 辯方：僅籲同事繼續經營報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻則重申，在《國安法》生效之前，黎與其他被告協議去做的是合法事情，當它在《國安法》生效之後變得不合法，他們便從根本上更改了整個協議。法官杜麗冰則質疑，辯方從沒有在盤問控方證人期間，向他們指出以上說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰又質疑，在沒有任何證據下，辯方基於什麼基礎而指稱被告的協議是合法，而且合法與否並非基於被告自己的意見，不是被告覺得是合法便是合法。彭耀鴻則重申，黎與其他被告之間的協議並不涉任何罪行，一向都是完全合法（perfectly lawful）。根據張劍虹和陳沛敏的證供，《國安法》生效之後，他們徵詢法律意見，以確保《蘋果》不觸犯任何法律，可見他們的協議並非觸犯法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mwz5Vjx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李素蘭質疑，黎還柙後仍然叫同事繼續「撐住」。彭耀鴻則指，黎的意思是叫同事繼續營運《蘋果日報》，不代表叫同事繼續犯法。李素蘭回應指，須視乎相關證據去理解黎說「撐住」的意思是什麼。彭重申，黎的意思是叫同事繼續經營及出版《蘋果》，法庭不能以此說話來推論黎籲同事觸犯法律。法官杜麗冰和李素蘭聞言均指，這是一個牽涉事實裁定的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英對談節目確有提及制裁-但不代表呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英對談節目確有提及制裁 但不代表呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻指，黎曾經在2020年7月之前曾提倡外國制裁，但是這是在《國安法》生效之前發生，其時相關行為完全合法，然而黎在《國安法》生效之後便沒有繼續呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在2020年7月開始製作網上對談節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，但是他在節目中從沒呼籲外國制裁中國和香港。黎與其私人助手 Mark Simon 之間的訊息僅表達黎的個人意見，並不構成任何證據顯示有犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，即使黎在 Live Chat 節目中的確有提及制裁，但是不代表他正在呼籲外國實施制裁。惟法官杜麗冰指，假設有人說「制裁有幫助，能迫使政府為自己的行為負責」等言論，可以被視為等同於呼籲制裁，視乎說話者在怎樣的情況下說這番言論。彭耀鴻回應指，因此法庭需要將語境考慮在內，就本案而言，「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」每集時間頗長，討論內容均圍繞國際事務，與呼籲制裁大相逕庭，不足以作出推論指犯罪協議存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英節目僅討論國際局勢-正如市民在茶餐廳討論時政&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英節目僅討論國際局勢 正如市民在茶餐廳討論時政&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英與不同嘉賓在對談節目中僅就國際事務表達意見、評論拜登政府應該怎樣做等等，就如一般市民在茶餐廳裡評論時政，說香港政府有何不足、應該怎樣做、美國政府及歐洲政府應怎樣做等，然而這不足以達至推論指黎有犯罪協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英刊於專欄「成敗樂一笑」的文章，辯方指黎僅表達其個人見解，沒有任何內容可以被用來推論黎串謀呼籲制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指蘋果編採政策不變不代表黎同意犯法-官質疑打擦邊球&quot;&gt;辯方指《蘋果》編採政策不變不代表黎同意犯法 官質疑「打擦邊球」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方案情指稱，在《國安法》生效之後，《蘋果》的編採政策沒有改變過。辯方則指，縱使證人供稱到獄中探訪還柙的黎時，黎寄語《蘋果》同事不要害怕、要繼續如常營運《蘋果》，亦沒有指示要改變編採政策，但是不代表黎同意干犯法律，他的意思只是叫同事繼續出版報紙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李素蘭則引述楊清奇的證供中「打擦邊球」說法，質疑《蘋果》冒險超越法律界線。彭耀鴻則強調《蘋果》高層想盡力維持在法律界線之內，就如打乒乓球般，雙方目標是令乒乓球留在界線內，而不是瞄準界線而來發球。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏早前供稱黎智英提議製作制裁名單-辯方稱訊息非出自黎手筆&quot;&gt;陳沛敏早前供稱黎智英提議製作制裁名單 辯方稱訊息非出自黎手筆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏曾供稱，2020年7月14日，時任美國總統特朗普簽署《香港自治法》的行政命令之後，黎智英以 WhatsApp 傳送相關行政命令內文，以及提出準備一份「Shit List」，陳理解黎的意思是要製作「制裁名單」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3zOG2Tr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今指稱，從 WhatsApp 訊息的字眼可見，黎當時只是將另一名美國人的訊息，連同行政命令內文和「Shit List」的提議，一併複製並傳送給陳沛敏。因為相關行政命令是很重要的新聞，而陳當時身為高層，所以黎立即傳送給陳，然而「Shit list」並非黎本人的提議。法官杜麗冰質疑辯方是在作出假設，而且相關訊息是否由黎智英撰寫、黎是否同意訊息內容，皆屬於事實爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方有充份證據證明國安法生效後-黎智英仍然是犯罪協議的一份子&quot;&gt;控方：有充份證據證明國安法生效後 黎智英仍然是犯罪協議的一份子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行重申，控方一直以來都是指稱黎與其他被告在《國安法》之前達成犯罪協議，並在國安法生效之後繼續相關協議。而且案中有充份證據證明《國安法》生效之後，黎智英仍然是協議的一份子，包括其網上對談節目內容、Twitter 上有關「重光團隊」、IPAC和裴倫德的帖文等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zndiTrc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行（左）、高級檢控官 陳穎琛（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，法庭不能夠只著眼於《國安法》生效之後發生的事，而是要將黎智英在《國安法》之前所作的行為納入考慮，以全面地理解案情，因此控方從頭到尾、根據時序來顯示黎智英做過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，所有以從犯證人身份出庭作供的《蘋果》高層均供稱，在國安法生效之後，《蘋果》的編採政策沒有改變，他們繼續做一直以來的工作。當張劍虹對於黎邀請美國退休軍官 Jack Keane 出席對談節目表達關注，質疑會否過於敏感，黎則回應：「我一定去到盡㗎，我冇得褪㗎。」就另一項串謀勾結外國勢力罪，從犯證人陳梓華供稱在2020年6月16日赴壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英，當時黎要求陳繼續國際線工作，形容《國安法》「雷聲大，雨點小」。控方指以上均顯示《國安法》之後黎決定繼續涉案行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，只要有足夠證據顯示犯罪協議持續，而且參與者遵守相關協議，便可以滿足「串謀」這項控罪元素。控方又指，不只可以透過外在行為（overt acts），案中亦有來自從犯證人的直接證據，證明協議的內容、如何達成協議，以及在國安法前後如何執行相關協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官押後至明早宣布決定&quot;&gt;官押後至明早宣布決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控辯雙方均陳詞完畢，法官杜麗冰押後至明日上午（25日）宣布決定。若然法庭裁定黎就控罪表證成立，黎需決定是否作供及傳召辯方證人；相反，若然法庭裁定表證不成立，黎則毋須答辯，可當庭釋放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司，於2020年7月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀，請求外國或者境外機構、組織、人員實施對香港特別行政區或者中華人民共和國進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，指黎智英於2020年7月1日至今年2月15日間，與 Mark Simon、陳梓華、李宇軒、劉祖廸及其他人串謀，請求外國或境外機構、組織、人員，實施對中國或香港進行制裁、封鎖或者採取其他敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示或複製煽動刊物」罪指，黎智英、蘋果日報有限公司、蘋果日報印刷有限公司及蘋果互聯網有限公司於2019年4月1日至2021年6月24日（包括首尾兩日），在香港與其他人一同串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及/或複製煽動刊物，具意圖：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;

Many in both communities feel that a peace process would simply allow the other side to buy time while pursuing more maximalist goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you mention a peace process in Israel or the West Bank these days, you risk sounding naive at best and borderline treacherous at worst. Both communities are reeling, polls show support for a two-state solution is at an all-time low, and the Israeli Knesset has just passed a resolution rejecting a Palestinian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the conflict isn’t going away and, at some point, engagement will again be necessary. When that time comes, the parameters cannot just snap back to the same issues that defined previous negotiations. Rather, they will need to take into account the sharply changed realities (and strikingly similar perceptions) in both communities. In my conversations with everyday Israelis and Palestinians on the ground, the same themes keep emerging – yet it’s clear that the two communities have never been further apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trauma&quot;&gt;Trauma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Israelis and Palestinians are (again) navigating unprecedented traumas, and “trauma” is the word I’ve heard the most here this summer. The Israel–Palestine conflict has long been described as one of dual victimhood, with the state of Israel emerging in the aftermath of the Holocaust, along with the mass displacement of indigenous Palestinians in the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. The intergenerational trauma of those events still deeply pervades both societies, but the events themselves are recognised as historical events that predate the lives of most members of both populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7 October attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza have brought those prior traumas surging back for the current generation. For Israel, 7 October not only marked the single deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, but also reanimated a sense of existential dread not felt in decades. Several people have told me that their overwhelming thought on the morning of the attacks was: “They are coming for us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Gaza, meanwhile, is being experienced by Palestinians as the current generation’s Nakba: “What our grandparents experienced in 1948, it’s history. But what is going on now in Gaza is so shocking, because for us, it’s the first time to see this level of destruction, of ethnic cleansing, of mass killings”, one woman told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As much as Israelis and Palestinians distrust their own leaders, they also distrust the other side’s, including the relative moderates who would be most likely to re-engage in a future peace process&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are the twin traumas unfolding simultaneously, but each side has shrugged off the other’s suffering with a general response of “they deserved it”. “Even Palestinians who don’t support Hamas couldn’t help feeling a satisfaction on 7 October”, I’ve heard often, with polling reflecting the same sentiment. And most Israelis, across the political spectrum, support the war in Gaza. As one man told me, “There is a Jewish saying: if there are those who are coming to kill you, you kill them first. So what can we do?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;distrust&quot;&gt;Distrust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Corrupt”. “Complicit”. “Selfish”. “Liars”. I haven’t met a single Israeli or Palestinian who trusts their current leadership – much less the other side’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than half of Israelis believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the war for political reasons, and citizens across the ideological spectrum blame him for the failed policies and security lapses that, they believe, allowed the Hamas attacks to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians are equally frustrated with the ossifying Palestinian Authority (PA), which has long been seen as corrupt. But for most Palestinians I’ve spoken with, it is what they view as the PA’s complicity with Israel, via intelligence and security cooperation, that has most degraded any sense they might have of the body’s legitimacy. As one activist told me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People feel oppressed, we don’t have the power of political parties, and we feel we cannot do what we should do to support Gaza. Everywhere around the world, we see actions in solidarity with Gaza, or for a ceasefire. But here we cannot write a Facebook post, we cannot organise demonstrations or sit-ins, even within our own cities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as Israelis and Palestinians distrust their own leaders, they also distrust the other side’s, including the relative moderates who would be most likely to re-engage in a future peace process. Moreover, they distrust a peace process, believing such a process does little beyond allowing the other side to buy time while pursuing more maximalist goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An open letter published by Palestinians in Mondoweiss put it bluntly: “Make no mistake. The offers of a Palestinian state are an illusion”. Israelis I have met expressed similar views: “No matter what [PA president] Abu Mazen says, or a piece of paper says, most Palestinians will still just want to kill Jews. And they won’t stop, even if there is a Palestinian state”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;isolation&quot;&gt;Isolation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Palestinians and Israelis feel wholly marginalised by the international community. Despite sympathy from world leaders directly after 7 October, Israelis have since perceived a world turned increasingly hostile, from widespread student protests and unexpected boycotts to legal actions in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). “It’s like the whole world has forgotten the atrocities of 7 October”, I’m often told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more pointed criticisms. A former IDF spokesperson I met was incredulous that the World Health Organization had not condemned Hamas’s infiltration of Gazan hospitals. In Tel Aviv, a main thoroughfare is lined with posters accusing UN Women of ignoring reports of widespread sexual violence on 7 October. When I asked women at the Hostages and Missing Persons Square why they thought that was, their answer was simple: “Because we’re Jews”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians have felt equally marginalised. While international solidarity protests for Palestine are appreciated, there is frustration that government leaders, especially in the US, have continued to support Israel: “How can they just sit back and let a genocide continue for nine months?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the ICJ and ICC actions, while welcome, are seen by many Palestinians as double-edged swords, because of the lack of enforcement mechanisms. “On the one hand, the legal steps make people hope that justice might prevail”, a Palestinian human rights lawyer told me. “At the same time, when nothing happens after that, and the end result on the ground is nothing, people lose faith, not just in the court, but in the whole international system”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;defiance&quot;&gt;Defiance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides are also more dug in than ever before – and confident that they can wait each other out. The phrase “from the river to the sea” became well-known for its deployment in pro-Palestine demonstrations, but I hear it invoked by Israelis just as much as by Palestinians – referring to full control of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, including the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite sympathy from world leaders directly after 7 October, Israelis have since perceived a world turned increasingly hostile, from widespread student protests and unexpected boycotts to legal actions in international courts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such aspirations are not new, but they are more widespread and vocalised now than in previous years. Moreover, both sides are increasingly convinced that they can win in a long-game demographic stand-off. Palestinians have long embraced the concept of sumoud, roughly translated as “steadfastness”, or a sense of perseverance and rootedness in the land. I’m often told, “We outlasted the British and the Ottomans and centuries of other foreign occupiers. We can outlast Israel too”. Among Israelis, the word I’ve heard the most in the post-7 October context is “resilience”. Despite some reports of emigration in the context of the war, the main sentiment here was summed up by one Israeli as, “We’re not moving. We are resilient and we won’t be bullied anymore”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremists have, obviously, exploited those sentiments further. Far-right Israeli settlers, intent on retaking all of biblical Israel, have escalated campaigns of direct violence to expel Palestinians from more than a dozen West Bank villages since 7 October, attacks described to me by multiple Palestinians as “pogroms”. And many Palestinians support Hamas’s claim that the 7 October attack was “a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, still many individuals, NGOs and movements – including family members of hostages and victims – who are committed to a (fledgling) peace movement. As one activist said, “Everyone wants things black and white, but as humans, we should be able to have empathy for the hostages and their families and also for civilians in Gaza. People want revenge, and it’s understandable, but we cannot lose our identity and our humanity in search of revenge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most mainstream Israelis and Palestinians I’ve met do not see their hardened positions as motivated by revenge, so much as by survival. A new political vision, whenever it comes, will need to engage with these deeper fundamental realities if it’s going to stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brexit vote in June 2016 and subsequent decision by then-Prime Minister Theresa May to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union in March 2017, formally starting the process through which the UK left the EU, triggered a range of consequences for the UK. In the sanctions arena, this decision created the need for the UK to develop the necessary legislation to maintain existing sanctions regimes – and have the capacity to impose further sanctions – outside the laws and regulations of the EU. This work needed to be done rapidly to ensure the UK maintained its ability to implement and enforce sanctions once the exit process was complete. At the same time, the decision to leave the EU also created the opportunity for the UK to develop its own independent sanctions policy, acting unilaterally and at a different pace from its European neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the importance of the challenge and opportunity this presented, in May 2019, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) created a taskforce on the “Future of UK Sanctions Policy”, which considered the post-Brexit design and coordination of sanctions, providing recommendations on how the UK should develop and implement its independent sanctions policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strategy the UK may have been developing for the use of sanctions following the completion of the Brexit process was upended by the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the significant challenges posed by the need to design, implement and enforce sanctions on Russia and the recent publication of the UK government’s sanctions strategy, RUSI has established a new taskforce to consider how the UK has addressed these challenges and what its independent sanctions policy might be in this dramatically changed sanctions environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the progress made, the challenges encountered and the lessons learned is vital for defining an effective future sanctions strategy for the UK to ensure the country is in the best possible position to create the desired impact of sanctions in an evolving threat landscape. This new UK Sanctions Implementation and Strategy Taskforce (the Taskforce), comprising 50 former government officials from the UK and elsewhere, senior sanctions executives from the financial sector and industry, and academics aims to evaluate the UK’s current sanctions policy and propose enhancements to its strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce held its inaugural roundtable in June 2024 to discuss the evolution of the UK’s independent sanctions policies post-Brexit, the preparation and changes required and the early use of an independent sanctions strategy. It then discussed the challenges posed, and changes necessitated, by the sanctions regime imposed on Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A second roundtable is scheduled for October 2024 to explore opportunities for strengthening existing frameworks and ensuring the UK’s sanctions strategy is fit for the geopolitical and emerging threat environment it faces today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report gathers the main findings from the June roundtable and assesses chronologically the establishment of the UK’s independent sanctions framework and the subsequent need to rapidly adapt in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. None of the comments made by the Taskforce members are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-post-brexit-sanctions-response-201622&quot;&gt;The UK’s Post-Brexit Sanctions Response (2016–22)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion first sought to understand the overall impact of the transition from an EU-based sanctions regime to the post-Brexit era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establishing-an-independent-sanctions-framework&quot;&gt;Establishing an Independent Sanctions Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Taskforce participants agreed that, while initially creating an atmosphere of uncertainty in the early stages of the process, Brexit had also given the UK government the flexibility and agility to shape its sanctions policy according to national priorities. After decades of implementing sanctions – apart from those relating to terrorism – as part of multi-country groupings within the UN and EU, the UK had the chance to introduce its own legal framework, leveraging the experience gathered while in the EU, as well as exploring the development of new sanctions regimes and accompanying narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members from major financial institutions reported that the early days of the transition process were characterised by a sense of urgency among civil servants to establish the necessary legislation for imposing and implementing the UK’s own sanctions, due to a lack of certainty on the official departure date from the EU. The need for independent sanctions legislation resulted in the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA), which facilitated the roll-over of the existing EU sanctions regimes, their applicability in the UK and the future capacity of the UK to make new designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the urgency of the transition was over, the UK’s sanctions policy evolved beyond merely replicating EU sanctions. Former government officials at the roundtable noted that the UK had been a leading player in the development of the EU’s sanctions policies. With newfound independence, the government was able to leverage this experience, and introduce new sanctions regimes such as the Global Human Rights (GHR) Sanctions regime and the Global Anti-Corruption (GAC) Sanctions regime, and act with greater agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members acknowledged some of strengths of the post-Brexit UK regime. A former US government official, for instance, praised the UK’s role in facilitating transatlantic coordination with the EU and commended the country’s “political bravery” in implementing sanctions regimes that had previously been hindered by disagreements among EU member states pre-Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from the UK also acknowledged the relative strength of the UK’s post-Brexit legal framework. For example, one representative from the private sector noted that the legal framework is “broadly sensible” and functional, with statutory requirements for guidance enhancing its effectiveness, and an evidentiary threshold that is more consistently applied now that the UK is not in the EU – making listing decisions more robust. Another significant success singled out by the Taskforce was the introduction of the power to grant general licences, which greatly enhanced the flexibility and responsiveness of the sanctions regime, despite not being much used before February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the strength of the legal framework, some private sector representatives argued that the new independent regime created unease among businesses that now had to comply with yet another significant set of sanctions listings and implementation requirements and engage with new authorities such as the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OFSI was established in March 2016 and became operational in April 2017. Some participants mentioned that its slow start disappointed the private sector, contrasting its performance with the decades-old Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the US. Former US officials also stressed the differences in resourcing and behaviour between the US and the UK’s “sanctions machinery”, with the latter lacking the former’s size and “aggressiveness”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Taskforce members agreed that in the immediate period after Brexit, the UK had developed an effective sanctions framework based on the new SAMLA legislation and had gradually built its capacity to implement new regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;introducing-new-autonomous-sanctions-regimes&quot;&gt;Introducing New Autonomous Sanctions Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taskforce explored one particular benefit of the UK’s independent sanctions policy – the autonomy to design and adopt new regimes. Although the UK now has 36 thematic and country regimes, the Taskforce discussion focused on two regimes in particular – the GHR sanctions regime of 2020 and the GAC sanctions regime of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Taskforce participants agreed on the limited impact and scope of these two regimes. Overall, they described human rights and anti-corruption sanctions as “presentational”, with a strong messaging value at the international level, but limited impact on the targets or on UK businesses and their sanctions compliance obligations. Some recalled former Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s vision when establishing these regimes, as he sought to articulate the UK’s sanctions strategy as demonstrating “Global Britain’s commitment to acting as a force for good in the world”. However, they posited that these expectations have not been fully realised. The UK’s GAC and GHR sanctions have been underused, with only 42 and 123 designations respectively, in stark contrast to the proactive use by the US of its Global Magnitsky Sanctions, which includes 700 designations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited application of GAC and GHR sanctions is not merely about numbers. Participants highlighted a lack of clarity and transparency regarding the criteria and purpose for which sanctions are deployed – or the strategy for their use – concluding that they are mainly used for signalling, with little expectation of behaviour change or justice being delivered. According to civil society representatives attending the roundtable, the inconsistency and perceived arbitrariness in the use of GAC sanctions undermine the legitimacy of the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also agreed that the deployment of thematic sanctions has been significantly hindered by the government’s focus on the Russia regime since February 2022. One Taskforce member suggested that without Russia’s invasion, the UK would have likely developed a clearer vision for its thematic regimes, citing the successful coordination with Canada and the US on Belarus’s GHR designations as an example of effective pre-2022 implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-sanctions-reality-after-february-2022&quot;&gt;The New Sanctions Reality After February 2022&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants recognised that the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022 had fundamentally altered the sanctions landscape and had a dramatic impact on the operations of private sector compliance departments across the UK. The Taskforce recognised that the UK had found itself on a steep learning curve, rapidly scaling up efforts to match heightened global expectations, particularly from the US, to ensure the effectiveness of G7 coordinated sanctions efforts against Russia. Among the positive developments stemming from these efforts, participants highlighted the significant injection of funds and resources in key agencies such as OFSI, increased parliamentary scrutiny to monitor the government’s performance and ensure accountability, and a designation process with a more consistent application of the evidentiary threshold than before 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statutory requirement for the government to provide guidance was, according to participants, another major advance, ensuring greater clarity on implementation as well as accountability and transparency from the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants acknowledged the UK government’s efforts to engage with industry at different stages of the sanctions cycle, despite encountering a series of challenges. For instance, they argued that co-designing sanctions had proven to be difficult due to their national security nature, citing the oil price cap as a unique example of industry involvement in shaping specific measures. Meanwhile, in supporting sanctions implementation, sanctions had dominated public–private partnership meetings, almost matching the focus traditionally placed on anti-money laundering in these forums. However, after this positive initial public–private engagement, some industry representatives observed a shift from collaboration towards an enforcement-focused approach, prompting businesses to seek legal protection when engaging with authorities, which in the view of some participants has been a backwards step in terms of a cross-sector approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants welcomed the increased use by the government of the power to grant general licences. This greatly enhanced the flexibility and responsiveness of the sanctions regime by allowing multiple parties to conduct certain restricted activities without the bureaucracy of obtaining individual licences. Prior to the invasion, OFSI granted only two general licences, while since February 2022 the number of general licences has reached more than 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features of the UK’s approach to sanctions post-February 2022, which were largely absent in the immediate post-Brexit period, have become central to the post-invasion sanctions landscape. Despite these advances, the Taskforce identified several deficiencies undermining the effectiveness and credibility of UK sanctions, which require government attention. These are set out in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-resourcing-and-expertise&quot;&gt;Limited Resourcing and Expertise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taskforce members discussed the shortage of resources and expertise in the relevant government sanctions departments. They described how the Russia regime required the hiring of new staff within government agencies, many of whom lacked the necessary sanctions knowledge. The urgency to address a backlog of licensing requests from businesses operating in the UK also led to a “conveyor belt” approach, which prioritised speed over development of expertise. This has prevented officials from developing a wider focus beyond UK domestic sanctions, resulting in many civil servants, who were working on sanctions, remaining too UK-centric in their approach, and consequently lacking in-depth knowledge about the regimes of G7 partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid staff turnover also exacerbated these challenges. Government officials who have developed their expertise in sanctions have frequently transitioned to the private sector, attracted by better opportunities and remuneration. As reported by private sector representatives, even secondment initiatives intended to bolster expertise in the civil service often result in permanent moves away from public service, contributing to a persistent shortage of skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-maturity-in-the-non-financial-sector&quot;&gt;Lack of Maturity in the Non-Financial Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-running experience of financial institutions in implementing sanctions facilitated their readiness to confront the new obligations presented by the Russia regime and engage with competent authorities. However, most Taskforce members agreed that the non-financial sector continues to display varying degrees of readiness and capability to comply with the new sanctions regime. Deficiencies in the sector often relate to a lack of the necessary technical knowledge, skills and resources, including basic awareness of sanctions risks, rather than wilful neglect. The non-financial sector is increasingly participating in public–private collaboration efforts and enhancing their expertise and capabilities, but the gap demands greater attention from the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quality-of-guidance&quot;&gt;Quality of Guidance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Taskforce members welcomed OFSI’s recent decision to publish an FAQs document and found it useful for understanding OFSI’s expectations. Yet, one participant suggested that clearer and more comprehensive guidance might eliminate the burden for regulators to provide FAQs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant highlighted that sanctions and related guidance still do not reflect the specific nuances of supply chains. This creates a substantial compliance burden for businesses to check whether listed small components or items are present in their supply chain. They gave as an example the requirements to comply with sanctions on materials such as titanium, which required businesses to trace the origins of small components, with uncertain benefits for the ultimate goals of sanctions. Despite the overall usefulness of guidance and complementary FAQs, a sanctions lawyer in the Taskforce also raised concerns about the legal standing of the guidance, highlighting recent UK court decisions which have emphasised the prioritisation of the statutory language of the sanctions regulations over any related guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;listing-and-delisting-criteria&quot;&gt;Listing and Delisting Criteria&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal experts in the Taskforce criticised the current UK sanctions designation criteria for lacking clarity and rigorous standards, based on the low evidentiary threshold of “reasonable grounds to suspect”. Participants noted that UK courts have so far adopted an “arm’s length” approach when deliberating designation challenges, highlighting a prevailing trend in UK court rulings, viewing sanctions designations as a matter of government foreign policy with which they do not feel it is appropriate to engage, thus granting considerable leeway to the government in their sanctions decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most legal experts in the Taskforce highlighted the absence of an established delisting policy, leaving those sanctioned without recourse or explanation, further eroding the legitimacy of the sanctions regime. Some advocated for the introduction of clear, transparent criteria and procedures for lifting sanctions; these could include conditions such as divestment from problematic assets, cessation of activities linked to the Russian government, undergoing periodic independent audits, publicly supporting Ukraine, or criticising where possible Russia’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;combining-sanctions-with-criminal-justice-tools&quot;&gt;Combining Sanctions with Criminal Justice Tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants raised significant concerns about due process and the rule of law when combining sanctions with criminal justice tools, due to sanctions’ low evidentiary threshold and their basis in ministerial decisions. They noted a lack of differentiation between assets of individuals or businesses of Russian heritage and/or who have divested their assets from Russia, and individuals involved in illicit activities such as corruption, money laundering or sanctions evasion. Only the latter should be subject to asset confiscation, yet discussions often fail to make this distinction. Despite these challenges, Taskforce members recommended combining sanctions with other enforcement tools, particularly criminal investigations resulting in civil and criminal forfeitures. They suggested that this approach, if carefully implemented, could enhance the UK’s independent sanctions policy and global influence. A member of the legal sector recommended looking at the activities of the US Task Force KleptoCapture as a successful example of this model to prosecute illicit conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alignment-of-sanctions-regimes&quot;&gt;Alignment of Sanctions Regimes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While G7 countries aim for a unified approach to Russian sanctions, the Taskforce concurred that implementation varies between nations, leading to inconsistencies and challenges for international businesses. Private sector members reported that discrepancies in licensing and regulatory practices still existed between the US, the UK and the EU, causing operational disruptions. They emphasised the importance of alignment with international partners for the effectiveness of sanctions, the need to harmonise licences to simplify operations and mitigate diverging economic impacts, and the need for close coordination to minimise differences in sanctions regimes to avoid undermining collective efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lack-of-a-sustainable-vision&quot;&gt;Lack of a Sustainable Vision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Taskforce members highlighted their perception of the lack of a long-term vision in the UK sanctions strategy beyond the Russia regime. Most concurred that the current sanctions regime imposes a significant burden on businesses and regulators without necessarily achieving – or clearly evidencing – its intended objectives. For instance, despite its aim to disrupt Russian military trade flows, sanctions have not effectively curtailed Russia’s global procurement activities, but simply redirected them. Members from the private sector noted the challenge for the UK government of balancing competing political aims – for example, on the one hand, restricting finance and resources to Russia while on the other trying to maintain global energy supplies. This created a tension between political messaging of standing against Russia and the practical implementation of sanctions and licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants suggested that the UK needs to reassess its strategy to ensure that sanctions are not only punitive but also effective and sustainable. They recommended the UK revisited or eliminated measures that create undue burdens without significant impact. This approach would allow the UK to focus on sanctions that genuinely hinder the targeted activities and adapt to a changing global landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After its departure from the EU, the UK embarked on an intensive journey to develop its independent sanctions policy. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine ushered in a new era, characterised by a rapid expansion and heightening of efforts, significant resource allocation, and a steep learning curve for government agencies. Despite these efforts, the Taskforce identified several deficiencies that the UK government must address to ensure the effectiveness and credibility of UK sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, the Taskforce highlighted as key issues: resources and expertise; engagement with industry; alignment with international partners; and a clear set of objectives for its sanctions policy. The Taskforce agreed that the UK will need to look beyond Russia sanctions to react to evolving geopolitical risks and emerging threats. The Taskforce will reconvene in October 2024 for an assessment of the future and vision of the UK and its sanctions regimes to ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of its sanctions strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

China has been a leading partner in many Latin American space projects and the primary focus of U.S. interest in space activities in the region. While important in the context of U.S.-China competition, this approach proves limiting in understanding the real imperatives and constraints behind international space engagement in the region, whether with China or the many other nations with which Latin American countries collaborate in space. Understanding the complex domestic and foreign policy factors impacting these choices is essential for developing U.S. engagement strategies and policies that fully leverage the vital opportunities afforded by space activities in the context of U.S.–Latin American relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space developments in Latin America remain relatively unknown to U.S. analysts and policymakers. One reason is that the outsized presence of China — responsible for the launch of over a dozen satellites on behalf of Latin American countries — is so often the focal point of English-language study of this topic. This analytical approach is typically framed as a chapter in the larger story of great power competition, with emphasis on strategic and security concerns given relative U.S. disengagement with the region. Yet it does little to explain why Latin American countries choose space-related partnerships with China — or, just as importantly, because the world has multiple spheres of influence and nations do not split cleanly into two sides, why they choose many other international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just about great power politics. Latin American actors operate in space as they do in other domains, with complex moves in both the domestic and foreign policy realms. When placed in a broader context that considers domestic constraints, as well as international foreign policy objectives, the complex modalities of international space engagement in the region — featuring civil and defense actors, civil society, academia, and industry — start to make more sense. For example, extensive Chinese-Brazilian collaboration to develop and operate the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) program has not prevented Brazil from making its proposed contributions to the United States’ Moon exploration program Artemis or participating in space security exchanges with the U.S. military. Instead, these reflect Brazil’s “universalist” approach to space cooperation, which echoes a foreign policy tradition of active nonalignment to keep all avenues of collaboration open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/o4rpBPJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It matters why and how Latin American space actors engage internationally. While Latin American countries’ choices in space partners are not simply an indication of attitudes toward the United States, these developments do have implications for U.S. strategic objectives, both in space and beyond. Oversimplifying these choices and failing to understand the drivers and constraints of space activities in the region risks the development of partnership strategies that fail to meet the needs of potential partners and are thus not seen as viable alternatives. It could also close the door on other opportunities beyond the realm of space. Efforts to advance U.S. objectives in the region would thus prove challenging and ineffective, with significant geopolitical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, space activities are linked to some of the most pressing issues facing decisionmakers today, from national security to agricultural production in the face of climate change. Latin American countries have observed the experience of actors such as India, which has successfully integrated space into its national development agenda, and thus see the potential for space to serve as a cross-cutting tool to address national priorities. The successful integration of space tools and applications is therefore pivotal in addressing the key Latin American issues of today, whether to support efforts to curb illegal fishing, understand the Venezuela-Guyana territorial border dispute, or assess recovery after Rio Grande do Sul’s devastating floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief captures findings from a yearlong study of the international engagement efforts of a subset of Latin American space actors through the lens of both domestic and foreign policy. It draws on extensive reading of primary and secondary sources in English, Spanish, and Portuguese; analysis of presentations and public remarks; and not-for-attribution interviews with government officials and other experts. The study fills a gap in the literature by shedding light on the broader context of space development in Latin America, where international cooperation has been central. Ultimately, this work seeks to contribute to the development of U.S. engagement strategies and policies that fully leverage the vital opportunities afforded by space activities in U.S.–Latin American relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief first paints a broad picture of space development and international space engagement in Latin America. It then examines three case studies that exemplify different types of international engagement, discussing the domestic and foreign policy drivers and constraints impacting these efforts. The brief then closes by assessing the implications for U.S. policymakers, offering several recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-emerging-space-region&quot;&gt;An “Emerging” Space Region&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space activities are not new to Latin American countries. Space development in Latin America can be grouped into three general periods. The first began in the 1960s with Argentina and Brazil establishing space-focused entities and adopting a similar strategic approach to space as that of the United States, China, and the Soviet Union. Next, these early, largely military-led programs shifted to wholly civil or dual-use approaches in the 1990s amid the post–Cold War security landscape. The third and current phase exhibits important milestones across a wider set of countries and actors, such as universities and private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stated priorities continue to focus on acquiring, leveraging, or developing space technologies for societal need, with a particular emphasis on telecommunications and Earth observation rather than human spaceflight. For instance, the head of the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB), commenting on potential Brazilian contributions to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Artemis program, noted that while sending an astronaut to space “generates visibility,” it is “not the most important thing in the Brazilian space program. Its primary objective, from the beginning, is to generate benefits for society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is “profound heterogeneity” in the region’s space activities, which nevertheless share basic principles — such as support for the core international space treaties — and often retain an operational and leadership role for the military. A discussion of the space-related milestones achieved by the many Latin American countries is beyond the scope of this paper. It is important to note, however, that these have included activity across the technology, institutional, and international cooperation domains since the beginning — such as Ecuador ratifying the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (one of the core international space treaties) in 1972 and Costa Rica hosting the first Space Conference of the Americas in 1990. The diversity and breadth of activity in Latin America exhibits the limitations of simply describing it as an “emerging” space region, which implies that there has been very little activity and only very recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H2QgpeG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latin American countries’ international engagement on space issues has been a core tenet since the 1960s. As reflected in Brazil’s National Program for Space Activities, PNAE 2022–2031, international cooperation is both a means (to advance national space development) as well as an end (to strengthen strategic alliances). In addition, every one of the projects of Argentina’s National Space Activities Commission (CONAE) has been developed through international cooperation, according to its director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas discussion of international cooperation tends to highlight joint projects or bilateral development efforts, Latin American space engagement has notably featured leadership in international coordination and cooperation bodies. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were among the 18 member states of the 1958 UN ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which later become a permanent committee and remains central for information exchange and cooperation in the peaceful use of space. Via national subject-matter experts and through the UN Group of Latin American Countries, the region has had significant weight in multilateral space governance efforts. This includes Brazil chairing a 2019 COPUOS session at which members adopted a set of voluntary best practices for space activities and Chile chairing the 2022 UN-convened working group on space threats, which saw active engagement from several other countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, today’s space activities in Latin America are increasingly spreading to the nongovernment realm, with new business ventures, including start-ups, being stood up even in countries with no national space programs. Presenting a new set of challenges for how to govern space activities, multiple civil society and advocacy organizations have formed to support the Latin American space industry and address the constraints on entry into the global space market. Worthy of future research, this is yet another dynamic that illustrates shared regional conditions and challenges. Taken as a whole, the Latin American space landscape is complex, full of energy, and hosts a diverse set of space actors who continue to advance international partnerships and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-looks-at-international-space-engagement-in-latin-america&quot;&gt;Three Looks at International Space Engagement in Latin America&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign and domestic policy considerations motivate and constrain the space activities of Latin American nations in ways that impact the priorities and lines of effort (“what”), rationales (“why”), institutions involved (“who”), and implementation approaches (“how”) of such efforts. The following case studies examine different types of international engagement among several actors. Selected collaborations do not include China and cannot be explained by great power politics, thereby highlighting the complexities at play in Latin American space decisions beyond strategic rivalry. Additionally, while these efforts began with decisions made decades ago, they represent important developments shaping space activities today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;autonomy-and-dependency-in-chiles-national-satellites&quot;&gt;Autonomy and Dependency in Chile’s National Satellites&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unique among its neighbors, Chile opted to meet national security needs for data about its territory by sourcing Earth observation satellites commercially. The Chilean Air Force (FACh) used technology transfer contracts to procure its first national Earth observation satellites, FASat-Alpha and FASat-Bravo, from the United Kingdom’s Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL), then the lead manufacturer of commercial small satellites for international customers. In 1998, it successfully orbited FASat-Bravo after FASat-Alpha failed to deploy in 1995. The satellite’s successor, FASat-Charlie, was procured from Europe’s Astrium (now Airbus Defence and Space, which owns SSTL) and launched in 2011. Registered under the Chilean flag, the satellites added highly prized experience in satellite operations to Chile’s existing knowledge base on the interpretation and use of images and data from air- and space-borne remote sensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Chile announced a new national space effort. The National Satellite System (SNSat) would not just replace the aging FASat-Charlie but also include a national development component so that Chilean engineers would build the bulk of a new constellation of 10 small satellites. SNSat also includes plans to spread infrastructure and capacity more widely across Chile, helping address the development gap between Santiago and outer regions. Supported by an interministerial space council and a draft national space policy released for public comment in November 2023, SNSat attempts to address earlier calls for a national space program that meets national needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differing narratives behind these efforts, however, demonstrate the disconnects among the major Chilean institutions involved in space activities and the limitations of a program housed in a branch of the armed services. In August 2023, the Ministry of Defense, FACh, and Senate of Chile hosted a conference on “national space sovereignty.” While this makes sense from a military standpoint, this was criticized by several Chilean experts interviewed because speaking of “sovereignty” is at odds with international space law, which Chilean diplomats have long promoted and which explicitly prohibits sovereignty claims in space. Rather than a concerted shift in policy, inconsistencies such as this reflect domestic divides between operational/military voices and diplomatic voices speaking independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utilization of FASat-Charlie is also telling. A recent article found that Chile’s National Forestry Corporation (CONAF) did not use images from Charlie during the 2019–21 wildfire seasons, as had earlier been reported. Conversations with experts pointed to a combination of issues, including limited awareness of actual distribution channels, military restrictions on access, and the lack of a governance system to facilitate wider use. For example, FASat-Charlie was procured under a now-defunct law that allocated revenues from copper mining to purchases of materiel. With the satellite classified as a weapons system, it was required to remain within military control. In addition, the initial absence of guidelines to determine satellite tasking priority and distribution protocols for nonmilitary users frustrated civilians requesting imagery from FACh’s Aerophotogrammetric Service (SAF). Compounded by required user fees for SAF-processed data products, which added to both costs and delays, Chileans “turned elsewhere” to meet their satellite imagery needs, according to a former SAF official. Many governmental and private users turned to international sources of data, which could at times be acquired more quickly and cheaply. For example, Copernicus Chile, an imagery hub at the University of Chile, provides private and public institutions with data from the European satellite system Copernicus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complicated landscape has shaped the approach to SNSat, which is built on a long-term ambition of increased technical autonomy, including access to assets that Chile does not develop independently. Before the June 2023 launch of FASat-Delta — the first microsatellite under SNSat — Chile celebrated the first successful download of images from a virtual constellation of 200 foreign satellites. Providing access to different data types (e.g., radar and multispectral images beyond the visible range), the arrangement provides continuity to FASat-Charlie while better serving nonmilitary applications such as scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, SNSat involves difficult trade-offs. In contrast to its predecessors, FASat-Delta is not operated by FACh but by its contractor, Israeli company ImageSat International. As co-owner, FACh has priority access to data from the satellite — but only through a service arrangement, rather than direct satellite tasking. Recent diplomatic tensions between Chile and Israel have raised concerns about potential impacts. In March 2024, President Gabriel Boric excluded Israel from participating in the International Air and Space Fair (FIDAE) in Santiago. This was consistent with the president’s criticisms of Israeli actions in Gaza, an issue that has drawn significant domestic attention in Chile, which has the largest Palestinian diaspora outside of the Middle East. Nevertheless, this move was widely criticized for risking the multidecadal alliance with Israel in the scientific and defense realm upon which Chile relies. “The government’s decision could leave Chile without its satellites, which is very serious from the point of view of controlling the country’s security,” said former officials in an interview. While the Chilean government confirmed that it had no intentions of severing relations, Israel pulled its military attaché from its embassy in Santiago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the diplomatic strife, FASat-Delta is already facing technical challenges. As of May 2024, 300 days after launch, Delta was not yet operational due to issues discovered during validation and testing. Furthermore, until a ground segment antenna is installed in Chilean territory, a required component for receiving signals from the satellite as it passes overhead, FACh will not be able to download images directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time being, the delay in operations will increase users’ real and perceived reliance on external capabilities, complicating efforts to sustain the long-term political and resource investment required to execute the full vision for SNSat. In this landscape, leveraging frameworks such as the domestic space council to coordinate the apparently divergent national space communities will be essential for generating stakeholder buy-in. If successful at integrating space-related decisions into a larger national discourse, Chile’s experience will be helpful for other Latin American countries navigating the delicate balance between autonomy and dependency in space capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sabia-mar-south-south-competition-and-cooperation&quot;&gt;SABIA-Mar: South-South Competition and Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Argentina and Brazil reflects broad waves of “advances and setbacks, comings and goings” as each country navigates its perceived regional and international standing and the dependencies of a shared border. Likewise, space is “a lagging (not leading) indicator of bilateral relations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of intense distrust over concerns that the other nation was developing nuclear weapons, Argentina and Brazil reached a landmark bilateral solution to the nuclear question that paved the way for other collaboration. In 1989, Argentina and Brazil (now both under civilian rule) issued a joint presidential declaration calling space cooperation a “multiplying factor” in sustainable development. In 1996, shortly after establishing their own civil space agencies, the parties signed a framework agreement that has been repeatedly expanded and still guides their overarching space cooperation. From early integration and testing of Argentina’s Science Application Satellites series in Brazilian facilities to the use of Argentinean industry components on Brazil’s first homegrown satellite, Amazonia-1, the partners’ increasingly complex technical cooperation efforts are now focused on a major shared priority: water. With Argentina’s CONAE marking over 30 years of “looking at Earth from space” and Brazil’s efforts to manage its strategic maritime territory known as the Blue Amazon, the ocean-focused effort is a “natural partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a state visit to Buenos Aires in 2008, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva issued a joint statement with Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner endorsing the satellite project and noting the “strategic” nature of the bilateral relationship. Having evolved from an initial concept in 1998 which was further fleshed out in subsequent agreements, the Satellite for Applications Based on Environmental Marine Information (SABIA-Mar) project kicked off with the goal of developing two identical satellites for ocean monitoring and mapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet each side did not make progress at the same rate. Significant resource constraints in Brazil were exacerbated by setbacks such as the delayed development of the Multi-Mission Platform (MMP), the satellite bus Brazil was to contribute to the project, and the 2013 failure of CBERS-3, a satellite in the joint program with China. To ensure the continuous flow of data, China and Brazil accelerated development of CBERS-4 by one year, drawing resources away from other projects. Thus, despite healthy relations between AEB and CONAE, Brazil had little to show for its part in SABIA-Mar a decade in, and its role in the project was uncertain. Tellingly, in the PNAE, Brazil’s 10-year space plan released in late 2021, SABIA-Mar was listed as a “proposed project” that could potentially use “spare parts” from another satellite. According to an expert then working at AEB, the agency conducted an internal review in 2021 on what had happened with the project and came up with options for consideration, including formal withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A combination of technical and political factors turned the tide in 2023. One of these was the success of Brazil’s first fully domestic satellite, Amazonia-1, which launched in 2021 and demonstrated the maturity of the MMP. On the political side, President Lula’s return to power in January 2023 overlapped with the end of President Alberto Fernández’s term (and consequently Fernández de Kirchner’s term as vice president), prompting a quick warming of relations. Intent on reengaging with allies after the “radical departure” of President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil hurried to strengthen ties through high-level engagements that included cooperation on science and space in advance of a similarly dramatic change in leadership in Argentina later that year. At last, with Brazil recommitting to its participation in the project, the partners are working to field two satellites: SABIA-Mar 1 will be fully developed by Argentina and SABIA-Mar 2 will be Brazil’s responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these encouraging steps, SABIA-Mar’s future is uncertain. Resource commitments are in no way a given in Brazil, which invested only about a third of the monies required to execute space activities envisioned in its previous 10-year plan. Now under President Javier Milei’s administration, Argentina has significantly slashed government spending as part of austerity measures and maintains a tense relationship with Brazil — making it uncertain whether Argentina’s satellite will complete development by the 2026 target launch date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008, during his speech in Buenos Aires, President Lula spoke of the bilateral alliance being “indispensable” to each country’s national goals and to the need to emphasize areas of agreement over the differences he acknowledged would always exist. Today’s tensions between Brazil’s and Argentina’s leaders increase the risk that these differences, while unlikely to threaten long-standing strategic interests, may overtake cooperative efforts, especially if problems arise that require diverting already limited resources. Analysts have pointed to the risks carried by recent visible, petty fights among Latin American leaders, noting that “multiple presidents fighting with each other as if they’re trying to win a reality show means that governing and cooperation do not occur.” While space is not going to play a leading role in the bilateral Argentina-Brazil relationship, the latest dispute between Presidents Milei and Lula could mean projects such as SABIA-Mar get caught in the crossfire as the relationship ebbs and flows over the coming years. Ultimately, if SABIA-Mar is successful, it will indeed be Latin America’s “most significant example of South–South cooperation,” not just because of complex technical demands but also due to the interplay of forces involved in maintaining this collaboration through the decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;latin-americas-esa&quot;&gt;Latin America’s ESA?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Latin American and Caribbean Space Agency (ALCE) was launched in Mexico City in 2021 at a session of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) presided by Mexico. Co-championed by Argentina, which has proposed a regional space entity in its national space plans since 2000, ALCE’s roots can be traced back to the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much has been written about Latin America’s expectations regarding the region’s long hoped-for counterpart to the European Space Agency (ESA), ALCE is just now on the cusp of beginning formal operations. Written into ALCE’s constitutive agreement is a requirement that at least 11 countries ratify it before it enters into force. Even as ALCE continues to garner signatories — 21 countries as of May 2024 — formal ratification has proven challenging. Reflecting on the challenges of clearing this “legal-diplomatic” hurdle, the Mexican representative to ALCE, Ambassador Gustavo Alonso Cabrera Rodríguez, lamented the confluence of institutional and political factors that has led to the significant delay. Speaking at FIDAE in April 2024, he wondered at the willingness of members to assign dedicated representatives, saying that without designated space institutions such issues default to the ministers of foreign relations and thus depend on “individual relationships.” This has meant that supporters have needed to actively promote the agency even among countries that have already committed to joining, making the formalization step lengthier and less certain. Nevertheless, with ratifications trickling in, reaching 10 as of May 2024, experts close to the effort confirmed that ALCE intends to launch formal operations by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues Cabrera Rodríguez raised regarding the formalization of the agreement ironically point to a problem ALCE is itself intended to resolve: the absence of an entry point for sustained regional cooperation. Not unique to the space realm, the lack of sustained political integration has been a persistent challenge for Latin America, which hosts over 30 regional organizations and forums, all with varying degrees of legitimacy. In contrast with Africa, which has rallied around the African Union as the most legitimate regional voice on several issues, Latin America has no such central representative body. Regional and subregional groups such as the Pacific Alliance and the Union of South American Nations wax and wane in relevance and tend not to represent the region’s views consistently or speak for all countries. CELAC itself was arguably created “as a counterweight to U.S. influence in the region,” an alternative to the Organization of American States (OAS), which includes both Canada and the United States. Similarly, while the idea of a regional space agency is old, there has not been consensus on its membership. Analysts have faulted “political grievances” for the decades-long delay in establishing ALCE and note Brazil’s absence — blamed on political differences — as a major weakness. Although Brazilian officials have spoken positively of ALCE, Brazil has not agreed to join on the basis that it was not a member of CELAC when it was negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important questions regarding how ALCE will finance its activities remain tied to the problem of sustaining domestic political support for it within member countries. As Cabrera Rodríguez said, it will be difficult to make investment in the agency attractive in a “scenario of scarcity or apparent scarcity.” Related challenges, such as the asymmetries of national space capabilities in the region, reflect a circular situation: ALCE may need to exist to create the necessary domestic support to sustain it. In some ways, it could help coordinate a space community with widely disconnected pockets of expertise, but only if national governments provide consistent support. ALCE is by nature a political effort and subject to the broader dynamics that have made regional integration a challenge — such as polarization and staunch support for sovereignty driven by a history of interventionism. There are already ideological differences that are reputedly preventing certain space nations, including Colombia and Ecuador, from joining ALCE. It is likely no accident that ALCE has been given a “coordinator role for regional space activities instead of a more political role.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interest ALCE has garnered from external partners is significant and only likely to increase as formal operations begin. The ESA and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, among other space agencies, have already proposed collaboration with ALCE. In addition, “China is very interested,” said Cabrera Rodríguez in April and again in May during the first China-CELAC space forum, in Wuhan. ALCE has also been welcomed to the new Ibero-American Network of Aerospace Agencies, which is coordinated by the Organization of Ibero-American States and includes the Portuguese Space Agency. These nods of recognition, along with the persistent need for more stable institutions handling space topics, may continue to help boost the effort. ALCE is not Latin America’s ESA — but it could fill at least some of the need for integration on space issues in a region fraught with fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples serve as a reminder that space activities do not exist in isolation. Chile’s experiences with FASat and SNSat demonstrate how domestic constraints can create international positions and relationships that do not necessarily result from a determined foreign policy direction. SABIA-Mar shows an alternate scenario, wherein a project supported by a stable relationship at the institutional level is alternately buffeted and aided by higher-order shifts between the country’s leaders. Finally, the journey to an operational regional space agency, ALCE, reflects Latin America’s tortuous relationship with political integration even as it opens new avenues of external engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With space activities thus naturally rooted in domestic and regional realities, the analysis of Latin American international space engagement benefits greatly from looking beyond great power politics. Overall, Latin American countries have many options to meet their space technology and application needs, and a mix of factors (e.g., eager partners, competing domestic stakeholders, and foreign policy strategies such as hedging) will continue to be reflected in space alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter for the United States? U.S. national space policy highlights the need to expand the country’s space alliances. The bipartisan objectives articulated in the 2020 National Space Policy, the 2021 U.S. Space Priorities Framework, and the 2022 National Security Strategy include diversifying strategic partnerships with emerging and middle space powers and strengthening global governance of space activities in line with U.S. principles. But the United States should change the way it approaches these issues with potential new partners. It cannot be guided solely on the assumption that geopolitical imperatives drive Latin American space partnerships, rendering space as just a way for nations to pick sides in the U.S.-China rivalry. The United States needs to recognize that the complex space alliances prevalent in Latin America are not simply a function of its own actions but a reflection of the interplay of numerous countries’ domestic and foreign policy drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this, U.S. space engagement in the region should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonstrate a whole-of-government approach to bilateral engagement across Latin America.&lt;/strong&gt; Due to impermanent roles surrounding space, a single, national point of contact often does not exist among Latin American actors. Coupled with patchwork institutional frameworks that exacerbate gaps among the communities involved in space, U.S. partners may find that there are many different, even contradictory positions on space issues and that no single decisionmaker is able to drive forward an effort. Moreover, there is a proliferation of dual-use programs that serve both civil and defense needs, reflecting the already blurred lines between civil, defense, and commercial space efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, U.S. engagement with its Latin American counterparts tends to be siloed — with civil space visits on the one hand and military-only discussions on the other, even while both seek expanded collaboration. In nations such as Chile that lack a civil space agency comparable to NASA and that are pursuing dual-use programs involving civil and defense entities, limiting conversations to U.S. civil space agencies or to U.S. defense agencies is risky. This severely limits the effectiveness of relationship-building efforts intended to develop shared understanding on space issues and ultimately advance common priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The somewhat fractured nature of some of the space communities in Latin America should not deter U.S. engagement but instead invite an integrated whole-of-government approach, as called for in the U.S. Strategic Framework for Space Diplomacy. The United States should build on existing successes — such as the Space Force’s bilateral data-sharing agreements on space situational awareness, as well as civil space agencies’ leadership in the regional Earth observation collaboration framework, AmeriGEO — to better integrate space issues into its broader relations with regional partners. This engagement could be modeled after the comprehensive dialogues the United States has held on space with important allies such as France and Japan. Even if it is not appropriate to elevate certain Latin American relationships to that level, this approach could inform engagement with key security partners such as Colombia or economic partners such as Mexico and Chile. In addition to facilitating collaboration across the U.S. agencies already engaged in Latin America, this would enable the United States to contribute subject-matter expertise and resources from across the government, modeling the kind of effective institutional coordination that strengthens the U.S. space program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand engagement to other multilateral settings, even ones not dedicated to space.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should better leverage other regional forums and venues, such as the OAS and the Summit of the Americas, to create sustained engagement on space topics. Knowing that the opportunities and risks associated with space technology are not widely recognized across the different decisionmaking communities in Latin America, U.S. decisionmakers should not assume that space capabilities are being leveraged or even considered as part of collective efforts on issues such as cybersecurity, public health, or food insecurity. More consistent integration of space-related applications by U.S. agencies involved in these efforts can help foster important stakeholder connections on the Latin American side, drawing leaders’ attention to space and benefiting even communities with few or no dedicated space institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A more intentional engagement strategy that takes space discussions beyond the usual venues also presents an opportunity to counter China’s extensive reach in formal and informal regional forums. For instance, China’s engagement with CELAC, an organization it prefers because it excludes the United States, includes a space element. The recently expanded BRICS alliance, which evolved from an economic-oriented grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa into a larger political and economic forum, has also gained relevance in the space domain. From coordination projects such as the BRICS Joint Committee on Space Cooperation, which was announced in 2021 and is intended to enable satellite data sharing, to statements on space sustainability and space security in the 2024 BRICS declaration, it is clear that members see the alliance as a legitimate forum to align on space issues. To enhance coordination and collaboration with like-minded Latin American space nations, the United States should adopt a more agile engagement strategy that consistently includes space on the regional agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand collaboration on national space governance topics.&lt;/strong&gt; Since security considerations mean technology transfer arrangements may not be on the table for U.S.–Latin America collaboration, the United States should expand efforts in other substantive areas informed by the unique dynamics of the region. This should include national governance — the combination of policy, law, and regulation, supported by institutional frameworks — of space activities. The inconsistencies and misalignments referenced in this report sometimes result from gaps in these areas and threaten both the successful implementation of national programs and efforts to elevate space in the list of priorities. Licensing regimes for commercial space efforts, the development of mechanisms for regular engagement with nongovernment actors, and research-to-operations strategies that enhance adoption of government-funded science are among the many governance topics ripe for bilateral and multilateral dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The United States can draw on its experience with Latin American nations but also involve partners such as Canada to share perspectives on adopting governance models tailored to a different government structure and that seek different goals. These topics — while not as headline-worthy as joint hardware development projects — are a natural extension of the region’s substantial support for important U.S.-led space-governance efforts such as the Artemis Accords. In elaborating on how such principles are put into practice in a way that can account for the unique challenges of countries in the region, such collaboration could help advance national governance in Latin America, thereby advancing space development.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International space engagement in Latin America is not about apolitical calculations driven by technological needs, nor does it represent just another front in the U.S.-China great power rivalry. It is instead a landscape where complex domestic and foreign policy factors interact to both motivate and constrain the choices Latin American countries make about space activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges at hand for the space programs in Latin America do not correspond simply to a lack of funding or technical know-how. Ultimately, for space activities to help advance national priorities, they should be rooted in the domestic and international policy strategies of each nation. To be a strong ally and meet its own strategic objectives in space and in Latin America, the United States should shift how it approaches its regional space engagement. The considerations and recommendations in this brief can inform enhanced strategic partnerships, including cooperation on new areas such as developing institutional frameworks and bringing space discussions outside of traditional space forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Latin American space landscape is complex, but it is one that potential partners in the United States can navigate. As a leading regional expert argued recently, among the advantages the region presents for the United States is that it is both “far” from global conflicts and “near” U.S. markets. Space collaboration presents a valuable opportunity to bring the United States and Latin American partners closer — contributing to relationships that are stronger, more strategic, and better positioned to address the shared challenges of today and tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the main thrust of Russia’s anticipated summer offensive underway, it is an opportune moment to take stock of the significant and underappreciated changes that have taken hold in Moscow’s approach to cyber operations in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much Western analysis to date has fixated on Russia’s highly visible opening cyber offensive, the merits of its approach, and the potential for a renewed destructive campaign of a similar nature against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. This focus is misplaced, however, and has anchored Western understanding of the war’s cyber dimensions to Russia’s countervalue strategy to amass societal pressure via the widespread sabotage of computer networks – an approach that has not seen primacy since the invasion’s first year when assumptions about a short war still guided Russia’s theory of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harsher reality is that Russia’s intelligence services have adapted their posture in cyberspace to the demands of a long war. Mounting evidence, stretching back to the months preceding Ukraine’s counteroffensive in 2023, indicates that multiple Russian cyber units have shifted their sights away from strategic civilian targets toward soldiers’ computers and mobiles endpoints in order to enable tactical military objectives on Ukraine’s frontlines. This change in operational focus has been cross-cutting, with Russian military intelligence (GRU) and the domestic security service (FSB) – long renowned for rivalry and mistrust – unifying their earlier disjointed cyber efforts and systematising a series of tradecraft adaptations intended to increase their military effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a relative shift in priorities rather than a complete overhaul of Russia’s wider strategy. There remain patterns of operational activity indicative of sustained interest in Ukrainian critical infrastructure objects that would hold no immediate intelligence value, and therefore likely represent preparations for future sabotage. What is clear, however, is that Moscow has rebalanced its overarching concept of operations to emphasise targets that can provide more direct and tangible battlefield advantages to its conventional forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These adjustments are not solely a reflection of Russia’s scaled-down ambitions in Ukraine, nor how its wider perception of Kyiv’s centre of gravity have changed over the past two years as the conflict intensified into a war of attrition. They are also an important signal of how Russia’s intelligence services have adapted their thinking about how to optimally integrate cyber and conventional capabilities after two years of high-intensity engagement, and what the coming months may bring as Russia makes a new push in eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-tactical-pivot&quot;&gt;Russia’s Tactical Pivot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refocusing of Russia’s cyber campaign to meet what is almost certainly an increasing demand for tactical-relevant signals intelligence (SIGINT) has largely fallen into a few main lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond targeted efforts to gain access to devices and systems used by Ukrainian soldiers, Russia has also reoriented its cyber forces to help locate Ukrainian military equipment and positions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first has been penetrating devices used by Ukrainian soldiers at the front. Not only has Kyiv’s emphasis on “data-driven combat” made smartphones an invaluable source of location data to establish patterns of movement and locate and target Ukrainian positions, but the military’s dependence on free encrypted messaging applications (EMAs), such as Signal for secure operational communication, has made the ability to eavesdrop on these devices of paramount importance for both the GRU and the FSB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Moscow is that collecting these types of signals is not a trivial feat at scale. The cryptographic protocols used by popular EMAs have withstood rigorous public scrutiny, and it is unlikely Russia’s services are capable of quietly breaking them. Phones at the front are also unlikely to be connected to mobile networks where geolocation and other signals can be reliably collected upstream through compromised telecommunications infrastructure or by electronic warfare capabilities. This has driven the intelligence services to adopt a few operational concepts to fill this critical collection gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One method has been conventional attempts at full-device compromise using malware, more often than not, disguised as applications used by the Ukrainian military. While this tradecraft is not altogether new – the GRU first altered a Ukrainian app to geolocate artillery units in 2016 – the masking of malware as versions of mobile applications has increased significantly in response to Kyiv’s suite of software-driven military innovations. These operations have generally relied on highly tailored social engineering, repurposing legitimate military communications, and directly interacting with targets over Signal and Telegram chats to build rapport before delivering the malicious applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other more novel method has been to siphon messages through the device-linking feature built into common EMAs. One Russian military-affiliated unit has dedicated its focus to social engineering Ukrainian soldiers into linking Russian-intelligence controlled instances of EMAs including Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp to their accounts. Similarly focused FSB operations have centred on exploiting systems already linked to Ukrainian soldiers’ phones. According to Microsoft, cyber operators linked to Center 16, the FSB’s main SIGINT unit, have shown a specific interest in stealing files containing messages from the Signal Desktop application, providing them access to the target’s private Signal conversations and attachments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the GRU is also engaged in the close-access exploitation of mobile devices and other systems captured by Russian forces on the battlefield to achieve similar access. Here, cyber operators have begun to technically enable their counterparts within the Russian military to independently initiate the collection of intelligence from Ukrainian devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the author’s Mandiant research has highlighted how the GRU’s Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST), commonly known as APT44 or Sandworm, has provided dedicated infrastructure and technical instructions to Russian ground forces so that they can exfiltrate Telegram and Signal communications from captured devices at the front. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has similarly reported on Sandworm using captured devices as a foothold to deliver malware known as Infamous Chisel to penetrate military networks and gather data on connected Starlink terminals and the suite of specialised applications used by the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major line of effort has been to penetrate the digital systems used by the Ukrainian army for command and control, situational awareness and other operational needs. It is no secret that digitised battlefield management systems like Delta and Kropyva have been a critical enabler of information and combat advantages for the Ukrainian army. In fact, Moscow has perceived these systems to be so effective that it has undertaken efforts to develop exact replicas for the Russian military. Unlike attempts to deliver malware disguised as these applications to compromise endpoints, this category of operations has instead focused on tricking soldiers to give up their credentials, providing Russia’s services a surreptitious lens into Kyiv’s common operational picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond targeted efforts to gain access to devices and systems used by Ukrainian soldiers, Russia has also reoriented its cyber forces to help locate Ukrainian military equipment and positions. The SBU has warned of Russian efforts to control compromised webcams in population centres to locate Ukrainian air defences and other critical infrastructure objects and feed targeting data into its reconnaissance-strike complex. Dutch military intelligence has similarly alerted publics to the overall refocusing of Russia’s cyber campaign, highlighting operations designed to locate and map military positions and equipment for later physical seizure. Those providing assistance to Ukraine should factor in the potential risks of this cyber-enabled surveillance activity, as the intensifying campaign of sabotage across Europe strongly indicates that insight into Western military supply chains is a clear collection priority for Russia’s intelligence services at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, each of these new operational concepts point to a deepening two-way relationship between Russian cyber and conventional forces, and the extension of their early coordination efforts to now encompass both strategic and tactical objectives. What’s more, they signal that for specific operations, Russian cyber elements have likely also moved closer to the front to capitalise on the short-lived tactical intelligence that these mobile devices might provide. Looking forward, it is reasonable to expect further adaptations and operational concepts to arise from this closer relationship as the war continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-ukraine-and-nato&quot;&gt;Implications For Ukraine and NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main takeaway for Western policymakers is that mobile devices have become a critical centre of gravity for Russia’s cyber campaign in Ukraine. The war’s technology-dense and sensor-rich frontlines have placed a premium on the ability to collect signals from soldiers’ devices and the digital networks that connect them. With new technologies continuing to shape the battlefield and drive tactical innovations on the front lines, these types of operations are only likely to grow more common as the war continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s impressive defensive feats aside, Russia’s adapted force employment demands renewed attention on how to best sustain international support for Ukraine’s cyber defences&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is important to recognise is that this is a fundamentally different technology environment where earlier lessons about the capacity of governments and the private sector to support Ukrainian cyber defences are less likely to hold. Visibility into sensitive military networks and mobile devices is much more opaque, virtual incident response is more difficult, and fewer defensive partners are likely to have capabilities readied for this type of security assistance. Ukraine’s impressive defensive feats aside, Russia’s adapted force employment demands renewed attention on how to best sustain international support for Ukraine’s cyber defences. This is especially important now that other emerging threats are increasingly consuming limited intelligence resources and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally as important, we must begin to acknowledge that the second-order consequences of these espionage operations can be grave. Take, for example, the lethal strike on Ukraine’s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade in November 2023 that was traced back to the penetration of a soldier’s Signal account. At a time when conventional wisdom has grown dismissive about the military benefit that cyber operations have afforded Russia, it is important that we carefully consider the implications of this mission realignment and what it portends about cyber’s expanding role in kinetic, conventional operations now that attrition is the key element of Russia’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malicious linked devices will continue to provide intercepts even when phones are disconnected, destroyed or otherwise inactive, as Signal messages do not need to route through the target’s phone to be delivered to a linked device. Communications will therefore still reach Russian operators even when they will not necessarily reach the intended Ukrainian recipient. As one Ukrainian expert puts it, if “a soldier from a battalion group gets captured or dies, his phone falls into the hands of the enemy, and the Russians read all the correspondence in this group for another month”. The long-tail impact of these operations can be severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should also be prepared for Russia’s new operational concepts to proliferate outside of Ukraine. Today, Signal and other EMAs have become standard practice for sensitive communications. These applications see ubiquitous use by Western militaries, politicians, civil-society groups, and other common targets of Russia’s intelligence services. Russia’s war-focused tactics could therefore reasonably see wider use to fulfil other urgent intelligence requirements, such as the collection of foreign political intelligence from Ukraine’s partners, or in potential efforts to influence one of the many consequential Western elections on the horizon. If history has taught us anything, it’s that Russian tradecraft rarely stays confined to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Sir Keir Starmer’s cabinet sets about establishing what Labour policies mean in government for the first time in more than 14 years, his ministers will find there are some issues that will prove as thorny in government as they did in opposition. When it comes to foreign policy, one such example would be the Middle East; and when it comes to the Middle East, one such example would be Israel and the Palestinians. Israel’s war on Gaza has gone on for more than nine months, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, with the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, stating that civilians in Gaza are being pushed into, “ever deeper circles of hell”, due to the ensuing humanitarian situation arising from the Israeli campaign. On 7 July, David Lammy, the UK’s new foreign secretary, said that the UK seeks a “balanced position” on the current situation. How might that look on Israel–Gaza, and Israel–Palestine more generally?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-and-the-israeli-palestinian-conflict&quot;&gt;The UK and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last Conservative period of government, from 2010 until this year, relations between Israel and the UK reached an apex of support signified by a 2030 roadmap agreement signed in 2023, establishing widespread cooperation in a variety of fields. At the same time, the British government’s official position on Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories remained transparent; repeated declarations by London indicated its view that international law considered East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank to be occupied territory, and settlements therein illegal. (Indeed, a Conservative minister of state, Alan Duncan, spoke at RUSI in 2014 to make this point quite clear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last year has been a challenging one for British interests in the region; the 7 October attack on Israel, followed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, raised the threat of regional conflict, be it between Israel and Iran, Israel and Lebanon, as well as other theatres. As this author has mentioned with regard to Europe in another brief: a stable wider Arab world is in the UK’s ultimate interest; a wider Arab world and Middle East region in turmoil is precisely the opposite. Indeed, due to British interests being affected, the UK committed the use of force in the Red Sea against the Houthis, as a result of the latter’s escalation on international shipping lanes in the Red Sea – an escalation that would not have taken place had the war in Gaza been averted, or a ceasefire come to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, London’s diplomatic capital internationally is being impacted by the perception that the UK’s commitment to the “rules-based order” is not as absolute as it proclaims, because of the assessment that the UK has been lacking in balance vis-à-vis Israel–Palestine. As one G7 diplomat told the Financial Times months ago, “What we said about Ukraine has to apply to Gaza. Otherwise we lose all our credibility”. The UK stands in need of more, not less such diplomatic capital, with all the challenges on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immediate-future-aid-and-arms-sales&quot;&gt;Immediate Future: Aid and Arms Sales&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate future, the restoration of UK funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), announced by the Foreign Secretary on Friday 19 July, is a welcome step that ought to be followed up by British moves to improve aid transfers to the Palestinian occupied territories. Criticisms by the former Conservative government about the difficulty to get aid into Gaza due to Israeli obstacles remain valid; restoration of support to UNRWA is necessary to reduce the humanitarian crisis, but there remain other difficulties to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another near-term topic that is likely to come up again quite soon is that of arms sales to Israel by the UK. While it is true that such arms sales represent a small proportion of arms transfers to Israel, as the former foreign secretary Lord Cameron pointed out, such a point is immaterial to HMG’s legal obligations. Under the UK’s strategic export licensing criteria (SELC), London is required to prevent the transfer of military equipment where there is a clear or overriding risk that such equipment might be used to facilitate a serious violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While London is not in the business of telling the Israeli population how to vote, the British government should make clear to its ally what its own values are&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 130 parliamentarians in the last parliament argued this was already the case, joining many different human rights and aid organisations. Crucially, the Foreign Affairs Committee chair in the last parliament, Alicia Kearns, repeatedly raised the issue of whether or not export licence applications for Israel have been referred to ministers over the past year. If the UK were to take the step of suspending or restricting such export licences, they would be joining a number of their allies; Belgium, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, Italy, and Spain have already done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it may be that HMG legal advice has already recommended such a step. When in opposition, Foreign Secretary Lammy criticised the then Conservative-led government for not publishing the legal advice provided; it would be prudent for him to do so now, in order to show that a page has been turned in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the short-term decisions, this is perhaps the most difficult, because it would place the UK in a place different from its close allies in the US, France and Germany. Simultaneously, it is important to note that previous British governments, including those of David Cameron, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, and Margaret Thatcher, all suspended arms sales to Israel on different occasions – the precedent has already been set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;medium-term-the-icc-and-palestine-recognition&quot;&gt;Medium Term: the ICC and Palestine Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the medium term, there are two critical areas that are likely to be raised. The first relates to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the ICC prosecutor general, Karim Khan. Prominent US Republican politicians, including the newly announced candidate for the US vice-presidency, J D Vance, have called for sanctions against and an investigation into Khan, as a result of the latter’s calling for arrest warrants against Israeli officials. The Biden administration has also confirmed it wants to work with Congress to penalise the ICC. As a signatory of the Rome Statute that established the ICC, in addition to the fact that Khan is a British citizen, the UK ought to vigorously defend the ICC and the prosecutor general. London’s discreet challenge against ICC jurisdiction over Israeli officials, lodged in the last weeks of the last government, should be withdrawn; its continuation, particularly given the weak legal basis and existing challenges against the ICC, would be viewed as lacklustre support for the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second medium-term issue pertains to immediate recognition of the State of Palestine, which was, until relatively recently, a Labour policy. Labour has now changed that policy to indicate that recognition will happen as part of a peace process, rather than at the conclusion of that process, and that Labour was committed to such recognition. The reluctance to immediately recognise the State of Palestine is primarily due to a desire to avoid a rift with US President Joe Biden, which is understandable given London’s overarching security architecture. But it is not a foregone conclusion that London’s recognition would create a rift of any consequence with Washington DC. A total of 144 of the 193 member states of the UN already recognise the State of Palestine, including a majority of European states – their relations with Washington DC have been unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is: given the option of recognition, should the UK still resist it? British recognition of a Palestinian state would not immediately bring one into existence, so one could argue it is merely symbolic, and hardly consequential. The opposing argument is that recognition by the UK is qualitatively different than many other countries, given London’s historic role in the Israel–Palestine question. When Norway recognised a Palestinian state earlier this year, it was essentially stating that Oslo no longer believed in the Oslo Peace Process. The more such political messages are sent, the more pressure there is for a political process to be reinvigorated, rather than the continuation of an unstable status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-term-uk-political-convergence-and-divergence-on-israelpalestine&quot;&gt;Long term: UK Political Convergence and Divergence on Israel–Palestine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are longer term issues that the UK will have to address. The developing nature of the Israeli political spectrum has seen over the past decade a widening and mainstreaming of the Israeli far-right, with not only attitudes hardening on the margins, but in the centre. The latest such example was the near-entirety of the Israeli Knesset voted against Palestinian statehood, and thus the two-state solution itself, on the 18th of July; a political settlement that the international community, including the UK, has rallied behind for decades. Extreme radical views are expressed not only by members of far-right political parties, but also within traditionally centre-right ones, such as Likud. While London is not in the business of telling the Israeli population how to vote, the British government should make clear to its ally what its own values are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;London should consider re-evaluating the 2030 roadmap agreement that was signed with Israel in 2023&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, the sanctions regime that the UK FCDO has, and which it instituted against two extremist groups in Israel in May, should be widened. The settlement movement in the West Bank has not been infiltrated by extremist elements that need to be isolated; rather, the settlement movement is in itself an illegal enterprise, supported by the Israeli government and military. British courts, British politicians and the British government have made it abundantly clear on numerous occasions that East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza are all occupied territories, and that the occupying power is the State of Israel. HMG policy should make it clear that settlement activity writ large ought to result in sanctions. Moreover, as the ICC and International Court of Justice (ICJ) investigations continue, it is likely that there will be Israeli, as well as Hamas figures, that are sanctioned or the subject of arrest warrants. London should prepare for this, as it is likely that highly senior figures in the Israeli government will be affected, and London ought to make it clear that it upholds the independence of both the ICC and the ICJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;London already has a strongly effective system of restrictions and sanctions with regard to Hamas and support for terrorism, via legal and political measures, and little more seems necessary in that regard. However, in coordination with particularly European allies, which has substantial leverage with regard to the Palestinian Authority owing to existing EU aid packages, the UK should focus on “more for more”; not by threatening a withdrawal of aid, particularly at a time of tremendous suffering, but by proposing increased access to European and British markets for Palestinian trade, in exchange for improvements in governance by Palestinian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the ongoing widespread concerns around violations of international humanitarian law, London should furthermore consider re-evaluating the 2030 roadmap agreement that was signed with Israel in 2023. That agreement has significant impact on bilateral relations on military support and trade, among a wide variety of other fields. Given that Israel is currently in the dock at the ICJ for genocide charges, a suspension of the agreement until the outcome of the case at least, would seem prudent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the UK, while remaining aware and humble about its ability to directly impact the situation on the ground, should nonetheless recognise its tremendous indirect leveraging power. The UK enjoys a privileged relationship with the US, which has the most direct consequential impact on the Israel–Palestine question. London also has extensive and deep contacts with Arab states that are extremely important with regard to the conflict, particularly Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE. If the US were to use the leverage it has over the Israelis, and Arab states were to simultaneously use their leverage over the Palestinians, the prospects for a genuine and sustainable peace settlement in Israel–Palestine would be far easier to materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been ongoing for decades, and it is tempting to see it as an unsolvable foreign policy issue. But such defeatist thinking led to the political dynamic that eventually led to the terrible events of 7 October, and sent the region into a deeply dangerous spiral of escalation and violence. UK national security interests stipulate that London further prospects for a wider peace in the region, if only to hold back the possibility of wider escalation of violence, and corresponding impacts on British interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of China’s entry into the UN, Foreign Minister Wang Yi boasted of China’s peacekeeping efforts, highlighting that the country had fulfilled its pledge to establish an 8,000-member standby peacekeeping force, participated in 29 former and ongoing peacekeeping operations, and contributed more than 50,000 personnel. Wang declared, “China has met its responsibilities for upholding world peace. Over the past 50 years, China has taken the side of fairness, upholding equality and opposing interference in other countries’ internal affairs, power politics and hegemonism”. He emphasised that China’s active involvement was a major departure from its longstanding policy of not participating in UN peacekeeping missions, which – from Beijing’s point of view –strategists and policymakers had underappreciated for too many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By most accounts, the international community widely appreciates China’s growing contribution due to the unprecedented demand for UN peacekeeping. Today’s peacekeeping missions are increasingly complex in terms of the scale and scope of their mandates. However, China’s expanding role in peace operations highlights its growing prominence within the UN. This development directly challenges the US’s strategic influence and its broader role as leader of the rules-based international order. It is essential to recognise that peacekeeping, stabilisation and large-scale combat operations are not mutually exclusive. Instead, peace operations should be viewed through the lens of strategic competition which the US government can use to its advantage while assisting populations in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 24 years, China has significantly expanded its participation in UN peacekeeping missions. In 2000, the country provided fewer than 100 personnel to all peace operations. Now, Beijing is the 10th largest troop and police contributor (2,274 personnel) of any country and the second largest financial supporter, providing nearly 19% of UN peacekeeping programme funding (see Figure 1). Moreover, China provides more peacekeepers to UN operations than all the other UN Security Council permanent members combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2O3pPR9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Chinese Troop and Police Contributions to UN Missions, 2000–2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these contributions may appear positive for the overall UN peacekeeping agenda, China – like other countries – is motivated out of self-interest to advance its foreign policy objectives. Strong participation in UN peace operations is an ideal way for China to gain on-the-ground operational experience abroad, build multilateral cooperation, improve bilateral relations and advance a positive image domestically and worldwide. Also, China’s peacekeeping efforts appear to match its resource investments and economic interests, particularly in Africa, where more than three-quarters of Chinese nationals on UN missions are deployed. Beijing has progressively linked these deployments to protecting its interests and citizens on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other significant factors may influence China’s peacekeeping activities apart from its economic interests, as suggested by data collected from 2012–2018 by Lucy Best. While China has disproportionately deployed peacekeepers in areas where it has commercial interests, investment levels do not necessarily lead to increased personnel counts. This implies that other factors could be at play in China’s decision to participate in peacekeeping missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its growing troop and financial commitments, China established its Peacekeeping Affairs Centre in 2018 to coordinate international cooperation and manage its UN peacekeeping troop deployments, and is actively involved in leading peace training workshops and seminars. Through these efforts, China is gradually pressing for normative changes in UN peacekeeping that align with its more technocratic and state-centric vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, China has been seeking to secure senior political and military peacekeeping leadership posts in the UN Department of Peace Operations (UNDPO), and it is alleged that Beijing wishes to supplant France as the head of the department – a position French diplomats have filled since 1966. To this end, China is building its depth of qualified personnel, as 13 of its military officers have held top UN operational peacekeeping positions, serving either as a force commander, deputy force commander, sector commander or deputy sector commander. If the assertions about Beijing’s ambitions prove correct, China could over time gain the experience and access needed to prioritise its interests to the detriment of US foreign policy objectives and Western peacekeeping norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strong participation in UN peace operations is an ideal way for China to gain on-the-ground operational experience abroad&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, Beijing distributed a short English-language promotional film on its Ministry of National Defense website (and on YouTube) called “Here I Am”, depicting its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as a benevolent force that upholds justice and peace. The two-minute video combines live footage and animation highlighting the country’s military achievements in UN peacekeeping. While the video’s declarations may seem farfetched to some, it is undoubtedly good publicity. Chinese media and government officials portray these deployments as a positive investment in the country’s promise to support multilateral peace and stability missions. According to Courtney J Fung, China is seen by the UN community and beyond “as a committed peacekeeping state, one that recognises the value of peacekeeping for the UN and for its own discrete foreign policy goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-us-peacekeeping-efforts--are-they-enough&quot;&gt;Current US Peacekeeping Efforts – Are They Enough?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its inaugural mission in 1948, the US has consistently been the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping efforts. Despite maintaining its position as the top funder, the US ranks 84th out of 123 contributing countries regarding the number of peacekeeping personnel deployed. With only 24 peacekeepers participating across seven missions, the US troop and police contributions to UN peacekeeping operations have gradually decreased since 2000 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factors that have contributed to this decline include US military obligations in Afghanistan and Iraq, policy shifts in response to significant geopolitical events, and the domestic political environment. In addition to its financial and troop commitments, the US provides training and equipment to assist partner countries in developing key enabling capabilities to train and sustain peacekeeping proficiencies through efforts such as the US State Department-led Global Peace Operations Initiative and the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership. With a total budget of more than $1.4 billion between fiscal years 2005–2022, these programmes provide a critical funding activity to prevent personnel readiness shortfalls in UN peace operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: US Troop and Police Contributions to UN Missions, 2000–2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, at the Leaders’ Summit on Peacekeeping, President Barack Obama committed to expanding support for UN peace missions. He issued new presidential guidance, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We’ll work to double the number of US military officers serving in peacekeeping operations. We will offer logistical support, including our unrivaled network of air- and sea-lift. When there’s an urgent need…we’ll undertake engineering projects like building airfields and base camps for new missions. And we’ll step up our efforts to help build the UN’s capacity…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit was deemed a success, with 31 member states, including the US, committing to contribute over 40,000 troops and police, along with helicopters, engineering and naval units, and field hospitals. However, in the years that followed, the US’s commitment to enhancing UN peacekeeping operations seemed fleeting. Several initiatives have since stalled or been scaled down due to shifting US national security priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent China from dominating UN peacekeeping and achieving its objectives in this mission space, the US should develop and implement several actions now to reassert its leadership role in authorising and shaping peace operations, limit Chinese influence, and demonstrate that it is fully invested in bringing peace, security and stability to challenged regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, the US should support building a bench of qualified military personnel to serve in senior UN billets as proposed in a 2021 Institute for National Strategic Studies report by Bryce Loidolt. Presently, UN headquarters and peace operations deployments are not viewed by the US military services as career-enhancing assignments. However, this attitude may change if senior officers are regularly nominated and selected to serve in key UN peacekeeping staff billets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to filling UN peace mission mid-level general staff positions, the US should actively seek to fill key operational-level leadership positions such as Chief of Staff or Command Group Advisor. This would be an ideal way to make UN officer assignments more attractive within the US military and to demonstrate to all member states that the US has the requisite experience to compete for senior positions within UNDPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high-impact, low-cost initiative would be to appropriately staff and fund the US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI). The institute serves as the military lead agent for joint advocacy of peace and stability operations. Additionally, PKSOI develops concepts, doctrine and training to ensure the US joint force, interagency and allies/partners have the requisite expertise to plan and execute peacekeeping and stability operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, PKSOI actively participates with the UN on doctrine and concept development, ensuring that US values and peacekeeping norms are upheld. In a 2018 cost-cutting move, the Army decided to decrease PKSOI’s staff and budget dramatically. Restoring PKSOI’s staff and funding to pre-2018 levels (42 billets for $3 million per year) would go a long way in expanding its doctrinal reach inside the UN and signal to the military departments, interagency and the international community that the US values peacekeeping operations and understands that they are a critical conflict management tool, particularly in an era of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US rarely makes public pronouncements or consistently touts its longstanding support for UN peacekeeping. So, the US government should develop a comprehensive and active engagement plan to communicate all the ways in which it contributes to UN peacekeeping operations. For example, the US Military Observer Group – the Department of Defense’s focal point for military members serving in the UN – does not have a social media presence, and the State Department has few articles announcing its achievements in support of UN peacekeeping. Frequently broadcasting these milestones on US government social media accounts and public-facing webpages would be a low-cost strategic investment that would enable the US to enhance its image and effectively use peacekeeping as a tool to advance its key foreign policy objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, formally published US peacekeeping themes and messages may encourage Combatant Commanders to develop complementary talking points in order to foster better relations and increase US credibility on the issue when they engage in bilateral discussions with major UN peacekeeping troop-contributing countries. The preponderance of these large troop contributors are in the Indo-Pacific and Africa – two strategically important regions to US security interests. Better messaging would assist in emphasising the importance of upholding Western-backed peacekeeping norms – protecting civilians, monitoring and preventing human rights violations, and pursuing governance and security sector reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While increasing US participation and visibility in UN peacekeeping operations offers benefits, it also entail risks. The US possesses substantial military capability and capacity, but these resources are finite and subject to ever-evolving foreign policy priorities. Despite these challenges, the US should capitalise on its contributions to UN peacekeeping by fostering relationships and securing access. This strategic approach would help to counter China’s influence, safeguard national security and advance the US’s foreign policy goals, ultimately enhancing its competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original concept of operations for the Ukrainian offensive was sound. It required 12 armoured and mechanised brigades to achieve a breakthrough along 30 km of frontage, the isolation of Tokmak within seven days, and thereafter a breakout south towards Melitopol. Tempo was supposed to prevent Russia from bringing the majority of its forces to bear, so that the attacking force would need to overcome only six regiments in defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of operation was not implemented. This arose from operational errors made by both Ukraine and its international partners. Ukraine’s international partners missed two critical decision points prior to the offensive. First, whereas Russia began to transition to a war economy from May 2022 and began the mobilisation of troops from the autumn, Ukraine’s international partners did not take significant steps to address their industrial limitations. In consequence, while many nations gifted Ukraine a significant proportion of their national stocks, this did not amount to a sufficient volume of equipment to provide the doctrinal minimum of critical enablers required for the concept of operation to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second decision point missed was when that equipment needed to arrive in Ukraine. Ukraine’s international partners wasted four months in deciding to act, so that only a part of the pledged equipment arrived in Ukraine prior to the offensive, and the Ukrainian brigades did not have enough time to train on the equipment that did arrive. The brigades were, therefore, undertrained at the start of the offensive, which accounts for a significant proportion of the tactical mistakes made during the execution of the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also made a series of errors. First, experienced troops were used to hold the line of contact and thereafter conduct fixing operations during the offensive, while the main force was for the most part newly raised. This left the lead elements with a dearth of combat experience, which led to tactical errors during the execution of the operation. Second, Ukrainian planners exacerbated their shortage of properly equipped forces by committing troops on multiple axes, which were then further resourced with ammunition and enablers, at the expense of the main effort. The combination of these two errors limited the ability of the force to operate at and maintain tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most serious error made in planning by Ukraine appears to have been the basis on which it was determined that the main effort could succeed under these circumstances. Rather than using tempo and concentration to defeat six Russian regiments, it was hoped that shock action would cause Russian troops to break, as had occurred around Kharkiv in 2022. Insufficient planning was done to assess how the critical conditions for such a collapse in morale could be achieved, so that this proved an overly optimistic planning assumption. In the event, the initial attacks failed, and tempo was lost, such that Russia could fight the battle with the full 105,000 troops it had in the target sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesson for both Ukraine and its international partners is that operational security was inadequate, such that Russia knew precisely where and approximately when the offensive was to take place. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that with only a couple of brigades properly equipped for offensive operations, Russia only had to track a small number of units to determine Ukrainian intent. Given that this lack of security partly stemmed from the multinational process of organising the offensive, this should be examined carefully by NATO, which relies on comparable processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a great many tactical lessons identified in this paper. Some, however, raise questions about necessary adaptations to prevailing doctrine. First, there is a need to have an effective counter-reconnaissance capability to reduce sustained enemy observation of the intended axes of advance. The inability to screen axes of advance from enemy ISR risks sustained exposure to precision fires, producing an unacceptable rate of equipment loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is the need for electronic protection, and a corresponding requirement for electromagnetic command and control. Fratricide in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is a major problem for controlling large-scale operations under modern conditions. Given the density of systems dependent on the EMS and the actively contested condition of the spectrum, it is not viable to simply deconflict frequencies at the divisional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also evident during the offensive that while software-defined systems were critical to the competitiveness of the force, they were also susceptible to targeted electronic warfare interference. This was especially true in relation to precision strike. Over time, the enemy developed hard counters to a range of Ukrainian capabilities including Excalibur and GMLRS (guided multiple-launch rocket systems). It is therefore evident that retaining technological advantage requires the ability to rapidly update systems in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of sustained enemy observation and long-range fires meant that once troops were committed to offensive operations, their ground lines of communication became predictable and targetable, collapsing tempo. Where operations required gap crossing, the issue of sustainment became insurmountable. The question of how enduring protection of crossing points to sustain a force across a wet gap can be established should be a critical area of capability focus for NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the density of precision effects, even at tactical echelons, has left prestige enablers, such as offensive breaching vehicles, exceedingly vulnerable. Without such assets, there is no mobility, and thus no scope for manoeuvre. NATO militaries should therefore carefully examine how the density of enablers can be increased without overburdening the force, or how enabling capabilities can augment other platforms, such as to improve the organic mobility of units. Dependence on small fleets of specialist enablers is increasingly non-viable when the enemy can discern and engage specific targets within a formation and will do so throughout the depth of an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine, the lead times involved in regenerating offensive combat power mean that renewed offensive operations are not viable in the foreseeable future. To that end, Ukraine must now reprioritise inflicting as much damage as possible on the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation to buy the necessary time. At the same time, Ukraine is likely to pursue trying to constrain Russian revenue generation through strikes on Russian revenue-generating infrastructure. Time can be bought, albeit at a heavy price. The question for Ukraine and its international partners is what is done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Ukraine launched an offensive operation in an attempt to break through Russian defence lines and sever the land corridor occupied by Russia at the neck of Crimea. The operation failed to achieve any of its objectives. Understanding why is vital to ensuring that future Ukrainian operations are properly planned and resourced, and to inform the way in which NATO land forces endeavour to rebuild their offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several reports on the Ukrainian offensive of 2023, including some contributions by the authors, emphasise tactical considerations in explaining its failure. This report does address tactical lessons, but it is primarily concerned with the operational shortcomings of the offensive, relating to planning, operational decisions, the absolute shortage of critical means, and the challenges of mobilisation, force generation and logistics. The report seeks to shed light on how much decision space the Ukrainian military had, and where decision points actually lay. For example, problems with the concentration of a critical mass of Ukrainian troops on the main effort, and with Ukrainian force quality at the beginning of the offensive, have been widely reported. This does explain why particular assaults failed. However, the factors leading to these limitations were the result of decisions made months earlier, and so correcting such vulnerabilities has a long lead time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report was written in collaboration with the Ukrainian General Staff. The report is based on interviews with Ukrainian military personnel and commanders at tactical, operational and strategic echelons throughout 2023. It also draws on the operational data accumulated by the Ukrainian General Staff on troop strengths, casualties and equipment levels in units. The authors also worked closely with the lessons learned department of the Ukrainian General Staff, responsible for identifying adaptations to training, tactics and organisation for the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). In addition, the authors engaged extensively with Ukraine’s international partners throughout the offensive. While observations from those interviews shaped the thinking in this report, no data from Ukraine’s international partners is used. The report builds on and extends a report written by the authors covering the first six months of the war, published in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has a range of methodological limitations that should be declared up front. This is not an impartial piece of analysis. Ukraine is fighting an ongoing war, meaning there are parts of the dataset examined that cannot be released. There are also topics – such as some of the details of the relationship between Ukraine and some of its international partners – that remain sensitive and cannot be addressed. This report also – while identifying a range of shortcomings in decision-making, planning and tactical execution – avoids allocating blame. The authors aim for lessons to be learned, rather than seeking to offer an exercise in accountability. It should also be noted that the data in this report is derived from figures declassified for release in Ukrainian General Staff assessments. Other assessments have been made at various times, which often cite different numbers. In some instances, these may be more precise; in others, they are less so. However, there are very few alternative open source datasets that are persistently available using a consistent methodology across the period under examination. Some of the more complete datasets in the public domain are either Ukrainian or Russian information operations. This report therefore generally uses the Ukrainian General Staff figures because the consistency in methodology allows for like-for-like comparisons over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very briefly, it is worth noting one topic that is conspicuous by its absence: airpower. Much has been written about the importance of airpower in NATO offensive operations. The reality, however, is that while Ukraine’s lack of airpower was undoubtedly a serious disadvantage, it would not have been possible to build Ukrainian airpower capabilities in a manner where Ukraine would have been capable of conducting effective close air support inside the threat envelope that prevailed and within the timeframe of the Ukrainian 2023 offensive being planned and executed. Airpower was used during the offensive, with the Russians launching dozens of glide bombs per day onto Ukrainian positions. But in this it was used more as an augmentation of artillery, rather than as a parallel campaign. It therefore affords limited data points to discuss the application of airpower. As such a discussion would be somewhat theoretical, it has been omitted from this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is divided into four chapters. Chapter I describes the command decisions that shaped Ukrainian operations from September 2022 to the commencement of the offensive in June 2023. It establishes a baseline context and explains the correlation of forces. Chapter II describes the phases of the Ukrainian offensive, concluding in October 2023. Chapter III analyses the factors that contributed to Ukraine’s failure during the summer offensive, which are specific to this conflict. Chapter IV examines tactical and operational challenges that were new and are not accounted for in existing doctrine among Ukraine’s international partners, which are relevant for the regeneration of offensive combat power in NATO countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-operational-context&quot;&gt;I. The Operational Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, the AFU halted the advance of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) in Donbas. There were three factors that caused the Russian offensive to culminate. Russia had suffered heavy attrition among its best units during the early phase of the conflict – which were, in any case, inappropriately organised for large-scale offensive operations – and was thus finding it difficult to sustain offensive momentum. The AFRF had been compensating for this shortcoming through the application of an overwhelming fires advantage. Ukraine’s use of long-range precision strikes destroying Russian logistical infrastructure in June and July 2022 denied Russian forces this advantage. After months of bruising defensive operations, this created the first opportunity for Ukraine to seize the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukraine’s political leadership, uncertainty as to the longevity of international support was the critical factor in planning. Ultimately, Ukraine could be defeated in two ways: the AFU could be broken on the battlefield, or the loss of international support could leave it without arms or ammunition. By summer 2022, Ukraine had exhausted its own stocks of most critical munition natures and therefore depended on the international community. It was also believed that the flurry of gifting of equipment would not last unless Ukraine’s international partners perceived a viable path towards favourable war termination. Thus, the political direction to the AFU was twofold. First, the AFU had to generate a plan for offensive operations that could be sold to Ukraine’s international partners, who would need to resource it. Second, successful offensive operations of symbolic significance had to take place imminently. A further drive towards an early offensive was the threat that Russia would annex, depopulate and thereafter entrench the boundaries of the occupied territories. Russian officials had openly discussed annexation prior to the invasion, as well as during its early stages, and it would mirror the Russian playbook in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the AFU’s combat power in August 2022 was fixed defending the line of contact. Many units had been attrited, and so there was a relatively small number of brigades that had a sufficient level of readiness as a reserve to be used in offensive operations. With political direction to undertake offensive operations, the General Staff had to determine against which axes these forces would be committed. In terms of impact on the war if successful, the most attractive plan was to push south from Zaporizhzhia towards Melitopol and thereby sever the neck of Crimea, while simultaneously cutting the supply lines to Russian forces holding the right bank of the Dnipro River around Kherson. This axis was high risk. The consequence of the thrust would be a long and thin penetration with Russian forces on both sides. If the Russians responded aggressively this thrust could fail. The thrust would be close to the main concentrations of Russian forces in Ukraine at the time, who had been moved to the area to deny this very axis. Many of the Russian troops there had also not participated in the offensive in Donbas and had suffered fewer losses of equipment or personnel. The decision was therefore made to commit several brigades to attack the Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnipro to liberate Kherson, since the river would protect Ukrainian forces from any Russian attempt to counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation to liberate Kherson began on 29 August 2022. The fight would prove challenging. The Russians had committed some of their best troops to the city. The fact that the Ukrainian political leadership needed to demonstrate a “win” to Western partners meant that the objective of the operation had been heavily signalled. The Russians knew what was coming and had prepared three defence lines around the city. Despite the rate of resupply for Russian forces being constrained by the need to move materiel across contested crossing points over the Dnipro, Ukrainian forces found themselves advancing into well-sited ATGM (anti-tank guided missile) ambushes and artillery killing areas. The Russians used the limited artillery support they had in the region effectively. The AFU made some initial gains, only for their tempo to diminish as equipment and personnel losses mounted. Nevertheless, Russian troops were in a vulnerable position and, given Ukrainian fire control over their supply lines, risked slowly losing many competent troops. This pressure on Russian supply lines eventually saw Moscow withdraw its forces from Kherson in an orderly manner in October and November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader operational challenge faced by Russian forces in summer 2022 was that the initial invasion force was too small to maintain a sufficient concentration of troops across the breadth of the front. As the Kherson operation drew in Russian reserves, the question therefore arose as to whether the AFU could apply pressure elsewhere on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best place to attack was assessed to be in Kharkiv Oblast, which had several attractions. First, the Russian army lacked forces there, with units having suffered heavily during Russia’s offensive in Donbas. Second, as things stood, Izium remained a launching point for further attacks on Donbas, while the Russians were in artillery range of Kharkiv’s suburbs. This latter point, given Kharkiv’s significance as a major population centre, made Kharkiv a priority axis. While Russian forces observed Ukraine’s build-up of troops on the Kharkiv axis, they lacked forces to respond, having committed them to the south. It is also reasonable to conclude that while Ukraine did not achieve surprise as regards their intentions, they did achieve surprise with the timing of the attack. The gains exceeded Ukrainian expectations, as the Russian Western Group of Forces collapsed. Ironically, although the liberation of Kherson had been prioritised because it was a notable objective, the unexpected speed and scale of the gains in Kharkiv had an outsized effect in convincing Ukraine’s international partners that resourcing offensive operations could bring about results, thereby achieving the political goals of the operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn 2022 was marked by notable successes on the part of the AFU. Nevertheless, the AFU entered 2023 facing several significant challenges. Over the course of 2022, the AFU had taken approximately 30,000 killed and missing, and a significant number of wounded. Most losses took place during the Russian offensive on Donbas in May and June 2022, and during the offensive to liberate Kherson. Many of these losses were concentrated among Ukraine’s professional military brigades, which had been on the frontline continuously since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Besides killed and wounded, the AFU had also lost a large quantity of materiel. New units could be mobilised, but without equipment for them they could not be made suitable for offensive operations. The Territorial Defence Forces were left largely unmechanised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was available commands. Although the AFU had capable brigade staffs, these were largely committed to managing defensive sectors. The expansion of the AFU after the invasion increased the number of troops, but there was not a proportional number of experienced brigade staffs so that brigades tended to be given more battalions under command. The limited number of brigade enablers made it difficult to rotate full brigades off the line of contact so that they could conduct exercises to prepare for brigade operations. The challenge of rotation was exacerbated by the risks involved, due to the congestion it caused on the roads. Given the persistent threat to Ukraine’s training areas from Russian long-range strikes, and the lack of ammunition, spares or platforms to equip new units, Ukraine could raise new units, but training and equipping them depended on support from the country’s partners. If the AFU was to conduct further successful offensive operations, it needed to build new brigades, appropriately equipped for the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main outlines of a plan for a major offensive were in place by September 2022. The successes of the Kherson and Kharkiv offensives created the political belief that liberating further territories held by Russia could be possible. This spurred the Ramstein process – in which Ukraine’s international partners pledged the provision of materiel and other support – to begin cohering donations of equipment from Ukraine’s allies. Unfortunately, the process of agreeing what equipment could be gifted took almost three months, with pledges only made in January 2023. This wasted time would come at a terrible price later in the year. The process also established a clear tension between the need to sell the plan and the requirements of operational security. Regrettably, both Ukrainian messaging and speculation by Western officials were already setting clear expectations of a Ukrainian spring offensive and its potential objectives as early as December 2022. These discussions were noted in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Ukraine’s offensive operations, the AFRF adopted several measures to stabilise their front that would fundamentally alter the context for the future Ukrainian offensive. First, the AFRF had declared mobilisation to raise troop levels after the Ukrainian breakthrough in Kharkiv exposed how Russian forces were stretched. Second, the AFRF withdrew from the right bank of the Dnipro through Kherson, turning the river into a natural defensive barrier and securing their flank. Third, the Russians set about building deliberate defences across the approaches to the neck of Crimea in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Mobilisation did not rapidly produce well-trained soldiers. The defence lines would also take time to erect. Russia therefore embarked on an offensive in late January 2023, beginning in Vuhledar but rapidly spreading to most of the eastern front, with a particular emphasis on the city of Bakhmut. This ill-prepared offensive using under-trained troops was extremely costly for the Russians, but the command appears to have judged that it could trade lives for time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian mobilisation placed the AFU in a challenging position, where tactical successes could increasingly expose Ukraine to operational vulnerability over time. There has been a protracted debate about the efforts expended by the AFU in the defence of Bakhmut. Once depopulated by shelling, the city itself was of little value. However, the concern within the Ukrainian General Staff was that if Bakhmut fell without the AFRF culminating there, their next objective would be Chasiv Yar. Chasiv Yar not only straddles a ridge that would have facilitated further offensive operations, but if captured would also bring the rail and ground lines of communication from Kostyantynivka under Russian fire control and could bring Kramatorsk within range of Russian artillery, risking its depopulation. Furthermore, if the Russians did not culminate in Bakhmut they would force the AFU to fight for vital ground at a time when the intent was to be committing resources to offensive operations elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russia’s assault on the city offered the prospect of an urban defence where the AFU could inflict disproportionate losses, the decision was made to mount a determined defence of the city. Initially, this decision was vindicated by high Russian losses. However, Bakhmut was a highly unfavourable position to defend, situated in low ground. Russian gains around Bakhmut meant that by February the AFRF had established artillery control over the main ground lines of communication into the city along which Ukrainian troops were rotated. At this point, the disparity in losses became unfavourable for Ukraine. Overall, approximately 10,000 Ukrainian troops were killed or severely wounded during the fight for and around Bakhmut. Russian forces attacking the city were largely composed of Wagner Group troops and mobilised convicts, with support from the VDV (Russian Airborne Forces). In total, 19,547 Wagner fighters were killed in Bakhmut, with a similar number seriously wounded. In theory, this produced a 4:1 exchange ratio in favour of Ukraine. However, 88% of Wagner losses were of mobilised convicts, with the number of trained Wagner troops killed averaging between 40 and 60 per week. Thus, while Ukraine was losing experienced personnel, Russia was expending what it considered disposable untrained troops to fix the AFU, while inflicting heavy losses with its 5:1 advantage in artillery. Militarily, it is evident that the optimal tactical course of action would have been to withdraw to a new defence line once the AFRF had artillery control of the ground lines of communication into the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politically, however, the Ukrainian government believed that withdrawing from Bakhmut came with considerable risk. The decision point for the withdrawal coincided with several key decisions on the release of critical equipment, including tanks, munitions and enablers to Ukraine, mainly from Germany, for the planned offensive. The idea of the news from the front being Russia’s success against its main objective was, therefore, judged to endanger the speed with which Ukraine’s international partners would push materiel forward. Thus, the city was allowed to acquire a strategic symbolic significance that defied operational military logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 2023, the scale of a Ukrainian offensive had been determined, based on the volume of equipment being supplied by Ukraine’s partners and the troops that had been raised to conduct it. Ukraine and its partners thereafter set about apportioning equipment and training to these units. The challenge that emerged from the fight for Bakhmut was that many of those lost were experienced troops who could have been seeded throughout new units to raise their tactical proficiency. Instead, while experienced forces held the Russians back, new units were prepared for the offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By March 2023, equipment deliveries were starting to arrive in Ukraine. Given the limitations of available equipment in NATO countries that had run down their own militaries for three decades, the donations of equipment represented a large proportion of national stocks. It is important here to reflect on the scale of the conflict, as it highlights the extent to which many of Ukraine’s international partners have come to depend on fleets of military equipment that are manifestly too small for the purpose for which the equipment was procured. Relative to Russian forces, the quantity of equipment provided to Ukraine has been small. The total number of tanks given to Ukraine as aid over the course of the war is 671. Only 150 of these are Western models, with the majority Soviet models. At the same time, Ukraine has captured 495 Russian tanks over the course of the war, which makes Russia its largest single supplier of tanks. Ukraine received 480 infantry fighting vehicles from its international partners, more than 300 of which were BMP-1s. Ukraine has also captured 424 Russian BMPs. And yet, Russian equipment levels in theatre have expanded over the course of the fighting, with Russia producing and refurbishing approximately 1,500 tanks per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that there was and to some extent is a significant cognitive dissonance between what Ukraine’s international partners gave to Ukraine and what they thought could be achieved. In essence, while what was gifted was a significant proportion of the national stocks of Ukraine’s partners, that did not make the volume of equipment commensurate with the task. The inability of Western officials to grasp the scale of the fighting sat behind a persistent misalignment of expectations and outcome that haunted the 2023 Ukrainian offensive. This hype was exacerbated by Ukrainian information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment of experienced troops to blunt the Russian winter–spring offensive meant that the new units raised for the Ukrainian offensive were predominantly made up of fresh recruits. This was identified by commanders of these units in after-action reviews as a mistake, as it left an insufficient proportion of the force with combat experience during early engagements. These troops received basic training in the UK and Europe, and some subsequently received collective training. Other personnel received specialist training in operating donated equipment. This proved problematic. First, Ukraine received a vast range of equipment, and even within the same platform type it received multiple varieties. The result was that each formed Ukrainian brigade was fielding up to five different armoured vehicles. Moreover, while equipment that was to be donated had to be brought out of storage and either repaired or demodernised to remove sensitive systems, the equipment that many Ukrainian specialists trained on came from active military units in the donor nation. This meant that the vehicles on which Ukrainian troops trained differed in the workflow, capabilities and maintenance requirements from those that arrived in Ukraine, usually without manuals or spares. The result was that the units prepared for the offensive lacked combat experience among their junior leaders, had received accelerated tactical training on equipment that differed from the weapons with which they were to fight, and had a limited ability to maintain and operate the few platforms they received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More time was needed to build up the readiness of the brigades created for Ukraine’s offensive. However, time was also unavailable, as it would give Russia the opportunity to extend and deepen its defence lines and to raise and train more forces. With Russia’s force expansion proceeding faster than Ukraine’s, there was a point after which no offensive could have been possible. The key lesson for NATO leaders is that the preference of politicians to defer decisions is extremely costly in war. Just as Russia paid a heavy price for not mobilising in April 2022, Ukraine suffered for not expanding mobilisation, backed by an earlier commitment from its partners to train and equip its forces at scale, made in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In planning for the offensive, the Ukrainian General Staff had assessed five options for the axes of advance. First, there was the eastern direction around Bakhmut. This axis offered the greatest freedom of manoeuvre, but there were no objectives in this direction that would alter the logic of the conflict, unless Ukraine could surround or isolate a large body of Russian troops. This was deemed unlikely. All other options would aim to bring the neck of Crimea under physical control or fire control, complementing the roll back of the Black Sea Fleet to bring about the isolation of Crimea, thereby altering the dynamics of the war. The second axis would see amphibious operations across the Dnipro River. This would bypass much of the Russian defence line, but Ukrainian troops would face the same challenge of contested supply lines as had undermined the Russian defence of Kherson. There were three axes heading south. The westernmost axis would strike along a ridge line, parallel to the Dnipro, through Vasilyivka. This had some attractions. It would bypass the densest parts of Russia’s defence line, while a large stretch of the axis had been the basis for exercises in Ukrainian professional military education, such that many officers were familiar with the ground. There were drawbacks. First, it would involve two river crossings in the initial phases. Second, it would leave Ukrainian forces advancing on a narrow front, with the risk of being pinned against the Dnipro. Third, this axis would have brought fighting close to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant at Energodar, with the risk that it could be damaged or sabotaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two axes ran from Orikhiv via Tokmak towards Melitopol, and through Velika Novosilka towards Berdyansk. The density of Russian defences was comparable on these axes, with a slightly greater concentration on the former. The latter, however, required much more ground to be covered to be successful. Considering all these factors, the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was identified as the direction of the Ukrainian main effort. Fixing actions, meanwhile, would be undertaken towards Bakhmut and threatened across the Dnipro to reduce Russia’s lateral redeployment of forces to defend Tokmak. The subsequent blowing of the Nova Kakhovka dam by the AFRF during the first week of the offensive removed the possibility of a fixing operation being executed across the Dnipro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFRF was aware of the Ukrainian plan in detail. Between Ukrainian messaging, the leaking of highly classified information from the US, and terrain analysis, the Russians had concentrated their defences on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis. Thus, by the time the offensive was to be executed, the correlation of forces was unfavourable to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offensive plan envisaged Ukraine fielding 12 brigades. As originally conceived, three brigades were to support a fixing operation against Russian forces in the east. Three armoured brigades would then be committed to breach the Russian defence line, with another three mechanised brigades echeloning through to defeat Russian forces defending Tokmak. The final three brigades were to function as an exploitation force. In principle, the breach was to be accomplished within seven days. Such a tempo would mean that the Ukrainian forces would need to defeat six AFRF regiments, producing a favourable local force ratio. In practice, the original plan could not be executed at the time when the offensive was launched because of the equipment and readiness of the brigades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brigades for the offensive comprised three brigades of the National Guard of Ukraine (the 3rd, 14th and 15th Brigades) and three tactical groups of the AFU. The latter were called corps (the 9th Corps, the 10th Corps and the “Maroon” Corps), even though they were definitely not corps, by neither NATO nor Ukrainian standards, lacking corps echelon troops or the cohesion to function as formations. At best, they were division-sized units without divisional or adequate numbers of brigade enablers. Rather than being full armoured and mechanised brigades, the tactical groups consisted of two to three mechanised battalions each, with additional unmechanised units. The subordinate brigades fielded few critical enablers. The original scheme of manoeuvre had been for 9th Corps to be responsible for the initial break-in through the Russian disruption belt, for 10th Corps to penetrate to Tokmak, and for the Maroon Corps to then exploit towards Melitopol. Because these brigades lacked the equipment or readiness to execute a plan at the requisite tempo, the Russians would have time to bring to bear their forces throughout the area of the operation, which shifted the correlation of forces to unfavourable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of the Ukrainian forces were arrayed three defence lines comprising a disruption belt and forward defence line, a main defence line, and a reserve defence line, collectively straddling about 30 km of depth. These were defended by the 7th Airborne Division and the 42nd Motorised Rifle Division of the AFRF. For every 10 km of defence, the Russians thus had one motorised rifle regiment (70, 71 and 291 Regiments across the frontage of the axis) and one airborne regiment. In the second line were the 56th, 108th and 247 th Regiments. The 810th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Russian Federation and one of the battalions of the 177th Naval Infantry Regiment were also deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, two motorised rifle divisions (19 and 42) and two airborne divisions (7 and 76, consisting of the 104, 234 and 347 Regiments) were available to be brought to the defence lines, under command of the 58th Combined Arms Army. Additional artillery units were also assigned, including the 439th Artillery Brigade, equipped with Tornado-S MLRS (multiple-launch rocket systems). At the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive, the Russians had cached 35 days’ worth of supplies of ammunition around their gun lines, amounting to three replenishments of a standard load per day. In addition, the Russians fielded about 60 combat helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that while the AFRF had reverted back to the divisional and regimental force structure from the battalion tactical group in 2022, the composition of its units at this time was somewhat irregular. Many battalions included Storm-Z companies, territorial units and other attachments, while also lacking some of the conventional elements of their order of battle. The unit designations above should not, therefore, be taken as proxies for the order of battle, but rather as the command and control (C2) elements of the Russian defensive echelons. In total, if the Ukrainian offensive had prosecuted its three phases, there were 105,000 Russian troops that were available to defend the Orikhiv–Tokmak–Melitopol axis. These troops fielded approximately 470 tanks, up to 1,410 armoured fighting vehicles, over 720 artillery systems, up to 230 MLRS, and 12 operational–tactical missile complexes. However, if the tempo envisaged in the original plan had been achieved, Ukrainian forces would only have had to contend with 30% of these forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacking the units of action to execute the plan as originally intended, Ukrainian planners nevertheless felt that an offensive had to be attempted, and so began to hypothesise that if the initial attack applied enough pressure, they could advance into a numerically superior enemy by breaking its morale. The defeat mechanism of the Russian defence lines was premised on deep strike and shock action causing localised collapse. It was hoped that this would thereafter lead to a manoeuvre defence that would see Russian troops lose cohesion. These were very optimistic assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Ukraine fielded approximately 400,000 combat troops including the Territorial Defence Forces, the National Guard and State Border Guards at this time, there has been much discussion as to why more troops were not concentrated for the attack. First, many of these troops were not equipped or trained for breaching operations. But it is also important to note the broader context of the conflict to appreciate the risks that further concentration would have created elsewhere. Unlike in September 2022, when the Russian concentration in the south came at the expense of other parts of the line, mobilisation had allowed the AFRF to maintain significant forces across the front and to replenish losses. Thus, despite the losses suffered by Russia in early 2023, in July the number of Russian troops fielded in the Operational Group of Forces attacking Ukraine increased to about 450,000 personnel, fielding 2,200 tanks and 5,150 armoured combat vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-ukrainian-offensive-of-2023&quot;&gt;II. The Ukrainian Offensive of 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-May, Ukraine initiated operations on the Bakhmut axis, intended to fix Russian forces ahead of the main effort in the south. The attack on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was opened on 3 June, with operations by supporting brigades to secure the flanks of the main axis. The intent was for artillery preparation and an assault to take place during the night of 3–4 June. During these opening phases, however, several tactical errors were made. First, deconfliction between the troops assigned to the main effort and those that had been holding the front prior to the offensive was inadequate. This led to several incidents of friendly fire and disruption caused by Ukrainian defensive obstacles, prior to the initiation of attacks. Second, this disruption led to a time lag between the initial fire preparation missions and the assault of approximately three hours, leading to the opening of the main effort commencing after dawn. These errors reflected the limited cohesion carried out at brigade level during training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battalions of the 47th, 65th, and 33rd Brigades from 9th Corps opened the offensive with a series of attempted breaches by mechanised companies. MICLIC and UR-77 Meteorit explosive breaching lines were used to create lanes in the minefields, but these were often of insufficient depth to deliver a complete breach, while inexperienced vehicle crews deviated from the cleared path. A lack of demining equipment then became a problem. The corps had 10 demining vehicles, mainly Vincent-1s. These could clear ground but would overheat and shut down after ploughing for a sustained period. Russian units concentrated ATGMs, fired from infantry positions and from tanks stationed on high ground, against the demining equipment. Furthermore, a shortage of mine ploughs meant that usually only the leading vehicle had clearing equipment in each breach. The Ukrainian artillery also lacked smoke rounds to obscure their lines of advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was that multiple company attacks suffered the same fate. They entered the narrow breaching lanes, only for the lead vehicle to be knocked out or immobilised. At this point, the cleared lane was too narrow for vehicles to turn, so that, when following vehicles, if either tried to turn around or to move around the destroyed leading vehicle, they would become immobilised by mines. This led to large concentrated groupings of immobilised Ukrainian armour, which would then be targeted by Russian artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the blunting of initial armoured advances, the first Russian defensive positions were lightly held. Following the initial failed assaults, Ukrainian forces made a series of dismounted attacks drawing on troops from more experienced units, which managed to enter the first series of Russian fighting positions. Consistent with Russian doctrine, the first belt of defensive positions was a disruption zone, and thus Russian forces withdrew from some of their positions before Ukrainian troops entered them during the first two weeks of the offensive, only to counterattack before the enemy could consolidate. This was not conducted in an orderly manner, and so Russian forces took losses to Ukrainian artillery. There were two drivers of this disorder. First, Russian guns lacked the range to conduct effective counterbattery fire. Second, weeks of Ukrainian propaganda had convinced some Russian soldiers that they were about to face the brunt of NATO’s heavy equipment, and morale among some troops was low, although this phenomenon was uneven. Nevertheless, as the mechanised Ukrainian units began to accumulate losses and videos of these engagements spread among Russian troops, their confidence started to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losses during the initial assaults had an impact on the morale of as yet uncommitted Ukrainian units. The Ukrainian troops’ confidence in both their equipment and training diminished, especially since the second echelon was largely mounted in BMPs that lacked the crew survivability offered by Western infantry fighting vehicles. As a result, Ukrainian commanders moved experienced troops from a range of unmechanised supporting brigades into the line to conduct assaults using dismounted assault group tactics. Because these units had not been prioritised for the provision of Western equipment, many of them lacked means to support their assaults. This led to the blending of units, with tanks or breaching equipment borrowed from one brigade to support the assault groups of another. The result was that in some instances a company attack might have supporting components from up to three brigades enabling the effort. This proved highly problematic. The Ukrainian brigades that were prepared for the offensive also had not previously practised working with the brigades protecting their flanks. For those troops lacking combat experience, with very short training courses in the West, control of direct fire was a serious problem, such that there were many cases of friendly fire between intermingled sub-units from different brigades. Despite these complications, the assault units did make some progress into the Russian defence lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukrainian forces got deeper into the defences, new challenges started to emerge. First, by late June, Russian troops started to counterattack. At first, this involved the use of their artillery, held out of range of the front, to destroy abandoned fighting positions once they were occupied by Ukrainian troops. Second, Russian troops began to use dismounted infantry supported by armour to attack the positions at night. Given that each Ukrainian battalion produces at best two platoons of fully capable assault troops, it was vital that Ukrainian forces replaced assault troops with line infantry on positions they occupied. In general, there were insufficient troops to conduct rotations. The tempo of Russian counterattacks also meant that troops would then need to be resupplied. Resupply at night through the narrow breaches in the minefields was extremely dangerous, especially given the limited availability of night vision equipment, and Russia’s use of artillery-deployed scatterable mines. Thus, Ukrainian units often had to resupply during the day, when Russian troops would begin to attack the resupply routes using FPV loitering munitions and barrel-launched ATGMs fired by tanks from hilltops, and attack aviation firing ATAKA and Vikhr ATGMs. Given the absolute shortage of demining equipment, this often had to be accomplished by hand, which was slow and dangerous. The overall effect was to prevent any build-up of tempo, such that Ukrainian units had to continually attack prepared positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loss of enablers in 9th Corps meant that this equipment had to be committed from 10th Corps to continue the attacks. Without these enablers, and without the C2 to conduct a large-scale forward passage of lines in a convoluted battlespace, 10th Corps began to be committed piecemeal, not only on the main axis, but also on the eastern axis around Bakhmut, and on the supporting Velika Novosilka axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Ukrainian troops managed to gain sufficient lodgements to push further into the defences in some sectors. These were, however, highly predictable for the Russians, so defensive means could be concentrated at these points. Moreover, because of the narrow width of the proposed axis of advance and the persistent threat from Lancet-3Ms hunting Ukrainian artillery, the guns could not be brought forwards. This meant that proportionally more Russian artillery could cover Ukrainian lines of advance without Ukrainian counterbattery fire being able to reach the Russian guns. Thus, for the second round of assaults, the resistance became harder. With most of the available demining equipment already lost, the proportion of breaching that needed to be conducted by hand increased. The units conducting it largely lacked dismounted breaching equipment. This time, Russian troops consistently held their positions, having often set up flanking ambushes from the tree lines while counterattacking aggressively with armour. During this phase, Ukrainian troops often took positions, only to lose them to counterattacks, such that assaults would need to be repeated several times. As a result, by late June, Ukrainian officers feared that the counteroffensive would not achieve its aims and paused while they debated where and how to commit additional units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original plan had seen the 9th, 10th and Maroon Corps as distinct units of action. In practice, units of the 9th Corps had been expended in the first assaults, while 10th Corps had been committed piecemeal, exacerbated by the need to amalgamate breaching equipment. By July, Ukrainian commanders had to judge whether to commit units from the Maroon Corps to continuing the southern axis, or to call off the offensive. Politically, halting the offensive seemed unacceptable. Fears that there would not be another chance and hopes that the Russian resistance would falter if the attack were sustained led to the decision to continue pushing south, but with the revised objective of capturing Tokmak. The AFU, recognising that to use its exploitation force for the assault would prevent an exploitation after the breakthrough, also switched its prioritisation of fires towards a damage-centric strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s long-range strike campaign during the offensive deserves some discussion. More than 300 Storm Shadow and SCALP cruise missiles were delivered to Ukraine over the course of the offensive, although only small numbers could be launched at any given time. Despite some strikes on Russian C2 and logistics during the offensive, long-range fires had little impact on the fighting. Given the extent to which NATO militaries hope that precision and deep strike can offset volume of unguided artillery, it is worth examining the reason for these results. First, the priority of the precision strike campaign was to destroy the Russian Black Sea Fleet and to degrade defences on the Crimean Peninsula. Combined with the use of uncrewed surface vessels, long-range precision strikes degraded Russian sea control. This had the strategic effect of allowing Ukraine to resume exports from its ports. It also set the conditions for the isolation of Crimea from the sea, although this effect would only be felt if the neck of Crimea could be threatened. The long-range strike campaign was therefore successful against its primary objective, but the failure of the ground operation meant the success was not fully exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikes using Storm Shadow in support of the ground operation proved less successful. Several headquarters were destroyed, including the reserve command post of the 58th Combined Arms Army in Berdyansk, along with strikes on bridges at the neck of Crimea. Collectively, however, these strikes never reached the critical level of damage that would disorder the C2 or logistics system. Nor were the strikes themselves effectively synchronised with ground operations that would have caused pressure in tempo with disruption in the deep. This was partly because having effect in the land domain requires the simultaneous servicing of more targets than operations targeting naval forces. The damage to the Black Sea Fleet was absolute. Damaged command posts and bridges, by contrast, could be replaced and repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the offensive, GMLRS strikes had been prioritised in maximum depth, to disrupt Russian C2 and logistics and also to target air defence systems and other targets that could have improved the efficiency of loitering munitions raids on Crimea. Once the objective became more limited to Tokmak, the depth of the fires campaign also came back, with an emphasis on fires in shallow depth to assist with the attack. Thus, GMLRS in particular started to be reprioritised, from targeting high-value targets to striking Russian artillery. This was also driven by the inability to push Ukrainian guns forwards, as the breach was insufficiently wide, and scoured by Lancets. While many Russian guns were destroyed, with only approximately seven GMLRs (munitions, not launchers) per day to service the whole theatre, the rate of destruction was something Russian troops could absorb during the critical period when Ukraine had remaining offensive combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of precision strike was further mitigated by Russian countermeasures. The munitions that were to deliver these precision effects had been employed for almost a year by the time the offensive began. Whereas Excalibur, for example, was achieving around 70% effectiveness at the beginning of the conflict, by August 2023, it was hitting the designated point only 6% of the time, a rate lower than non-precision munitions. This was because of exquisite electronic warfare (EW) countermeasures fielded by the AFRF. The impact on GMLRS was slightly different. The first challenge was that electronic protection systems were able to redirect entire salvos of GMLRS targeting specific areas. The second issue was that Russian air defences had been calibrated to be able to shoot down GMLRS. These problems could be overcome by layering effects. The use of other munition types such as HARMs, EW or decoys, or selecting the right time to engage, made GMLRS strikes highly effective. But these shaping requirements significantly reduced the tempo and scale at which strikes could be directed against operationally significant targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment of Maroon Corps units in July began to exert significant pressure on the 58th Combined Arms Army. Along with small numbers of strikes in depth using Storm Shadow, the attrition of artillery systems with GMLRS, and the fact that Russian troops had been in the line for two months of heavy fighting, Ukrainian units began to achieve results in small tactical actions, largely by narrowing the axis on which they were working from a 30 km frontage to a 10 km frontage. In one incident, for example, a Ukrainian assault group of 15 personnel managed to dislodge 88 Russian troops from a position. Despite these kinds of incidents, the pace of advance was extremely slow and always gave the Russians time to reset their defences, such that every attack had to be a deliberate assault action. The need to secure the flanks of any gains further slowed progress. Furthermore, Ukrainian advances began to be canalised between two pieces of high ground across an area 7 km wide. This left troops vulnerable to plunging fire from the flanks, further constraining the rate of advance. The commitment of the Maroon Corps, as the exploitation force, also removed any risk for the Russians that further Ukrainian axes could be prioritised. This freed up Russian troops to rotate the more damaged units of the 58th Combined Arms Army, such that Ukrainian forces found themselves fighting fresh troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been persistent discussion about the Ukrainian decision to commit some of the troops prepared for the offensive towards the Bakhmut axis, rather than concentrating forces in the south. This is, to some extent, the wrong framing of the choice facing the AFU. The allocation of ammunition to the eastern axis certainly contributed to Ukraine having insufficient fires on the southern axis. Nevertheless, since Ukrainian artillery was being held back from advancing by Russian mines and Lancets, adding more artillery pieces to the southern axis would not have axiomatically increased Ukraine’s firepower where it mattered. The same can be said of committing more troops. Given the frontages involved, pushing more companies of assault troops southwards would not have vastly increased the scale of operations that could be carried out and thus the combat power applied. As it became clear, however, that the southern axis might at best reach Tokmak – and even this objective appeared in doubt – there was a strong political direction to demonstrate progress, so that more troops were committed to the Bakhmut axis. Without sufficient mechanised forces, however, these attacks could not achieve sufficient tempo to produce encirclements of Russian troops. The eastern direction therefore devolved into fights for treelines. The real trade-off decision, therefore, was not between the commitment of units between two axes or one, but rather whether these reserves should have been committed at all, or else preserved. In hindsight, the commitment of these forces appears to have been a mistake, as Ukraine is now short of cohered units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian attrition during the offensive arguably reached its height in early August. The use of counterattacks, and the provision of dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICM) to Ukraine, which increased both the number of rounds that could be fired per day and the lethality of these fire missions, all drove up Russian casualties. Nevertheless, Russia continued to rotate its regiments under its divisions to ensure that there were fresh troops holding the defences. If a breakthrough to Tokmak was going to happen, this was most likely in early August. After that, the likelihood began to diminish. Ukrainian ammunition stocks meant that the rate of fire to support offensive operations could be continued until October at the latest. By mid-September, offensive actions were largely aimed at improving tactical positions, as commanders recognised that a breakthrough – even to Tokmak – was not going to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offensive may have culminated, but one last operation was attempted, to cross the Dnipro and attack through Krynky. For this purpose, some 55 GMLRS were stockpiled, along with a large volume of other fires. The Ukrainian marines conducting the operation were attacking into their old training grounds and knew the terrain well. It was hoped that a surge of force across the river might turn the flank. When the crossing was made, Ukrainian forces managed to secure a lodgement on the eastern bank, and for approximately three days there was an opportunity to move a significant number of troops across. This was not attempted. The reason was simple. While a large body of troops might have been projected over the river, they could not be sustained, and the larger the force the less viable their sustainment would be. The Krynky operation does not need to be covered in detail as it was never fully carried out, but it does offer one salutary lesson to which observers should pay attention. Under modern battlefield conditions, the establishment and protection of a crossing on a wide wet gap against sustained observation and the indefinite threat of fires is a problem to which there is not yet a doctrinal answer. Given the number of these gaps in Eastern Europe, it is a problem set that deserves study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-assessing-the-causes-of-failure&quot;&gt;III. Assessing the Causes of Failure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most analyses gravitate towards the conclusion that the reasons for the difference between the failure of Russian operations in 2022 and their comparative success in 2023 is that the Russians are learning and adapting, and are becoming more tactically proficient. Although Russia has adapted its tactics, the main reason for the striking difference in the effectiveness of Russian operations is that in the preparation of the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin’s main effort was that of its Special Services, which were supposed to destabilise Ukraine and disorganise its system of state and military administration. The military invasion was not supposed to meet serious organised resistance, other than in Donbas. The defeats suffered by the AFRF in the battles of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson were primarily the consequences of an initial miscalculation in the planning of the invasion, and the employment of forces improperly structured and commanded for conventional warfighting. After the failure of the initial coup de main, attempts were made to rectify the structural shortcomings, but without an uplift in mass, and because of the losses during the opening phase of the war, the Russian military failed to achieve its objectives. In 2023, Ukraine was dealing with an enemy that had completely changed its strategy. Russia began to take seriously the planning and conduct of military operations, moving from a blitzkrieg strategy to a protracted war, with the mobilisation necessary for this through its human and industrial resources. It placed its main bet on the fact that Western partners will tire of supporting Ukraine, allowing Russia to eventually gain the necessary advantage on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the AFRF’s operational failures in 2022 was the insufficient number of ground troops to conduct effective combat operations along multiple independent axes. In fact, the lack of the necessary forces and means for a successful full-scale invasion was one of the foremost reasons why many analysts, including in Ukrainian intelligence agencies, were sceptical about the probability of a Russian invasion in February 2022, predicting such an invasion later, in June or even September 2022, and only in the limited theatre of the south and east. Such sceptical assessments of the probability of a successful invasion allowed the Russians to achieve operational surprise, which explains the success in capturing the south of Ukraine, as well as the deep advance in the north, where the AFU did not have significant forces. The Russian plan came much closer to succeeding than is often acknowledged, but when the bet on speed failed, the plan was invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to defeat the AFU during its initial blitzkrieg and heavy losses in people and military equipment meant that Russia faced the problem of an acute lack of the troops necessary not only to continue the offensive, but also to hold territories in the east and especially in the south. It was the lack of adequate personnel that forced the Russians to withdraw from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, and prevented them from organising the proper density of defences near Kharkiv, enabling the AFU to carry out a successful breakthrough there and a further offensive almost to the borders of the Luhansk region. Although Ukrainian fire control of Russian lines of supply explains the tactical decision to withdraw from Kherson, the unwillingness of the AFRF to lose the quality troops deployed there reflected the shortages in personnel elsewhere on the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in many military conflicts before, including the First and Second World Wars, after the end of the first phase of the war, which was characterised by rapid manoeuvre by the first echelon, the second phase began, during which the skirmish line stabilised, the fighting became positional, and the parties concentrated on generating the reserves to win the war. As a result of the mobilisation that began in October 2022, Russia managed by May 2023 not only to replenish its losses, but also to increase the size of the group of forces in Ukraine to approximately 420,000 personnel (not counting the units of the Russian Guard and the police involved in running an occupation regime), as well as to establish the production of weapons and military equipment in the volumes necessary to support their operations. As a result, the Ukrainian offensive, which began in June 2023, was conducted in conditions that differed significantly from those that prevailed when the plan for the offensive was developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In autumn 2022, the AFRF in Ukraine consisted of 130 battalion-tactical groups and separate units of the 1st and 2nd Army Corps with a total number of about 200,000 servicemen, about 930 tanks, more than 2,500 armoured combat vehicles, 1,350 artillery systems, 660 MLRS and 40 operational-tactical missile systems (OTMS). By the beginning of June 2023, Russian ground forces in Ukraine comprised about 420,000 personnel, 1,980 tanks, 4,450 armoured combat vehicles, 2,750 artillery systems, 860 MLRS and 46 OTMS. During this time, the AFRF abandoned the use of battalion-tactical groups and switched to the army management system, cohering 50 brigades, 128 regiments, 102 separate battalions and about 50 combined units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Russia’s group of forces in Ukraine, outlined above, constitutes its combat troops. These troops were not responsible for guarding the Russian border, a task undertaken by other parts of the AFRF. Nor were they primarily concerned with supporting the administration of the occupied territories. For this, the Russian Federation had deployed in Ukraine 25,000 servicemen of the Russian Guard, fielding their own 520 armoured combat vehicles, about 140 artillery systems and 22 helicopters. By contrast, the AFU’s combat power had to hold the entire Ukrainian border, stretching out AFU resources while the AFRF maintained freedom to commit resources on particular axes. The presence of AFRF units on the Russian–Ukrainian border, their constant shelling of Ukrainian territory with MLRS, artillery and mortars, airstrikes and the use of sabotage groups forced Ukraine to keep part of its troops in the north, making it impossible to transfer them to other directions. A further 50,000 troops of the AFU were committed to generating mobile air defence groups with their necessary support echelon to defeat a sustained Russian long-range strike campaign throughout Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to use artillery to compensate for the limited force density along much of the front limited the concentration of firepower on the main effort. The largest number of 155-calibre guns simultaneously operating on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis was 55 units. Ammunition levels for Ukrainian artillery varied throughout the offensive. At its peak, these reached approximately 70 rounds per gun per day for those guns on the main effort. However, ammunition supplies were uneven and would peak and trough, so that for periods of the offensive, Ukrainian guns had as little as 10 rounds per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both at the beginning and during the conduct of the Ukrainian offensive operation, the AFU did not have a numerical advantage over the enemy in the number of personnel, combat systems and ammunition, or enablers necessary for successful offensive operations, especially against a well-organised and echeloned line of defence. At times, the AFU did establish localised superiority, but this could rarely be maintained as forces advanced. The balance of forces in many cases was not in favour of Ukraine, which forced Ukrainian units to storm the positions of a more numerous enemy. Conditions were especially unfavourable given the lack of air support. Against this, Ukraine had some qualitative advantages in both troops and equipment, but this did not provide a sufficient offset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of numerical advantage, the AFU counted on a moral advantage due to both the high level of motivation of the Ukrainian troops and the low morale of Russian troops observed during their winter offensive. To some extent, Ukraine repeated the mistake that Russia had made during the first stage of the war, counting on shock induced by offensive operations preventing the enemy from putting up an adequate resistance. This theory of success was a poor planning assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, therefore, the Ukrainian offensive failed because the plan was not properly calibrated to the available resources. Nor were appropriate troops assigned to the tasks for which they were suited. Undertrained personnel spearheaded the main effort, while experienced troops were committed to diversionary or fixing axes. Ukraine’s international partners failed to mobilise industry early in the conflict, while over-optimistic planning assumptions by Ukrainian planners based on the conditions prevailing before Russian mobilisation had grave consequences. The reason to place such emphasis on this point is that Ukraine’s international partners missed their decision points for industrial mobilisation, while Ukraine missed its decision points for the mobilisation and adequate training of personnel. It is thus vital that for future operations Ukraine and its partners do not lull themselves into believing that an under-resourced operation has a strong likelihood of succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this foremost operational point, numerous shortcomings of the preparation of the Ukrainian offensive can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-lack-of-surprise&quot;&gt;A Lack of Surprise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the anticipated mechanisms enabling success during the Ukrainian offensive was the shock to Russian troops. In the initial plan, this was hoped to enable the 12 brigades to break six enemy regiments across 30 km of front. When planners realised that this was not possible, it was hoped that the violence of the initial attack would dislodge the defenders. Where tactical surprise was achieved during the war, as in the Kharkiv offensive in 2022, Ukrainian forces effectively dislocated Russian troops. Conversely, in both Kherson and on the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis, surprise was not achieved, and operational security failed. In the Kherson direction, the Ukrainian government signalled the intention to attack on this axis. The subsequent decision to attack Kherson was therefore made against a prepared defence and was neither particularly successful in terms of the ground assaults nor did it cause shock among Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Orikhiv–Tokmak axis, the failure of operational security occurred at multiple levels. At the strategic level, leaks of top secret information from Ukraine’s international partners (including terrain analysis and other materials) gave the Russians a precise picture of the Ukrainian assault force’s structure, anticipated capabilities, limitations and options for axes of advance. Furthermore, the public messaging from the Ukrainian government, and public discourse from partners, gave Russia a clear understanding of the timing of a likely assault and informed AFRF planning. Finally, Russian penetration of Ukrainian communications systems enabled capture of a range of materials. The result was that when the offensive started, Ukrainian efforts to compartmentalise planning often left friendly forces with less understanding of the wider plan than Russian commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson is clear: future operations must be accompanied by appropriate deception and more effective operational security. For Ukraine, this means less public telegraphing of intentions. However, there are also lessons for Ukraine’s partners about the transparency of its political discourse on collective planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inadequate-force-generation&quot;&gt;Inadequate Force Generation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the greater human reserves of the Russian Federation, Ukraine must seek qualitative superiority among its forces. For situations in which the AFU are on the defensive, this has largely been achieved. For offensive operations, 2023 demonstrated that the system of training and force generation is not producing sufficient force quality to execute a high tempo of operations. There are several reasons for this. At the most basic level, the training is appropriate neither in duration nor content. There are differences of approach between AFU and NATO members on how battle inoculation should be carried out. Nevertheless, restrained use of BATSIM (battlefield simulation) and other techniques to habituate trainees to the felt effect of artillery manifested in a proportion of units performing poorly early in the offensive. A lack of familiarity and training with artillery for example saw troops unwilling to keep pace with close support fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other fundamental problem related to drill proficiency. With five weeks training at Operation Interflex, and perhaps a month of collective training before being committed, troops did not have a well-rehearsed repertoire of battlefield movements they could execute at pace. Tactical control of direct fires was also very limited, partly because safety constraints on training without sufficient time to lay strong foundations prevented fire and movement at platoon and company level from being adequately drilled. In consequence, fire discipline was largely poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method adopted by the Ukrainian military to make up for this force quality problem was to select a cadre of assault troops from within its units, such that a battalion might generate two platoons of assault troops, while the remainder of the battalion formed conventional companies. In practice, this meant that rather than being able to echelon through one another to maintain offensive momentum, each attack had to be deliberately planned and would culminate on completion. Furthermore, the loss of these assault troops would remove the offensive combat power of the battalion. This made commanders cautious, further impeding tempo. Although the approach adopted by the AFU made sense in the limited time available, the time for training was inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem was the training of brigades as a cohered formation. With most brigade staffs fixed on the front to manage defensive sectors, Ukraine has struggled to train brigades, or to exercise battalions beneath a brigade headquarters. The result was that when Ukrainian units reached the battle area, they tended to plan and execute separate company actions, managed by the brigade headquarters and supported by brigade fires, rather than conforming to a brigade scheme of manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to raise force quality for offensive operations through a deliberate process taking approximately eight months, with up to 18 weeks of individual training and collective training thereafter, must be factored in to war planning. Planning by Ukraine or its international partners has rarely been conducted over such horizons, especially among the political echelon. But failure to plan in this way means that the available force will not be suited to the envisaged task. The largest attacks during the offensive were battalion attacks. This reflected the small cadre of trained staff officers able to synchronise larger operations. To overmatch Russian units, it is necessary to increase the scale at which Ukrainian units can operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deficiencies-in-planning&quot;&gt;Deficiencies in Planning&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original concept of operations, as previously described, envisaged a 12-brigade operation taking seven days to breach the defence lines along a 30 km frontage and isolate Tokmak. The evidence suggests that had this concentration of forces and tempo been achieved, a breakthrough to Tokmak was possible. However, this concept defining requirements was unburdened by the limitations of the actual force employed. The original concept was reasonable. But when the concept was turned into a plan, reflecting the limitations of the forces that had been generated, the time that had elapsed, and thus the disposition of the enemy, errors in planning emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the theory of success for the operation as executed depended on a collapse in Russian forces, but the forces and means were not concentrated sufficiently to achieve this effect. It is not evident on what basis planners thought this would be achieved. Instead, planning appears to have proceeded on the basis of significant optimism bias. This appears to have stemmed partly from a belief that Russia’s collapse around Kharkiv arose from a lack of morale, when in reality it arose from Russia’s lack of sufficient troops. This is not a new problem, but given the extent to which NATO members hope to offset the enemy’s numerical superiority, methodologies for more accurate assessments of the morale of an enemy seem worth developing. The UK, in particular, has for some time emphasised the importance of information manoeuvre and the cognitive dimension of war. It is evident, however, that planners did not correctly evaluate Russia’s mindset or vulnerabilities in this regard. Thus, it appears there are insufficient means for staffs to sense or conduct battle damage assessment on morale, to enable accurate planning for how a collapse might be induced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also evident that planners failed to properly apportion the right forces for the operation. Rather than being recovered from the front to form the core of new units, experienced troops were instead left with diminishing levels of mechanised equipment and were committed on various diversionary axes, such as Bakhmut, or in fixing actions on either side of the main effort. When troops from these units were thereafter pushed into the offensive force, the units lacked critical means, including demining equipment, to be able to succeed. The decline in equipment quality in follow-on forces was also pronounced, such that Ukrainian units began to have to attempt offensive breaching operations with MaxxPros and other vehicles unsuited to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain planning failures were made jointly between Ukraine and its international partners, for example, the weight given to effects of deep strikes, which were intended to disrupt the Russian defences. While the campaign targeting Crimea was well planned, the deep battle in support of the main effort employed too few munitions against too diverse an array of targets to ever deliver a critical scale of effect. Nor were the application of long-range precision fires synchronised with tactical actions that would best exploit the pressure placed on the Russian defensive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another curious element of the planning is the lack of mitigations in place to overcome identified Russian strengths. During wargames carried out with Ukraine’s international partners prior to the offensive, a number of Russian capabilities were identified as especially problematic. Russian aviation was one such capability. Yet the operation was launched without any means to counter the threat from Russian attack aviation. The US eventually approved the use of ATACMs in October to strike Russian helicopters at their airfields. This was all very well, but by October Russian attack aviation had already played its part in blunting Ukraine’s offensive. By then, the application of ATACMs merely contributed to an attritional writing down of Russian systems. It did not enable manoeuvre. The point here is not that ATACMs were the answer to aviation. Russia tactically adapted to mitigate the risk to its airfields within days of these strikes. The point is that nothing was done to mitigate the risk when it mattered. This problem was not limited to the issue of aviation. Minefields were similarly identified as a major problem. At the beginning of the offensive, Ukraine had significantly fewer demining vehicles than would be considered the minimum required in doctrine. This had predictable results, which had been identified by Ukraine and its partners during the pre-offensive wargames. Yet Ukraine’s partners continued to push demining vehicles into Ukraine as late as August, when the US provided M117s. The AFU took two months learning how to operate and maintain these vehicles so they were not ready to be used until October 2023, after the offensive had completely culminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about this is that Ukraine’s international partners provided equipment in a manner that was completely inconsistent with NATO doctrine, such that Ukraine could not concentrate a critical mass of the relevant capabilities at the decisive point. Much of this failure was political. The US had recommended releasing DPICM to Ukraine in autumn 2022 and ATACMs early in 2023. The release of these systems was approved late. The question that NATO members must confront is whether their systems of government prompt leaders to make decisions when they must be made if they are to have their intended effect, or whether the system allows for delay beyond the point of relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-identifying-emerging-tactical-challenges&quot;&gt;IV. Identifying Emerging Tactical Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of large-scale offensive breaching operations is one of the hardest tasks that land forces must be able to carry out. In the First World War, it took the Entente powers three years to develop the concepts and capabilities and generate the capacity to effectively breach German defences on the Western Front. Holding units that are equipped and trained for this operation represents the largest resource commitment in most armies. For example, while the UK has many units that have widespread utility, only 3 UK Division, which is by far the most expensive element of the Field Army, is expected to be able to conduct large-scale offensive breaching, and it is at present not equipped to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctrinal framework for offensive breaching has remained essentially unchanged since the formulation of AirLand Battle in the 1980s. The last time offensive breaching was conducted by Western forces at scale was in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, and this appeared to vindicate the equipment, formation structure, tactics and doctrine underpinning AirLand Battle. Prior to 2023, the only large-scale offensive breaching operation to have been conducted in a conventional war since 1991 was Azerbaijan’s operation to retake Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020. This operation was, however, carried out against an Armenian force that was barely modernised from the 1980s. Thus, the established formula once again proved successful. Breaching operations in Iraq during the war against Islamic State and in Afghanistan during fighting with the Taliban required clearing through complex fields of IEDs, but these were not covered by artillery, and so coalition forces dictated the tempo of manoeuvre. It is therefore reasonable to argue that Ukraine’s attempts to breach the Surovikin Line over summer 2023 were the first attempts at large-scale offensive breaching operations in 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over that timeframe, new technologies have had a considerable impact on how armies fight. It is therefore worth examining the experience of Ukrainian forces to assess the extent to which established doctrine remains valid and where it may need to be adapted or revised. These lessons are not only relevant for Ukraine’s forces, as they endeavour to recover and prepare for future offensive operations, but also for Ukraine’s international partners, who must be credible if they are to deter Russia from challenging Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fighting in Ukraine during 2023 revealed several requirements and problem sets that have not widely confronted NATO forces and are not effectively accounted for in Western doctrine. These issues need to be thought through during the design of future forces and operations. Several of these challenges are unpacked in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pervasive-observation-and-precision-fires&quot;&gt;Pervasive Observation and Precision Fires&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the offensive, both sides made extensive use of UAVs to watch the battlefield over the frontline and into opposing rear areas. Russian troops made substantial use of Lancet-3M loitering munitions to deliver precision strikes against Ukrainian artillery and support elements. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, used an expanding number of first-person-view UAVs as they moved onto the defensive, and as their own availability of artillery ammunition diminished. For both sides, these capabilities have proved more impactful for defensive than offensive operations. This is primarily because it is easier to deconflict these systems when one’s own forces are manoeuvring less, because using them in the close against advancing troops means they are in closer proximity to their control antennae than to enemy jamming, and because it is the attacking party that must increase its signature and will outrun its ability to use deception or decoys to protect itself, as the attacker must advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of EW and low-altitude air defence for offensive operations did exist in older doctrine. Largely, however, this was a divisional responsibility, as it remains in US concepts. Today, the localised ability to generate precision fires means that all units require electronic protection. In concept, advancing formations must be able to create electronic barriers, and since sub-units are unlikely to have dedicated air defence, systems must be multifunctional, with the ability to engage small aerial targets. Electronic protection is too vulnerable if kept on a small number of dedicated platforms. Instead, while electronic protection modules must be programmable and relatively autonomous, they must be widely distributed. Antennae will become a crucial layer in a protection system, vulnerable to direct fire. They must therefore be replaceable, rather than integral to the unit generating the jamming frequencies. Projecting navigational interference is particularly important for providing area defence against precision fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there is the dilemma, noted above, of how a force that must create a time-limited snowdome of protection from precision fires can avoid increasing its exposure to statistical artillery (non-precision munitions). The old answer – to win the counterfires battle – is only a partial solution, because high-fidelity ISR now allows fewer guns to deliver more concentrated effects, thus raising the threshold of suppression needed to protect the force. Thus, alongside the requirement to protect the force from stand-in observation, it is also necessary to be able to defeat enemy longer-range UAVs, either at low altitude but stood off up to 10 km, or at medium altitude above the MANPADS ceiling. Combined with the fact that the targets being engaged will often be relatively inexpensive, this presents a key challenge for short-ranged air defence. There is also the requirement to shift the task from counterbattery kills to left-of-launch targeting of enemy artillery. This brings into the close battle concepts that had previously been more relevant to discussions of Integrated Air and Missile Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electromagnetic-battlespace-management&quot;&gt;Electromagnetic Battlespace Management&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The force that can employ precision fires responsively is likely to be disproportionately efficient compared with their adversary. The ability to minimise concentration is simultaneously dependent on coordination of activities at reach or beyond line of sight. This depends on access to the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The result is that even without enemy EW, the EMS is becoming crowded. The number of systems communicating is increasing. The volume of data being passed is increasing. And the advantages to be gained versus vulnerabilities ceded by not contesting the EMS are shifting to a point where although forces must be able to revert without their primary systems, this does not mean they should accept loss of communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contested nature of the EMS and its impact on the efficiency of fires and manoeuvre must be addressed. In the defence, runners, ground-laid cable and other reversionary methods can be used to limit traffic, signature and vulnerability. On the offence, these are not viable options. Without careful frequency management, forces are liable to engage in widespread fratricide in the EMS, including degrading the efficiency and survivability of their own UAVs. This was a serious problem in Ukraine, and often caused commanders to limit electronic protection to their forces, thus increasing their own situational awareness but also giving freedom to enemy ISR and fires. Russian forces would reset their frequencies every 24 hours, deconflicting UAV orbits, and would synchronise EW with manoeuvre, so that when precision coordinates needed to be generated, electronic protection would dip before being brought back up. This was achieved despite the AFRF distributing EW capabilities to the company echelon. For Ukraine, absolute shortage of systems reduced the complexity of the task, but most EW was nevertheless managed at the brigade echelon, and even then was often not maximally exploited, because of the difficulties it created for C2 and ISR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to allocate sufficient bandwidths for software-defined systems to avoid broad-band jamming, and yet have enough spectrum available for the range of systems in a modern force, is a serious problem. It is also one that most military personnel are not trained to manage. Yet this is becoming a key planning constraint at all echelons. There is a need for signallers to be trained differently to support these requirements down to brigade and battlegroup level. At the same time, commanders in the combat arms need to be better trained in how to use EW troops and how to plan manoeuvre in the EMS. Increasing the skills of signallers is of little value if the level of understanding among the other arms diverges rather than converges, leading to the capabilities being neglected or misapplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;accelerated-capability-refresh-cycles&quot;&gt;Accelerated Capability Refresh Cycles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a new observation to say that innovative capabilities have their greatest impact when first fielded and then offer less advantage as the enemy adapts. This problem was well understood in the wake of the First World War. Today, however, software-defined systems are highly vulnerable to bespoke electronic countermeasures, while also being disproportionately effective when compared with non-software-defined capabilities. The result is that a force must use software-defined systems to be competitive, but the peak effectiveness of a software-defined capability is therefore operationally short-lived and, once the enemy has adapted, tactically volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This manifested in various ways during the 2023 offensive. First, Western planning assumptions about the effects deliverable by precision munitions proved exaggerated, owing to enemy countermeasures. Excalibur and GMLRS suffered from this. Second, Ukraine found that with systems such as UAVs, a rapid refresh rate of both software and radios was necessary to maintain their effectiveness. This impinged, however, on their ability to scale production and therefore to reap the rewards of their technical advantage. Instead, innovations would be tested at small scale and deployed at moderate scale when industry could begin supplying a solution. However, the adversary would develop exquisite countermeasures before production could be accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is evident that this interaction is going to be a feature of future conflict. It poses major challenges to how NATO militaries contract industry, how systems are tested and validated, and how training and safety of systems is managed. Other than for night-one capabilities, designed to open the door, it is clear that maintaining technological advantage, and thus a qualitative edge, must be premised on having software engineers in tactical formations empowered to interfere with systems, and the ability to rapidly swap out hardware components like radios without having to discard the platforms to which they were attached. Vendors must be incentivised to provide sub-systems and to understand that there will be repeat custom cyclically as they adapt their products, rather than refining a single product and endeavouring to lock the customer into keeping with it. In many states, this will require legislative changes to oversight. Within operational – rather than tactical – timeframes, however, this is crucial to maintaining tempo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diversification-of-last-mile-resupply&quot;&gt;Diversification of Last-Mile Resupply&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistence of surveillance over the frontline, combined with cheap and scalable precision strike using UAVs, poses a particular threat to the resupply of forces on the offence because the available ground lines of communication become constrained to established breaches and are therefore easy to monitor. Furthermore, deception and other methods aimed at keeping resupply vehicles alive are irrelevant once they are forced to traverse known routes, where the enemy will not have to deal with false positives. Moreover, the pressure put by the enemy on lead elements through counterattack means that they can impose when resupply and casualty evacuation is most critical, limiting the agency the offensive force has to shape conditions to enable last-mile resupply. Resupply vehicles must also be supported in breaching artillery-delivered scattered mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One answer for this is that last-mile resupply becomes a combined arms endeavour requiring the layering of air defence, counterbattery fires, EW, engineering support and other measures to create windows of opportunity for movement. This is extremely resource intensive and, in Ukraine’s case, resources are lacking. In certain circumstances, resupply may have to become the main effort of a force’s supporting arms, but this is highly undesirable and, in any case, limits the number of resupplies that can be achieved. Although not directly related to last-mile resupply, the inability to advance less protected support platforms such as artillery and medical support, owing to the persistent threat of precision strike over the forward line of own troops (FLOT), is a further challenge that limits the ability to keep support and enablers moving forwards with the combat arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, methods must be found for diversifying last-mile resupply. The UK, in particular, has been experimenting extensively with uncrewed systems in this role. While helicopters are expensive to operate and vulnerable in the face of Russian air defences, UAVs may offer a means to move pallets of food, water and ammunition forwards. Using uncrewed ground vehicles for breaching similarly offers the opportunity to widen and multiply the lanes through which supplies can pass. Uncrewed ground vehicle technology is not currently ideally suited to offensive obstacle breaching, because it is easily knocked out through damage to key sensors and often depends on remote control, while such breaching must be done either from close proximity to the vehicle or via fixed cable. Once behind the FLOT, however, such systems have significant potential, and experimentation in this space could mature the capability until it is able to support offensive breaching operations. Increasing the throughput of materiel and thereby extending the reach and endurance of a given assault unit buys time for the breach to be expanded, for additional forces to echelon through and ultimately for the maintenance of momentum. Medical evacuation via UAV is more morally complex, but in many instances may improve the rate of survival considerably by allowing casualties to be recovered across complex or denied terrain to a medical facility in a hardened position where a better standard of care can be provided. Improving the rate of survival from injury also has a positive effect on morale, contributing to the maintenance of momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important context in which NATO members should examine this problem is how it relates to gap crossing. Russia’s control of Kherson Oblast was ultimately rendered unsustainable because of Ukraine’s ability to interdict crossing points. Ukraine’s decision not to exploit its opportunity in Krynky was driven by the assessment that a force large enough to have any significant impact on the left bank of the Dnipro could not be supported across it. Any terrain analysis of NATO’s eastern flank shows that wet gaps are regular terrain features. How NATO members can develop capabilities for emplacing and protecting crossings is therefore a vital conceptual area for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vulnerability-of-critical-enablers&quot;&gt;Vulnerability of Critical Enablers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final significant challenge that must be overcome conceptually is the vulnerability of critical enablers such as engineering vehicles. Historically, this has been addressed by heavily protecting these platforms and by having them covered by main battle tanks. The concept has been that although ATGM operators and hostile main battle tanks will seek to engage breaching vehicles, this will reveal their positions and allow them to be engaged and destroyed by overwatching direct fires. Psychologically, the threat of this rapid and lethal response has the effect of suppressing the scale at which threats manifest. Speed then reduces the time available for the enemy to safely execute engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under modern conditions, this concept of overwatch is deeply flawed. The problem is that an increasing array of threat systems, from FPV drones to non-line-of-sight ATGMs and UAV-mounted laser designation for artillery munitions, can be launched and directed from concealed positions. This means that individual prestige equipment can be picked out. It also extends the timeframe within which it can be targeted, because those launching these munitions can fire multiple times and can concentrate on guiding their munition without concern about receiving fire. The result is a high probability of mission kill against key enabling equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolving this problem requires new approaches to offensive suppression and to the design of enabling equipment. For offensive suppression, the utilisation of loitering munitions, provided with target coordinates by EW baselines, could enable strikes on operators of threat systems that are otherwise safe beyond line of sight of their targets. An equivalent to the Lancet-3M would be very useful for this. It would also require an uplift in the density of Ukrainian EW baselines at brigade level to identify enemy UAV operators and engage them. For defensive measures, the utilisation of multispectral smoke would help, although not entirely alleviate, the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical line of effort, however, is that if these vehicles can be picked out then it follows that they will be attrited. More of them are therefore required. At present, these are often prestige assets and are heavily protected, able to carry out a range of functions. It seems likely that the number of vehicles in engineering units needs to increase, while their flexibility and complexity needs to decrease to make such an uplift in platforms affordable. Furthermore, the diversification of tasks that can be carried out with modules mounted on other armoured vehicles should be prioritised. If such systems are targetable, then the aim should be to make fewer targets single points of failure in the ability of the force to breach obstacles. It is notable that Israel, when entering Gaza, determined that it required 20 D9 armoured bulldozers per brigade to overcome the anticipated IED threat. D9s may not be ideally suited to combat in Ukraine, but the density of such vehicles is a good yardstick for what should be the aim. The requirement for such an uplift in the number of platforms speaks to a need to change the design priorities for the platforms dedicated to these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The causes of the failure of Ukraine’s offensive operations in 2023 may be summarised as a lack of personnel and critical materiel, inadequate time to train and cohere the relevant forces, the misallocation of personnel to the identified axes, and a lack of solutions to several identified tactical problems. Ensuring that these mistakes are not repeated requires a more deliberate and longer force generation process, and for Ukraine’s international partners to calibrate equipment provision to the outcomes they have stated they want, rather than to what is politically convenient to provide in the short term. Given that addressing these challenges requires the industrial mobilisation of Europe, and that this has started late, it will take some time before Ukraine can recommence major offensive operations. Creating the conditions for the eventual termination of the war on favourable terms must be achieved through shaping in the intervening period. This has driven a change in how Ukraine looks to fight the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the current phase of the conflict, the AFU’s focus is on inflicting maximum damage on the Russian Federation, not on liberating Ukrainian territories at any cost. On the battlefield, the AFU is prioritising the destruction of those systems that the AFRF will struggle to replace or repair. The AFU is also building extensive defensive positions to try to maximise the AFRF rate of losses for any gains made on the battlefield. Such a damage-centric approach is intended to buy the maximum possible time, both for force generation and for damage to be inflicted in the deep. For Ukraine’s international partners, provision of artillery ammunition and long-range strike systems are most important in support of this effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s capacity to continue its aggression against Ukraine is fundamentally a result of its large capital reserves. The ability to pay high salaries to contract soldiers is enabling Russia’s regeneration of forces, while money generated from petrochemical exports allows Russia to expand military equipment production, even as sanctions and supply chain disruption drive up the price. Ukraine is therefore targeting oil and gas infrastructure in Russia to initially reduce its reserves and thereafter the availability of liquid capital. Ukraine’s international partners can support this effort by targeting the manufacturing facilities of Russia’s defence industries, and the global supply chains that allow Russia to sustain the war, through rigorously enforced sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another line of effort for inflicting damage on Russia is the use of information operations to reduce Russian confidence in the rouble, and to take measures to drive up inflation. Creating a felt cost of the conflict for the Russian population, and ascribing blame for that feeling to local officials, increases the jeopardy for the Russian government as the war protracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying time and slowing Russian force expansion are ways to support the regeneration of offensive combat power. To regenerate this power, Ukraine must levy troops that it does not immediately commit as battlefield replacements, but instead allows to train collectively until they are tactically proficient. This requires the opportunity to exercise headquarters to enable Ukrainian units to operate at scale. The combat arms officers leading such formations must also be familiar with using electronic protection, reconnaissance and attack so that they can protect their units once committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for the commitment of additional forces should not be fixed in relation to a timeline governed by political expectations. Instead, the AFU should plan a shaping operation to create the conditions for offensive operations to be possible. While critical conditions are being established, Ukraine’s international partners must work with these units to develop methods of overcoming the threat from Russian long-range fires. These include effective counter- reconnaissance capabilities, and the ability to protect the logistics routes in support of offensive operations and key enablers supporting offensive action. If these measures are not taken, Ukraine risks prolonging the conflict without shifting its trajectory, with tragic consequences for both the country and the security of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（18日）踏入第56日審訊。李家田昨天完成作供，其餘被告不作供。法官張慧玲指現階段所有證供已完結，並押後至下周四（25日）進行結案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;承認事實指警方設近20條防線圍封理大-晚上10時作拘捕&quot;&gt;承認事實指警方設近20條防線圍封理大 晚上10時作拘捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李家田作供時透露，自己被困理大而沒有出席「屠龍」會議。代表李家田的大律師林芷瑩，與控方商討關於警方圍封理大的承認事實。控方讀出第二份承認事實，指2019年11月17日下午，理大附近道路被阻塞及放火焚燒，而橫跨紅隧收費廣場的北面行人天橋更遭嚴重焚毀。警方基於局勢極為緊張及危險，警方制定包圍計劃，從而說服理大人士投降。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在圍封行動中設立近20條防線，包括在柯士甸道近漆咸道南、科學館道近科學館徑、南橋、北橋等地點設防線，防止「暴徒」逃離理大。警方亦將香港體育館設定為臨時羈留處，處理投降人士。警方於17日晚上7時完成圍封，初步計劃在8時起開始以「暴動」罪拘捕理大內人士，但基於校內人士眾多，於是推遲至10時才進行拘捕行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方於17日晚上9時半呼籲理大人士從Y出口離開，並在10時後以「暴動罪」拘捕從理大出來的人，但被核實為記者或急救員的人士不會被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;逾千人被捕-另有300名未成年學生&quot;&gt;逾千人被捕 另有300名未成年學生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於18日晚上9時許，指定人士獲准自行承擔風險，進入理大充當說客。警方收到消息可能有逾100名中學生仍在理大內，大部分人感困惑或已受傷，但害怕被捕後遭警方粗暴對待而不想投降。直至11月29日，警方將理大交回大學管理層處理，警方行動亦告終結。由11月11日至29日，超過1,100名人士被捕或被紀錄資料，另有300名為未成年學生。警方在校園內發現汽油彈、化學品及其他武器；校園內亦遭嚴重破壞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;其餘被告不作供-所有證供完結&quot;&gt;其餘被告不作供 所有證供完結&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其餘3名被告賴振邦、許湛榮及劉佩凝均不作供，亦不傳召辯方證人。法官張慧玲指，現階段所有證供完結，並將案件押後至下周四（25日）進行結案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（19日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

The fragile interconnectedness of the norms urges global action to reinforce these pillars and prevent a destabilizing cascade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, nuclear norms have faced significant challenges, as exemplified by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s November 2023 decision to withdraw Russia’s ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). This decision is part of a broader trend undermining nuclear institutions, such as the breakdown of bilateral arms control dialogue and the failure to achieve consensus within the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The erosion of these norms poses a critical question for the international community: Can the nuclear order be maintained — or will it collapse under persistent contestation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes the health of three key nuclear norms: nonproliferation, nonuse, and no testing. The findings indicate that while these norms are broadly supported and critical for stability, they are increasingly contested. The research paints a picture of a network of nuclear norms under stress. This contestation is led by a relatively small cast of characters, but growing friction within nuclear institutions from multiple directions and by a wide set of actors also challenges the existing nuclear order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norm development is frequently depicted as a cascade, yet this cascade can also operate in reverse should a norm experience significant weakening. Such a reverse normative cascade has the potential to make the nuclear order collapse like a house of cards, whereby the violation of a single nuclear norm, such as the norm against testing, could have knock-on effects potentially undermining other norms, such as the one against proliferation. The interconnected nature of these norms means that a significant weakening of one could lead to a cascade effect, jeopardizing the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear norms are interdependent, and a normative cascade can go both ways: While the norms are often represented as stand-alone pillars, these pillars are arranged like dominoes: if one falls, another could follow. Proliferation, for example, has historically been followed by testing, and it could undermine the credibility of not only the NPT and CTBT but also their associated norms. Similarly, any use of a nuclear weapon could call into question the entire nuclear order and its ability to restrain nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Norm cascades or reverse cascades are exacerbated by regional dynamics: For example, Russia’s suspension of arms control agreements, such as New START, correlates with its invasion of Ukraine. States’ decisions to observe norms, therefore, depend not only on the wider international security environment, but particularly on the regional security environment and perceptions of threats from neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear testing is strong, but the weakest of the three: The norm against nuclear testing faces the most active contestation, highlighted by North Korea’s ongoing testing over the past decade and Russia’s potential resumption of testing. Another challenge is coming from contestation of the CTBT. One point of contestation is the treaty’s delayed entry into force, which remains a distant and unlikely prospect both because of the security environment and because of domestic political polarization, particularly within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treating nuclear possessors as a monolith could undermine nuclear norms: Many international actors treat all nuclear possessors as norm contesters because of nuclear modernization programs and continued reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Overall, third-party responses have been strongly supportive of upholding all three norms. However, responses to potential nuclear use and nuclear threats have been less strong than the other two norms. The main example of this is the hesitant international response to Russia’s threats of nuclear use related to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Nuclear Possessors: Continue to uphold and reinforce nuclear norms through transparency, restraint, and collective efforts such as the P5 process (involving China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND) initiative. Specific activities might include reciprocal visits to test sites, along with incorporating risks of emerging technologies into multilateral dialogues. To strengthen the nonproliferation norm, the United States and United Kingdom can be more explicit about the historical nonproliferation benefits of extended nuclear deterrence. Additionally, states should refrain from explicit nuclear threats or escalatory language, such as threatening “World War III.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the P3 (France, the United Kingdom, the United States): Lead efforts in risk reduction and norm reinforcement, engaging with both nuclear and non-nuclear states to address emerging threats and regional dynamics. These efforts might take place within the context of CEND, the initiative on irreversible nuclear disarmament (IND), or other new risk reduction efforts. This will require continuing to operate within the P5 process, but the P3 can also engage either bilaterally or multilaterally with a wider group of non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to understand and strengthen norms at the regional level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Non-Nuclear Possessors and Civil Society: Play an active role in norm enforcement, particularly in the context of the NPT. One specific area where NNWS and civil society can strengthen nuclear norms is to avoid treating nuclear possessors as a monolith. They should also continue to pressure the P5 to continue with their dialogues and to address the risks of weakening norms in the context of emerging technologies, transparency of doctrine, and risk reduction initiatives. This group should also play an important role in championing the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty and CTBT. A final point is that civil society can lead the way in public denouncements of norm violations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is a call not only for nuclear weapon states (NWS) to uphold the nuclear norm network, but also for leadership by key states, such as the United Kingdom and United States, to engage with NNWS to strengthen norms and hold norm violators accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On March 13, 2024, Russian president Vladimir Putin added to his list of nuclear threats, stating that Moscow was ready to use nuclear weapons in case of a threat to “the existence of the Russian state, our sovereignty and independence.” This statement was the latest in a string of challenges to nuclear institutions, including the breakdown of bilateral arms control dialogue and the failure to reach consensus in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), often cited as the cornerstone of the nuclear order. In a statement to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in 2024, for example, UK ambassador James Kariuki cited the importance of the NPT in “preventing the erosion of non-proliferation.” Nuclear norms are being tested from multiple directions, and how the international community responds to these challenges will determine if the nuclear order can be stabilized through existing institutions or whether it faces an era of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining the status of nuclear norms is not a purely academic exercise, although much of the thinking about norms is rooted in scholarship. The health of nuclear norms also has direct policy implications. Policy objectives for the international community, particularly for nuclear weapon states (NWS) with unique nuclear responsibilities, include upholding existing nuclear norms so as to avoid escalation to nuclear use or nuclear proliferation. The nuclear order, to include institutions and norms, is important because it provides stability and predictability on nuclear risks in a time of growing uncertainty. Treaties, norms, and other commonly observed practices inhibit potentially dangerous behaviors such as nuclear proliferation or testing, along with upholding the taboo against nuclear use. But a worsening security environment and new technologies, among other factors, threaten to undermine nuclear norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Nuclear norms are being tested from multiple directions, and how the international community responds to these challenges will determine if the nuclear order can be stabilized through existing institutions or whether it faces an era of uncertainty.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three norms serve as the foundation of the nuclear order: nonproliferation, nonuse, and no testing. This study uses an analytical framework to assess the health of these three nuclear norms and to identify policy options for strengthening them. The research paints a picture of an increasingly contested network of nuclear norms. This contestation is led by a relatively small cast of characters, but growing friction within nuclear institutions from multiple directions and by a wide set of actors also challenges the existing nuclear order. Much of the current contestation is driven by regional and domestic factors — including individuals — rather than by major strategic shifts or great power competition. Norm development is frequently depicted as a cascade, yet this cascade can also operate in reverse should a norm experience significant weakening. Such a reverse normative cascade has the potential to make the nuclear order collapse like a house of cards, whereby the violation of a single nuclear norm, such as the norm against testing, could have knock-on effects potentially undermining other norms, such as the one against proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proceeds in three sections. First, it provides an overview of the three key nuclear norms. Second, it uses an analytical framework to assess the health of nuclear norms and identify which are strongest as well as which are being contested and by whom on the basis of concordance, third-party responses, compliance, and implementation. This framework is derived from robust scholarship on norm evolution and health, and it demonstrates the value of bridging the academic and policy communities on pressing nuclear issues. Finally, the paper summarizes the four main findings from the analytical framework and offers a series of policy recommendations for strengthening norms, such as greater transparency, cooperative efforts to reduce nuclear risks, and public denouncement of norm violations. The paper is a call not only for NWS to uphold the nuclear norm network, but also for leadership by key states, such as the United Kingdom and United States, to engage with non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) to strengthen norms and hold norm violators accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;Three Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonproliferation, Nonuse, and No Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Krepon, in his 2021 book Winning and Losing the Nuclear Peace, emphasized the importance of sustaining the norms against nuclear proliferation, the use of nuclear weapons in warfare, and further nuclear weapons testing. Krepon argued that arms control efforts should focus on upholding these norms. Like Krepon, this paper does not include norms of disarmament or deterrence in its analysis, given that disarmament and abolition “reflect aspirational standards that have been beyond reach for every generation that has lived uneasily with nuclear danger. . . . The human costs of continued warfare have been great, but not anywhere near as great as in wars fought before the Bomb was invented.” Similarly, it does not include disarmament as a norm because while disarmament is captured in NPT Article VI and nuclear arsenals have been reduced by approximately 88 percent since the height of the Cold War, progress toward disarmament has stagnated and is not a consistent practice. Additionally, scholarship by Jean-Baptiste Jeangene Vilmer and Lawrence Freedman has demonstrated that nuclear disarmament does not constitute a norm because it does not have a norm “entrepreneur” among nuclear possessors and may fail to fully emerge. Nuclear deterrence, conversely, remains a consistent practice among nuclear possessors and states covered by extended nuclear deterrence (such as within NATO), and it is also occasionally cited as consistent with the norm of nonuse. But nuclear deterrence remains widely contested among NNWS and much of civil society, and it has not reached the same widespread acceptance as the nuclear taboo, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset, it is important to recognize the potential limits of focusing on norms as an indicator of the strength of the nuclear order and as a policy framework. Norms are intended to set rules of the road to shape broader behaviors. The hope is that a norm violation would inspire widespread condemnation and outrage. However, sometimes outrage is not enough to shape states’ behavior in the face of unprecedented security threats. Norms are neither valued nor observed symmetrically among states, possessors and non-possessors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the three nuclear norms and their approximate years of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RNEU3kC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Nuclear Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear nonproliferation norm is defined as a set of principles, agreements, and international efforts aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-applicable nuclear technology and information. Koplow, for example, defines the nonproliferation regime as “the set of treaties, agreements, conventions, formal and informal groupings, rules, and norms that seek to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.” Despite four nuclear-armed countries remaining outside of the 1968 NPT, nuclear nonproliferation has been marked by the widespread international recognition that having more states with nuclear weapons would be destabilizing and could increase the risks of nuclear use. The treaty itself, supported by 191 countries, states that “the proliferation of nuclear weapons would seriously enhance the danger of nuclear war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present analysis focuses on the norm against horizontal proliferation: the spread of nuclear weapons and materials between states or other international actors. This paper does not include so-called vertical proliferation (i.e., nuclear modernization) as part of the norm. Established nuclear powers, including the United States, Russia, and China, continue to modernize, and in some cases expand, their arsenals, which challenges the emergence of a norm against vertical proliferation. Despite their commitments to nuclear disarmament, these states justify their proliferation efforts based on security imperatives, technological advancements, and the perceived necessity of maintaining credible deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear weapon use is largely based on the recognition of the potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear detonations and the potential for escalation associated with the use of nuclear weapons. It dates back over seven decades, emerging after the United States used atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The norm endured the end of the nuclear monopoly with the development of nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union, as well as the intense geopolitical rivalry of the Cold War era, when the threat of nuclear warfare loomed large. However, despite the temptation to employ nuclear weapons, both superpowers exhibited restraint, recognizing the immense consequences of nuclear conflict and the risk of mutual assured destruction. As Nina Tannenwald highlights, for example, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Secretary of State Dean Rusk opposed the use of nuclear weapons during the Vietnam War because of the fallout risks and unacceptable destruction, reinforcing the taboo against nuclear use. Similarly, the Soviet Union chose to lose the war in Afghanistan rather than seek to achieve its objectives through “winning” with the use of nuclear weapons. Subsequent diplomatic efforts, international treaties, and various arms control agreements — such as the 1973 Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War — strengthened the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the norm against nuclear testing refers to a shared understanding that states will refrain from conducting explosive nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, underwater, in outer space, underground, or anywhere on earth. The first nuclear test was conducted by the United States in July 1945. After that, nuclear testing quickly became a crucial aspect of the Cold War competition between Washington and Moscow. The United States conducted 1,032 tests and the Soviet Union conducted 715, with the Castle Bravo test being the worst radiological disaster in U.S. history due to its contamination of local civilians on the Marshall Islands. The subsequent arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union fueled an extensive period of testing in different domains. However, concerns over the environmental and humanitarian consequences led to international efforts to halt testing, beginning as early as 1954. After a testing moratorium was put in place between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union between 1958 and 1961, as well as limited test ban agreements, a new test ban was proposed in 1990. The norm is now supported by various agreements and initiatives aimed at reducing the risks associated with nuclear testing. Major legal mechanisms to identify concordance with the norm are the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT), which prohibited atmospheric testing, and its successor, the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which further restricted nuclear testing. The CTBT has not yet entered into force. Since it was opened for signature, none of the NPT’s NWS have engaged in nuclear testing; however, India and Pakistan tested in 1998, and North Korea continues to test or threaten to test nuclear weapons as part of its nuclear signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to acknowledge at the outset a high degree of dynamism across the three norms, as evident in their evolution, interaction, and roles in shaping international relations. They essentially form a network of reinforcing mechanisms for nuclear stability. The norm against the use of nuclear weapons, for example, emerged amid Cold War rivalries, with both superpowers laying the groundwork for mutual restraint. Recognizing that any conflict between the two would have catastrophic consequences, President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev agreed at the Geneva Summit in 1985 that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Since the emergence of these norms, their robustness has varied due to fluctuations in levels of enforcement, adherence, and the institutional strength of the United Nations and other international bodies. Despite varying degrees of strength over time, these norms, working in concert, serve as the foundation of the nuclear order, highlighting the dynamic interplay between policy, historical evolution, and contemporary challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-health-of-nuclear-norms&quot;&gt;The Health of Nuclear Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section assesses the robustness and health of the three nuclear norms. Informed by case studies in security and humanitarian law, an analytical framework from Nicole Deitelhoff and Lisbeth Zimmermann identifies conditions affecting the strength, resilience, and durability of global norms. While it can seem in the nuclear policy discourse that these nuclear norms are on the verge of disappearing, the framework shows that they tend to be much more robust than many others in international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four common critical indicators across norms in security studies: concordance, third-party responses, compliance, and implementation. The first two constitute discourse-based metrics of a norm’s strength, whereas the third and fourth components are practice-based and entail specific behaviors. The four indicators are equally weighted to evaluate a norm’s robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Concordance with the norm describes the acceptance of a norm’s legitimacy by a state or the general public. It is characterized by belief in norm-enforcing entities, including institutions tasked with monitoring or implementing the norm. Concordance is also measured by the absolute and relative number of ratifications and the standard and quality of opt-out clauses. High concordance, for example, would see universal or near-universal participation in international treaties, with few, if any, opt-out clauses. Low concordance, conversely, would be shown by the absence of international agreements capturing a norm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third-party responses to norm violations can include discursive and material sanctioning. Strong third-party responses include universal sanctioning to noncompliance. Weak responses, such as ignoring or directly or indirectly endorsing violations, would rank low in third-party responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compliance indicates behavior consistent with norms. This is evaluated by how widespread or rare compliance is. All norms encounter a certain amount of noncompliance, often inadvertent, and compliance alone does not explain robustness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implementation of a norm is critical and can help illustrate when norms withstand challenges. This is measured through the inclusion of norms in policy papers and protocols, the creation of institutions, or the adoption of norms into domestic law. Compliance and implementation are practice-based dimensions to measure the robustness of norms over time and across cases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of this framework offers insights into the robustness of international norms. Table 2 provides an overall assessment of the strength of the nuclear norms, evaluating them from moderate, to strong, to very strong. The table includes some nonexhaustive examples. Justification for the metrics of “Very Strong” to “Moderate” is explained below in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5BxtjRc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Assessing Nuclear Norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that this framework alone does not inherently capture dynamic factors, such as the mutually reinforcing nature of many of these norms. Nor does it capture the evolution of the norms over time, an important point of analysis given changing strategic and technological landscapes. Below is a more in-depth analysis, including consideration of dynamism across the norms, to better understand the health of the three nuclear norms and their relationships to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonproliferation&quot;&gt;Nonproliferation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The norm against nuclear proliferation has high concordance in policies and treaties, making the norm very robust. The NPT is a cornerstone of global cooperation against nuclear proliferation, with near-universal acceptance, from 191 UN members, creating a robust legal framework against nuclear proliferation. In addition to the NPT, UNSC Resolution 1540 further solidified efforts against proliferation by mandating member states to establish legal measures against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The nuclear nonproliferation regime encompasses various formal agreements, institutions, and informal groupings beyond the NPT and UNSC resolution. These elements — including nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZ), institutions such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and other informal efforts (e.g., the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Zanger Committee, the four Nuclear Security Summits, the Six-Party Talks, and the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament initiative) — contribute to the strengthening of the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope and number of institutions and groupings committed to nuclear nonproliferation signal a widespread third-party response to violations. Breaches of the norm prohibiting nuclear proliferation have prompted robust responses from numerous actors, eliciting international condemnation, economic sanctions, and diplomatic isolation. Whether from individual state actors, alliances such as the European Union, or the UNSC, there is a historical precedent of condemning norm violations by would-be proliferators. The UNSC Sanctions Committee on North Korea, for example, was created in 2006 to address North Korea’s nuclear testing and proliferation activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With high acceptance rates, compliance with the norm against nuclear proliferation is nearly universal. The IAEA, through comprehensive safeguards agreements and the Additional Protocol, plays a crucial role in verifying compliance. For instance, the agency conducted numerous inspections in Iran to ensure adherence to its nuclear obligations. Regional organizations also ensure adherence to specific treaties, emphasizing the multilevel implementation of the norm. For example, the compliance with the obligations of the Treaty of Tlatelolco is ensured by the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the African Commission on Nuclear Energy ensures the implementation of the Treaty of Pelindaba. Overall, the norm against nuclear proliferation exhibits high robustness due to its concordance, reactions to violations, and effective implementation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, today the nonproliferation norm faces challenges from various actors. Iran’s nuclear program poses a major provocation, and while Iran claims that its activities are intended for peaceful purposes, Western nations and international organizations have raised concerns about the intent and extent of its nuclear endeavors. Similarly, North Korea’s withdrawal from the NPT in 2003 and its development of nuclear weapons have been an ongoing challenge to the nonproliferation norm. Efforts to negotiate and redefine norms related to nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula continue amid diplomatic tensions. Additionally, in March 2024, Russia vetoed the mandate of a UN Panel of Experts tasked with monitoring enforcement of the sanctions regime against North Korea. This not only weakens the implementation of the norm but also suggests a weakening in third-party responses to norm violation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overall, the norm against nuclear proliferation exhibits high robustness due to its concordance, reactions to violations, and effective implementation mechanisms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But potential challenges to the nonproliferation norm are also coming from new directions. Given the threat from North Korea’s nuclear program, South Korea may contest the norm against nuclear proliferation, although the likelihood of this is hard to measure. However, polling data shows a gap in public and elite opinions on the issue of South Korea developing an independent nuclear program. A majority (71 percent) of the South Korean public supports an independent nuclear deterrent, while only one-third of the elite supports it (34 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has stated that if Iran did successfully develop a weapon, Saudia Arabia “will have to get one.” Of course, Iran’s ongoing nuclear program itself challenges the nonproliferation norm. While officially endorsing the NPT, concerns persist about Saudi Arabia’s potential interest in developing its nuclear capabilities, posing challenges to existing norms. Saudi Arabia pursuing a nuclear program would hold serious implications for regional stability and the integrity of nonproliferation efforts. Whether or not South Korea, Saudia Arabia, or other states pursue an independent nuclear weapons program will depend not only on regional security dynamics but also on the restraining power of institutions such as the NPT. At present, it is hard to imagine that South Korea, for example, would be the second state to withdraw from the NPT after North Korea. However, if the normative power of the NPT or other nuclear institutions weakens over time, that restraining power may diminish as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonuse&quot;&gt;Nonuse&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, there is high concordance with the norm of nonuse, yet there are fewer legal mechanisms to enforce this norm compared to nonproliferation. While the NPT — the primary treaty for nonproliferation — does not explicitly prohibit nuclear use, norms regulating potential nuclear use (or nonuse) are directly and indirectly addressed through international humanitarian law. However, international humanitarian law refers to the use of force more broadly, rather than nuclear use specifically. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) explicitly refers to the prohibition of nuclear use, but the treaty is not universally accepted. Despite some reservations, the ratification of NWFZs contributes to increasing concordance regionally. For example, a basic party obligation in the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia is “not to allow in its territory: the production, acquisition, stationing, storage or use, of any nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Generally, there is high concordance with the norm of nonuse, yet there are fewer legal mechanisms to enforce this norm compared to nonproliferation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party reactions&lt;/strong&gt; to the use of nuclear weapons have been strong. Acting and former UN secretary-generals António Guterres and Kofi Annan both called out the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan in 1945 as a moment of unmatched horror for humanity. Reactions to the threat of use, however, have been fairly mixed, with condemnation by many Western states, but overall the responses have not been universal. Guterres told the UNSC in March 2024 that “nuclear saber-rattling must stop [and] threats to use nuclear weapons in any capacity are unacceptable.” Steen Hansen, minister counsellor of the European Union, similarly condemned Russian threats as dangerous and unacceptable. But many other international actors have remained largely silent about Russian nuclear threats amid the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third-party actors, including civil society groups and human rights organizations, bolster norm robustness by condemning nuclear use and emphasizing humanitarian and environmental effects. This ranges from the Hibakusha — people affected by the atomic bombings of Japan — to scientific groups such as the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. For example, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons issued a statement in 2022 condemning “nuclear threats [as] unacceptable at any time, by anyone. Putin’s threats increase the risk of escalation to a nuclear conflict.” In 2023, Chinese president Xi Jinping emphasized the need for the international community to “jointly oppose the use of, or threats to use, nuclear weapons.” But not all actors were swift to condemn Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling. The first TPNW Meeting of States Parties, for example, failed to call out Russian nuclear threats, despite the treaty explicitly prohibiting the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons. Some nations with close economic or security ties to Russia, particularly in Central Asia, were hesitant to openly criticize Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance&lt;/strong&gt; with the norm is nearly universal, with few actors showing behavior that would suggest an intent to break the nearly 80-year tradition of nuclear nonuse. States have largely been dissuaded from using nuclear weapons in conflicts since the first use of atomic weapons in 1945. While nonuse has persisted, there have been nuclear threats. The United States and the Soviet Union issued nuclear threats during the Berlin Crisis (1958–61) and Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), North Korea has threatened South Korea and its allies multiple times over recent decades, and India and Pakistan have made veiled threats against each other in the past. More recently, nuclear threats have been an integral part of Putin’s strategy for deterring Western intervention in the ongoing war in Ukraine. In February 2024, for example, Putin stated that Western nations “must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory.” The extent to which these threats have the potential to lower the threshold for nuclear use remains unclear, but they should not be discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt; of the norm occurs at various levels, with regional enforcement through NWFZ agreements indicating high implementation — with the caveat that countries in NWFZs cannot use or threaten to use nuclear weapons and none of these states possess nuclear weapons. NWFZs are an example of the interconnectedness of the nuclear norms, with some institutions and actors encompassing all three nuclear norms. Some states include the norm against nuclear use in their domestic nuclear strategy through declared no-first-use policies, adding a level of implementation. Other domestic efforts such as law of war manuals subject nuclear use to the principles of proportionality and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-testing&quot;&gt;No Testing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concordance&lt;/strong&gt; with the norm against nuclear testing is captured primarily in legal mechanisms such as the PTBT and CTBT. While the CTBT is considered the cornerstone of efforts to halt global nuclear testing, it has not yet entered into force due to reluctance by a key group of states to ratify or sign the treaty. Nevertheless, nuclear possessors, with the exception of North Korea, continue to refrain from nuclear testing. Although a significant number of countries have ratified the treaty, the absence of universal participation from nuclear states could diminish the robustness of concordance with the norm, according to the analytical framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violations of the norm have elicited strong &lt;strong&gt;third-party reactions&lt;/strong&gt; in recent years, including international condemnation and sanctions by individual states as well as the European Union and the UNSC. Civil society efforts by affected communities and organizations have also played a significant role in condemning nuclear testing, resulting in legislative measures such as the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in the United States. Strong reactions are nearly universal and occur at various levels. For example, the UNSC has passed nearly a dozen sanctions on North Korea since 2006 because of the state’s nuclear program. This includes sanctions on military and arms trade, along with impacts on the financial assets of key individuals, in response to nuclear testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the norm against nuclear testing taking hold with the end of the Cold War, a handful of states have continued testing to develop their nuclear weapons programs. There have been 10 nuclear tests since the CTBT opened for signature in 1996: two by India (1998), two by Pakistan (1998), and six by North Korea (2006, 2009, 2013, two in 2016, and 2017). Compliance has been widespread over the past 30 years, although there have been concerns about low-yield testing, particularly by Russia, such as those raised by the U.S. State Department’s annual compliance report. Thus, while the nonproliferation norm is supported by an active treaty and the nuclear nonuse norm lacks a universally accepted treaty, the nuclear testing norm is upheld by a treaty that is not yet in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the nonproliferation norm is supported by an active treaty and the nuclear nonuse norm lacks a universally accepted treaty, the nuclear testing norm is upheld by a treaty that is not yet in force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt; of the norm involves various verification methods, including monitoring stations and radionuclide laboratories operated by CTBT signatories. The treaty relies on data from monitoring stations around the world, which is collected and analyzed by the International Data Center. While all signatories have access to this data, only countries that have ratified the treaty are considered full participants. Regional enforcement mechanisms, such as those embedded in NWFZs, signal a high level of implementation in specific regional zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and the United States have engaged in extensive discussions regarding the interpretation of the CTBT. Although both countries have signed the treaty, they hold differing views on what constitutes a violation, illustrating applicatory contestation as they negotiate the scope and interpretation of the norm against nuclear testing. A key point of contention is the concept of zero-yield testing. The CTBT bans all nuclear explosions, but some argue that explosions with an immeasurably small yield are not truly nuclear tests and should be permissible. Putin’s remarks in October 2023 about Russia’s possible readiness to resume nuclear testing reflect this ongoing debate: “I am not ready to tell you right now whether we need or do not need to carry out these tests.” He framed Russia’s potential return to testing as contingent on whether the United States tests. Additionally, some officials in the Trump administration suggested that a return to nuclear testing might be an option. Most recent, Robert C. O’Brien, former national security adviser to Trump, reiterated this need to “test new nuclear weapons for reliability and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like others, the norm against nuclear testing is being contested by a small group of nuclear possessors. North Korea continues to defy the norm by testing or threatening to test nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. Despite international condemnation, Pyongyang argues that such tests are vital for its defensive capabilities. A public statement accompanying one of its 2016 tests emphasized North Korea’s right to self-defense and its intention to bolster its nuclear force against perceived threats, particularly from the United States. Additionally, Russia’s deratification of the CTBT in 2023 and Putin’s suggestion that Russia could return to testing also have the potential to undermine the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;avoiding-a-reverse-normative-cascade&quot;&gt;Avoiding a Reverse Normative Cascade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normative framework presents both a positive but also a cautionary tale. Overall, the nuclear norms remain strong and are widely observed, despite contestation by a small group of actors and a worsening security environment. They are buttressed by widespread concordance with treaties and agreements, particularly the NPT and regional initiatives, such as NWFZs. And yet, despite the historical resilience and overall robustness of these norms, they face ongoing challenges and adaptations. The nonuse norm, for example, demonstrates considerable resilience and is widely recognized as “taboo.” And yet it is being contested by continued Russian and North Korean nuclear threats — some of which do not receive widespread international condemnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, this paper’s intention is not to present an overly optimistic perspective, but rather to offer a word of caution. The network of nuclear norms could either be reinforced as a lasting foundation of nuclear order or it could collapse like a house of cards. The interconnected nature of nuclear norms is both their strength and their vulnerability when faced with concerted and persistent contestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The network of nuclear norms could either be reinforced as a lasting foundation of nuclear order or it could collapse like a house of cards. The interconnected nature of nuclear norms is both their strength and their vulnerability when faced with concerted and persistent contestation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question from the analysis is who creates, upholds, and challenges norms. Norm establishment, to include normative cascades, typically requires norm entrepreneurs or key stakeholders that can build domestic and international consensus. Similarly, norm contestation also begins with individuals; the inverse of entrepreneurs are norm contesters. When it comes to nuclear decisionmaking, particularly in authoritarian countries such as North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China, individual leaders play an outsized role. Russia’s threats of nuclear use in the war in Ukraine have been seemingly driven by Putin. North Korea’s nuclear program is driven by Kim Jong-un and has been personalized to the Kim family. This finding aligns with other scholarship pointing to the importance of individuals in international security. Solingen, among others, has found that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . systematic differences in nuclear behavior can be observed between states whose leaders or ruling coalitions advocate integration in the global economy, and those whose leaders reject it. . . . Conversely, leaders and ruling coalitions rejecting internationalization incur fewer such costs and have greater incentives to exploit nuclear weapons as tools in nationalist platforms of political competition and for staying in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the normative framework and the present analysis, this report draws four main conclusions about the health of nuclear norms and the strength of the existing nuclear order. It then offers three sets of recommendations for strengthening nuclear norms, grouped by who should execute them: (1) nuclear possessors, including those in the P5 process (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States); (2) the P3 (France, the United Kingdom, and the United States); and (3) nuclear non-possessors, which includes civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 1: Nuclear norms are interdependent, and a normative cascade can go both ways.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While nuclear norms continue to benefit from widespread international support, particularly in comparison to other international norms, all three are being tested concurrently. This contestation reflects states’ responses to a dynamic and uncertain geopolitical and technological landscape. While the norms are often represented as stand-alone pillars, these pillars are arranged like dominoes: if one falls, another could follow. Norm development is often portrayed as a cascade, but this cascade could also work in reverse if one norm is significantly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, this interconnectedness could contribute to strengthening norms. Third-party responses and compliance could speak to multiple norms at once. For example, the NWFZs contribute to strengthening all three norms. On the other hand, one norm’s breakdown could undermine the others. Proliferation, for example, has historically been followed by testing, and it could undermine the credibility of not only the NPT and CTBT but also their associated norms. Similarly, any use of a nuclear weapon would be a game changer and could call into question the entire nuclear order and its ability to restrain nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 2: Norm cascades or reverse cascades are exacerbated by regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Norm contestation appears particularly linked to regional issues. For example, Russia’s suspension of arms control agreements, such as New START, correlates with its invasion of Ukraine. Similarly, Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling, which has the potential to undermine the norm against nuclear use, is tied to its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Early on, Putin blamed the United States and NATO for its overreach and expansion in Europe: “What the United States is doing in Ukraine is at our doorstep. . . . And they should understand that we have nowhere further to retreat to. Under [U.S.] protection, they are arming and urging on extremists from a neighbouring country at Russia.” For the Middle East, Saudi Arabia’s threat to pursue nuclear weapons is explicitly tied to regional proliferation and stability, namely whether or not Iran develops nuclear weapons. Similarly, in South Asia, violations are tied to the tensions between India and Pakistan. In response to India’s two nuclear tests in 1998, Pakistan announced its own tests only a few days later. States’ decisions to observe norms, therefore, depend not only on the wider international security environment, but particularly on the regional security environment and perceptions of threats from neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 3: The norm against nuclear testing is strong, but the weakest of the three.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The analytical framework indicates that the norm against nuclear testing is currently facing the most active contestation from multiple directions. The most recent violation of any of the three norms occurred due to North Korea’s 2017 test, not to mention its ongoing threats to test again, which all challenge the norm against testing. In 2022, for example, South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol indicated that North Korea had completed preparations for a seventh nuclear test. One positive trend in the norm against testing has been the strong response to North Korea’s most recent nuclear tests, particularly by China. This is an important development compared to earlier nuclear tests; however, given Pyongyang and Moscow’s growing closeness, a future test may not receive consensus or UNSC condemnation. Senior officials from Russia and North Korea are meeting regularly to enhance collaboration across various domains such as the economy, science and technology, and culture. In September 2023, for example, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un traveled to Russia’s Far East to promote military and technological links with Russia. Only a few months later, in June 2024, President Putin made his way to North Korea, likely deepening the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given Pyongyang and Moscow’s growing closeness, a future test may not receive consensus or UNSC condemnation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another challenge is coming from contestation of the CTBT. One point of contestation is the treaty’s delayed entry into force, which remains a distant and unlikely prospect both because of the security environment and because of domestic political polarization, particularly within the United States. The CTBT is also contested by Russia’s deratification. Amid the increasing tensions in the international order, some nuclear-armed states may propose alternative normative frameworks prioritizing national sovereignty over disarmament efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finding 4: Treating nuclear possessors as a monolith could undermine nuclear norms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While this analysis points to a small group of norm contesters, many international actors treat all nuclear possessors as norm contesters because of nuclear modernization programs and continued reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Overall, third-party responses have been strongly supportive of upholding all three norms; however, responses to potential nuclear use and nuclear threats have been less strong than the other two norms. The obvious example of this is the muted international response to Russia’s threats of nuclear use related to Ukraine. While Western leaders, including NATO, explicitly and publicly called out Russian saber-rattling, for example, in the fall of 2022, others were more subdued in their responses. It is believed that Chinese and Indian leaders privately signaled to Putin to de-escalate tensions and nuclear threats in the fall of 2022, but the lack of public outcry does little to strengthen the norms. China and India can take on a more influential role in messaging to Putin the risk that his nuclear threats incur.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these findings, the paper offers three sets of policy recommendations for nuclear possessors and nonpossessors to strengthen existing norms and their associated institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 1: Nuclear Possessors and the P5 Process&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First and foremost, nuclear possessors should continue to observe and uphold the three nuclear norms. This may be more complicated than it appears. For example, a historically successful tool of nonproliferation has been extended nuclear deterrence to allies and partners, which could require strong nuclear deterrence signaling. Francis Gavin points to NATO as an efficient example of this strategy. Another complication is the fine line between threatening nuclear use — which could undermine the norm against use — and policies of nuclear deterrence which hold at risk what an adversary values to prevent escalation. To reconcile these challenges, nuclear possessors, particularly the United States and United Kingdom, can be more explicit about the historical nonproliferation benefits of extended nuclear deterrence. Additionally, states should refrain from explicit nuclear threats or escalatory language, such as threatening “World War III.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition to unilateral restraint and policies, nuclear possessors can also work collectively to uphold and strengthen nuclear norms through forums such as the P5 process as well as the Creating an Environment for Nuclear Disarmament (CEND) and Irreversible Nuclear Disarmament (IND) initiatives. The P5 process is under pressure because of tension in the security environment, but it remains one of the best opportunities for reinforcing norms and reducing risk. Some recent proposals would contribute to strengthening norms against use and testing, such as reciprocal visits to former test sites, a joint statement on a continued testing moratorium, and transparency of doctrines and risk reduction efforts to avoid escalation to nuclear use. The CEND initiative continues to hold plenary meetings, including subgroup work on emerging technologies and risk reduction. One potential area of work would be for CEND participants to identify how emerging technologies, such as additive manufacturing, could undermine norms of nonproliferation. Likewise, the IND initiative is an important opportunity to explore the role of norms in making progress toward political, legal, and technical mechanisms to facilitate irreversible nuclear disarmament.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 2: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States (P3)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Nuclear possessors have unique responsibilities. Ideally, the P5 would act in concert in fulfilling those responsibilities by jointly pursuing many of these opportunities to strengthen nuclear norms. In the absence of P5 unity and consensus, however, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States might lead efforts to pursue these actions. Other opportunities include leading in CEND, IND, and new risk reduction efforts, such as inviting other NWS to join a “human-in-the-loop” commitment in nuclear decisionmaking. There are challenges and risks with this approach. The biggest risk is breaking the P5 process. Undermining the P5 process at a time when the NPT is under pressure could be dangerous. If the P5 process fails to yield substantive results in disarmament, arms control, risk reduction, and transparency, this would be met with deep dissatisfaction by many NNWS and continue to exacerbate polarization within the NPT while inhibiting its ability to serve as a foundation for the nuclear order.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another area of opportunity for the P3 is to engage, either bilaterally or multilaterally, with members of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates) and NNWS to work cooperatively to strengthen nuclear norms. This can include engaging with groupings to better understand risks to nuclear norms at the regional level, along with building consensus around norms against the use and threat of use of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recommendation Set 3: Non-Nuclear Possessors and Civil Society&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;States without nuclear weapons also have responsibilities for upholding nuclear norms, and this paper has demonstrated the importance of third-party responses in contributing to the health of nuclear norms — NWFZs, for example, have a cross-cutting effect on strengthening nuclear norms. But one specific area where NNWS and civil society can strengthen nuclear norms is to avoid treating nuclear possessors as a monolith. All NNWS, including in the context of the NPT review cycle, should call out norm-contesting behavior, such as nuclear threats and withdrawal from existing arms control agreements. These statements can be directed at various members of the P5 process, but they should be specific. They should also continue to pressure the P5 to continue with their dialogues and to address the risks of weakening norms in the context of emerging technologies, transparency of doctrine, and risk reduction initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;One area ripe for NNWS and civil society to increase pressure on nuclear possessors and upholding norms is around fissile material. These groups often criticize the Conference on Disarmament (CD) for failing to make progress in recent years, such as progress toward a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT). This approach, however, treats all CD members as the same, whereas lack of progress on an FMCT can be explicitly linked to two specific states: Pakistan and China. Pakistan continues to ask for a verifiable FMCT that addresses existing stockpiles of fissile material, not just future production, and China emphasizes the need for prioritizing disarmament by NWS, along with issues around verification. These concerns are understandable and grounds for dialogue, but they should not completely derail FMCT efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;One area ripe for NNWS and civil society to increase pressure on nuclear possessors and upholding norms is around fissile material.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NNWS can also play an important role in enforcing the CTBT. By ratifying the CTBT, they contribute to its global legitimacy and pressure NWS to comply. They can engage in diplomatic efforts to advocate for the treaty’s universal adoption and implementation. Additionally, NNWS can increasingly participate in the CTBT’s verification regime, providing data and support to the International Monitoring System, which enhances the treaty’s enforcement and helps detect and call out any illicit nuclear tests in these regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-call-for-action&quot;&gt;A Call for Action&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the current geopolitical climate, there are still positive developments in the nuclear norm landscape worth noting. No new nuclear states have emerged in two decades, and President John F. Kennedy’s fear of dozens of nuclear possessors has not come to fruition. Nuclear weapons have not been used in conflict since 1945. And while North Korea remains the only country continuing to test nuclear weapons, it has been widely condemned as an international pariah as a result. Overall, nuclear norms are healthy — for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three norms are being actively contested amid a worsening geopolitical landscape. For this reason, policymakers should not be complacent about the health of the nuclear order, thinking that it is safe while underpinned by these norms. Instead, they should consider the interconnectedness of nuclear norms, as emphasized in this paper. With the possibility of a reverse normative cascade on the table, where the weakening of one norm could have ripple effects on others and potentially topple the nuclear landscape as it exists today, the risk is too great for policymakers to do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田指行動前一晚無去安全屋 向隊員戲稱正「同啲女仔一齊」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qPLPxYA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（17日）踏入第55日審訊。被告李家田接受控方大律師周凱靈盤問。李多番表示不知道「屠龍」成員討論的「20 kg」、「大Plan」是甚麼，亦不知有隊員藏槍。李稱知道小隊於12月8日在港島有行動，但前一晚決定不前往灣仔安全屋，不過卻騙隊員自己會去，並著對方把鎖匙放門口。他指當時向隊員戲稱自己正「同啲女仔一齊」，並表示「阻人」。李解釋，他引用電影《賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯》中，演員萬梓良的對白：「阻人扑嘢，死咗會畀人燒春袋。」庭上被告聞後不禁發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱自己有入理大-不忿屠龍公開表示無成員進入&quot;&gt;李家田稱自己有入理大 不忿「屠龍」公開表示無成員進入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第八日作供，接受控方代表大律師周凱靈盤問。控方繼續問及李的電話紀錄中，他在 Telegram「滅龍」群組內發出的訊息。2019年11月21日，李在群組發送「屠龍」在「育龍」頻道澄清沒有成員進入理大的訊息，李表示自己曾進入理大，對於「屠龍」的說法感不開心，「覺得佢哋冇當我係屠龍小隊成員」，因此「發晦氣」傳送出來。控方追問：「你以屠龍身份入理大？」李不同意，強調是以個人身份，但認為小隊應公開交代有成員在理大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不知道隊員討論的20-kg指甚麼&quot;&gt;李稱不知道隊員討論的「20 kg」指甚麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於11月22日，有成員在群組發送新聞連結，提及懲教署區域應變大隊成員，以「特務警察」身份借調到警隊，主要負責守衞警方指定的政府處所。其後成員林銘皓 Kan 表示：「我想同佢哋用眼鏡」。李解釋「眼鏡」指槍，而「佢哋」可指懲教署職員。嚴文謙另表示：「我想用 AK 47，搶支 AR 15 都好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，群組成員討論「20 kg」。黃振強早前供稱，他理解「20 kg」是指炸藥。其中張俊富表示：「20 kg 交畀你？」，梁政希則表示：「20 kg 係咪開心嘢？」，並獲林銘皓回覆「Yeah，超開心」。李表示不知道「20 kg」所指的是甚麼，自己亦無詢問。控方質疑，其他成員似乎都知道「20 kg」的意思；李表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李否認曾出席11月兩次小隊會議&quot;&gt;李否認曾出席11月兩次小隊會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李表示沒有出席成員在群組提及的會議或飯局，包括11月17日在荃灣大鴻輝的會議、同月25日在三陂坊的會議。李表示隊員沒有問他為何不出席25日的會議。控方問：「你有冇失落？」、「有冇覺得不被重視？」李回答：「都有少少。」控方指，李服從黃的要求，在地圖寫上「手足」、「搵人跟」等字眼，卻不依照黃的提議參加小隊會議。由於李早前指自己依靠資助到 HKTVmall 領取食物，控方遂質疑：「記唔記得你要去 HKTVmall 領取食物，好艱難？黃振強請你食飯，點解你唔去？」李解釋計算車費後選擇不去。控方指出，李均有出席上述兩次會議；李不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦在群組表示：「票站得兩隻，點睇？I am ready」，成員程于寶則回應「行得」。李解釋，自己當時在區議會選舉的票站觀看點票情況，見到在場有兩名警察。他想起其他小隊會於24日進行激進行動，因此思考會否有關。李又指，「I am ready」是指準備好在現場觀看事件發生，並非指加入其他小隊的行動。李續解釋「行得」可能指「票站」，但遭控方質疑：「個票站會行？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李否認知道小隊有人藏槍&quot;&gt;李否認知道小隊有人藏槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，林銘皓在群組表示：「Poly 游繩嗰個位得6隻」、「想幫佢哋戴眼鏡」。李表示按字面理解，相信對方表達想用槍對付警察。控方問：「你知道『屠龍』小隊有槍？」李不同意並指：「想，可以未有。」成員張銘裕曾在群組傳送引爆裝置的片段，李表示印象中沒有看過該影片。控方指出，成員沒有問片段內的裝置是甚麼，顯示他們知道。李表示有可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，沒有打算參與12月1日的尖沙咀行動，但無向成員表明。於11月29日，黃振強與成員在群組討論12.1行動，並表示：「我直接打啦，仲哨？」，林銘皓回應：「講緊嗰20，唔使睇？」，黃表示「唔使睇，我想落場打」。林回答「咁就咁㗎啦，你想做大嘢，係要 plan 㗎喎。一係直接嗰日用囉，一了百了」。黃亦指：「啪尖沙咀狗屋」，林回答「佢哋喺入面都炸唔死佢哋，佢哋要出嚟」。控方問：「用咩炸？唔會係汽油彈？」李表示：「可能係。」控方追問：「汽油彈會炸？」李表示可用這個詞語形容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，成員談及「鴻仔」好像有防彈盾，嚴回應「係就好，順便畀支 AR 15 我」。控方指出，成員均知道「鴻仔」的身份，嚴亦知道他藏有槍械。李對此不同意。控方又指，當成員討論台灣軍訓時，李有參與其中，又指「去完台灣咪有得打」。李表示常理覺得軍訓會包括槍械訓練，但否認知道有「屠龍」成員管有槍械。李亦否認想參與軍訓，因訓練內容「聽落好辛苦」，包括左右腳各深蹲30下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示無興趣知道成員談及的大plan&quot;&gt;李表示無興趣知道成員談及的「大Plan」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12月6日，嚴文謙於群組問：「8號之後我哋使唔使避一避？」程于寶則指「淨係引班狗嚟就掂，走得」。林回覆「我哋引戰，然後一班狗嚟，班狗一放煙或者開槍，佢就嚟」。李表示當時看到訊息，但不明白內容。其後黃振強表示：「星期日有大 Plan」；李表示沒有興趣知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示知道屠龍128有行動-但前一晚沒有去安全屋&quot;&gt;李表示知道「屠龍」12.8有行動 但前一晚沒有去安全屋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，有部份訊息並不在李的電話紀錄中。李表示12月8日早上黃振強等人被捕後，他離開群組時，看到18小時前的訊息正被刪除，他認為可能是管理員發出的指令。這些對話紀錄包括，李於12月7日表示：「係咪今晚去定港島先？」李表示知道12月8日「屠龍」在港島有行動，但不同意隊員前往灣仔安全屋是為翌日行動備戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示引賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯對白-戲稱阻人扑嘢死咗會俾人燒春袋&quot;&gt;李表示引《賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯》對白 戲稱「阻人扑嘢，死咗會俾人燒春袋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，12月7日的下午仍在考慮是否去安全屋，直至8月凌晨他決定不去，因當時在飲酒。李承認當時欺騙黃，聲稱自己會去安全屋。於12月8日凌晨12時，李表示：「我一陣嚟」、「等等我，好快，搞掂埋就得」，並要求黃提供地址。黃提醒李「你一陣嚟嘅時候，搭𨋢搭上兩層」。李表示不明白，但不覺得事態嚴重。黃於凌晨4時許問李：「瞓着啦，嚟未？」李回覆「擺條鎖匙喺門口先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李同時在群組表示，自己當時正「同緊啲女仔一齊」，並對黃表示「阻人」。李解釋，他為「搞笑」故引用電影《賭俠大戰拉斯維加斯》中，演員萬梓良的對白：「阻人扑嘢，死咗會俾人燒春袋。」庭上被告聞後不禁發笑。法官張慧玲問：「係阻邊個？」李回應：「嗰一幕萬梓良係講緊自己。」控方其後亦補充：「中英對照添嗰幕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李家田作供完畢，案件明（18日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方質疑李家田無問隊員試甚麼槍 反問：你覺得試水槍？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LXgkqAd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（16日）踏入第54日審訊。被告李家田接受控方大律師周凱靈盤問。對話紀錄顯示黃振強曾稱「今晚試，副眼鏡唔知清唔清」。李解釋以其理解，眼鏡代表槍，黃當時打算去試槍，但可以是指「氣槍」。控方追問：「你覺得試水槍？豆槍？射唔到嘅槍？」李回應：「有諗過，可能裝易燃液體。」另外，李一度忘記控方的問題，遭控方質疑：「警方人員又打又水刑，你話擔心阿媽安危，佢哋（警方）講嘅嘢你記得，我問你嘅嘢你唔記得？」李回應：「係，因為你未打我。」控方遂表示「放心」並問：「即係打你，你先記得？」李回答：「如果你經歷過會明白。你冇經歷過，嗰刻係性命攸關。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱部分示威者如童子軍在場揸住雞毛當令箭&quot;&gt;李家田稱部分示威者如「童子軍」在場「揸住雞毛當令箭」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第七日作供，接受控方代表大律師周凱靈盤問。控方問及李在 Telegram「滅龍」群組內發出的訊息。於2019年11月14日，「屠龍」成員梁政希表示「荃灣好多南亞」，嚴文謙則回應「宣戰二陂坊」，梁再表示「唔理，掃晒」。李家田則回應「喺荃灣插支旗」。李解釋，他與成員是在「吹水」，最後沒有發生任何事情。被問及「插旗」的意思，李表示不懂解釋，控方追問：「係咪即係『屠龍』喺荃灣立一個聲譽？」李表示同意。他亦同意法官張慧玲所指，目的是宣示在某地方有勢力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，自己於11月14日仍身處中文大學，他在凌晨時分在群組表示：「中大等成日，狗影都冇」、「你哋走咗之後，變咗啲童子軍帶」。李昨解釋，「童子軍」意指行為較愚蠢的示威者，包括在對峙期間拿床褥抵擋。控方追問：「佢哋嘅武力程度好幼稚？」李不同意，並解釋示威者不需要拿床褥抵擋，因現場有其他物品如壁報板。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，有成員傳送用丫叉發射燃燒物體的片段，李回應「呢舊嘢10次得2次過十米」。他解釋，曾在中大見過有人使用類似武器，因此作出評論，認為該武器作用不大。李亦曾表示「呢咋童子軍唔識射，佢哋串」。控方追問：「係咪你去教佢哋，佢哋唔接受？」李不同意，並向控方解釋：「好似你唔信我講嘢咁。」張官追問示威者的表現如何令李感覺「串」；他解釋對方「揸住雞毛當令箭」，例如向其他示威者下指令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又發訊息表示「前排啲友仲串，當正自己大佬咁講嘢」。他解釋，部分示威者「代入自己係領導者角色咁講嘢」，但當時示威並無「大台」。李表示，在中大逗留兩日期間並無與任何人溝通，只是查問糧食或洗手間的位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李曾發訊息指黑警死全家否認把口號掛嘴邊&quot;&gt;李曾發訊息指「黑警死全家」否認把口號掛嘴邊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日傍晚，李發訊息指「黑警死全家」。他解釋，自己看完新聞後想作評論，於是套用示威者常說的口號，而口號是「鬧緊啲警察」。控方質疑：「咁多口號唔用，用呢個？」李表示自己關心與警察相關的問題。控方追問：「呢個係唯一關於警方嘅口號？」李回答：「而家唔記得仲有冇其他關於警察嘅口號。」控方續問：「點解揀呢句？」李表示：「順口。」控方最後問：「你經常掛在口中？」李不同意。其後，有成員發送「屠龍小隊圍爐談 籲港人覺醒」報道的連結。李表示不知道內容是否屬實，亦無考究真假，因覺得沒有需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至11月15日凌晨3時，李發訊息指「學生會騎咗，無了」。李解釋自己經已離開中大，並從網上消息得知中大二橋的示威者選擇撤離，而學生會發出撤離聲明，因此認為學生會「騎劫」了行動並「攞彩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被控方質疑記得被警打細節卻忘記問題-李因為你未打我&quot;&gt;被控方質疑記得被警打細節卻忘記問題 李：因為你未打我&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，李轉載香港大學聘請保安的資訊，並附上自己的評論，稱「呢個順便守HKU，正喎」。控方問：「你覺得要搵社運人士入去做保安？」李表示討論區文章標題已提及「有冇手足可以幫手」。李之後忘記控方的問題，控方卻質疑：「警方人員又打又水刑，你話擔心阿媽安危，佢哋（警方）講嘅嘢你記得，我問你嘅嘢你唔記得？」李回應：「係，因為你未打我。」控方遂表示「放心」，並問：「即係打你，你先記得？」李回答：「如果你經歷過會明白。你冇經歷過，嗰刻係性命攸關。」張官協助問：「係咪打你先記得？因為畀人打，監你去記就記得？」李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又強調，自己只是作出評論而非建議，他認為做保安既可以賺錢，亦可以守衛港大。控方不斷問及李認為「正」的原因，張官遂表示：「大家都明大學發生咩事，無謂兜兜轉轉，手足去做冇理由唔破壞？」李不同意並指：「可以唔破壞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示即使痾血仍前往理大及行山&quot;&gt;李表示即使「痾血」仍前往理大及「行山」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於15日下午約1時，張銘裕發訊息問李：「仲有冇嚟M？」，李表示「仲有」。李解釋自己正「痾血」兩至三日。張亦表示自己「嚟咗5日」、「好似停唔到咁」，又一度表示擔心失血過多，李則回應「好燥呀而家，要發脾氣了」。控方問：「你有冇睇醫生？」李表示沒有。其後李發訊息，表示「放料話中大入口放咗菠蘿，引狗入去炸佢哋」，他於晚上又稱「我喺 Poly 添，好似仆街了」。控方質疑：「你痾緊血都去咗 Poly？」李確認自己於15日晚上已身處理大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至11月16日下午2時，黃振強問：「你唔係行山咩？」，李回覆「今晚行」，黃再表示「記得報平安」。被問及為何要報平安，李表示：「可能係溫馨提示。」控方再質疑：「你行程緊密，喺中大三日兩夜，出嚟痾血，15號去 Poly，夜晚仲要去行夜山？」李同意。控方追問：「痾血都辛苦？」李解釋是大便有血。控方再問：「都係唔舒服？除非你話畀我聽好舒服？」李同意是「唔舒服」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李可不去行山-毋須唯命是從&quot;&gt;控方質疑李可不去行山 毋須唯命是從&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，既然李當時認為行夜山是「童軍行山」性質，那是否「可去可不去」。李同意，但沒有向黃振強建議找其他人代去。李早前稱，為免失去黃提供的資助，故答應陪他行山。控方追問，既然李得知黃因在中大受傷未能去行山，並由張銘裕頂上，李是否有沒有必要唯命是從，可以有更大的理由要求換人。李不同意，因當初是黃著他去行山，故他會繼續參與。控方亦質疑，李聲稱要到理大搜集資料，為何他卻去行山；李對此不同意。李又曾發訊息指：「迫出老解」，他解釋僅說笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示不知成員試甚麼槍-以為是水槍&quot;&gt;李表示不知成員試甚麼槍 以為是水槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強同日稱「今晚試，副眼鏡唔知清唔清」。李解釋以其理解，黃因要去試槍而未能行山。控方質疑為何發生如此「大事」，李卻沒有向對方查問。李解釋試槍可以指「氣槍」。控方問：「試水槍？豆槍？射唔到嘅槍？」李解釋：「有諗過，可能裝易燃液體。」惟控方質疑李不知就裏卻搭話：「我想鍍金落鏡框」，又指有人曾提及「滅聲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示為免成員知道自己身處理大-故訛稱會參與開會&quot;&gt;李表示為免成員知道自己身處理大 故訛稱會參與開會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李曾表示自己正「行山」，中途被要求站遠點，期間聽不到槍聲或爆炸聲。他否認控方所指，因不想碰槍械而沒有向同行者過問。11月17日凌晨，黃提議晚上開會。李稱自己在行山後返回理大，並說笑提議晚上到「藍店」麥當勞開會。成員在群組「Tag」李，並指「噚日行山嗰兩個一定要到」。李表示，黃曾勸隊員不要前往理大，因此隊員均不知道他身處理大。李於是隨口說自己「好快到」，以「氹住佢哋先」。李其後表示：「到我塞緊」，表達未能到場的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑無人問李退出群組原因-他解釋可能佢哋覺得我唔重要&quot;&gt;控方質疑無人問李退出群組原因 他解釋「可能佢哋覺得我唔重要」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，其後群組長達一小時沒有人發言，因此質疑：「喺紀錄入面都算創舉？你覺唔覺得奇怪？」李表示不感奇怪。最後李發現自己未能離開理大，因此於晚上10時多離開群組。控方問：「覺唔覺得奇怪，冇人問你咩事？點解你冇到？」李表示：「我有唔開心⋯⋯可能因為佢哋覺得我唔重要，我覺得唔奇怪。」控方指出，實際上李有出席在大鴻輝的飯局，期間成員得知李會前往理大，因此沒人問他離開群組的原因；李不同意。控方追問：「因為你可有可無？你有冇問？」李回應：「我冇咁矯情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強其後指「有冇人可以 Keep 眼鏡？阿檸出唔到嚟」。李解釋黃猜到他身處理大。控方質疑：「你隻字不提，佢哋估到你喺入面出唔到嚟？」李同意。於11月18日晚上8時，嚴文謙問「檸走唔走到？」，Kan 表示「走到，啱啱走到，游繩」。李卻表示自己並非游繩。直至20日，李要求 Kan 將他加回群組。李表示自己沒有翻看早前的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（17日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is ubiquitous in modern defence: space capabilities are essential in areas such as gathering intelligence, enabling navigation and precision firepower via GPS, and communicating beyond the line of sight. Furthermore, the utility of space increasingly renders capabilities a target for hostile action. Attacks on space-enabled communications services, as seen during the war in Ukraine, are just one example of how counter-space capabilities are already being used. In the future, adversaries may not restrict themselves to non-kinetic means, and space itself might turn into a battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK defence views space as both a domain and an enabler, although the balance is skewed towards enablement. It follows that the space domain must be protected to guarantee its utility as an enabler. The mixed message about space given to the services is part of the reason why space is perceived as complicated – it is used by all the armed forces, yet its potential for supporting other domains is not fully understood. A wider understanding of the services and support that space can offer is needed across defence – what it enables, what capabilities are dependent on it, what new vulnerabilities have been exposed as a result, and what investments may be needed to optimise its use. This understanding is important for ensuring that space can continue to be used even when its capabilities are under attack, and so that reversionary non-space-dependent alternatives are developed and trained for, where necessary. UK Space Command will be vital for providing the broader education and wider promotion of space needed across UK defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current approach of treating space as a niche subject area is not only conceptually flawed but also risks leaving space-enabled capabilities vulnerable and space services under-utilised, and reducing the capacity of a growing Space Command to perform its role effectively. This approach has already led to compromises in relation to the Skynet programme that could undermine the security of space assets. In the coming years it will be vital to include UK Space Command in all appropriate discussions to ensure full protection of UK space assets and to allow the command to grow and establish itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence and Space Command should emphasise doctrinally that space must be understood as both a domain and an enabler, while acknowledging that currently UK defence uses space capabilities more heavily in the enabler role for terrestrial operations than for defensive or offensive operations in space itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There should be a greater emphasis across the services on education about space capabilities, the degree to which terrestrial systems and concepts of operation rely on them, and the potential vulnerabilities created that must be mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This education effort should be part of a wider promotion of the message that space is not reserved for a few specialists in Space Command and in space programmes, but instead is critical for all the services. As such, space must be widely understood, used, built into operational planning as a key capability across domains, and protected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space is increasingly recognised by UK government as a vital part of defence. It featured prominently in the UK Integrated Review in 2021, and this was followed by the release of three strategy documents: the National Space Strategy in 2021; the Defence Space Strategy in 2022; and the Space Power Doctrine in 2022. The focus on integration – highlighted in both the 2023 Integrated Review Refresh and the associated Defence Command Paper – is intended to counter the new threat environment and is meant to “[enable] the UK to deliver disproportionate effect relative to [its] size”. Space acts a critical enabler for this integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the recognition that space and the cyber and electromagnetic activities that underpin capabilities “are the least understood domains in UK Defence”. This lack of understanding and lack of priority status is also reflected in budgets: in 2022, a mere £1.4 billion was promised for space capabilities over the following 10 years, apart from the £5 billion to be spent on the UK’s Skynet Programme. Meanwhile, the UK spent £52.8 billion in total on defence in 2022/23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it appears that government has started to take space more seriously, as shown by the publication of two strategies, a more general understanding of how space enables many defence functions remains absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Power Doctrine 2022 document goes into greater detail, outlining how space capabilities should contribute to UK defence’s integrated approach. It also highlights (to an extent) where space already supports and enables capabilities, and explains the current responsibilities and organisations involved in the defence space structures. UK space doctrine states that “the vast majority of military operations could not be sustained without space capabilities”, and space is often referred to as forming part of the “Defence Digital Backbone”. Essentially, space allows defence to know where its own forces are (Positioning, Navigation and Timing [PNT], linked to situational awareness applications), and to know where adversaries and associated threats might be (earth observation/ISR), and it enables satellite communication channels that are vital for command and control (C2) purposes (SATCOM). Space assets are critical to enabling the use of long-range precision weapons for strikes in high-threat areas through the provision of ISR data for targeting, PNT services for guidance and navigation, and SATCOM links for C2 functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the UK’s space doctrine deals with explaining what space is, including descriptions of space debris and solar weather. This is necessary to some extent, as it is the UK’s first dedicated space doctrine (previously it was part of airpower doctrine), and one of its aims is “to provide a basis of understanding”. However, this concentration on the basics of space as an environment means that details on how space enables terrestrial capabilities are relatively thin on the ground, and cannot educate readers on terrestrial alternatives or how outages should be dealt with . To make up for this missed opportunity, later iterations of strategy/documentation will need to expand further on how space is used to enable practical military effects. One way to do this, while not losing sight of the basics, could be to update the UK Military Space Primer from 2010 and point towards that document in future updated doctrine documents. This would leave more room in the updated doctrine for information that would help readers appreciate the operational potential of space. It would further promote debate on the subject and help potential beneficiaries engage better with the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is not unique to the UK. Jeffrey Caton has commented that current US space and cyberspace doctrines “often devolve to technical descriptions of their operation”. One of the core purposes of doctrine is to provide “a common basis for understanding the nature and conduct of armed conflict”, but initial theorising can end up taking this more technical approach, as understanding of the potential of space capability to support and enhance military activity has started to permeate to the tactical level but has not yet systematically reached the operational level. Some analysts have argued that doctrine tends to be developed on the basis of practical experience in a given domain or in the context of new tactics, rather than being seen as a prerequisite for practical success, as encapsulated in the phrase “doctrine is the daughter of history”. In the same vein, while systematic thinking about the air domain developed rapidly during the First World War, the RAF was already well established before a unified body of UK airpower doctrine was written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;PURPOSE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is currently missing from discussions is an assessment of how decision-makers within the UK defence and security community view space, how this thinking has shaped nascent defence space infrastructures, and how the various structures involved affect the future trajectory of using the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is to outline how UK defence can use space to its fullest extent. Although Space Command was created as recently as 2021, this does not mean that space is a new concept in the UK: rather, space capabilities have formed a little-acknowledged part of UK defence capabilities for decades. With space rising to prominence again around the latter half of the 2010s – evidenced by the establishment of space commands and accompanying strategies and documents in several states – a change in perception is overdue. Space needs to be understood at every level of UK defence, and by policymakers and practitioners alike. This paper outlines how this understanding can be achieved – with education and promotion through Space Command. This perception shift would help the command to fulfil its task of protecting space as a domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is primarily aimed at UK defence personnel: both those who are already familiar with space and those who are not. While the information about the threats to space capabilities will not be news to some, the message about education and promotion needs to be heard by all. Meanwhile, the rest of defence needs to hear the message that space is essential to modern conflict at all levels of intensity, and that it is not a specialised area for a few select experts, but rather one that has capabilities and vulnerabilities that need to be understood by all defence professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper is based in part on a review of academic literature and extant military doctrine, but it also draws on 15 interviews with experts conducted by the author between October 2022 and August 2023. The interviewees include current senior serving members of the armed forces, academics, and experienced people working in the commercial space sector, selected for their expertise. Most interviews took place online, with two interviews conducted in person and one via phone call. All interview data has been anonymised. Given the paper’s focus on UK defence space, most of the experts interviewed are based in the UK, with only one interviewee based in the US. The UK experience, however, is not unique among relatively new space powers, and some lessons may also be applicable to similarly sized space powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;STRUCTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper consists of two main sections. The first section illustrates how space is currently conceived of as both a domain and an enabler, with the current skew towards it primarily acting as an enabler. This may yet change (for example, if on-orbit activities and threats to space assets increase), and the paper uses analogies from the early days of the RAF to showcase this. As interviews revealed, space is often misunderstood, if it is considered at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second section deals with the implications of these current patterns of thinking. The section argues that space is of vital importance for UK defence, and that it is currently not given the prominence and consideration that it should be across the wider armed forces. It also argues that space education across the UK armed forces is vital to understanding: how space already supports operations as a critical enabler; its vulnerabilities; and potential non-space alternatives that might be required to sustain operations if space assets are disrupted or altogether unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it becomes clear that Space Command must be structured to ensure that the UK’s space capability will flourish – both as an enabler of other domains, through services like PNT, ISR and communications, and in terms of enabling it to fulfil its core role, the protection and defence of space assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-conception-of-space-within-the-military&quot;&gt;THE CONCEPTION OF SPACE WITHIN THE MILITARY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand space as part of the UK defence framework, it is important to understand how it is thought of in defence decision-making circles. Space has been physically explored for the better part of the past seven decades. However, the thinking around how it can be used for military purposes, and how it should be conceptualised as part of an integrated force, lags behind thinking related to the traditional domains and to cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK space power doctrine considers space a domain, applying NATO’s doctrine that it is an operational domain alongside land, air, maritime, and electromagnetic and cyber. Space is currently conceived of within the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as an “independent operational domain” which enables a whole host of capabilities. This seems consistent with both UK and NATO doctrine – after all, space is a physical environment that can be entered, and in which operations can take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the term “domain” is itself contested, it is commonly defined as “a sphere of the operating environment that has physical characteristics requiring unique doctrines, organizations, and equipment for military forces to effectively control and exploit in the conduct of military operations”. This is the case for space: the physical characteristics of the environment require a unique approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laws of physics as they apply in space, the associated speed of travel, and the remoteness of the environment are just a few of the initial factors that need to be considered when operating in space, and they have implications for deployment and maintenance. For example, assets deployed in space, in addition to inherently requiring special design features, also need to cope with the fact that maintenance in space is generally not possible. While in-orbit refuelling, repair and even manufacturing are developing areas of the space industry, they are still far from routine. For the moment at least, a satellite’s lifespan is dictated by its fuel supply. For assets in geostationary orbit this is typically 15 years, although the lifetime of many satellites is stretched out for longer. Space is also different from other domains in that its defence assets are not crewed; the phrase “satellites don’t have mothers” echoes discussions in other domains around the use of UAVs and other remotely operated capabilities, in relation to concerns that the loss of hardware is not considered enough of a deterrent, thereby potentially lowering the threshold of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the uniqueness of the environment requires targeted thinking that accounts for the specific characteristics of space as a domain. The conceptualisation of space as a domain also carries with it structural, administrative and budgetary recognition. It could even be argued that the categorisation of space as a separate domain was an important part of the justification for the establishment of UK Space Command as a joint two-star headquarters under the RAF in 2021. The primary task of Space Command, which is the protection and defence of space assets, reflects this categorisation as a separate domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the establishment of Space Command may also send an unhelpful signal to the rest of defence: that space is “taken care of” and is a niche topic that only concerns those working in the command itself. That space is sometimes forgotten about was confirmed by a group captain in the MoD Space Policy team, who stated that space sometimes falls down the priority list for funding, as it is primarily regarded as an enabler for other activities. This highlights why further education and promotion among the rest of the services is a crucial task for Space Command in the coming years, so as to firmly establish the importance of space, its ubiquity in UK defence, and the overall dependence on the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, viewing space from a domain-centric perspective can also be unhelpful, and viewing space solely in this way limits understanding of how it can influence military operations. As a senior military officer at UK Space Command put it, “we might not win a war using only space, but we will not win a war without it”. The three main roles of space – PNT, ISR and SATCOM – are fundamentally important because they support other, terrestrial, capabilities. Most of the capabilities that space unlocks and enables do not exist in isolation but rather are used as part of wider operational or tactical systems. However, sometimes military users are wholly reliant on SATCOM, especially on early entry deployments or where the ranges or terrain prevent the deployment of terrestrial networks. For example, SATCOM played a vital role for Western forces in Afghanistan, where it was often the only viable communications option for deployed bases or patrols. Space is vital for connectivity in multi-domain settings, for example allowing naval forces to communicate in real time with higher headquarters and ground forces ashore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-balance-between-domain-and-enabler&quot;&gt;THE BALANCE BETWEEN DOMAIN AND ENABLER&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within UK defence circles, space has been treated more as an enabler than as an operational domain (although this attitude may not last). John Klein put it succinctly: “The inherent value of space is what it allows you to do”. This perception has structural implications: the conception of space as primarily an enabler might suggest that it should not be an independent command, in view of historical precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the RAF became an independent service only in 1918. For most of the First World War, aircraft were thought of – in their reconnaissance and artillery observation roles – as enablers for land and maritime forces. Towards the end of the war, though, the increasing use of aircraft in strategic bombing campaigns to disrupt the enemy’s industrial war efforts prompted a shift in the perceived balance between airpower’s importance as an enabler and as a separate domain of warfare. This shift towards thinking about airpower in domain-centric terms was ultimately reflected in the granting to the RAF of its status as an independent service in the final year of the war. As George K Williams wrote, “[the] issue of strategic bombardment was from the outset inextricably conjoined with the creation of the third service”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the origins of modern air forces may to some extent serve as an analogy for the origins of national space commands, there are important distinctions to be made. Among them is the fact that air-to-ground and air-to-air combat, if only rudimentary, began to take place almost as soon as the air began to be used for military purposes. While physical combat in orbit would be possible, this has not yet occurred. Furthermore, while space is already providing powerful new benefits for states (echoing the way that the air domain proved revolutionary), it does not provide the same initial benefit of comparatively low cost of entry to achieve transformative effects. Operating in space, as we are often reminded by launch failures and long project timelines, is difficult and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duality of space as both a domain and an enabler is not necessarily permanent, as it may evolve into a domain in which direct acts of war happen. If space warfare were to become a regular feature of conflicts, this would even out the balance between space’s domain/enabler roles. The current imbalance would then shift, leading to space doctrine and concepts changing, just as they did in the air domain. For the moment, considering space as a domain as well as an enabler is necessary for the protection of its assets, as well as for creating the budgetary and structural latitude for space within UK defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the conception of space as both a domain and an enabler is correct but skewed, which further complicates the way in which it is perceived by the rest of defence. Space Command’s official functions are “delivering day-to-day space operations, growing and training defence’s space workforce, and developing and delivering space equipment programmes”. Treating space as a domain is thus central to the role of Space Command in the delivery of space operations, but it is also important in terms of promoting space, educating the wider forces about their dependence on and the utility of space services, and – perhaps most crucially – protecting the domain by looking after the assets within it. In short, the domain must be protected, so that it can also be used as an enabler. This is why it is important to have a dedicated structure for space in the form of a Space Command: effectively, Space Command deals with space as a domain, while the rest of the services treat space as an enabler for their own conventional capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-steps-for-uk-space&quot;&gt;FUTURE STEPS FOR UK SPACE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having discussed how space is currently perceived within UK defence, it is important to consider next steps for UK space, including what Space Command’s role entails. Given the current state of understanding of space discussed above, the priorities for focus can be divided into three distinct categories: education; promotion; and protection of assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-education-and-promotion&quot;&gt;THE NEED FOR EDUCATION AND PROMOTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the ubiquitous nature of the space services underpinning many of the conventional capabilities that modern forces depend upon, the services require a broader understanding of space’s contribution to their operations. Space Command’s expertise covers space as a domain, and the threats posed to assets in orbit. While the Command can help with education and promotion, the rest of defence needs to engage more closely and actively improve its baseline knowledge. This includes what kind of disruptions are to be expected, how these can be minimised, and what alternatives are available if satellite services are degraded or fail altogether. As previously outlined, current policy documents – the Space Power Doctrine, the Defence Space Strategy and the National Space Strategy – to some extent explain why space is important, where dependencies lie and what threats to anticipate, but these documents remain rather limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews, concerns were expressed about a degree of myopia among the services; but it was also noted that this might change as thinking about cross-domain integration evolves, with space becoming more prominent in discussions. A senior government official at the MoD remarked that there was “education left to do”, and a “low space IQ across departments”. There was a general consensus among interviewees that more space education was required in defence circles not immediately adjacent to space, with Space Command playing a key role in bridging that gap. The need for education was further emphasised in a House of Commons Defence Committee report in 2023, which also acknowledged that modification and development of training was underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some measures are already being taken to address the issue: the Space Power Doctrine outlines the idea that space is part of an integrated approach, partly enabled and coordinated through a network of space liaison officers. Although this goes some way towards alleviating the problem, the presence of a few space experts scattered around the services is not going to prompt a seismic change in understanding. In fact, the designation of space experts risks sending the wrong message: that space is so complicated that it is the domain solely of specialised experts, rather than an area that concerns everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vehicle for education is the Space Academy, which is to open at the end of 2024 as part of the UK Defence Academy. Including space as part of wider defence education and situating it naturally among the other domains is the right approach: space forms a crucial part of defence infrastructure and should not be treated as so specialised that it is reserved for a select few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews, one senior RAF officer noted that the problem with attempting to spread knowledge and awareness of space more widely among defence was that content was overly complicated, requiring the topic to be communicated repeatedly. This highlights the need for marketing as well as education: it is not just space’s importance that needs to be communicated, but also that the topic is not as difficult as is sometimes perceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem could be how the topic is currently explained. Everyday end-users of space services – such as a soldier using a satellite phone – might be familiar with the space-enabled device in their hand, but not with the space threats that could degrade its functionality. Although considering space solely from a domain perspective facilitates the scrutiny of space threats and other important environment-specific topics, it all too often obscures the enabler elements and neglects the tactical level at which space plays a key role in terrestrial activities. The soldier with the satellite phone may not consider themselves to be a space user, despite the degree to which the success of their mission, or even their survival, depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When communicating why space matters, therefore, it might be more fruitful to stress the domain’s potential as an enabler, as well as the number of terrestrial capabilities that could not operate in their current capacity without it. The current deficit of clear communication creates a gap, whereby understanding at the operational level is often lost. This is problematic given that understanding of potential capabilities, vulnerabilities and dependencies is necessary at the operational level to ensure that disruptions to space services do not catch troops off guard, and that reversionary measures can be implemented quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will therefore be Space Command’s fundamental task over the coming years to educate and to spread awareness among the rest of the joint force. Space liaison officers are a good start, but they are not a panacea – space is not a niche topic and ought no longer to be treated as such. It is vital to ensure that space quickly becomes part of defence’s “business as usual” activity so that its importance is more broadly recognised. While space’s unique characteristics affect how it fits into the defence framework, treating it as a specialised, discrete part of defence will hinder full integration and contribute to the perception of space as an overly complicated department with a high barrier to entry. A modern fighting force that is truly integrated cannot function if it is unaware of how one of its main enablers works (or if its fighting force is put off learning about it because the subject matter is considered too complicated). This does not mean that space specialists are unnecessary – in fact, they are very much needed, and well placed within Space Command – but space should not be regarded as a field that only concerns a few specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space Command is currently best placed to drive the education and promotion campaign that is necessary if this understanding – that space is everyone’s concern – is to be attained. One of the key requirements will be developing skills associated with education and promotion. Cyber security in the civilian sector provides a useful analogy. Since every company uses the internet to some extent, most companies provide cyber security training for their staff, for example to make them aware of phishing emails and the ways in which their organisation could become vulnerable in the event of a breach. In the same way, every soldier who handles space-enabled equipment (a category that likely includes most service personnel) needs to be aware of the limitations of the tool and the threats to its associated systems. The absence of such awareness risks late detection or incorrect addressing of counter-space measures. Moreover, users need to be acquainted with the backup options available (or at least be aware of the degree of risk if there are no backup options). Although recent combat operations undertaken by the British armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan did not involve significant contests in the electromagnetic spectrum, the experience of the current war in Ukraine suggests that this situation would change in a peer-to-peer (or near-peer) conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-protection&quot;&gt;THE NEED FOR PROTECTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of space assets has increasingly led to them being seen as potential targets. Geospatial analytics company Hawkeye 360 has reported that there was “increased GPS interference in and around Ukraine in the months leading up to the February attack as well as since”. Similarly, Elon Musk reported attacks against the mega-constellation Starlink – the space-enabled internet provider that has supplied Ukrainian troops with much-needed connectivity. On the morning of the invasion of Ukraine, another space-enabled internet provider, Viasat, was targeted in a cyber attack, although it is unclear to what extent one of its clients, the Ukrainian Armed Forces, was affected by the resultant outage. What is clear, though, is that adversaries and competitors have realised the utility of space assets, and will endeavour to ensure they are disrupted or made inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is further evidenced by Russia’s focus on information dominance. Space, as one of the major conduits for information flows, is a crucial attack vector. Russian electronic warfare (EW) capabilities did not initially prove as dominant in Ukraine as had been assumed, primarily due to a lack of in-depth Russian planning during the opening phases of the invasion. While Russia’s use of EW capabilities has increased significantly in both scope and sophistication since the opening stages of the war, these have not been particularly successful in denying Ukraine access to satellite-enabled communications, in part due to the resilience of the Starlink constellation. Nevertheless, they are having a negative effect on positioning, thus “slowing down vital kill chains and imposing significant limitations on Ukrainian reconnaissance in depth”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited initial use of EW capabilities in Ukraine, it must be assumed that space capabilities, such as SATCOM, would be at least partially disrupted in any future peer-to-peer (or near-peer) conflict. This is important, especially given the ubiquity and utility of the electromagnetic spectrum for C2 purposes, including communications, coordination and targeting. Western forces largely conduct training in environments that are unrealistically permissive from an electromagnetic spectrum perspective. Likewise, most recent Western combat experience has been in expeditionary operations where the space environment has been largely uncontested. For example, whereas SATCOM ground stations could become targets for physical attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, the satellites and the links themselves were not at risk. In 2003, Iraqi EW systems were present and alleged to have been provided by Russia, but they proved incapable of jamming US systems and were ultimately destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consistent attempts to target space-enabled capabilities in the war in Ukraine are not an outlier. Both Russia and China view Western (and specifically US) dependence on space as a weakness to be exploited. While China and Russia both run significant counter-space programmes, it is not only space powers that are capable of disrupting or destroying space assets. Cyber attacks against space systems and direct attacks/sabotage targeting ground stations are just two ways in which a non-space power could disrupt space systems. Attacks in the electromagnetic spectrum, such as jamming and spoofing, have become part and parcel of modern warfare and could even be carried out by non-state actors, given the widespread commercial availability of jammers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the degree of dependence on space services and the rapidly expanding threat they face, the US Army and the US Air Force have already begun training under GPS-denied conditions – Exercise Red Flag in 2018 was a prominent example. In all NATO countries, services dependent on satellite-enabled services – air forces, armies and navies – should increase reversionary training. In many cases, potential reversionary options already exist for situations where space services are degraded or denied. For example, GPS alternatives for the Royal Navy have been suggested, such as an automated celestial navigation system, magnetic anomaly navigation and bathymetric navigation. Even where one method may not provide a comprehensive service, the combination of alternative navigation methods could offer resilience in scenarios where GPS is disrupted or completely unavailable. In this instance, a primary, alternative, contingency and emergency (PACE)-like approach, as used for communications planning, could prove equally useful for PNT and other space systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it is inevitable both that space will be a critical enabler in future wars and that space assets will be specifically targeted, given their centrality to modern capabilities. Consequently, understanding of space needs to extend far beyond those immediately responsible for space assets, reaching out across the whole breadth of modern forces. This highlights the necessity of education at a general level in defence about the dependencies and vulnerabilities of systems relying on space assets, alongside appropriate involvement of Space Command in programmes to perform its core task of ensuring that assets are defended against space threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structural-and-organisational-implications-for-protect-and-defend&quot;&gt;STRUCTURAL AND ORGANISATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR “PROTECT AND DEFEND”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While UK Space Command is still in its early days, the structures that are being shaped now will be fundamental not only to the command’s success but also to how effectively space can enable wider cross-domain integration. As Bleddyn Bowen puts it, “the primary questions of a space force should be who can manage space infrastructure and its protection best, and which branches of the military should engage in counterspace missions, most often involving terrestrially based weapons”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was inaugurated in 2021, UK Space Command was established under the financial umbrella of the RAF, with its headquarters located in High Wycombe. This was at least in part due to the fact that most suitably qualified and experienced personnel on space issues in defence were deemed to work in the RAF already. At the time, there were discussions about whether the command should sit under Strategic Command, given that it is a joint enabler and essential to integration, and also considering that the Skynet programme, which at approximately £5 billion makes up the vast majority of the UK defence space budget, already falls within its remit. However, the scope of operations, capability development and training, and the fact that almost 70% of the UK Space Command workforce comes from the RAF, led to the command being formed under the RAF. This decision was echoed in the German armed forces (also in 2021), and is in line with several other countries (including France, which created its Air and Space Force in 2020). UK Space Command is not a single service function, however. It is a joint command that acts as the UK’s nerve centre for space, and is staffed by personnel from all three services, although administrative staff and logistical underpinnings are provided by Air Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three questions to be answered in this context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should Space Command be an independent service?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Is it best placed as a command or headquarters under the auspices of the RAF, as is currently the case?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should it instead be moved to Strategic Command?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is currently not clear whether Space Command will eventually outgrow its parent organisation and become an independent service. For the time being, however, it is too small to function as a standalone service. Leaving aside budget considerations, it is probably wise for Space Command to be made its own service only if exclusive space operations become substantial enough for the enabler/domain balance to tip towards the domain end of the spectrum. As long as space is primarily used as an enabler, it seems most reasonable for the command to fall under one of the more established services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Space Command is not an independent service, then, what is the best way to carve out a nerve centre for space when decisions made by Space Command will affect all the other services? How should capacity and responsibility for different space functions, such as ISR, SATCOM and PNT, be allocated within the services? UK space power doctrine suggests that, where further clarification is required to avoid doubt, a mission should be labelled according to its effect rather than its means. This, however, poses a question about the extent to which it is possible to have exclusively space missions. Space is “a prime integrator” and is very rarely used in isolation. What are operated are assets that send data to ground stations, which in turn assist terrestrial assets – whether by providing images through ISR, coordinates via PNT, or data through SATCOM. Protective measures for satellites would fall squarely in the space mission category, though current anti-satellite measures are most likely to come in the form of jamming, spoofing and cyber attacks – all of which attack the links (and potentially terrestrial elements such as ground stations), rather than directly targeting the space assets themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that Space Command is probably best placed under Strategic Command at this stage, for two reasons. First, if Space Command is tasked with the protection and defence of space assets against attacks (most of which are likely to take place in the electromagnetic and cyber realms), it would be best placed to work with the command that already owns most of those capabilities. Second, moving away from the top-level budget of the RAF would send a powerful cultural message that space enables the full spectrum of military capabilities and affects everyone, not just aviators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are deep intra-dependencies within each domain, and perhaps especially within space, which acts as the glue that holds the other domains together. Therefore, losing access to the space capabilities that are crucial for achieving operational success might be particularly disruptive for the complex system of interdependencies across the air, land, maritime, cyber and space domains. In interviews, one official stressed that the potential risk of overlap was not unique to space, but happened in other areas as well. This seems to suggest that an overlap of space roles mentioned in the Space Power Doctrine is widespread across defence and is actually a “growing pain” of the continuing trend towards integration. As a former signaller reflected during interviews, the main problem with integration was that people saw it as a destination rather than as a journey that in reality never ends, due to technology change, with no final end state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pervasiveness of space means that there is also a danger of insufficient involvement and consultation of Space Command on projects or systems that concern space. A prime example of where this could be potentially harmful is the Skynet programme, a hardened constellation of X-band satellites that provides all beyond line of sight communications to the UK military. The programme has been running since the late 1960s, and the next generation of satellites is already being planned: Skynet 6A has been promised to provide “more capacity, speed and greater versatility”. The Skynet programme, despite being a critical space asset, falls under Strategic Command, and it is the biggest UK defence space project. While there are long-term ambitions to move the programme to sit under Space Command, there are no immediate plans to do so. However, other new space capabilities being developed, such as the ISR constellation Istari and the integrator system Minerva, are planned to fall within Space Command’s remit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK’s biggest defence space project, it may seem counterintuitive that Skynet is not allocated to Space Command. However, given the advanced stage the project had reached by the time that Space Command was being created, and the project’s sheer scale, its placement was a logical decision. A huge project such as Skynet requires a command that can support it with the scale of staffing it needs. As a space industry expert has observed, Space Command is currently not “configured” to take on large projects. Furthermore, there is experience within Strategic Command to help guide how Skynet ought to be run – including how its services can reach the “frontline” when necessary. This is in part enabled through the Chief Information Officer within the MoD, and guided by the Digital Strategy for Defence, ensuring that “frontline forces … have real-time access to data”. Taking Skynet out of these tried-and-tested structures, while attempting to manage such a big project and learning “on the go”, would have been counterproductive, and could have led to the loss of crucial expertise, such as appropriate bandwidth for operations. In the view of a senior military officer at UK Space Command, taking on the Skynet programme at such an early stage of development of the Command would have caused significant issues, given the size of the programme, and would have been all-encompassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the inclusion of Skynet under Space Command in the future would not strengthen the command (albeit requiring additional budget and people). Space Command is already responsible for the “protect and defend” element of Skynet – ensuring that it is safe from hostile intent. Moreover, Skynet 6 will be in orbit for many years and will carry out critical mission support, making it a legitimate target for adversaries. Given the evolving nature of space threats and the importance of the service provided, it has become evident that additional protection is needed beyond the measures that were initially specified at the start of the programme. Ultimately, the problem with Skynet has been that, despite the large budget, it would be challenging to meet the requirements of protect and defend from within Skynet’s existing funding. This is because when the requirements were set, the initial threat assessment assumed a different geopolitical situation (and a different risk level for satellites). When Space Command was established, it was relatively late in the process to influence the requirements for Skynet 6A and Enduring Capability, and for agreeing the appropriate balance of responsibility between Space Command and Strategic Command for delivering the protect and defend mission. The case of Skynet is perhaps unique, in the sense that the timing of the establishment of Space Command did not lend itself to sufficient consultation. However, it is an example that shows that the vulnerability and protection of satellites need to be considered more extensively. Where compromises had to be made for the current programme, this has been considered a lesson learned, and significant progress is being made towards understanding how future Skynet spacecraft can be protected and defended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is not unusual for a defence programme of this scale. Given the long development and deployment timeframes usually involved, security requirements can quickly become outdated. However, in most major defence projects, modifications to hardware and configuration can be made at multiple points during a capability lifecycle to improve responsiveness to evolving threats. Space assets are somewhat unique, in that generally only the software can be updated once an asset has been placed in orbit. Therefore, a greater degree of horizon scanning is required, and software adaptability built in to ensure the ability to protect the asset throughout its lifespan. This is particularly true for satellites in geostationary orbit (like Skynet), which remain in orbit for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson must be that the protection and defence requirements of any future space asset need to be decided within Space Command and included in the core specifications from the inception of any project. Given that Space Command will ultimately hold operational responsibility for Skynet, the way that the programme has been managed in terms of ownership creates a gap between those who designed the programme and those who will be ultimately responsible for it. This not only increases the potential vulnerability of a strategic asset, due to a lack of focus on protect and defend requirements during development, but also potentially risks a fledgling Space Command looking ineffective in the event of any issues with Skynet 6 Enduring Capability once in service, which could hamper the command’s future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skynet programme serves as an example for the wider structure: bigger projects that require a large budget and many personnel are best placed outside Space Command, at least while the command matures, but must involve the command to the extent that it can assure its future mission of protecting and defending space assets once they enter service. In this way, the “domain” thinking sits within Space Command, while the “enabler” elements stay with the relevant parts of the services or UK Strategic Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space will become increasingly contested as the reliance on space-enabled assets grows. It is therefore vital that modern armed forces are ready for this contest – this cannot be done with only a handful of people in a single command recognising the potential dangers. Thus, the setting up of a dedicated Space Command should not send the message to the rest of the force that space is now “taken care of” – space operations do not happen in isolation from other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK Space Command was formed in 2021. Now, three years after its inception and the publication of the National and Defence Space Strategies, important lessons have been learned. Global trends, not least those observed during the war in Ukraine, have made it abundantly clear that space services are not a niche capability. Space is a ubiquitous and essential integrating layer for modern military operations, and as a result it is also increasingly being directly and indirectly targeted by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With space underlying so many military capabilities, space knowledge cannot be left to a few specialists in UK defence. Rather, its dependencies and vulnerabilities and non-space-based alternatives need to be widely understood. An understanding of space and what it can do for UK defence and security needs to permeate all of UK defence, and be promoted at every level to guarantee continuous access to space and the capabilities it enables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of a Space Academy at the Defence College is a step in the right direction, as it further drives home the message that space does not require special treatment, as a discrete entity, but is instead vitally integrated into the way that defence operates. Widespread understanding of how space enables modern warfare will be fundamental to early threat detection, the prevention of service disruption and, ultimately, unlocking true integration. It is therefore vital that space education is made a core part of broader military education and training within defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as enabling this wider education, a core role for Space Command in the coming years will be the protection of space capabilities. As space becomes more woven into defence structures, and space capabilities become more resilient (but also dispersed across a wider array of constellations and services), the challenge of protection will become more complex. Space Command needs the tools and the people to counter these threats. This requires involving Space Command from the beginning of projects so that the security of space assets, rather than being an afterthought, is designed in from the start. Space security must be considered at every level, and from the beginning – otherwise a multitude of terrestrial capabilities may become vulnerable or even be rendered ineffective through attacks on the space assets that enable them to function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the concept of space power is gaining importance and visibility across the military, it is now time to engage the wider community of space beneficiaries across UK defence in much greater detail. Space is an enabler for many fundamental capabilities, such as the orbital ISR, PNT and SATCOM that make modern warfare possible. Space is an integrator of many capabilities and functions. It is therefore important to recognise and counter threats to these functions, both from the harsh space environment and from adversaries, who are increasingly investing in tools that make disruption or denial of space-enabled capabilities possible. Thus there is a need for wider education and promotion of space within the armed forces, as well as for potential structural changes to both programme management and service ownership to ensure that Space Command can ultimately fulfil its role of protecting and defending the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田稱中大對峙時有人收起大殺傷力武器 認為對方做法有道德問題&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DcdUNcp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（15日）踏入第53日審訊。被告李家田接受控方大律師周凱靈盤問。李供稱於11月曾前往中大示威現場，觀察情況為紀錄片取材。對話紀錄顯示，李曾在群組表示「大殺傷力武器收起唔畀用」。李解釋認為做法在道德上有問題，因警方曾用真槍射示威者，但這些人仍覺得「唔應該用武器對待警察」。控方問：「你覺得警方同示威者嘅武力不對稱？」李回應：「我有咁嘅察覺。」控方再三追問：「你思維上覺得警方同示威者武力不對稱？」李強調：「呢個係事實。」另外，李認為示威者表現不成熟似嬉戲，他們測試汽油彈的做法愚蠢，故表示「全童子軍，點睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱被警員打後-隨口虛構自己曾保管手槍&quot;&gt;李家田稱被警員打後 隨口虛構自己曾保管手槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第六日作供，接受控方代表大律師周凱靈盤問。李表示在錄影會面期間，虛構自己將手槍保管兩星期的說法。控方質疑，常理而言虛構更短的保管時間，對自己更有利。李解釋，「我畀人（警員）打到咁樣，隨口而出講啲嘢出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱得悉黃振強被捕後-決定退出群組並改tg名&quot;&gt;李稱得悉黃振強被捕後 決定退出群組並改TG名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李承認得知黃振強於12月8日被捕後，為免帶來不必要誤會，因此決定退出「滅龍」群組，並更改自己的 Telegram 用戶名稱，由「I am reinforce Jr.」改為「黃又南」。李同意擔心警方會在被捕人士的電話內辨認到自己。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱為引起話題-故轉發呼籲破壞警署的訊息&quot;&gt;李稱為引起話題 故轉發呼籲破壞警署的訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問及李在「滅龍」群組內發出的訊息。李於2019年11月9日轉發訊息「聽日全世界去拆荃灣狗屋」，並問：「點睇？」李解釋，由於「屠龍」小隊經常在荃灣出沒，因此他看到網上呼籲破壞荃灣警署就分享。控方指，李早前強調自己缺席隊中一半的行動，即使出席亦只在旁觀察，故質疑李為何突然「摟檔」。李解釋是想引起話題，並表示想問隊員會否參與，但否認自己想參與。李又指，成員將粉紅色膠紙貼在身上作為記認，而他亦有照做。他同意控方指，自己在示威現場會被其他成員辨認到。李另指，他一直視所有隊員為朋友。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，另一日得知有一名13至14歲的示威者，在街上被電單車撞傷腳，並由嚴文謙救走。其後李在群組內提出帶對方去私家醫院，以免在公立醫院內遭警察查問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李曾呼籲成員去中大-解釋僅吹水&quot;&gt;李曾呼籲成員去中大 解釋僅「吹水」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於11月12日，李在群組呼籲成員去中大，他發語音訊息稱：「暴大出晒架撐」，「陣地戰有得打啦，最多我教咁多位射箭好冇？」李解釋當時僅「吹水」、「求其搵啲嘢講吓」，但自己確實有前往中大，為紀錄片作資料搜集。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃振強稱開無雙-李解釋源於三國無雙遊戲意指近距離攻擊警察&quot;&gt;黃振強稱「開無雙」 李解釋源於「三國無雙」遊戲、意指近距離攻擊警察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強在群組表示「諗住打近戰，開無雙」。法官張慧玲問說話的意思，李解釋：「有隻遊戲叫『三國無雙』，佢可以操控武將，例如呂布」，「可以一路打敵人、儲氣、『爆大技』，同埋可以做好華麗嘅動作。」張官追問：「點樣做華麗嘅動作？」李回應：「唔識用口講出嚟」，並解釋黃意指「會近距離攻擊警察」。在犯人欄的張俊富及嚴文謙不禁發笑。控方遂質疑：「大家都知道戰術點行？」李不同意並指僅屬「打機術語」，如果是遊戲玩家就會明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李同意自己站一旁觀看-卻呼籲其他成員打&quot;&gt;李同意自己站一旁觀看 卻呼籲其他成員「打」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後發訊息指：「好X好玩」、「好興奮」，他解釋僅屬「吹水」，想表達在場見到示威者與警方衝突後的感受。其後有成員表示不能攜帶裝備進入中大，李卻回應「唔理了，打」。李解釋這亦屬「吹水」。控方質疑，李向成員表示「你哋冇準備都唔緊要，打」，但自己卻站在一旁觀看；李同意。控方再質疑，李是否仍然堅持與「屠龍」其他成員劃界；李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李得知中大內有人鎖起武器-認為做法有道德上問題&quot;&gt;李得知中大內有人鎖起武器 認為做法有道德上問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李之後發語音訊息指：「好X伏，得個2、300人，擸架撐得嗰50（人），仲要唔知係咪真係打。認真，不如放棄。」李解釋正評論現場情況，建議成員「返屋企」。其後他發訊息表示「大殺傷力武器收起唔畀用」。李解釋，當時中大內有人鎖起武器，李認為此做法在道德上「有啲問題」，因警方曾用真槍射示威者，但這些人仍然覺得「唔應該用武器對待警察」。控方追問：「你覺得警方同示威者嘅武力不對稱？」李回應：「我有咁嘅察覺。」控方再問：「你係咪咁諗？」李堅稱：「呢個就係我嘅觀察。」控方再三追問：「你思維上覺得警方同示威者武力不對稱？」李強調：「呢個係事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後發語音訊息指：「係啲左膠鎖起咗，唔X畀用。」庭上播放有關錄音後，控方在提問時一度稱「助教」，其後控方問：「其實講緊『左膠』，唔係『助教』？」李堅持是「助教」。在張官查問下，李表示「左膠」意指「一啲唔想用暴力去做抗爭嘅人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李曾批評示威者嘗試投擲汽油彈-認為做法愚蠢&quot;&gt;李曾批評示威者嘗試投擲汽油彈 認為做法愚蠢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又發訊息指「set 晒防線，等啲狗衝」。他解釋自己「越行越前」，身處示威者所在的二橋，與最前的示威者相差五行。因此「企喺示威者嗰邊諗」，並作出評論。群組有人表示：「有冇酒（即汽油彈）？」，李回應「少少，試緊」。他解釋示威者當時在運動場嘗試投擲汽油彈。李又曾批評示威者嘗試投擲汽油彈的行為，並稱「試乜X嘢，一定得㗎，實 work 㗎呢招」。他解釋認為製作汽油彈很容易。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李發訊息指「全童子軍，點睇」、「熱狗」。他解釋，當時認為在場示威者表現不太成熟，似在嬉戲。至於「熱狗」，則是當其他人說「熱血」時，李為表達不同意而作出的回應。李亦表示：「不如拎啲左膠出嚟擋子彈啦」，最後他表示自己「冇心機」。李解釋因目睹示威者的愚蠢行為。控方質疑：「『屠龍』行為就唔會出現呢啲野？」；李不同意。另外，李承認「屠龍」會帶備汽油彈予其他示威者使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示代受傷的黃振強向群組表達急-call-火魔&quot;&gt;李表示代受傷的黃振強向群組表達「急 Call 火魔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又發訊息問：「有冇貨（即汽油彈）？」他解釋在其身旁的黃振強受傷，所以李代為詢問。李其後發訊息表示「打，唔X驚」。他解釋當時回應黃振強說「好爽」，又指字眼源自網絡常用笑話，包含「講笑」的意思。控方質疑：「你自己企埋一邊觀察，但係就叫其他你視為朋友、隊友嘅人去打？」；李同意，但強調亦有說笑成份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就自己曾發訊表示「都話最鍾意陣地，勁好玩」，李解釋：「鍾意示威者聚集埋一齊嘅現場」，並可以從中觀察。他強調黃振強一直知道自己留在「屠龍」是為了觀察取材。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，身旁的黃振強要求李協助在群組說：「急 Call 火魔」，其後黃因受傷而被扶走，因此黃在一分鐘後接着說「未走嗰啲自己搵車走，我重傷呀」。李聞後表示：「吓，唔打啦？」控方質疑，黃在中大事件中受傷需被扶走，事隔數天李收到黃邀約去行山時，是否感到奇怪。李表示覺得奇怪，但沒有問對方是否已康復，亦沒有問張銘裕為何換人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示嚴文謙自言好犀利&quot;&gt;李表示嚴文謙自言「好犀利」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方問李「嚴文謙係咪戰略上好打得？」；李表示：「佢平時會講得自己好犀利」，在犯人欄的嚴文謙不禁發笑。控方問：「邊一方面好犀利？」李猶豫後回答：「有啲方面唔係咁適合講⋯⋯」張官追問：「同行動有關嘅，係邊方面？」李表示：「近距離打警察」、「佢話飛踢警察」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李否認透過示威爭取五大訴求&quot;&gt;李否認透過示威爭取「五大訴求」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦問到，李的理念是否與「屠龍」相似。李否認自己透過示威爭取「五大訴求」及「反對警察使用暴力」。控方最後問既然李視成員為朋友，是否不想朋友使用暴力；李表示「冇評價」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問，是否有人試過將鐵釘放入爆炸品內，造成更大殺傷力。李表示沒有試過，亦無這方面的知識。李又認為汽油彈並不屬大殺傷力武器，槍械才算是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（16日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（12日）踏入第52日審訊。選擇作供的被告李家田，接受控方大律師周凱靈盤問。李供稱被捕時遭多名警員拳打腳踢，現擔心在庭上說出被打經歷後，「出到去可能仲有啲咩報復性待遇。」但他強調：「驚但係我都仲要講，因為我要畀所有人知道，警察係會點做嘢。同埋我相信法庭可以畀到一個公義我。」控方另問及李的 Telegram 用戶名「I am reinforce Jr.」的意思。李解釋是動畫《高達》其中一部戰艦的名稱，並指自己喜歡《高達》的反戰概念。控方追問戰艦用途，李表示負責打仗。控方再問：「打外敵？革命？」李回答是「幫助國家打外敵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑李家田未完成儀式非天主教徒-又問為何在基督教學校讀書&quot;&gt;控方質疑李家田未完成儀式非天主教徒 又問為何在基督教學校讀書&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第五日作供，接受控方代表大律師周凱靈盤問。李作供時以天主教形式宣誓，並曾稱出生後領洗。控方問李有否完成堅振聖事（即嬰兒受洗後，於長大再確認教徒身份的儀式），李表示沒有完成，亦不知道有這個程序。他解釋，兒時曾向母親表示想領聖體，但母親卻回應「大個啲先」。控方遂質疑：「嚴格嚟講，你不能用聖經宣誓？」李表示不知道。控方又問，李是否在基督教學校讀書；他同意。控方質疑學校既然得知李是天主教徒，「人哋照畀你讀書？」李回應：「我唔明有咩問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李擔心說出被打經歷後遭報復性對待-但強調要畀所有人知警察點做嘢&quot;&gt;李擔心說出被打經歷後遭報復性對待 但強調「要畀所有人知警察點做嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前稱，2020年6月11日被捕時遭數名警員拳打腳踢及施行「水刑」，導致他在錄影會面期間感驚慌，擔心自己及母親再受類似對待。他今表示，被捕後兩天首次被帶上法庭時，亦感驚慌，而驚慌感覺持續至現在。控方質疑：「你而家喺懲教署，你知道係同警察分開？」李同意。另外，李確認自他被捕後，其母親選擇離港，現已離世。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何仍感驚慌，李解釋擔心警察「告我多啲罪」，並指：「我喺庭上面講佢哋點打我之後，擔心出到去可能仲有啲咩報復性待遇。」法官張慧玲問：「你相信即使懲教職員睇住，你都有機會畀警察報復性對待？」李澄清，擔心將來離開懲教署後會受到報復性待遇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示不解，並問：「你話驚所以唔講，但係而家你講咗？」李提高聲線回答：「驚但係我都仲要講，因為我要畀所有人知道，警察係會點做嘢。同埋我相信法庭可以畀到一個公義我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李強調無稱毋須看醫生-屬警員自問自答&quot;&gt;李強調無稱毋須看醫生 屬警員「自問自答」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認在案件首次提堂時，他由當值律師代表，但因在警方羈押下故沒有投訴。李同意當日他要求8天保釋覆核，於是在6月19日再次上庭，並由朋友協助聘請的私人律師代表。李表示因比較相信私人律師，故透過律師向法庭投訴被毆打、掌摑、打肚、踢腰，以及施行「水刑」。根據紀錄，律師在庭上透露由於已事隔數天，故李身上的瘀傷差不多消退，只剩下腰間有瘀痕，李希望懲教帶他去驗傷及帶他往警察投訴課。控方質疑，李昨供稱被打後只發現腰間有瘀傷；他解釋其意思是瘀傷逐漸消退。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方根據紀錄指出，李表示毋須拍攝傷勢照片。李解釋當時警方問：「使唔使影相？唔使㗎喇！你返去懲教署先啦。」控方再指，李當時稱暫時毋須看醫生，有需要再看。李強調自己沒有說過，是警員當時「自問自答」。李確認最終沒有去看醫生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱行動期間僅觀察無破壞-控方質疑為何黃振強仍願意給錢&quot;&gt;李稱行動期間僅觀察無破壞 控方質疑為何黃振強仍願意給錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問及李在「屠龍」的參與程度。李同意每次向黃振強索取資助時，他都表現「疏爽」。李又指，參與「屠龍」的行動約10次，過程中只是在旁觀察，並無參與破壞行為。另外有一半的行動自己則無參與，並用不同藉口推搪。控方質疑：「你而家係咪話畀我哋聽，黃振強容許你做呢啲嘢，不過對於你要攞錢仍然有求必應？」李同意。控方又問有沒有「屠龍」成員不滿李的做法並作出埋怨；李表示沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱以高達戰艦作為tg名稱-控方問打外敵革命&quot;&gt;李稱以《高達》戰艦作為TG名稱 控方問：打外敵？革命？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問李的 Telegram 用戶名意思，控方問及「I am reinforce Jr.」名稱有何典故。李解釋動畫《高達》其中一部戰艦名為「Reinforce Junior」，他喜歡《高達》帶出的反戰概念。控方問及戰艦的用途，李表示負責打仗。控方追問：「打外敵？革命？」李解釋是幫助國家打外敵。張官問：「高達咁多隻艦，你特別鍾意『Reinforce Junior』？」李同意。張官追問是否貌似人形；李回答不是，並指：「閣下講嗰隻應該係《超時空要塞》。」控方再問李另一用戶名「John Lemon」有何意思，李解釋自己喜歡「Beatles」成員約翰連儂（John Lennon），亦喜歡其宣傳和平的理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於代表李家田的大律師林芷瑩不適發燒，因此案件押後至下周一（15日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Summit – double-hatted as the NATO 75th anniversary – focused more on the founding of NATO and its past success as “the world’s most successful military alliance” rather than fully engaging with future challenges, both immediate and long-term. Moreover, scheduled in July, it was a summit designed to support President Joe Biden’s re-election bid, maximising the celebrations and avoiding controversies. The deliberately lowered expectations led to only incremental progress, both in the ongoing transformation of the Alliance’s defence and deterrence posture, and on support to Ukraine. Instead, the summit was dominated by the DC chatter surrounding the US presidential election in November, which will be hugely consequential for NATO, Ukraine and European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-volatility&quot;&gt;Political Volatility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political preamble to Washington was intense. Biden’s underwhelming performance in the first election debate has sparked growing calls for him to cede to a younger Democratic candidate. These interventions grew louder during the summit, with the closing unscripted press conference becoming a litmus test of the president’s abilities on the world stage, which he failed. Over in Europe, centrist parties were overcome in the EU Parliamentary elections in June, which pressed French President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election. While the worst-case scenario – a majority for the far-right National Front – was averted, French lawmaking will now be paralysed, giving more electoral ammunition to the far right for the 2027 presidential election. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s ruling coalition in Germany was equally challenged, but it will likely limp on for another 15 months. Going against this grain, in the UK, the Labour Party won a landslide election victory and with it a strong mandate to govern. Meanwhile, Hungarian President Viktor Orban – who holds the rotating EU Council Presidency – visited the Kremlin on a “peace mission” and shook hands with President Vladimir Putin, providing a stark reminder that NATO has a growing Hungary problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last development is particularly repugnant as the summit week began with Russia bombing the Okhamdyat children’s hospital in Kyiv and other medical facilities. These strikes were likely a deliberate policy to demonstrate to already nervous European countries the cost of escalation. If this was the intent, it backfired as NATO countries rallied together to announce an additional strategic and tactical air defence package for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-new&quot;&gt;What is New?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the language on China is now much stronger than at previous summits, with Beijing now labelled a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The declaration states that “The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation”, which is a significant step for the Alliance in calling out its hostile intent. However, it mainly identified and admired the problem, rather than outlining what NATO should do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, defence industrial cooperation was a focal point, with a separate “NATO Industrial Capacity Expansion Pledge” published alongside the main declaration, which will be critical in restocking NATO militaries as quickly and as efficiently possible, together with ensuring long-term industrial support to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the central objectives was to “Trump-proof” NATO support to Ukraine. With no invitation, NATO sought to “bridge” membership through three measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a “NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine” will be established – at a new command in Wiesbaden, Germany – to transition lead responsibilities from the US to NATO on coordinating support and training and place it on an “enduring footing, ensuring enhanced, predictable, and coherent support”. This is twinned with the creation of a senior NATO civilian representative post in Kyiv to allow closer coordination. However, Germany vetoed its original “mission” designation over concerns this could be escalatory. These semantic gymnastics and overall timidity towards Ukraine will be seen by Putin as weakness, and degrade NATO’s own deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The deliberately lowered expectations led to only incremental progress, both in the ongoing transformation of the Alliance’s defence and deterrence posture, and on support to Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a €40 billion package was agreed for Ukraine in 2025. A five-year commitment had been favoured by the NATO Secretary General, but Allies wanted an annual review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a Joint Analysis Training and Education Center will be set up to jointly identify and apply lessons from the current war and increase Ukrainian interoperability with NATO. This will act as a critical feedback loop for NATO’s Allied Command Transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These commitments are not trivial, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was very careful to not come across as ungrateful as he was at Vilnius, which annoyed many Allies at the time. However, these collective commitments do not move the dial decisively in Ukraine’s favour. Political slogans to support Ukraine for “as long as it takes” were repeated. However, there were no definitions from the many speakers at the Public Forum on what a Ukrainian victory would actually look like – or, for that matter, a Russian defeat. At Vilnius, the requirement for Ukrainian membership of NATO was “when allies agree and conditions are met”. A year on, Ukraine is still none the wiser as to what these conditions are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-missed-opportunity&quot;&gt;A Missed Opportunity?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central victory for Ukraine was the following passage from the summit declaration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms. As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, and its advocates, secured the stronger language of an “irreversible” path towards NATO. However, this wording is anything but irreversible for two reasons. First, a future President Donald Trump could renege on the commitment, with fears that a US government led by him could offer up a commitment that Ukraine will never join NATO in future negotiations with Russia. Second, Macron, straight after the declaration from the 2019 London meeting of the North Atlantic Council was published, rowed back on the agreed language on China. Summitry wording does not equal policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the only procedurally “irreversible” mechanism would be an invitation for Ukraine to join the Alliance. It was a missed opportunity for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, unity. The short-term desire to harness the unity that NATO has enjoyed since Russia’s 2022 invasion is detrimental to its longer-term health. It has been 16 years since NATO made the commitment at the Bucharest Summit that Ukraine (and Georgia) “will become members of NATO”. With the irreversible language in 2024, NATO has backed itself into a corner, with little semantic room left for the subsequent years. As such, it will get harder and harder for NATO to satisfy support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, a formal invitation would give NATO, and the US, greater control on the timing of Ukraine joining at the precise moment “when conditions are met”. Through the use of Article 11 (Ratification) of the Washington Treaty, the Allies could show support to Ukraine and gradually manage escalation with Russia, even using it as a punishment for Russian behaviours by incrementally moving Ukraine closer through national ratifications in response to Russian atrocities such as the Okhamdyat strike. This would be preferable to waiting until “conditions are met” – presumably an end to the war in Ukraine’s favour – and then starting the process, which could take years (the quick ratifications of Finland and Sweden’s accession were an exception to the rule).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there is nothing in Article 10 (Invitation) to suggest that NATO can withdraw an invitation once made. Therefore, this could “Trump-proof” Ukraine’s membership of NATO and ensure it is not offered up in any peace deal with Russia that would surely cause a deep rupture in the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, an invitation now would pre-empt more difficult electoral maths in national parliaments to ratify the Assession Protocols. With such political instability across the Euro-Atlantic, NATO might never have had a better chance of getting ticks in the box. Of course, there is a possibility that parliaments – under different compositions – could “deratify” the protocols in the future, but this would be difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, it would firmly anchor Ukraine into the Euro-Atlantic security architecture. Policymakers should consider what is currently happening in Georgia as a cautionary tale. There is no guarantee that a future political leadership in Ukraine might not also turn away from Europe. It was striking that the Washington declaration removed all reference to Georgia, showing that 16 years of hard work since Bucharest in 2008 have been wasted due to the passing of Georgia’s new foreign agents law – widely dubbed the “Russian Law” – derailing Tbilisi’s Euro-Atlantic path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an invitation would be the ultimate expression of democracy – mentioned in the preamble to the Washington Summit – allowing Allies and national Parliaments to demonstrate support for Ukrainian membership, and those that have reservations to voice them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-leadership&quot;&gt;UK Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With political challenges for the leaderships of the US, France and Germany, the contrast with the UK’s new government mandate at a critical time for the UK, Europe and NATO was stark. The summit was an immediate opportunity for new UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to meet and greet world leaders. The momentum will continue next week as the UK hosts the fourth European Political Community summit with around 40 European leaders at Blenheim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Due to the transatlantic political volatility, there is a real opportunity for the UK to increase its leadership role within NATO&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime minister, flanked by his new Foreign Secretary David Lammy, his Defence Secretary John Healey and Minister for European Relations Nick Thomas-Symonds, put on a show of force in the US to reassure allies and partners. Throughout its election campaign, the Labour Party emphasised its NATO credentials, historically referencing the Party’s and Ernest Bevan’s role and confirming an “unshakeable” commitment to NATO and an “iron clad” commitment to the nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the transatlantic political volatility, there is a real opportunity for the UK to increase its leadership role within NATO. Indeed, it is likely to be necessary. However, the UK’s ability to lead within NATO – beyond words – largely rests on the conclusions of the UK’s next Strategic Defence Review (SDR), which will be announced by the prime minister next week. Three steps will make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Defence Intelligence and the wider UK Intelligence Community should be used to make an assessment of when the government believes the UK might have to commit to war in Europe. This would bring the UK in line with NATO itself and many European allies, and it would be the key to informing resourcing and capability choices – the difference between getting ready for 2027 versus 2033 is stark. It would also provide a target to communicate to the Treasury to negotiate the required increase in funding, or argue to more appropriate funding mechanisms for defence. This assessment should also be openly communicated to UK society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, to meet a “NATO first” approach, the SDR should fully align with the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP) rather than try to circumvent it. The UK should directly ask NATO what is required through the process for this four-year cycle and likely the subsequent two. This would then become the foundation of the SDR to avoid national programmes and projects that do not align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the role of UK nuclear weapons should be emphasised. The UK, unlike France, assigns its nuclear forces to NATO, and in a more dangerous world and with the risk of a disengaged US, Europeans are putting more emphasis on nuclear deterrence. The UK’s nuclear capability should also be better used as a bargaining tool within the NDPP, rather than an added extra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;america-first&quot;&gt;America First&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the multiple European elections this year, it is only the US election that really matters for European security. Former President Trump was not at the summit, but his spectre loomed large. Next week is the Republican National Convention, where he will officially become the nominee. If he does win the election, the 2025 NATO summit in The Hague will be very different to Washington, and it will force NATO to face the hard choices that it continues to defer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, Japan has taken historic steps to strengthen its defense posture and in turn the U.S.-Japan alliance, which has entered a period of unprecedented integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a far cry from the time of the alliance’s origins in 1951. With pacifist principles deeply embedded in its postwar constitution, Japan once prioritized economic development and resisted defense cooperation with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this starting point, how did Japan evolve into a significant military power capable in its own right of reinforcing deterrence across the Indo-Pacific region?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/programs/japan-chair&quot;&gt;CSIS Japan Chair&lt;/a&gt; compiled a short history, supplemented by a repository of official statements and interviews with experts, to document the remarkable evolution of this security partnership. This is Alliance Online, a resource tool documenting the evolution of the U.S.-Japan alliance, a security relationship critical to the history — and future — of international relations in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The signing of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20136/volume-136-I-1832-English.pdf&quot;&gt;1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty&lt;/a&gt; that ended the Pacific War&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The signing of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/japan001.asp&quot;&gt;1951 Security Treaty&lt;/a&gt; between Japan and the United States&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A subsequent revision of the bilateral treaty in 1960 known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/q&amp;amp;a/ref/1.html&quot;&gt;Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the Security Treaty, Japan retained the right to self-defense under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7&quot;&gt;Chapter VII, Article 51 of the United Nations Charter&lt;/a&gt;. However, Japan also renounced war as a sovereign right under &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html&quot;&gt;Article IX&lt;/a&gt; of its new constitution, written by the United States during the postwar occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the United States signed the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which allowed U.S. forces to retain bases in Japan after Japan regained sovereignty. However, the first version of the treaty included no obligation for the United States to defend Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-yoshida-doctrine&quot;&gt;The Yoshida Doctrine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As pressure from the United States on Japan to strengthen defense began to increase, Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru reluctantly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.loc.gov/resource/llglrdppubt.2019668409/?sp=2&amp;amp;st=text&quot;&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; Japan’s Self-Defense Forces in 1954.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was based on a government interpretation of the constitution that minimal defense capabilities were permissible under Article IX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some conservatives in Japan at the time pushed for a stronger military and for a broader interpretation of the constitution to allow the right of collective self-defense, Yoshida &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/event/forum/pdf/2003_01.pdf&quot;&gt;advocated&lt;/a&gt; a minimalist approach to allow Japan to focus on economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/kishidas-realism-diplomacy-yoshida-doctrine-values-based-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Yoshida Doctrine&lt;/a&gt;, under which Japan would ally with the West but do the minimum necessary for defense cooperation while focusing on reviving the economy, took hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-bargain-1&quot;&gt;The Strategic Bargain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Cold War tensions in Asia intensified in the aftermath of the Korean War, the two governments &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/en/j-us-alliance/joint-declaration/treaty/index.html&quot;&gt;revised&lt;/a&gt; the bilateral security treaty in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revised treaty enshrined the U.S. commitment to defend Japan in Article V in return for permission to retain bases in Japan “for the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East,” captured in Article VI. The United States also retained control of Okinawa until 1972. This was the broad strategic bargain that remains the foundation of the U.S.-Japan alliance to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these early days, few in either country thought that Japan would eventually emerge as a true military partner of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive protests that took place in Japan in response to the revised treaty — &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v18/d201&quot;&gt;which led President Eisenhower to cancel a planned visit&lt;/a&gt; to Japan in June 1960 — reflected concerns about the potential to become drawn into Cold War conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Japan gradually focused more on defense as the regional security environment became more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cold-war&quot;&gt;The Cold War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite the controversy in Japan surrounding the 1960 security treaty, strategic debates also reflected a parallel concern that a failure to develop defense capabilities could weaken U.S. support for Japan.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Sw741W5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ During the Cold War, Japan’s proximity to the Soviet Union necessitated a focus on homeland defense, especially in the surrounding seas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This created an “entrapment vs. abandonment” dilemma that animated Japanese defense policy during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of Soviet military power in East Asia would eventually necessitate increased emphasis on homeland defense, especially in the surrounding seas, to deter a Soviet attack and secure imports of natural resources critical to Japan’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sea lane defense was the focus of two key documents: Japan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldjpn.net/documents/texts/docs/19761029.O1E.html&quot;&gt;National Defense Program Outline&lt;/a&gt; of 1976 and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan2.usembassy.gov/pdfs/wwwf-mdao-defense-guidelines1978.pdf&quot;&gt;Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation&lt;/a&gt; of 1978, highlighting the alliance’s increased importance in the Cold War. This set the stage for Japan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/09/world/japanese-premier-vows-even-greater-efforts-on-defense.html&quot;&gt;commitment&lt;/a&gt; in 1981 to take on responsibility for defending sea lanes out to 1,000 nautical miles from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reinforcement-of-the-yoshida-doctrine&quot;&gt;Reinforcement of the Yoshida Doctrine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as Japan took modest but important steps to strengthen defense cooperation with the United States, it also implemented new measures that reinforced the Yoshida Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1967, Japan adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/un/disarmament/nnp/index.html#:~:text=My%20responsibility%20is%20to%20achieve,line%20with%20Japan's%20Peace%20Constitution.&quot;&gt;Three Non-Nuclear Principles&lt;/a&gt;, barring the country from possessing, manufacturing, or introducing nuclear weapons. The same year, it imposed an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/un/disarmament/policy/index.html&quot;&gt;effective ban&lt;/a&gt; on defense equipment exports. And in 1976, Japan announced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00196/&quot;&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; of limiting defense spending to 1 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to Yoshida’s vision, Japan focused on economic recovery while remaining allied with the West — yet gradually embraced a greater role in defense in response to the Soviet threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;burgeoning-economic-friction&quot;&gt;Burgeoning Economic Friction&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoshida’s emphasis on economic revival also featured prominently during this period, and by the 1980s Japan’s economic power became a source of friction with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20181203003241/http:/www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm850922.htm&quot;&gt;1985 Plaza Accord&lt;/a&gt; was intended to rectify trade imbalances, but it instead increased Japanese investment in the United States and generated criticism of Japan’s economic prowess as the U.S. economy struggled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This introduced a new dynamic to alliance ties that threatened to overshadow progress in defense cooperation critical to U.S. strategy in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;purpose-lost-and-regained&quot;&gt;Purpose Lost and Regained&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A series of crises in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War precipitated an effort to redefine strategic objectives for the U.S.-Japan alliance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j9F3ANY.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ In the post-Cold War era, the rise of security threats close to home — including North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs — convinced Japan to expand its traditional concept of self-defense to focus more on regional security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first Gulf War in 1991, Japan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/features/c00202/&quot;&gt;considered&lt;/a&gt; dispatching the Self-Defense Forces to support peacekeeping operations in response to U.S. pressure but failed to do so and was criticized for “checkbook diplomacy” after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nippon.com/en/features/c00202/&quot;&gt;contributing $13 billion&lt;/a&gt; to support the coalition against Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;renewal-of-alliance-purpose&quot;&gt;Renewal of Alliance Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/papers/english/me19-s1-14.pdf&quot;&gt;collapse of Japan’s “bubble” economy in 1992&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent U.S. emphasis on trade imbalances complicated the bilateral relationship even as the regional security environment deteriorated. Washington became increasingly focused on the threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and a newly rising China. But a coalition government in Japan began to emphasize multilateral diplomacy and a focus on Asia over the alliance with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alarmed by the potential for drift in the relationship, then assistant secretary of defense Joseph Nye launched a strategic review of the alliance. He published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/east-asia-strategy-report/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in February 1995 that emphasized the importance of U.S. forward military presence in East Asia in a post–Cold War world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events in and around Japan added further urgency to the reconsideration of alliance purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by U.S. servicemen in 1995 precipitated a political crisis in the U.S.-Japan alliance and increased pressure to reduce the U.S. military footprint on Okinawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other events drove home the continued relevance of a robust forward U.S. military presence for regional stability. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/3253814/averting-escalation-and-avoiding-war-lessons-from-the-19951996-taiwan-strait-cr/&quot;&gt;Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995–1996&lt;/a&gt; — in which China conducted missile tests around Taiwan in response to Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui’s visit to the United States — prompted the United States to respond with aircraft carrier deployments to the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wTMkEEQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of these events, Washington launched a dialogue with Tokyo to define the future of the U.S.-Japan alliance and rebuild the consensus in both capitals about the relationship’s importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort culminated in April 1996 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/security.html&quot;&gt;joint security declaration&lt;/a&gt; that affirmed the alliance as the “cornerstone . . . for maintaining a stable and prosperous environment for the Asia-Pacific region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that document, the two governments &lt;a href=&quot;https://warp.da.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/11591426/www.mod.go.jp/e/d_act/us/anpo/pdf/19970923.pdf&quot;&gt;agreed to revise&lt;/a&gt; the 1978 guidelines for defense cooperation, to include cooperation for the first time in “situations that may emerge in the areas surrounding Japan” — code for a Korean contingency — signaling Japan’s willingness to loosen its traditional emphasis on primarily its own defense to focus more on regional security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1996, the governments also produced a blueprint for reducing the impact of the U.S. presence on Okinawa, including plans to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is located in a heavily populated area and thus is a symbol of local frustration with the U.S. military presence on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-20002012-&quot;&gt;[ 2000–2012 ]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-war-on-terror-and-rebalance-to-asia&quot;&gt;The War on Terror and Rebalance to Asia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, marked the beginning of a new chapter in alliance cooperation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Gulf War period, Japan under Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro moved quickly to support the United States after the attacks and passed &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/policy/2001/anti-terrorism/1029terohougaiyou_e.html&quot;&gt;special legislation&lt;/a&gt; to dispatch Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels to the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/koizumispeech/2003/07/26danwa_e.html&quot;&gt;similar bill&lt;/a&gt; was passed after the onset of the Iraq War to allow the Self-Defense Forces to support reconstruction efforts under Operation Iraqi Freedom. Some 600 Ground Self-Defense Force personnel were deployed to Iraq to provide non-combat support to the war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both “special measures” laws were historic and facilitated a role for Japan in international security beyond its immediate region. Initially unpopular, both measures earned public support over time as Japan’s contributions were &lt;a href=&quot;https://avalon.law.yale.edu/sept11/state_009.asp&quot;&gt;recognized internationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanding role for Japan under Koizumi prompted the U.S. and Japanese governments to initiate a review of alliance roles, missions, and capabilities in a regional and global context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee or “2+2” process — meetings between the U.S. secretaries of state and defense and their Japanese counterparts — became the driver of progress in the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint statements in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/scc/joint0502.html&quot;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/scc/doc0510.html&quot;&gt;October&lt;/a&gt; 2005 outlined common strategic objectives for the alliance and added efforts to improve the international security environment as a third pillar for alliance roles and missions (in addition to the defense of Japan and situations surrounding Japan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;friction-over-us-force-posture-in-japan&quot;&gt;Friction over U.S. Force Posture in Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2006, the two governments announced a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsp.guam.gov/wp-bsp-content/uploads/govarchieve/G01-60.166%202006%20May%201_United%20States-Japan%20Roadmap%20for%20Realignment%20Implementation.pdf&quot;&gt;realignment plan&lt;/a&gt; for U.S. forces, including a plan to move approximately half of the 18,000 U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa to Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort to realign U.S. force posture stemmed from a desire to better position the United States to address international terrorism and other new global security challenges while reducing the impact on the Japanese people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Japanese concerns about the latter would test the alliance a few years later during a period of political transition in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/world/asia/31japan.html&quot;&gt;wrested political power from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)&lt;/a&gt;, which had ruled for much of the postwar era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Hatoyama Yukio was chosen by the DPJ as its first prime minister. He introduced the concept of an “&lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/hatoyama/statement/200911/15singapore_e.html&quot;&gt;East Asian Community&lt;/a&gt;” as the centerpiece of his foreign policy, placing greater emphasis on multilateral diplomacy to promote economic and security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hatoyama also sought to revise the 2006 realignment plan for U.S. forces and &lt;a href=&quot;https://japan.kantei.go.jp/hatoyama/statement/201005/28kaiken_e.html&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the entire U.S. Marine Corps presence on Okinawa be relocated off the island. Although neither proposal was realized, the process of revisiting alliance agreements was challenging for alliance managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-great-east-japan-earthquake-and-rising-threats-in-asia&quot;&gt;The Great East Japan Earthquake and Rising Threats in Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frictions over the alliance continued until the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011. That natural disaster cast the U.S.-Japan alliance in a new light as the U.S. and Japanese militaries &lt;a href=&quot;https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R41690/16&quot;&gt;coordinated large-scale humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts&lt;/a&gt; to support Japan’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By early 2012, the alliance was again on firm footing, and under Prime Minister Noda Yoshihiko the two governments successfully negotiated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secnav.navy.mil/eie/ASN%20EIE%20Policy/2012-04-27%20Joint%20Statement%20of%20the%20Security%20Consultative%20Committee.pdf&quot;&gt;adjustments&lt;/a&gt; to the 2006 force posture plan, preserving plans to reduce the Marine Corps presence on Okinawa while changing the composition of units moving to Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for Japan to strengthen deterrence in response to China’s military ambitions and tensions in the South China Sea and East China Sea subsequently shaped defense policy debates, ultimately yielding new strategies released after the LDP returned to power in late 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coincided with a strategic decision on the part of the United States to focus more cohesively on regional affairs under President Obama’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/asia_pacific_rebalance_factsheet_20130412.pdf&quot;&gt;rebalance to Asia&lt;/a&gt;,” reviving a process of strategic alignment with profound implications for U.S.-Japan alliance cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;-20122024-&quot;&gt;[ 2012–2024 ]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;alliance-integration&quot;&gt;Alliance Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Under Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, Japan unveiled its first National Security Strategy in 2013.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ASB6SSx.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s growing assertiveness in the South and East China Seas, combined with increasing frictions over Taiwan, prompted a shift in Japan’s focus to the south and west.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy defined Japan’s national interest in strengthening its own defense capabilities, the U.S.-Japan alliance, and partnerships with other like-minded partners in Asia to manage a rising China and shape the regional order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abe government pushed through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/gaiyou/jimu/pdf/anpohosei_eng.pdf&quot;&gt;reinterpretation of Article IX of the constitution&lt;/a&gt; to allow Japan to exercise the right of collective self-defense under limited circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It then prevailed in a contentious policy debate that resulted in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000143304.pdf&quot;&gt;package of defense policy reforms in 2015&lt;/a&gt; to codify the reinterpretations and authorize expanded roles for the Self-Defense Forces in a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a member of the United Nations, Japan already enjoyed the right of collective self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter, but since Yoshida, successive governments had chosen not to exercise that right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abe considered this step essential to enhancing Japan’s role as an alliance partner, and though limited in scope, the 2015 reforms allowed Japan to provide direct support for U.S. military operations if an attack against the United States threatened Japan’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of Japan’s new contributions featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000078188.pdf&quot;&gt;revised guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation released that same year. The new guidelines enabled the two militaries to plan for a wider range of contingencies and strengthen interoperability between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-birth-of-foip&quot;&gt;The Birth of FOIP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abe also established Japan as a regional leader. His government released a broad diplomatic strategy in 2016 known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/afr/af2/page4e_000496.html&quot;&gt;Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)&lt;/a&gt; strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOIP was designed to foster bilateral and multilateral interactions on political, security, and economic affairs while promoting regional institutions to support regional stability and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s blueprint for what it called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/siryou/pdf/2019boueikeikaku_e.pdf&quot;&gt;multilayered security cooperation&lt;/a&gt;” informed the regional strategies of the United States and several other nations, which all introduced their own FOIP visions to underwrite a free and open rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the postwar era, Japan enhanced its defense capabilities and roles in the U.S.-Japan alliance incrementally in response to changes in the security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in many ways, the postwar constraints on Japanese defense policy remained in place even through the Abe era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-defense-cooperation&quot;&gt;Enhancing Defense Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine — and Beijing’s support for Moscow — had a galvanizing effect on Japanese public opinion. In 2022, the government led by Prime Minister Kishida Fumio unveiled the second &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/siryou/221216anzenhoshou/nss-e.pdf&quot;&gt;National Security Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/policy/agenda/guideline/strategy/pdf/strategy_en.pdf&quot;&gt;National Defense Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mod.go.jp/j/policy/agenda/guideline/plan/pdf/program_en.pdf&quot;&gt;buildup plan&lt;/a&gt; to dramatically strengthen Japan’s defense posture and enhance defense cooperation with the United States and other like-minded partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ambitious agenda includes plans to nearly double the defense budget by 2027, invest for the first time in long-range counterstrike missiles and other capabilities to strengthen deterrence, and bolster Japan’s defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jU6FnTo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Japan’s Defense-Related Expenditures* (1997–2023)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The April 2024 Kishida-Biden summit in Washington clearly demonstrated a commitment to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/04/10/united-states-japan-joint-leaders-statement/&quot;&gt;strengthen defense cooperation&lt;/a&gt; with the United States. Kishida also has worked to deepen Japan’s ties with other like-minded partners, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/a_o/na/kr/page1e_000810.html&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/a_o/ocn/au/page1e_000761.html&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100575977.pdf&quot;&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mofa.go.jp/erp/ep/page7e_000023.html&quot;&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization&lt;/a&gt; (NATO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes represent a fundamental departure from Japan’s strategy at the onset of the Cold War, when pacifist principles, concerns about entrapment in military conflict, and a focus on economic power were the dominant features of Japanese strategic culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the United States are building an alliance that is more integrated bilaterally and with other partners to maintain stability and order in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite important constraints, including Article IX of its constitution, Japan will likely continue to move away from the Yoshida Doctrine and invest even more in defense to ensure the security of the nation and the region as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田稱坐椅子上被拳打氣門 控方質疑警員有大肚腩難彎身&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/maNY4Vt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（11日）踏入第51日審訊。被告李家田供稱警方上門拘捕時，被安排坐在電腦椅上，遭多名警員拳打腳踢。控方代表大律師周凱靈在盤問階段指出，曾上庭作供的男警5820梁樂文「相當大隻」及「好大肚腩」，因此控方質疑李的說法並問：「你係咪要我哋相信呢個說法，一個大肚腩警員烏低身打你氣門？」、「佢屈住大肚腩打你？」；李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田同意黃振強對嚴文謙帶女友行動有微言&quot;&gt;李家田同意黃振強對嚴文謙帶女友行動有微言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第四日作供，接受辯方盤問。代表嚴文謙的大律師梁鴻谷指出，Telegram「滅龍」群組的對話顯示，嚴多次表示因要陪伴女友，未能出席黃提議的示威行動，他亦曾提出會帶女友一同出席示威行動。黃因此以粗口責罵嚴，一度指「又帶條友出嚟佗手掕腳走唔切咁點，你救佢，我救你呀？」、「你帶住佢我就唔出，你自己諗」。辯方指，「屠龍」行動一般「唔方便帶女眷」因需要快速及有力量；李同意。另外，李同意從對話中感覺嚴的女友「比較有支配性」，而黃振強曾對嚴的行為有微言，不滿嚴的女友「痴住佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示審訊時才知黃振強用資金賭錢-對他欺騙隊友感婉惜&quot;&gt;李表示審訊時才知黃振強用資金賭錢 對他欺騙隊友感婉惜&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李同意黃原打算12月1日在尖沙咀行動，而嚴回應身處韓國未能出席，最終黃決定取消。李表示，沒有聽過黃表示因沒有嚴一同行動，失去安全感故取消。辯方其後問，隊友之間是否經常拿名為「毒蛇隊長」的人來開玩笑，因他經常稱有大殺傷力武器藏在山洞；李同意。辯方展示對話紀錄，顯示嚴曾稱：「我哋使唔使搵人守洞？」李表示以其理解，嚴應該是說笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另問及小隊的資金，李表示留意到黃曾向其他隊友提供資助，一般是「有求必應」。李又指，隊員之間沒有討論黃如何處理獲得的款項。直至審訊期間，李才知道黃利用滙豐個人戶口收取過百萬資助，並使用款項賭錢及作為泰國旅行支出。辯方問李，在得悉黃收取的資金與給予隊員的金額不成正比，有否感到憤怒；黃表示沒有，但同意辯方指對於黃一直欺騙隊友感到婉惜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前稱告知隊員懷疑自己被警方跟蹤，辯方問：「佢哋有冇表示擔心，有冇人覺得需要避吓、需要防範？」李表示沒有。辯方追問成員有否擔心「樹大招風」；李回答他們並無這方面的擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示成員在安全屋討論打機-唔係咁認真示威&quot;&gt;李表示成員在安全屋討論打機 「唔係咁認真示威」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉佩凝的大律師馬維騉問到，成員有否在安全屋討論將來的示威行動。李表示成員「唔係咁認真示威」，通常會玩或者打機；若有行動的話，只會在 Telegram 群組商討。李同意，「屠龍」成員的行動只涉堵路或裝修，即使有用汽油彈亦無意傷害人，也從沒有使用致命武器傷害人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李表示留在屠龍為搜集故事-控方質疑無證明&quot;&gt;李表示留在「屠龍」為搜集故事 控方質疑無證明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表大律師周凱靈進行盤問。李表示加入「屠龍」後，參與不超過10次的示威行動。控方質疑，李在「屠龍」成名後，卻沒有選擇退出群組；李表示自己為了搜集資料作電影素材。控方質疑，李沒有依照其「故事大綱」執行，沒有其他資料顯示他有搜集故事。李同意沒有紀錄，又指在示威現場只是透過觀察搜集故事，包括在理大觀察到示威者陷入絕望和恐慌狀態，但沒有訪問他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，由加入「屠龍」直至被捕，他共向黃索取一萬多元，黃一直是「有求必應」。李又指，沒有見過黃將現金交給其他被告。控方質疑：「即係你同佢交情好特別？」李回應因他私下問黃拿錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問到「屠龍」向警方投擲汽油彈之目的，李表示他們可能想嚇退警察，但強調自己沒有使用汽油彈，只見過黃振強及嚴文謙使用。李又指，成員聚會期間通常會「吹水」及「講笑」，有時會事後檢討行動，但不會討論將來的行動細節或部署。控方指，黃被捕後小隊變得「群龍無首」；李表示多名成員被捕後，小隊已屬解散狀態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問警員毆打時是否拳拳到肉李表示並非用全力&quot;&gt;控方問警員毆打時是否「拳拳到肉」李表示並非用全力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李家田稱，於2020年6月11日被警方上門拘捕時，他上身赤裸、遭多名警務人員拳打腳踢及施行「水刑」，過程約30至45分鐘。控方問警員在毆打時是否「拳拳到肉」；李不同意並指：「覺得佢唔係用全力打我。」控方並問：「唔係錫住你、揩下你就當打？真係有力度？」李表示並非太用力，雖然不是很痛，但氣門被打時感覺辛苦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑警員有大肚腩-難以彎身打李&quot;&gt;控方質疑警員有大肚腩 難以彎身打李&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦質疑，警員毆打坐在電腦椅的李，「佢打你，你咪轆走？」李表示沒有這個情況出現。控方亦問，警員5820是否要「烏低身」打李的氣門；李同意。惟控方指根據庭上所見，他「相當大隻」、「好大肚腩」；李同意。控方遂質疑：「你係咪要我哋相信呢個說法，一個大肚腩警員烏低身打你氣門？」、「佢屈住大肚腩打你？」；李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱警腳踢其腰-控方質疑難發力&quot;&gt;李稱警腳踢其腰 控方質疑難發力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李的證供亦指，警員6314用穿上軍靴的腳踢其左腰間。控方要求李站起身示範，其後代表李的大律師何正謙坐在椅子上，李提高右腳示範踢向其左腰。李解釋，當時雙手被反鎖背後，感覺警員運用六成力度踢。控方質疑：「你會同意警員踢你嘅動作難發力？」李表示若該警員有學過武術，或可以發力，但最後同意控方指，沒有學過武術的人難以發力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前的證供亦透露，當時亦遭偵緝警署警長馮保羅掌摑臉部至少10下。控方問及力度時，李表示對方不算大力，他亦不太感到痛楚。控方最後問：「雖然你話痛，話唔係好大力，咁有冇傷痕？」李表示腹部沒有傷痕，但腰間有直徑6厘米的紫色瘀痕，至於臉部則不覺得有腫脹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wa8EBQP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後李要求吸煙，警員於是將李的雙手鎖在前方，他自行用火柴點煙。控方質疑：「扣住隻手點火？」李同意。李續指，在追問下他表示「支槍喺鴻仔度」。但警方卻捏造李曾稱自己有份去西貢試槍。控方亦質疑，實際上警方已搜獲與本案數量符合的手槍，為何警員會稱「唔對數」；李表示不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李承認錄影會面時-未能說出警方要求記住的被告姓名&quot;&gt;李承認錄影會面時 未能說出警方要求記住的被告姓名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦透露，事後警員著他記住本案被告的人名。他不同意控方指，由於認識他們故容易記住姓名。但李同意自己在錄影會面時未能交代任何一個被告的姓名，他解釋指不記得。控方展示李的 PayMe 紀錄，顯示黃轉賬時顯示他的全名。控方質疑：「你真係要我哋相信，你唔知佢咩名？」李表示不知道付款者是否黃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李解釋為免被警方誤會參與暴動-故更改-telegram-用戶名&quot;&gt;李解釋為免被警方誤會參與暴動 故更改 Telegram 用戶名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問，李為何在黃被捕後將 Telegram 用戶名改為「黃又南」；李解釋為免引起不必要誤會，被警方以為自己參與暴動，亦擔心警方可能拘捕群組成員。李強調自己沒有參與破壞及堵路行為，只是在現場搜尋示威者故事。控方問李是否有詢問示威者，他表示沒有。控方遂問：「嗰故事從天嚟話畀你聽？」李不同意，強調是透過觀察獲得故事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦質疑，李為何要訛稱手槍放在自己的綠色斜孭袋。他表示：「我受到咁不人道待遇，唯有講啲嘢出嚟畀佢」，並想「攞啲證據」滿足警方。控方亦問：「綠色斜孭袋絕對可以裝到支槍？」李表示需要嘗試。控方回應：「你要我試？好呀！」控方遂將證物手槍併到袋上，又一度問警方：「無子彈㗎可？」最後李同意可以擺放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（12日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KioGZUy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今續處理參選衞生服務界的余慧明求情。代表余的大律師石書銘表示，余以護士為志業，組織工會和參選僅為服務公眾，她一直倡以非暴力和合法手段向政府施壓，惟本案後很大機會不能再任護士，已付出代價。而余所屬的衞生服務界沒有協調會議、亦無討論35+後的行為，認為余屬「積極參加者」較低級別或「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出余撰寫的求情信，余提及參選立法會是望增加議價能力和改變死局，但卻被指控為顛覆國家政權，「是其他民主國家聞所未聞」；而法庭裁決指「五大訴求」為空中樓閣，但當中包括落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選，余反問：「如果政府視落實23條是憲制責任，難道落實雙普選不是一樣嗎？」余又表明，即使到現在仍認為透過在立法會投票改變既定秩序並沒有錯，「或許我唯一犯下的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。」法官陳慶偉聞言後打斷，指這並非求情信，着辯方勿發表政治演說；又一度說：「那就不要求情，你不用求情，那沒有問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;毛孟靜岑敖暉何啟明無到庭&quot;&gt;毛孟靜、岑敖暉、何啟明無到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的毛孟靜、岑敖暉、何啟明今無到庭，其餘6人則按男女分成上下兩排，由懲教人員隔坐。昨繫領帶的馮達浚今無繫領帶，岑子杰則換上一件深藍色T裇，並向旁聽席展示背面圖案，又拉下口罩逐一向旁聽人士微笑揮手，又向律師揮手。余慧明則身穿卡其色外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;多名社民連成員包括周嘉發、陳寶瑩、黃浩銘，前民陣召集人陳皓桓，及前沙田區議員李志宏等均有旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方余以醫療服務為志業組織工會為服務公眾&quot;&gt;辯方：余以醫療服務為志業、組織工會為服務公眾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師石書銘先為前醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明求情，石陳詞期間，余坐得畢直，表情嚴肅望向前方。石指，余案發時33歲，已婚，在香港出生和長大，在大學時已以醫療服務為志業，修讀護理系並成為註冊護士，再進修成為深切治療部護士。余在前線工作多年，但因貢獻有限，因此決定轉到醫管局總部，擔任醫療信息管理助理主任。石強調她不是望有更舒適的環境工作，而是希望令更多病人受惠，並形容從余的學歷、職業，再到2019年組織工會，一路以來，都可見她熱心公共服務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石形容，余是政治素人，對政治不感興趣亦無參與政治，2019年的運動令香港市民關注日常生活的法律與秩序，是她的覺醒（awakening）；直至其後疫情爆發，影響每名香港人，驅使她作出行動。石強調，工會獲同事支持，提出的關注與政治無關，而是關乎公共衞生和採取措施以防生命損失。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CkhxrIM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石指，一個巴掌拍不響，無論事後回看余的想法何其激進，但當時他們只是對當權者的做法作出回應，可惜要求封關的訴求最終不獲理會，余遂決定參與立法會選舉。石又指，余出身自勞動階層的家庭，以非凡的努力實踐專業，再決定參政，作為一名花這麼多時間就公共衞生作出貢獻的工會領袖，余在其他地方或會被嘉許，但因本港政治環境獨特，余如今面對的卻是定罪。法官陳仲衡打斷，指余是因案發的行為、而非因其公共服務而定罪，石書銘表示明白，但強調余所做的是她公共服務之路的一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方余不知謀劃非法倡以非暴力和合法手段施壓&quot;&gt;辯方：余不知謀劃非法、倡以非暴力和合法手段施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘又指，余供稱否決預算案的理念來自網上和傳媒的討論，當時「35+」是熱門話題，但討論並非關於意圖顛覆國家政權，而是圍繞民意如何能在立法會更好地反映，亦是余參選的原意。雖然余亦多次提及否決預算案以令政府對話，但相關行為在《國安法》生效前屬合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iCi9Inw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 余慧明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，案發時無人清楚知道初選或涉案謀劃是否合法，包括余慧明，而她唯一獲權威告知合法性，是2020年7月9日出席初選記者會時，戴耀廷提及認為初選在《國安法》後仍合法，石望法庭接納余案發時一直強調運用合法手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰要求提供證據支持，指明白戴耀廷曾稱謀劃合法，但問題是被告是否相信，因或許有頑固的激進分子（die hard radicals）明知非法仍願繼續。石指，余並非那些頑固的激進分子，並舉例余在疫情時曾望發起「大三罷」，她不是望以暴力手段、而是運用法律下示威的權利進行施壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，作為從事醫療行業的人，余並非會使用暴力的人，她亦不想見到更多傷亡，就如她提到2019年醫院附近施放催淚彈影響病人，令她非常關注。而余相信《基本法》對落實雙普選的承諾，認為屬「五大訴求」中最重要，她一直以合法和非暴力手段向政府施壓，以帶來改變，並相信否決預算案是在《基本法》框架底下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指余或失護士資格&quot;&gt;辯方指余或失護士資格&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石指，余是一名年輕的理想主義者，她本性非常有同情心，不幸地因對法律的不確定，選了錯誤的一邊。而余作為一名註冊護士，本案後很有機會面對紀律處分，亦因本案控罪非常嚴重，可以肯定當局不會從輕處理（taken lightly），很大機會余不能再成為一名護士。石指，余成年後的人生均貢獻於醫療服務，但現在因為本案，她須以餘生付出代價，望法庭考慮並判處合適的刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4JIlzdM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;余慧明求情信稱唯一的錯或在太愛香港&quot;&gt;余慧明求情信稱唯一的錯或在太愛香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續指，今早聆訊前，收到來自余慧明的求情信，並望於庭上讀出。（＊英文全文及中文翻譯見文末）余提及，2019年100萬名港人上街反修例，但聲音不獲聆聽，引發激烈街頭抗爭，余不欲再看到示威者再犧牲和被捕，加上政府未能及時採取措施預防新冠疫情爆發，故望進入體制，增加議價能力和為改變當時的死局，但此舉卻被指控為顛覆國家政權「是其他民主國家聞所未聞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，法庭裁決提到「五大訴求」是空中樓閣，但當中包括落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選，反問：「如果政府視落實《基本法》23條是憲制責任，難道落實雙普選不是一樣嗎？」余又表示，「即使到現在，我仍然認為透過在立法會投票，改變既定秩序並沒有錯，或許我唯一的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官打斷促勿發表政治演說不求情沒問題&quot;&gt;官打斷促勿發表政治演說、不求情沒問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石欲繼續讀下去時，被法官陳慶偉打斷，指：「這不是一封求情信，這是政治演說，如果你想代你的當事人發表政治演說，我沒有問題，但不要在我的法庭這樣說。」石書銘回應，余在這封信解釋了她參與本案的原因，惟法官李運騰指，問題是在信中看不到減刑因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石再解釋，這是還柙多時的余所表達的想法。陳慶偉重申她可以在法庭外這樣做，但不是在這個法庭，又提高聲量說：「事實上，相反地，我們看不到任何悔意（“In fact, on the contrary, we see no remorse whatsoever.”）」，並補充「那沒有問題的，我們不是要求悔意，那是她的選擇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，本案涉及政治，如被告對所做的表達悔意，或被人質疑他們的信念是否真誠。陳慶偉聳肩和搖頭說：「那就不要求情，你不用求情，那沒有問題。（“Then don’t mitigate, you don’t have to mitigate, you see, that’s fine.”）」石最後指，認為余在信中有展示悔意，惟陳慶偉不接納，石續沒有讀出餘下內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方建議余為積極參加者較低級別&quot;&gt;辯方建議余為「積極參加者」較低級別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就余的參與程度，石書銘指，衞生服務界的情況與其他區有些不同，該界別初選的意圖只是防止分薄票源、增加勝出機會，而且沒有舉辦協調會議和選舉論壇，參選人也沒有與組織者討論達成35+後要做什麼。石形容，在整個案發過程，余基本上獨自行事，亦無證據她就35+與其他人討論，她簽署「墨落無悔」時亦認為不少內容不適用於衞生服務界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，余在謀劃的參與程度一直較低，她沒有策劃謀劃，即使她出席7月15日抗爭派記者會，亦是最溫和的參與者，只提及期望勝出者有更多合作，沒有提倡否決預算案。雖然有其他同場參與者提及否決，法庭亦裁定可以「共謀者原則」指證余，但不代表余支持，而余在會上親自說的話，或更值得法官在判刑時考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石指，若以三級刑期分級制作參考，建議余屬「積極參加者」（判監3至10年）的較低級別，但亦補充，雖余較其他被告就否決預算案表達較清晰的立場，但從整個謀劃來看，衞生服務界較其他界別少競選活動和討論，望法庭亦考慮余屬「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方余很有可能被dq謀劃不大可能成功&quot;&gt;辯方：余很有可能被DQ、謀劃不大可能成功&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又提到即使余在初選勝出，以她案發時的言論，也很有可能被DQ。法官李運騰關注，有辯方稱被告無被DQ，故顯示他不激進；有辯方則稱因被告被DQ，其參與較輕，似乎無論DQ與否都是求情因素，兩者陳詞矛盾。石解釋，若被告被DQ，則無法繼續落實謀劃並帶來危害，並同意法官總結指，政府能DQ候選人本身，已顯示謀劃不大可能成功，不會造成潛在危害，是針對所有被告的求情因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引抗爭派記招問答-指王真誠誤信否決屬合法&quot;&gt;辯方引抗爭派記招問答 指王真誠誤信否決屬合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，王百羽一方昨求情時，法官關注辯方稱王案發時真誠誤信謀劃為合法，但看畢其求情信，似乎看不到他有這樣說，要求辯方提供具體證據。代表王的大律師黃俊嘉今補充，2020年7月抗爭派記者會上，有記者問及承諾否決所有議案是否涉違《國安法》時，有發言者解釋否決是議員被賦予的合法權利，不存在任何脅逼或違法情況，王百羽續說「係啦」，可反映他肯定該發言者的理解，即否決屬合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡表示，《基本法》賦予否決預算案的權力、但並非無差別否決，而該發言者也沒有就無差別否決作出回答。黃俊嘉指，對法律錯誤的理解正是由此而來，因當被問及無差別否決是否違法時，發言者回答這是《基本法》賦予的權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。岑子杰由大律師郭憬憲代表，毛孟靜和岑敖暉由大律師黃雅斌代表，何啟明由大律師阮偉明代表，馮達浚由資深大律師祁志代表，黃碧雲由大律師沈士文代表，劉澤鋒由大律師黃錦娟代表，余慧明由大律師石書銘代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正如我在證供所說，對我來說，一切都源自2019年的反修例運動。當時一百萬名香港人上街，和平地反對修例，遺憾地，他們的聲音不獲聆聽，最終引致激烈的街頭抗爭。而現在，在那場民主運動開始逾5年過後，政府視那些參與的市民為「暴徒」，並標籤運動為「黑暴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年時，我相信即使有持續的街頭抗爭，政府仍然對公眾的不滿置若罔聞。我最不想看到的，是有示威者再犧牲和被捕。再者，由於政府未能及時採取措施預防新冠病毒在社區爆發，因此我希望進入政治體制——參選立法會，增加議價能力，改變當時的死局。然而，此舉被指控為顛覆國家政權，這是其他民主國家聞所未聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭裁決提到「五大訴求」是空中樓閣，但是那些訴求當中，包括落實《基本法》承諾的雙普選。如果政府視落實《基本法》23條是憲制責任，難道落實雙普選不是一樣嗎？即使到現在，我仍然認為透過在立法會投票，改變既定秩序並沒有錯，或許我唯一犯下的錯誤，就是我太愛香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have stated in my evidence, for me everything stemmed from the Anti-Extradition Bill movement in 2019. Back then over a million Hong Kong citizens took to the streets and expressed their opposition to the amendment peacefully. Regrettably, their voices went unheard and eventually triggered off vigorous street protests. And now, more than 5 years after the democratic movement began, the government regards those citizens who took part in the movement as thugs and labels the whole movement as “Black Riot”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I believed that even with continuous street protests, the government would still turn a deaf ear to public grievances. The last thing I wanted to see was further sacrifices and arrests of the protestors. Moreover, since the government failed to take timely measures to prevent the community outbreak of COVID-19, I thus wanted to enter our political institution – to stand for election in the Legislative Council, to increase the bargaining power and bring changes to the deadlock at that time. Yet it was accused as subverting the State Power. This is unheard of in other democratic countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Verdict stated that “Five Demands” were castle in the air. Yet among those demands was the implementation of dual Universal Suffrage as promised by the Basic Law. If the government deemed implementing Article 23 a constitutional duty, isn’t implementing dual Universal Suffrage the same? Even now, I am still of the view that there is nothing wrong in bringing changes to the established order through voting in the legislature, perhaps the only wrong I have committed was that I love Hong Kong too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四批被告今完成求情，本月30日將處理第五批被告求情，為8名新界西初選參與者：朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、伍健偉，料需時3天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指岑子杰2012年未經批准集結罪成後-無重蹈覆轍&quot;&gt;辯方指岑子杰2012年未經批准集結罪成後 無重蹈覆轍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余慧明一方完成求情後，代表岑子杰的大律師郭憬憲表示，已呈交書面陳詞，庭上只有簡單補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他指，岑於2018至2020年擔任民陣召集人，並引述同案從犯證人區諾軒為岑撰的求情信，指岑是九龍西協調會議上反對無差別否決預算案的「關鍵人物」，對於阻止無差別否決預算案成為九西的共識具決定性作用。郭憬憲指，岑的罪責和其他人不同，參與程度屬最輕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭又提及，岑於2012年曾干犯組織及參與未經批准集結罪，判處罰款5千元。法官李運騰指，相關案底已是10年前，辯方毋須提及，郭則強調，岑已汲取教訓，他在2019年曾舉行很多集會，全部均有向警方申請不反對通知書，指只是一次定罪便令他改變，再沒有犯下相同錯誤，正如區諾軒在信中提到，岑是非暴力和守法的人，2019年組織公眾活動時與警方合作。郭並指，就其他個人情況已寫在書面陳詞上，不會再在庭上重複。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，岑向旁聽席微笑豎起拇指，又向律師席的郭憬憲做致敬手勢，黃碧雲和王百羽等也向親友揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to invite your lordship to consider mercy on account of his political orientation. As what I have mentioned in my testimony, with representing League of Social Democrat, he was the key person who objected the advocacy of voting against the budget indiscriminately in the Kowloon West coordination meeting at material period of time. Despite any of his offence afterwards, I would like to emphasise his objection was decisive in preventing the advocacy to be the consensus in the Kowloon West meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我邀請法官閣下考慮岑子杰的政治取向，寬大處理，正如我的證供所述，岑代表社民連，是九龍西協調會議上反對無差別否決預算案的關鍵人物，不論他事後的控罪，我希望強調他的反對，對於阻止無差別否決預算案成為九西協調會議的共識，具決定性作用。&lt;/p&gt;

This paper seeks to identify lessons relevant to the British Army, based on analysis of IDF operations in autumn 2023. The paper is a study of military tactics and does not address the wider operational and strategic situation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards dismounted close combat in an urban environment, the IDF found that the risk of fratricide owing to cross-boundary fires meant that units should have non-contiguous unit boundaries for units advancing along the same axis. Thus, IDF units would have a movement corridor, and a fires corridor allocating on each side. Given the very narrow frontages of manoeuvre, it was found necessary to have combined arms elements in intimate support down to platoon level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF had persistent challenges with rubblisation, both because it created obstructions for movement and degraded the ability to describe the terrain and thus coordinate and control fire. The IDF has concluded that specific training is necessary for what it is terming “devastated terrain warfare”. Specific drills for talking soldiers onto target when looking at irregular terrain must be practised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also found that adopting a sequential approach to surface and sub-surface operations ceded initiative to the enemy and reduced tempo as units mounted deliberate clearance operations in their rear area. Instead, the IDF found that it was more effective to carry out simultaneous surface and sub-surface operations. This required careful battlespace management as movement below ground did not always correlate with unit boundaries above ground. In general, the IDF did not find that there was much of a requirement to deliberately clear high-rise buildings, as there was limited tactical value in being above the second floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations in Gaza have highlighted the criticality of organic lethality at echelon. Hamas tactics have evolved over the course of the fighting, but each iteration saw different groupings of fighters endeavour to rapidly engage isolated IDF units before disengaging. In practice these tactics did not perform well because Hamas was not able to concentrate sufficient firepower. It therefore often failed to inflict significant damage, while the IDF were generally able to suppress attackers and thereafter deliberately target them. For the British Army the lesson is clear: organic lethality must be increased in close combat echelons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to responsively employ precision fires in close proximity to friendly forces – allowing higher echelons to increase the lethality of close combat forces – has become critically dependent on access to the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The IDF found that once units had UAS organic to their formations, there was a significant challenge to identifying friend or foe. Once the enemy was also employing UAS, friendly electronic protection saturated the spectrum, interfering with digitised command and control. This has produced a requirement for reversionary methods to be available, and for improved EMS battlespace management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF ultimately suppressed Hamas’s capacity to concentrate forces because of its access to air delivered effects. It is worth noting that buildings do not offer significant protection against air delivered munitions, because of the weight of ordnance that can be dropped with precision. The lesson for the British Army is that urban defence must be premised on effective air defence covering the urban space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of air delivered fires to bypass the physical protection offered by urban terrain creates significant challenges for discrimination. First, there is the question of what cannot be seen as regards concealed civilians. Second, in conventional and unconventional conflict, combatants are increasingly blending in with the civilian population in a manner that makes discrimination difficult. The IDF have struggled with this problem and it has been exacerbated by the IDF ceding critical elements of the information environment, such as casualty estimates, to entities associated with Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humanitarian situation in Gaza has been disastrous. Much of this relates to issues of getting aid into the Strip, which, other than ensuring the efficiency of searching cargos at scale, is a political rather than tactical military problem and therefore falls outside of the scope of this paper. Where there are transferable lessons for the British Army is in the challenges the IDF have had in distributing aid. On the one hand Hamas has sought to gain control over aid distribution to re-establish control of the territory. This is antithetical to Israel’s war aims. Yet the IDF closely supervising distribution is a recipe for clashes at aid points. The IDF has not found a system that assures adequate supply and distribution of aid while also preventing Hamas from exerting control along the process. This dynamic challenge bears careful study as meeting humanitarian obligations are an essential part of urban operations, but when required at scale can rapidly unhinge the tempo and capacity of a formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more lessons identified in this paper that bear scrutiny. There are also likely to be further lessons that emerge from later stages of IDF operations in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectre of urban operations has been an enduring concern among professional militaries. In 2017, the liberation of Mosul was perceived as simultaneously demonstrating how difficult such operations are and providing an effective model for how Western militaries could project power into urban spaces while transferring the risk onto partner forces; in that case, the Iraqi security forces. The war in Ukraine has resurrected appreciation of the need to be able to conduct complex offensive action into urban terrain, for while the conditions for an urban operation are set in surrounding rural areas, translating tactical success into operational success is often dependent on the ability to enter and successfully seize towns and cities. Given repeated warnings from British defence figures that today is a “pre-war” period, any opportunity to learn lessons about the contemporary battlefield that could improve the readiness of the British Army deserves study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Hamas launched an armed attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, massacring civilians and taking over 250 hostages, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not have the option of transferring the risk onto a partner force. Faced with the simultaneous – and more severe – threat from Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border, the IDF elected to conduct a rapid combined arms assault into dense urban terrain, which had been extensively prepared by Hamas to support protracted defensive operations. Moreover, the assault was in terrain inhabited by a large civilian population hostile to the IDF’s presence and under intense international scrutiny. Given that the IDF is a modern military, drawing on a range of emerging capabilities, its operations are worthy of study to identify lessons relevant to the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines IDF operations – tactics, force structure, capabilities and operational design – during the initial operation in Gaza City in autumn 2023. The paper is intended to highlight tactical lessons that have wider applicability and to discuss the problems that have driven tactical adaptation in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasise what this paper does not attempt to do. It is not an assessment of the likely efficacy of the IDF’s operational design or strategic goals. Nor does it make recommendations about how the conflict may conclude. Rather, it is a study of military tactics. The paper does not assess the ethical or political debate surrounding aspects of Israeli operations, except insofar as the challenges confronted by the IDF would also pose tactical challenges to the British Army under comparable conditions. These questions, while highly important and the subject of ongoing debate, are best addressed separately. The paper is also limited to discussion of operations in 2023 in Gaza City and does not extensively cover subsequent operations in Khan Younis or Rafah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence base for this paper draws on author interviews with strategic-, operational- and tactical-level IDF commanders and analysts from a range of units that have operated in the Gaza Strip during the war. This includes interviews with Israel’s Southern and Northern Commands, with personnel from divisional and brigade staffs and at the battalion level. The IDF have also established lessons learned cells in all their formations, and with battalions assigning an officer to provide observations to the brigades from the beginning of their ground operations. These were analysed at the divisional and regional command echelon, and where contradictory information arose, were investigated. The authors spent time with the lessons learned officers and saw samples of their data. Of the 44 core interviews with IDF personnel, most interviewees ranked between OF4 and OF7. The authors directly observed some of the processes described. The authors also engaged with IDF personnel prior to the conflict and observed IDF training, including for urban operations. In addition to this primary evidence collection, the authors have collated and analysed a significant body of combat footage and reports on the conflict written by both journalists and academics and have maintained contact with some humanitarian personnel working on and in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant limitations to the evidence collected, and the extent to which it can be used. Hamas commanders were not accessible for interview. The authors did not endeavour to interview diplomatic and UN staffs, whose work does not cover military operations. There is also a significant body of evidence collected that cannot be made public or exploited in this paper because its publication would breach operational security. Where this arose, the authors did not address these subjects. The exact details of Israeli intelligence processes and adaptations following the failure to anticipate the attack on 7 October are sensitive, and it was decided to omit discussion of this topic, rather than address it in a manner that was self-evidently inadequate. Another area that is not substantially addressed is the efforts to recover Israeli hostages. While they have had a significant impact on the conduct of the war, these operations are also sensitive, and lessons relating to hostage rescue cannot be adequately covered at this time with the information that is releasable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has seven chapters. Chapter I is a brief overview of the context within which the IDF formulated its operational plan and the scheme of manoeuvre for the first operation against Gaza City. It is not intended to be a detailed narrative of the war. The subsequent chapters each cover lessons relating to warfighting functions: mounted and dismounted close combat; combat engineering; subterranean operations; fires; information operations; and humanitarian support operations. The paper concludes with considerations of the relevance of the identified lessons and specifically how they relate to emerging concepts in the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-operational-context-7-october-to-24-november-2023&quot;&gt;I. Operational Context: 7 October to 24 November 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas initiated its ground invasion of Israel on 7 October 2023 with a carefully synchronised breakthrough of Israel’s border defences. Although combat groups of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the military wing of Hamas) had been instructed to train and equip for the assault and capture of Israeli villages and IDF outposts for some time, these small-scale exercises by individual Hamas units had become somewhat routine. The planning for 7 October had been carried out by a small group, with instructions to individual Hamas units given in isolation, so that only upon assembly were its fighters given briefs on their specific objectives and an indication of the scale of the operation. These briefs were detailed, covering the location of IDF defensive positions and command posts, the layout of military installations and kibbutzim, and in some cases, the working and sleeping quarters of IDF commanders and local officials. The original breaching force also operated with effective communications discipline, with very little use of mobile phones or other communications systems until they were engaged by the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breaching of the border saw Hamas coordinate the blinding of surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities using UAVs, snipers and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) to destroy the cameras and communications antennae along the Gaza border. This simultaneously prevented IDF command posts from receiving information and stopped their transmission of instructions to subordinates. Breaches of the border fence were then executed at 50 points using bulldozers, frame charges and explosive Bangalore torpedoes. In addition, six fan-powered parachutes flew to three points inside Israel, while seven fast boats attempted a maritime insertion along the Israeli coast. The assault force was spearheaded by up to 2,000 Hamas fighters and participants from other armed groups in Gaza. The initial assault force was divided into combat groups, each of which was given specific objectives with prepared intelligence on the location of individual Israeli commanders and garrisons. The headquarters of IDF units and police forces were directly attacked. As the raid occurred during a national holiday in Israel, the IDF were left with very little situational awareness, without their communications infrastructure to coordinate a response, and with a lack of mobile reserves. Hamas teams also seized and held road junctions, impeding IDF movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of setting the initial conditions for the conflict, it is important to note that Hamas fighters deviated significantly from their own plan during its execution. Following behind the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigade fighters were around 1,000 Gazans, who – seeing the breaches in the fences – followed the assault force onto Israeli territory, and were the source of a significant proportion of the social media posts and videos from 7 October. Discipline among Hamas fighters at this point appears to have broken down. The original planning documents showed that Hamas had intended to fortify the positions it had seized and use hostages to complicate the IDF’s retaking of these positions. Hamas had brought rations and medical and combat equipment for extended operations. The chaotic massacre that unfolded diverted efforts to prepare for a deliberate defence. In some respects, the devastation created chaos that complicated efforts to bring the immediate situation under control on 7 October. At the same time, Hamas’s lack of prepared fighting positions made the IDF’s reclamation battle for the seized territory far easier over the following days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDF forces mobilised extremely quickly. In the initial 24 hours, this was to a large extent a process of self-mobilisation, whereby reservists and soldiers on leave rushed to the area near the Gaza border without clear chains of command established, or unit boundaries drawn. This resulted in losses of personnel and equipment. A good example is an IDF CH-53 helicopter, piloted by a former member of the aviation unit, which picked up a unit of paratroopers and flew them directly into the combat zone without deconfliction. The troops were inserted, but the helicopter was destroyed. The deployment of this unit was not part of any higher-level plan but was implemented by commanders and reservists at unit level. Despite this intermingling of troops from units across Israel creating an extremely chaotic battlespace, it also seriously disrupted Hamas fighters’ freedom of manoeuvre in and around the locations they had seized. Command and control (C2) of the IDF’s initial response was also complicated by the fact that Hamas had destroyed many of the antennae supporting military C2 systems around Gaza, while the capture of a large quantity of Israeli communications equipment forced the IDF to distribute new encryption keys for its military communications before they could be used. This meant that the IDF had to revert to civilian communications for the initial 48 hours of the war, with a corresponding lack of operational security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDF mobilisation became more deliberate within 48 hours as reservists were called up, assembled and moved to assembly areas. The appearance of formed units with their command echelon in the battle area enabled an increasingly deliberate series of reclamation battles to take occupied positions. The IDF had largely regained control of the ground within 72 hours, with clearance operations for a further three days eliminating surviving pockets of resistance. Some infiltrators remained on Israeli territory for up to three weeks but were not operationally significant beyond the first five days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the 7 October attack, the Israeli cabinet declared war on Hamas. Given that the Israeli government had seemingly not anticipated any such attack, a precise formulation of Israeli war aims took some time to coalesce, and some tenets of the implementation remain subject to debate. Nevertheless, within the first five days IDF commanders were planning against three core military objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The destruction of Hamas’s military infrastructure and capabilities to a point where they no longer threatened Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The recovery of hostages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The removal of Hamas as the de facto government in Gaza in order to deny Hamas the ability to regenerate its combat power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These objectives, authorised by the Israeli cabinet, became the basis for operational planning as soon as the IDF had regained control of Israeli territory. Other objectives that were more political in character were articulated at various points by Israeli ministers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDF officers concluded that a ground invasion would be necessary to remove Hamas from control of the Gaza Strip. The IDF had previously conducted incursions into the Gaza Strip, as during Operation Protective Edge in 2014. However, the aims of the incursions between 2008 and 2023 were far less ambitious in terms of the amount of terrain that had to be manoeuvred through. The IDF had plans for the full occupation of Gaza, which had been rehearsed in command post exercises. Nevertheless, the number of troops assessed to be necessary meant that these plans could not be fully exercised without a call up of reserves. The scale of the operation envisaged in 2023 meant that there was a requirement for a deliberate force build-up and an extended period of planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The period available for preparation was – in the view of IDF planners – constrained by three factors. First, alongside the ground attack on 7 October, Hamas initiated a massive rocket barrage of Israeli military and civilian sites. In response, the Israeli Air Force conducted an immediate large-scale air campaign against identified Hamas targets in Gaza and assessed rocket launch sites. Despite these efforts, it was assessed that rockets would continue to be launched if Hamas could cache weapons underground, and so would only be prevented from launching more rockets by the IDF physically seizing the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, IDF planners believed that there was a window of opportunity created by the 7 October attack during which the international community would give Israel freedom of action, and that this window would close. This belief stemmed from the experience from previous rounds of fighting. Indeed, just prior to 7 October, a senior IDF planner had indicated to one of the authors that the closing of the window within which operations could be conducted had prevented any kind of critical threshold being reached to change the dynamic during previous rounds of escalation with Hamas, as during 2021. The scale of the Hamas incursion in October 2023 meant that the IDF expected to have a longer period with freedom of action, but time was nevertheless considered a finite resource, and this created a belief among planners that they had to act sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, although Hezbollah had not coordinated any operations against northern Israel with Hamas on 7 October, it did begin to attack Israeli communities with rockets in the days following the operation, and mobilised a large body of fighters. With the threat of a major escalation in the northern theatre coinciding with the commitment of forces in Gaza, the IDF assessed that it needed to be able to rapidly complete the most intensive part of operations in Gaza – the urban break-in – to enable forces to subsequently pivot north. Moreover, the longer the Hamas rocket barrage continued against Israel, the more Iron Dome interceptors would be used, increasing Israel’s vulnerability to Hezbollah’s much greater missile arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the impetus to act quickly, the plan formulated by the IDF ground forces involved an advance into Gaza City on three axes. First, there were raids planned towards Beit Hanoun. These incursions, largely at night, both enabled the emplacement of forces in Gaza and confirmed Hamas in its belief that its phase lines for a deliberate defence should be orientated to confront an assault from this axis. The second axis divided Gaza City from southern Gaza by pushing along the northern side of Wadi Gaza, thereby isolating Hamas forces in the city from their line of resupply. The third axis was the main effort, heading south along the coast on a narrow front and then turning in to Gaza City. The coastal axis was intended to enable the IDF to circumvent most of Hamas’s prepared defences. The plan therefore committed three mechanised divisions simultaneously into an area smaller than 70 km2 to confront an adversary of approximately 20,000 personnel amid a civilian population of more than 600,000 people (approximately 1.1 million in the operational area north of Wadi Gaza, as compared with 40,000 Hamas fighters across the Strip).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that there has been some discussion of Gaza’s population density in the media, suggesting that it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Exact measures of population density vary, depending on where studies draw their boundaries. Like most cities, Gaza City had some pockets of extremely high population density, while across the Strip, the density is within the distribution for modern cities. Recognising that Gaza is not exceptional as an urban space is important, because it makes the lessons from Gaza in this regard transferable to other militaries in other theatres of operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lines of effort were initiated on the night of 27 October and made considerable progress, so that by the time a ceasefire was declared to allow the exchange of prisoners for hostages on 24 November, a large part of Gaza City was under IDF control. The IDF has subsequently conducted operations against Khan Younis, and at the time of writing is conducting operations in Rafah, and it has also undertaken further raids into Gaza City in response to Hamas re-entering parts of the city that had previously been cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a rough outline of the scale of operations and scheme of manoeuvre, it becomes possible to identify a range of tactical lessons and adaptations that the IDF has learned over the course of the fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-mounted-and-dismounted-close-combat&quot;&gt;II. Mounted and Dismounted Close Combat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scheme of manoeuvre for each axis was drawn up at the divisional echelon, under the IDF Southern Command as the operational headquarters. On the main axis, the division committed two brigades to an axis of advance less than 1 km wide. The brigade composition was an armoured battalion, a mechanised infantry battalion, an infantry battalion, a combat engineering battalion, an artillery battalion, a special forces attachment, and enablers. The boundaries between battalions were drawn down the centre of city blocks. The initial incursion was led by D9 bulldozers, intended to overcome IEDs. Exact employment differed block by block and between units, as the formations used were ad hoc. However, a rough outline of the tactical approach saw the D9s work one bound ahead of Merkava main battle tanks, with the heavy armour moving in pairs of vehicles. They would establish overwatch to enable Namer infantry fighting vehicles to then move forward and disembark infantry into buildings flanking the next bound. As the mechanised infantry moved forward, light infantry would advance to clear and hold terrain to prevent attacks on the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been some debate as to the significance of high-rise buildings during urban operations and the extent to which armies need to work out how to fight within them. The evidence from Gaza suggests that these structures are of limited military value. In terms of their use as observation posts, it is difficult for observers positioned on the higher floors to maintain oversight of the cityscape beneath them without also exposing themselves to observation. Above a certain height, the streets become dead ground. Furthermore, fighters who move up a multistorey building lose the ability to reposition laterally. The IDF therefore found that observers would remain in the first few levels of a building (not least because observation from higher altitude can be achieved more effectively by UAVs), while fighters rarely ventured above the second level. This is consistent with observations from Ukraine, largely for the same reasons. Using sensors to detect activity on higher floors to engage them with fires is a relevant capability, but there appears to be a limited requirement for ground manoeuvre forces to extensively occupy and clear higher floors. Tall buildings do bring complications for close combat elements, however. First, to attack an enemy on lower levels with fires often requires higher payload ordnance. This is because the angles available to reach a target in a high-rise area are constrained by obstructions, and thus attacks often need to strike a higher floor but impact a lower floor. This has implications for collateral damage. It also means that there is an increased risk of rubble and debris falling further away from the building, increasing the minimum safe distance from friendly infantry within which fires could be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the IDF made rapid progress during the early break-in, rubblisation caused a range of problems. Tank drivers could not accurately assess the depth of craters through night vision, especially when there had been rain, and some vehicles were lost owing to roll-overs when vehicles drove into shell holes. Another problem arose from a lack of terms for coordinating direct fire. Fire control in either an offensive or defensive context is best conducted through the designation of unit boundaries, arcs of fire, known friendly and enemy positions, and reference points. The integration of many mobilised reservists with the mixed professional and conscript force proved a challenge. While all Israeli reservists have full-time military experience from, at minimum, initial service as conscripts, many reservists had not conducted much substantial training for several years. As a result, many were out of practice and would to varying degrees operate according to outdated doctrine, impeding a common understanding when attempting to coordinate either movement or fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors exacerbated this problem. Gaza City’s high population density and limited urban planning created an urban environment characterised by narrow streets and irregular high-rise buildings. Furthermore, the progressive reduction of the terrain to rubble through the course of fighting resulted in an irregular, congested and complex visual environment. The extreme degree of irregularity and rubblisation proved manageable when mapping terrain from above, but was anathema to the accurate identification and designation of reference points and targets for ground units. If targets were seen by a ground unit, they would often defy precise verbal description, creating scope for their mis-designation. Forces that had been trained to talk one another onto targets using the windows and floors of a building as reference points struggled to rapidly convey where enemy were to one another in structures that no longer had uniformity. The contrast with other urban operations the IDF had conducted was sufficient that the IDF’s lessons learned teams have referred to what was experienced as a distinct category of urban operations – “devastated terrain warfare”. It should also be noted that rubblisation was to a large extent a product of IDF air- and artillery-delivered fires. This should therefore have been a factor in the planning of movement corridors and boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related challenges that IDF personnel confronted were friendly fire and combat accidents, of which there were three main causes. The first, and simplest to resolve, was unfamiliarity with the impact of heavier weapons in close terrain, especially for weapons that soldiers were qualified on but rarely used. The most common culprit was M203 grenade launchers, with several soldiers injured by fragmentation after engaging targets at too close range. Another issue was accidental cross-boundary fragmentation between units caused by heavier weapons carrying on through structures and therefore entering another unit’s manoeuvre corridor. It should be noted that communication between armour and infantry – in the IDF, this is generally done via radio – was critical for confirming channels of fire. Methods such as the use of phones mounted on the rear of tanks to speak to the crew inside were dangerous, given the functioning of active protection systems on Israeli armour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second cause of friendly fire and accidents, and much more challenging, was the difficulty in judging range and thus deconfliction lines between manoeuvre corridors. This was most pronounced when units were looking diagonally down a line of buildings. As rubblisation caused ruined buildings to visually merge, with the effect becoming more pronounced over distance or at night, movement in a building in an adjacent unit’s movement corridor would frequently be mistaken for movement within a unit’s area of responsibility. This issue was reduced, but not fully eliminated, by placing gaps between units’ movement corridors rather than having contiguous boundaries, where both adjacent units had freedom to engage targets in the intervening space. This fire zone was usually placed along a block of buildings. Another important mitigation was to use rangefinders to distinguish buildings and thereby overcome the visual merging of structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third cause of friendly fire related to perceived profiles. On several occasions, IDF personnel being tracked as mounted units dismounted to inspect buildings, run to colleagues’ vehicles to coordinate, or otherwise shifted profile. Where this caused them to appear on ISR feeds in both unexpected locations and as small numbers of armed dismounts, misclassification occurred and in some cases, strikes were directed against them. This was a particular challenge for UAV operators, since while thermal imaging allows personnel to be accurately distinguished from the background terrain, it also reduces the visual distinctiveness of uniforms and equipment. The latter problem was exacerbated by IDF reservists wearing privately acquired armour and uniform elements that did not conform to IDF-issue equipment, reducing the uniformity of the force. Given the lack of uniform among Hamas fighters, this made it difficult to accurately distinguish targets. The challenges of distinguishing Hamas fighters from civilians are discussed later in relation to targeting and fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamas’s tactics may be said to have evolved in three stages. At the beginning of the operation, Hamas appears to have conceived of its defence as being based around key junctions on the anticipated Israeli axis of advance. A strongpoint, from which a position could be overlooked, would fix IDF elements on a given avenue and coordinate the movement of small teams to then attack IDF units in flanking ambushes. This approach was disrupted by the unexpected axis of the main IDF advance. After many of the designated ambush sites were approached from different directions, Hamas thereafter began to raid and fight for key buildings and strongpoints. The fighting therefore shifted to a second stage, from being over particular intersections with favourable sight lines to building complexes that drew in IDF forces to enable attacks. The third stage of Hamas tactics emerged after the week-long November ceasefire and saw the emergence of harassing attacks by small, dispersed groups which would try to converge fires onto isolated IDF elements. As larger-scale engagements and the superiority of IDF fires inflicted heavy losses, Hamas instead switched to trying to attack weaker and smaller patrols of IDF personnel, rather than engage combined arms units. This near-uniform adaptation among Hamas cells demonstrates that they retained the ability to pass information during the initial phase of IDF operations, suggesting that the IDF was unsuccessful in fully degrading Hamas’s C2. The adaptations were consistent with Hamas’s assessed strategic objective of surviving as an armed presence across Gaza and thus retaining administrative control, even with a heavily depleted force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined with the use of fires ahead of manoeuvring elements to disrupt Hamas repositioning, the IDF did not confront heavy anti-armour ambushes, but rather sporadic and harassing engagements. However, once the IDF pushed into an area, Hamas would begin to emerge from subterranean infrastructure to conduct rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) and sniper engagements against IDF vehicles through rubblised structures. In some cases, heavy weapons were brought out from tunnels camouflaged with earth. In others, Hamas fighters would move in civilian profile without weapons and then retrieve cached arms at their intended point of ambush to conduct the engagement. Hamas arms caches were widely dispersed throughout the terrain, with IDF units reporting that about a third of structures in Gaza City contained arms. The attack groups would withdraw to subterranean positions once they had conducted an attack. Hamas’s coordination of these actions appeared to depend on spotters tracking IDF positions and then using fixed lines or runners to communicate this information. The passage of information could also be enabled through social media activity, largely indistinguishable from civilians commenting on events unfolding around them but providing significant situational awareness to combat groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sporadic anti-tank guided missile and persistent RPG threat – often manifesting from a 30–50-m distance from IDF vehicles – posed a challenge for active protection systems (APS). Where APS had either been turned off, did not have a sufficient line of sight between the sensor and the threat, or had already been expended, hits were achieved on IDF vehicles. Nevertheless, while Hamas believed that APS could be defeated with close engagements, this problem was resolved through software updates. In most cases, APS proved effective, although the distance between armour and infantry for APS to be fielded safely also offered Hamas fighters the opportunity to come in extremely close proximity to some vehicles. Nevertheless, it was found that having pairs of vehicles operate in intimate support helped to increase their survivability, as the APS could often overlap and thereby increase the magazine depth to protect the vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth briefly highlighting the number of casualties in Gaza since 7 October 2023, since these provide an indicator of the intensity of the fighting. In terms of individual engagements, Hamas has rarely concentrated forces above the size of the platoon. Nevertheless, because urban terrain causes high-intensity combat between relatively small groups of people, these fights have often been costly. From the beginning of ground operations in Gaza on 27 October 2023 to the time of writing, 287 IDF soldiers have been killed in combat, with a further 1,798 wounded, of whom 357 were classified as severely wounded. The IDF has therefore had more personnel killed so far than the UK did in the campaign to retake the Falklands from Argentina in 1982, or during the entire British campaign in Iraq from 2003. Hamas has not released casualty figures. The IDF estimated that it had killed between 10,000 and 12,000 Hamas fighters by February 2024. Estimates of civilian and combatant casualties among Palestinians exceeded 35,000. In reality, the number of people whose bodies remain under the rubble make a conclusive figure impossible to provide. However, these estimates give a sense of the intensity of the fighting, albeit one distorted by the proportion of casualties from air-delivered and indirect fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-combat-engineering&quot;&gt;III. Combat Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli operations started with the assumption that Hamas would have extensively laid landmines and IEDs along the anticipated routes into Gaza. Thus, Israeli forces at first either avoided roads or only used them in conjunction with meticulous clearance operations with support from D9 bulldozers, which slowed the pace of their advance. The IDF determined that it required 20 D9s per brigade to meet the required tempo of operations, although this was only allocated to the lead brigades. This proved to be largely unnecessary, as Hamas had not laid mines in sufficient concentration, and those that it had deployed along roads were often surface laid and thus easy to detect and simple to remove. It is debatable whether Hamas’s decision not to lay significant IEDs on the roads into Gaza City reflected a recognition that Israel’s combat engineering assets would make these efforts redundant. In other words, it may be that the density of breaching equipment pushed Hamas to prioritise efforts elsewhere. Hamas’s failure to mine the approaches could also have arisen from the limited time available, intensity of overhead observation, and local political impact on civilians prior to 7 October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While route proving did not demand significant engineering support, clearance and search operations placed a heavy demand on dismounted combat engineers. First, Hamas seeded IEDs throughout buildings in the Gaza Strip, and at the time of writing, these continue to inflict casualties. IEDs were also used to defend the entrances to tunnels and slow the IDF’s passage into Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure. Thus, dismounted combat engineers became an integral element of all combined arms operations. Alongside explosive ordnance and disposal (EOD) search and clearance, combat engineers were also critical to the breaching of buildings and rooms to enable the IDF to move unpredictably through the urban terrain. This reduced the exposure of manoeuvring infantry to traps and ambushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the technical combat engineering skills required are unsurprising; any observer with experience of coalition operations in the wider Middle East and Afghanistan would be familiar with most of the dynamics at play. However, the need to integrate combat engineers with ground combat formations at the sub-unit level re-emphasised the need for a significant number of appropriately trained personnel. This also raises questions about how to distribute engineers across different formations while maintaining the ability to centralise combat engineer operations where necessary, and to assimilate lessons learned, spread them across the force and conduct training – all essential to combining arms at scale for urban warfare. Furthermore, as will be covered in the next chapter, the subterranean nature of some of the fighting meant that difficult engineering tasks would have to be conducted under even more challenging conditions underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of the engineering challenge was that the use of novel sensors to locate subterranean infrastructure required close collaboration between technically sophisticated engineering units and intelligence practitioners. Here the IDF benefited from the experience of reservists with skillsets beyond the traditional military competencies. Capturing Hamas fighters or their caches and thus their documentation demanded the ability to move through terrain quickly. This required breaching and rapid EOD support. Conversely, when examination of captured materials or interrogation of captured fighters enabled the identification of tunnels, this often required engineering reconnaissance expertise to rapidly turn this information into an actionable plan on the ground. The level of engineer training at the sub-unit level therefore exceeded what would traditionally be covered by a pioneer, but instead necessitated sappers to be distributed across the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of the terrain also produced tactical challenges where engineering equipment had to be moved between echelons quickly. The repair of water pipes and facilities would normally sit at a relatively high echelon in dedicated engineering units, as a function brought in to stabilise an environment and tend to civilians after the completion of major clearance operations. In some instances, however, the IDF elected to flood Hamas tunnels using seawater and conduct other new engineering tasks during fighting. This required specialised expertise to be brought into the area of responsibility of combat arms units during combat, and thus brought engineers to an echelon with which they did not routinely train. Nevertheless, such techniques allowed some challenges to be bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At higher echelons, plans for engineering proved critical. Rainfall in Israel and Gaza can be intense, as it usually falls in concentrated periods. The impact of rainfall on the terrain was uneven, producing mobility challenges, as well as humanitarian problems relating to sanitation. This meant that as units rotated into and out of the Gaza Strip, viable movement corridors and the engineering support equipment necessary to restore mobility changed over time. Given the need to have the equipment available within a short timeframe, despite its large footprint, equipment needed to be accessible to units without being organic to them and thus a burden. This required intelligence and planning so that appropriate equipment could be pre-positioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-subterranean-operations&quot;&gt;IV. Subterranean Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure in Gaza makes it an almost unique operating environment. While not on a comparable scale, subterranean manoeuvre has been an element in fighting in Mariupol, Bakhmut, Mosul and other urban operations. This chapter is, therefore, probably the most case specific in its conclusions, but the lessons are still valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years prior to the 7 October attack, Hamas claims to have constructed more than 500 km of tunnel networks under Gaza. This required an immense volume of cement, concrete and iron, not to mention the removal of soil. The level of and exact split between Hamas coercion of and active collaboration by the civilian population remains unclear; the tunnels and their entrances run under residential buildings, schools, mosques and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To describe Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure merely as “tunnels” is a mischaracterisation. Some were intended as covert passageways between key points – such as beneath Wadi Gaza. Others were made with the intent to bypass Israeli defences. Still others housed barracks, caches, C2 centres, data storage and manufacturing facilities. There are roughly two levels of subterranean infrastructure – commanders’ tunnels and operatives’ tunnels. These are separated, with commanders’ tunnels running deeper and with a better quality of construction and more facilities, enabling them to be used for longer-term habitation and operations. The tunnels are not one single network. While some sections are linked, many are smaller sub-networks that are not integrated into an overall underground structure, with the segmentation of the network limiting the exploitation potential of any given tunnel. While at least one major data centre was captured, the majority of underground C2 nodes were very small, consisting of as little as internet-connected or ethernet-connected laptops. These could be found throughout the tunnel networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the current conflict, it was well known that Hamas conducted tunnelling and built underground infrastructure. However, even with a capable ISR apparatus, the IDF lacked the ability to accurately map the subterranean environment. While various units of the IDF had conducted training exercises focused on hypothetical operations in Gaza, Hamas had a far better understanding of the terrain than the IDF, and this was especially true of the subterranean environment. The tunnels were also central to Hamas’s concept of operations, allowing them to reinfiltrate areas on the surface that the IDF had cleared and granting them a safe haven from the fighting above ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the operation, the IDF conceived of surface and sub-surface operations as occurring sequentially: ground would be occupied and thereafter searched, with tunnels found and denied. As the operation developed, it became evident that this allowed Hamas to persist in conducting ambushes for a protracted period and to then transition to a layered defence of underground facilities. Nor could underground infrastructure be safely bypassed. Instead, therefore, the surface and sub-surface fighting needed to be carried out simultaneously, posing competing dilemmas for Hamas’s schemes of manoeuvre. Access to the tunnels required combat engineering, while entering and clearing them demanded highly specialised equipment and procedures, and thus personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF found that subterranean fighting was extremely stressful for its personnel and required many distinct techniques. The fact that every corner could lead to an extremely close confrontation with an enemy, or the discovery of an IED, created a staccato quality to the pressure on individuals that was corrosive of morale. This was exacerbated by the fact that while the risk of close confrontations can arise in urban operations, in tunnels there was no ability to attack from unexpected axes, or to move around a threat. Tunnels had to be cleared deliberately, and the enemy could fight a series of delaying or blunting actions throughout this process that could not be circumvented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the incursion, the IDF stressed identifying, controlling and sealing or denying the entrances of tunnels. In some cases, tunnels could be collapsed from the air, a factor that drove the use of heavy air-delivered ordnance early in the war. In most cases, however, this could not be done, for several reasons. While tunnel infrastructure could be assumed to be explicitly military in a way that above-ground infrastructure could not, offensive operations were slowed by the concerns for hostages who might be held there. Furthermore, collapsing underground tunnels could threaten the structural stability of civilian buildings above ground. Sensitive site exploitation was necessary both for obtaining further intelligence on Hamas and the missing hostages, and for documenting and attributing Hamas military activity directly below civilian infrastructure. These factors influenced a slower and more deliberate pace of subterranean operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable the widespread deliberate clearance of Hamas’s subterranean infrastructure, the IDF increasingly paired conventional and special operations units together. The special operations forces involved were predominantly a combination of troops from Shayaret-13 (Israel’s naval commandoes) and Yahalom (Israeli special forces engineers). These troops would be attached at brigade level. Clearing underground areas needed to be slow and deliberate, and there were limitations to how closely this could or should be tied to progress above ground, given the inability to provide effective mutual support or shared situational awareness except at tunnel entrances. However, by coordinating offensive operations above and below ground, dilemmas could be imposed on Hamas, constraining their movements and preventing them from using the tunnels as they wished. The specialist capabilities of special operations forces could be brought to bear in the subterranean environment, but this required a good working relationship with conventional forces that included the rapid sharing of intelligence and information, which did not always come naturally to the special operations forces and had to be actively fostered. While robots and military working dogs assisted in route proving in tunnels, much of the clearance operation continued to have to be carried out by humans, given the number of doors, steps and other obstacles confronted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge to simultaneous surface and subterranean manoeuvre was that the tunnels did not adhere to the boundaries of the units operating above ground. Because of the need to have relays behind an advancing force in the tunnel to maintain communications, the C2 of units underground had to be managed by the brigade to which the forces were attached. Nevertheless, they would often cross into another unit’s boundary. This could be deconflicted through notification, but it added a further consideration for units above ground of the effects they employed and which routes were used by heavier vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-fires&quot;&gt;V. Fires&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fires coordination during the operations in Gaza was complicated by being applied through several parallel processes. First, the IDF had a high-value target list that it began to prosecute at the onset of the conflict. This had been built using all-source intelligence fusion and included both persons and structures, including some subterranean targets. Stand-off targeting continued throughout the operation. Targets located by intelligence would be framed by reconnaissance, to cue precision strikes. “Framing” is an Israeli doctrinal term indicating that positive identification is established and then maintained until the target is struck. The processes for these targeted killings were largely unchanged from before the war; where they became significantly more complicated was how they interacted with the other forms of strike that arose during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside targeted killings, the IDF prosecuted signature-based strikes in response to targets identified through surveillance. Early in the conflict, a good example of this kind of strike was against rocket launchers. Subsequently, the identification of groups of militants by UAVs or other routine surveillance could lead to the generation of a strike. It is important to note that because the IDF could not choose the time and place of these interdiction strikes, they would often be carried out in areas where there had not been an intelligence soak to provide a detailed assessment of likely collateral damage. Just as dynamic strikes in Mosul led in some cases to large numbers of civilians being killed because their presence inside buildings could not be detected within the timeframe of the engagement, IDF dynamic strikes against large structures have led to intergenerational casualties within civilian families. There has been much speculation in the media about the extent to which the IDF was using AI to build the target packs for such strikes. A more accurate characterisation would be that the IDF targeting teams used software tools to assist in fusing large volumes of data to generate strikes. This has significantly increased the speed and scale at which target packs can be generated. Often the target generation process has outstripped the planning process to enable targets to be prosecuted. However, the decision to strike is still made by a human, and it is a human who is accountable for how the ecosystem of data processing tools is employed. The errors that have been made are therefore not because of the software – which provides decision-makers with all the information necessary to test its conclusions – but often because operators are not taking sufficient time to verify automated conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third kind of strike was one that emerged from ground forces calling for fires. In the IDF, fires – including air strikes – were allocated to brigades, with the brigade staff responsible for determining the synchronisation of these effects with their scheme of manoeuvre, or setting targets during the time when a strike is available in response to a threat. Although ground commanders can be connected to pilots to impart their intent, the technical coordination of air strikes is carried out at the brigade command post in the IDF. The IDF does not use Joint Terminal Attack Controllers to direct strikes. Despite this, the IDF managed to conduct strikes in extremely close proximity to manoeuvre elements – up to 200 m – with minimal fratricide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of these three types of strike, in any given piece of battlespace there were three targeting processes. Different elements of international humanitarian law (IHL) and the laws of armed conflict are relevant to each process. Interception or negative treatment operations – the intelligence-driven targeting of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad personnel – had the tightest controls around them. The IDF works to positively identify a target and then to continuously frame it until it is struck. Targets tended to work hard to avoid giving the IDF easy shots, exploiting protected sites to narrow the opportunities to attack them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF also had to deal with the problem of the revolving door. Known members of Hamas could be treated as combatants. During 7 October and Israel’s subsequent ground operations in Gaza, however, there were many Gazans who participated in military activities against the IDF. These ranged from picking up weapons and participating in fighting, to retrieving cached equipment, or “spotting”, to sustain Hamas fighters. While these individuals could be struck as participants in the conflict while they conducted these activities, targeting them once they had stopped this participation, unless they were confirmed to be members of Hamas, raises more complex legal questions. The distinction between someone incidentally participating in hostilities and someone routinely supporting Hamas can be difficult to make clearly in a way that is consistently applicable. For example, a military cook is a legitimate target in war. A civilian providing food to Hamas fighters could be a civilian providing a service and thus not a legitimate target. However, there is a boundary where this same individual becomes a participant, actively deviating from normal civilian behaviour to sustain an armed force. Where precisely the line is drawn is a matter of judgement, and under time pressure in a large-scale operation, the exact demarcation can become variable between who is making the decision and the context in which it is being made. It is important to note that this is not a challenge unique to Gaza. It has been confronted in almost every conflict to varying degrees and is becoming more complicated as the boundaries, for example, between civilian communication and spotting become harder to distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of dynamic strikes could fall either under the same rules of engagement as targeted strikes, or under the rubric of self-defence in the case, for example, of destroying the launch sites of Hamas rockets. Unlike targeted strikes where the IDF had some control over the timing and thus more time to evaluate whether there was military necessity and proportionality before striking, dynamic strikes had to be carried out quickly. While the same IHL obligations applied, the time in which to exercise judgement was shorter, with a greater likelihood of mistakes. For those cases where IDF troops were in contact and called for fires, the justification for the effect was self-defence, with proportionality judged against the expected harm to IDF personnel. The judgements of proportionality and military necessity often posed problems. For example, a high-value target might be close to civilian structures. However, to attack the structure with ground forces would require strikes to support the passage of those forces to the target and would affect a much greater area of civilian structures. An air strike might cause greater immediate collateral damage, but less secondary collateral damage. Mistakes could easily be made when the same target began to be assessed on multiple processes. A high-priority target that was positively identified, but where framing was lost, could be reacquired subsequently for a dynamic strike, without the same confidence of their identity being established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge for targeteers was to construct a system to address the IDF’s obligation to take measures to reduce civilian harm, before making a judgement on proportionality. Any system devised had to scale, given the number of troops operating in the city. The eventual approach was to divide the Gaza Strip into boxes. For each box, an assessment would be made, and routinely updated, as to the density of civilians prior to the conflict, their status and how many had been displaced. IDF personnel began to examine forthcoming operational plans and synchronise measures to move the population away from areas likely to see intense fighting. This was usually done through a mixture of leafleting, outreach to mobile telephones, and recommendations on timing and routes for movement. Estimating displacement allowed for the grading of each box as to the level of civilian presence and thus the appropriate rules of engagement in the area. Such a system clearly had significant drawbacks. First, not all civilians could move. Second, the civilians had a limited understanding of the boundaries between the boxes, so that someone who had left might later return. Third, the movement corridors became threat vectors that Hamas would try to exploit, while deconflicting strikes from these corridors at such a scale proved highly challenging. There were inevitably mistakes. There has been some reporting of this process as designating IDF “free fire zones” in Gaza. Instead, the IDF was endeavouring to provide troops with rules of engagement that were appropriate to the area within which they were operating, for commanders acting on variable levels of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the eventual structure, each brigade fielded an intelligence and strike cell consisting of officers from both specialisations working in tandem, along with support personnel. However, divisional headquarters oversaw much of the targeting and deconfliction. The process was refined until it followed the stages below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence-gathering and defining the location of the target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comparing the target with the evacuation map to determine whether the area was sufficiently clear of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking whether the target was close to any sensitive sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Checking whether any civilians could be seen or identified on target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Considering the issuing of warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choosing the correct munitions for the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Confirming the rules of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Decision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, when applied, this process produced a range of outcomes. Higher echelon decision-makers often lacked the sensors to have a high confidence assessment of civilian presence inside structures. Lower echelon decision-makers often perceived a greater direct threat to themselves or their personnel and had to decide within a compressed timeline. In some instances, where the incentives to strike between these echelons reinforced one another, errors were made. Where framing was not continuous – during dynamic strikes – assumptions could be made that led to tragic outcomes, as was the case with the strike on workers for the aid organisation World Central Kitchen in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where it did prove highly effective to hold organic capabilities at lower echelon was tactical strike UAVs. It was discovered that units that had these systems as well as ATGMs could monitor more urban terrain and conduct precision strikes at tempo in support of tactical actions. The IDF benefits considerably from its fielding non-line of sight ATGMs in its units. The small size of the munitions used meant that they could be used with an expectation of precision. In some cases, one screening company with these tools was able to hold the ground that would otherwise require a battalion to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the limitations of synchronisation and airspace deconfliction measures, it proved impossible to fully track or communicate UAV use. IDF ground combat units therefore found a high degree of air defence fratricide to be unavoidable, and shot down a large number of their own UAVs. Operations also highlighted that the technology and concepts of employment for UASs had outpaced the evolution of training, and IDF personnel had to learn on the job how to both tactically employ UAVs and defend against them. This was exacerbated by the disinvestment and retirement of many short-range air defence capabilities from the IDF arsenal and order of battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vi-information-operations&quot;&gt;VI. Information Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the IDF’s planning assumption that there would be a window during which international opinion would allow for the greatest freedom of action, the IDF has worked to try to extend the timeline. First, the IDF has slowly released information as investigations have progressed about events surrounding 7 October, to keep the atrocities committed and the justification for the war as part of the discourse. Packaging video from 7 October and showing it to journalists also extended the timeframe within which the context of 7 October framed reporting on subsequent developments. Footage has continued to be released, focusing on emotive topics such as the treatment of women. This has also been used to keep the story of Israel’s hostages at the forefront of the public discourse, since this is a justification for continuing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being forward leaning on much information release, however, information operations is an area where the IDF has underperformed during the conflict. First, there have been inconsistencies between Israel’s military and political messaging that have undermined the communication of many of the control measures put in place by the IDF. Second, the IDF has repeatedly inflated expectations of what will be found – for example, by briefing that there was a Hamas C2 centre beneath Al-Shifa hospital and releasing graphics suggesting a digitised C2 hub – and then failing to reveal something that met expectations. The IDF also undermined its own credibility by presenting a document showing the days of the week as a guard duty roster for hostages, owing to a shortage of Arabic speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these tactical errors, it is notable that Israel has not been proactive in controlling the narrative surrounding the conflict. A good example of this is the reporting of casualty figures. Civilian casualties are to be expected in high numbers during any urban operation. In Gaza, journalists had come to rely on reporting from the Gaza Health Ministry for casualty figures. The Gaza Health Ministry has a track record of producing reasonably accurate aggregate counts of casualties in previous rounds of fighting, but during the current war, the level of damage to health infrastructure has caused the ministry to have to change its methodologies from a central reporting system to a scrape of social media and reports from families, rendering aggregate numbers more questionable. The issue from an information operations point of view, however, is not the precision of the overall count. No one disputes that civilian casualties have been high. Because the Health Ministry does not distinguish between combatant and non-combatant casualties, its use by journalists drives a distorted discussion of the proportion of civilian and combatant casualties. Moreover, because the Health Ministry is controlled by Hamas, it can issue disinformation at critical moments. For example, the ministry was quoted by journalists as stating that 500 civilians had been killed at a hospital by an air strike, with much subsequent confusion, when in reality a Palestinian rocket had harmed a smaller number of civilians at the site. Israel has been quick to use the many inconsistences in Health Ministry data to try to undermine its credibility. These efforts have failed, however, because there is no alternative data source. The IDF has not endeavoured to release its own estimates, nor to proactively explain civilian casualties. Indeed, when the IDF releases assessments of combatant casualties, they tend to contrast these with the aggregate casualties reported by the Health Ministry, despite also arguing that this same source is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sustained issue has been the use of mobile phones and the internet by IDF personnel. This has caused problems, for example during prisoner detention. In some areas, the IDF detained a significant number of people. Given that Hamas fighters were wearing civilian clothes without distinguishing markers, and that there were civilians still in the areas being contested – some of whom participated in the fighting – distinguishing between combatants and non-combatants was challenging. This required individuals to be detained and processed. In view of the fact that Hamas has a long history of using IEDs to target Israeli soldiers, and noting the widespread practice by Islamic State of seeding suicide bombers into surrendering groups, the IDF took to requiring those being detained to strip. Several problems emerged. Detainees were not allowed to dress immediately after being verified as unarmed. They were also filmed while being processed. The fact that large numbers of troops have cameras on the modern battlefield, combined with a growing cultural tendency to film a wide variety of events, means that the filming of detainees has become quite common. Where reservists or recently mobilised civilians are in the battlespace, this is even more widespread. Indeed, poor discipline by some IDF personnel has done significant harm after being filmed and released publicly. Nevertheless, there are two lessons to be drawn. First, the uncontrolled use of mobile phones to film and release information can be highly damaging. Second, while UK and other NATO doctrine for dealing with captured persons exists, it is not clear that the procedures are well rehearsed when required at scale. The processes for managing an unanticipated large number of captured persons also bring with them significant disinformation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be noted that there are peculiarities to this conflict that make it an especially difficult context within which to conduct effective information operations. Globally, there is an animated audience in favour of both parties, and consequently, the actors directly involved have less agency in crafting perceptions. Instead, information is liable to be interpreted in the least favourable light by supporters of each side, and these individuals then amplify the worst interpretation available to their own communities. Within Israel, there is a prevailing sense that the battle is not worth contesting and that the vehemence of Western policymakers in directing Israel to pursue or refrain from particular courses of action is largely driven by the level of domestic political pressure they feel, rather than by any sustained conviction as to how the situation might be improved. This despondency does not help shape the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vii-humanitarian-support-operations&quot;&gt;VII. Humanitarian Support Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the conflict, Gaza’s habitability was already weak. Gaza urbanised rapidly during the 20th and early 21st centuries, and its population growth outstripped the resource-constrained municipality’s ability to provide essential services for residents. Urban planning has been poor, and the infrastructure supplying potable water and power has lacked either resilience or redundancy. This was exacerbated by Hamas’s use of construction materials for military purposes, which led the IDF to sustain the blockade of the Gaza Strip and limit access to dual-use materials. The IDF did have extensive surveillance and databasing of information regarding the civilian population, but given the lack of physical presence in the Gaza Strip in the years leading up to 2023, and the fact that these capabilities were security oriented and had not been intended or optimised for humanitarian work, these needed to be supplemented with dedicated humanitarian mechanisms that could operate multilaterally and integrate different NGOs, international agencies and Israeli government entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the size of the population and the disruption caused by the conflict, a large volume of supplies soon became necessary. This need was exacerbated by damage to Gaza’s infrastructure, with bottled drinking water needing to be brought in. Initially, flows into Gaza were disrupted by Israel’s desire to isolate it and the declaration of a total siege. At the political level, the siege became a point of discussion relating to leverage over the release of hostages, with Hamas threatening to execute hostages in response to strikes. This initial measure, taken in the aftermath of 7 October, was counterproductive and was quickly reversed under international pressure. However, once aid was allowed into Gaza in principle, ensuring a sufficient volume could enter Gaza remained challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once IDF forces began to operate inside Gaza, the main constraint on flows of humanitarian aid became the inspection of shipments to prevent Hamas rearming. The rate at which aid entered was around 70 trucks per day during the early phases of the operation, a number clearly inadequate to support the population. It then rose to 140 trucks per day early in 2024 and at the time of writing was between 300 and 400 trucks per day. These remain lower in number than aid flows prior to the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most contentious part of the inflow of trucks was who to trust to search for incoming military materiel destined for Hamas. Given that Hamas moved large quantities of weaponry into Gaza prior to the war, Israel is wary of those who have previously managed crossings and inspections. This mistrust arguably led to relatively poor coordination with organisations endeavouring to move materiel into Gaza. Aid agencies, for example, reported uncertainty as to what constituted dual-use items that would be prevented from moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways in which the process for getting aid into Gaza could be improved. Most of these are highly context specific, however. For the purposes of this paper, the area of friction in humanitarian operations that has the broadest relevance is the distribution of aid. This has been complicated by the close proximity of Hamas positions to civilian objects, which means that almost any part of Gaza is necessarily adjacent to sites from which attacks could emanate. Thus, separating areas of military operation from areas for humanitarian operations has proven complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, simply allowing humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza has also presented challenges. First, where the need has been greatest, desperation has driven violence around aid distribution centres, such that protection for humanitarian workers has been advisable. Even where more orderly processes emerged, this did not mean all was well. The theft of supplies by Hamas to sustain their own forces is clearly an issue of interest to the IDF. Separately, control over food is a vector for exerting control over the population. Since one of Israel’s goals in the war is to supplant Hamas’s control over the population, it goes directly against Israeli war aims to allow Hamas to exert control over aid distribution. Further complications have arisen in Israel with aid being attacked by Israeli citizens in protest. It is notable that the IDF has been less active in preventing this kind of disruption to supply. The point here is that while it might be desirable to leave humanitarian activity to humanitarians and thereby impose some separation between the IDF and the civilian population, in practice, the IDF has had to be heavily involved in the protection and distribution of aid in Gaza. Even where humanitarians were leading at the point of delivery, their movements had to be deconflicted from IDF manoeuvre and fires plans. Another complicating factor was the requirement for the IDF to use military engineering to restore some services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An enduring challenge for the IDF was that distribution of aid could be taken over by Hamas and used to maintain control over the local population, thereby preventing the implementation of one of Israel’s war aims. However, if the IDF took over distribution, the distribution point would also become a target for attack, to which the IDF would respond, risking the lives of civilians in the ensuing crossfire. There was also the risk that desperate people would end up in confrontations with soldiers who would use force in self-defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element of the humanitarian situation has been the impact on health infrastructure and its coordination. First, the IDF at several points during large troop movements cut access to the internet and phone network in Gaza to limit Hamas’s ability to report on its movements. This made military sense. It also collapsed the coordination of medical services during these periods. The IDF therefore came under significant international pressure to restore these services. The impact on health infrastructure of the fighting in Gaza has been devastating and will be long lasting. The IDF took care not to fire directly on functioning hospital buildings, which have protected status. However, as hospitals became isolated, they also ceased to function. Thereafter, Hamas occupied and operated from some hospital sites, such as Al-Shifa. At this point the hospital lost its protected status and ground operations in and around the area destroyed it. This is to some extent analogous to the international coalition bombing the hospital building in Mosul because it had ceased functioning as a medical facility and was being held by Islamic State fighters. While such actions may be legal, the long-term consequences of the destruction of a healthcare facility are severe. Moreover, alternative provision of medical care was not readily available, even as supplies of medicine necessary to keep the facilities running were disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to conclude that the IDF have made attempts to address the humanitarian issues, while continuing to pursue their military objectives. But none of the measures taken have been successful in preventing significant harm to the civilian population. Conditions in Gaza for civilians remain very poor as regards sanitation, the ability to move beyond areas of active fighting, and access to food and healthcare. The lesson here for militaries observing the conflict is cautionary. Many of the demands placed on the IDF by humanitarian organisations are incompatible with achieving the military tasks which they have been assigned. These conflicting imperatives remain messy and complex and have in the long run proven very damaging to the IDF politically. Learning from and improving methods for the provision of humanitarian assistance in urban warfare, where fighting will remain close to sensitive sites, is a challenge worthy of further consideration by the British Army and other militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the lessons identified by the IDF from the conflict in Gaza have direct relevance to other militaries. Nevertheless, there are observations that have specific salience for the British Army from the conflict that are not as significant for the IDF. It must also be acknowledged that there are particularities of the fighting in Gaza that are context specific. In parallel to their internal lessons learned process, the IDF has also had to establish an unlearning process to avoid tactical adaptations in Gaza being carried to the northern border with Lebanon, where some would be dangerous. One distinct characteristic of the fighting in Gaza is that Hamas – unlike Hezbollah – has no effective artillery. This has given the IDF rear-area security for their enablers and has also meant that units have been able to concentrate in a way that troops in other theatres, such as Ukraine, have found perilous. For the British Army, which must be ready to fight Russia to effectively contribute to NATO’s deterrence posture, capabilities must be aimed at maximising the ability to concentrate effects without concentrating forces. To this end, the levels of dispersion of Israeli mixed UAV and ATGM armed companies may be highly instructive as to the force density required to effectively screen urban terrain. But the levels of dispersion of Israeli infantry are less indicative of what would be viable in a conflict with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fundamental difference between IDF operations in Gaza and most other theatres – including Israel’s northern border with Lebanon – is the IDF’s total dominance in the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). On the northern border, where Hezbollah has been using one-way attack UAVs and other capabilities to strike Israeli positions, the need for electronic protection has produced such a cluttered EMS that the IDF has had to revert to printed maps, rather than depend entirely on digital map interfaces. For the British Army, given the extent of Russian electronic warfare, the battlespace management challenges that have emerged on Israel’s northern border are potentially more instructive than how centralised C2 has been conducted in Gaza. Unit boundaries and control measures remain relevant, but the blue force tracking possible in Gaza cannot be ensured in a highly contested EMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is the scale of the enemy force. Hamas predominantly operated in small groups of two to five personnel, with five or so groups often attacking within the same area. Hamas rarely concentrated above platoon strength. Although its 40,000 fighters make a sizeable force, the scale of its operations after 7 October was extremely limited. For the British Army, it is in some respects more useful to consider itself in Hamas’s position: defending urban areas with a coastline to the rear against a numerically superior enemy operating at divisional scale. It is the ability to effectively blunt Russian forces that is at the heart of the Land Operating Concept and thus the British Army’s contribution to NATO’s deterrence posture. Viewed from this perspective, some distinct lessons come into stark relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foremost observation of relevance to the British Army is the decisive role played by firepower in determining initiative during the fighting in Gaza. Ultimately, the superiority in responsiveness and organic lethality of IDF units made it costly for Hamas to mount attacks, and the larger the force it endeavoured to bring to bear, the higher the cost of any given action. Furthermore, while indirect fire prevented Hamas from concentrating its forces, the limited organic lethality of its teams meant that once they engaged IDF troops, they were quicky suppressed and thereafter destroyed. In many wargames, the British Army currently avoids confronting its diminishing tactical lethality by drawing on fires or capabilities held at the highest echelon represented in the scenario. In a war, however, these echelons would have other lines of effort to support, and these fires cannot be allocated to multiple targets. The lesson is clear. Firepower at the tactical level matters a great deal. The risk for the British Army is that the Land Operating Concept’s conclusions are not funded, so that while British troops may be trained to fight like the IDF, they find themselves equipped to die like Hamas. Increasing the British Army’s organic lethality at echelon should therefore be a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second important lesson for the British Army is the criticality of air defence to maintaining a position in an urban space. Hamas’s lack of ability to threaten Israeli aircraft and ISR meant that it was unable to concentrate and lacked freedom of manoeuvre. Once its defensive strong points were identified, they could be reduced. The weight of munitions deliverable from the air outweighs anything deliverable from artillery systems, such that many of the defensive advantages of urban terrain can be bypassed if it is possible to conduct precision bombing from medium altitude. The ability to operate from an urban environment, therefore, requires air defences, whether ground based or delivered through offensive and defensive counter-air patrols. In a major conflict, the density of enemy air defences means that the availability of counter air patrols may be extremely constrained. Thus, it seems clear that for the British Army to fight competitively on the ground, it must be able to hold enemy fast air at risk when flying at medium altitude. This lesson also reflects experiences in Mosul, Raqqa and throughout Ukraine. In Mosul, the ability of coalition fast air to enable Iraqi units to level defended positions fixed Islamic State to defend where they could not be detected. In Ukraine, whenever the Russian air force has established access at medium altitude near an urban settlement, it has rapidly destroyed it, enabling subsequent capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third lesson is that the relationship between offence and defence in the urban environment is micro-tactical. If the enemy can get around a flank, dislodging it requires attack into urban spaces, accompanied by its associated complications. For this reason, slowing the pace of enemy manoeuvre through urban terrain is critical to enable repositioning and preventing the defence from becoming unhinged. The most effective tool for this purpose is counter-mobility support. This is critically lacking in the British Army and is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freedom a force gains from air defence and counter-ISTAR allows it to manoeuvre in the urban environment, and manoeuvre is critical to urban operations. The force density required to hold a specific piece of urban terrain means that most armies will need to choose which parts of a city they contest at any given time. Furthermore, not all urban terrain is equal. The significance of Wadi Gaza and other movement corridors that, once controlled, limited Hamas’s ability to resupply or redeploy was disproportionate. Control of the rural–urban interface is necessary to sustain a force within an urban stronghold. Sensitive sites such as hospitals also have a significant shaping effect on the tempo and scope of urban manoeuvre. A city should not be examined as a homogeneous environment. It is critical that terrain assessments identify seams and vulnerabilities in a defence that can be exploited to move without having to directly confront prepared enemies in defensive positions. Careful planning can turn an urban space against the defender. To enable manoeuvre in ways that are not canalised by urban planning, there is a need for a high density of engineers. This spans mobility support, breaching, explosive ordnance search and clearance, and engineering reconnaissance. It must also be supported by a critical mass of relevant engineering platforms. The notion that a force can do without these enablers is a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army must consider how it conducts battlespace management in urban environments. Deconfliction of boundaries in urban spaces requires different tactics, techniques and procedures to fire control outside the urban environment, because an enemy will often be placed between friendly units, and reduced ranges mean that fire may carry through into friendly units. There is therefore an increased likelihood of friendly fire and combat accidents. Training that disproportionately focuses on small arms rather than heavy weapons can exacerbate this problem. If troops do not have an intuitive appreciation for how backblast, for example, is redirected in urban spaces, they will suffer combat accidents. Procedures for blue force tracking must account for the transition from mounted to dismounted patrols and must be pushed across unit boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of fire in urban terrain results in different echelons having overlapping responsibilities, because the distances between echelons is compressed. High-payoff targets are therefore hunted in the same battlespace that tactical ISR and strike assets endeavour to find and strike dynamic targets. This leads to different rules of engagement – divided by target – in the same area of responsibility. Given the scaling of targeting that takes place in a major conflict, there is a significant risk that errors will be introduced if targets shift between targeting processes. The ability to explain how the force applies fire is important to ensure compliance with IHL, but also to set expectation among civilians in the environment about risk, and to shape the information environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more lessons to be learned from the Gaza conflict, but at this juncture, it is necessary to allow more time to elapse for the relevant details to be releasable and therefore available for analysis. This paper is, therefore, a starting point for the analysis, rather than a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oNLM1Aq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（10日）踏入第50日審訊。早前的審訊透露有被告參與西貢行山試槍及炸彈。被告李家田供稱，獲黃振強要求陪他到西貢行山時，雖然感到奇怪，但為免得罪黃而失去資助，故答應對方。李表示行山中途各人停下，他被吩咐站遠點，期間沒有聽到槍聲或爆炸聲。李否認辯方所指，當日應黃要求視察吳智鴻等人是否真的試槍。另外，李表示小隊成員沒有同意過示威期間用槍對付警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱錄影會面期間驚慌-擔心說話唔啱聽未能滿足警察&quot;&gt;李家田稱錄影會面期間驚慌 擔心說話「唔啱聽」未能滿足警察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第三日作供，李指出錄影會面中的答案，部分屬事實，部分屬警方要求，部分屬他自行虛構。李表示，被捕時遭警方武力對待後，在錄影會面期間心情驚慌，擔心說話「唔啱聽」、「滿足唔到警察」，或令母親承受與他一樣的武力對待。他同時希望順從警方要求，令對方遵守承諾批准保釋。李亦指，他沒有使用警方在其家中檢取的綠色斜孭袋，用作盛載手槍，因自己根本無保管過手槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，在案件第二次提堂時，他有向法庭投訴遭警員武力對待，警方亦有跟進事件。但其後警方卻發信指由於法庭正處理其案件，因此投訴調查需暫停。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱對黃振強邀請行山感奇怪-為免得罪對方失資助故答應&quot;&gt;李稱對黃振強邀請行山感奇怪 為免得罪對方失資助故答應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後到辯方進行盤問。代表張俊富的大律師李國輔問，是否同意群組後期改名為「逃龍小隊」，李家田表示有聽過，但不知道是否因小隊經常被速龍追趕。另外，李同意當成員在「滅龍」群組討論槍械訓練時，張並沒有參與討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張銘裕的大律師姚本成問及，李是否在荃灣示威行動中認識張銘裕，俗稱「不打不相識」；李同意。李確認在2019年11月16日去西貢行山之前，雙方並沒有單獨聯絡，直至行山當晚張致電李。張於11月18日再向李發訊息指：「搵間房入去鎖門瞓覺」，李表示以其理解，張以為李仍在理大。當日至12月8日，兩人再沒有單獨聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方亦問及李與其他涉案者的關係。李表示獲黃振強要求陪他到西貢行山，但最後由張銘裕代替。李表示，黃沒有解釋行夜山的原因，對於他邀請自己去行山雖感奇怪，但為免得罪黃而失去資助，故答應對方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱沒有聽到槍聲或爆炸聲-否認應黃要求視察&quot;&gt;李稱沒有聽到槍聲或爆炸聲 否認應黃要求視察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李同意行山時，沒有人向他介紹同行的吳智鴻、彭軍壕、賴振邦及許湛榮，因此不認識上述4人。李不同意辯方指，吳表示不需要張提供的柴油，張遂倒掉。李表示中途各人停下，張吩咐他「行開啲」，但並非「睇水」。李於是走開，並繼續行5分鐘，但沒有聽到5下槍聲。張其後第二次叫停李，再次著他「行開啲」，期間沒有聽到爆炸聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，實際上黃振強吩咐李去視察吳等人是否真的試槍及炸彈；李不同意。李亦表示，黃沒有吩咐他取手槍。事後李沒有主動匯報行山情況，黃亦沒有過問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方問及李與黃振強的關係，他同意8月5日在荃灣認識黃。李表示9月底至10月開始向黃索取資助，由10月至11月對方共提供約5千元。李得知黃有金主，因此沒有問資金來源。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱成員沒有承認黃為隊長-亦無同意用槍對付警察&quot;&gt;李稱成員沒有承認黃為隊長 亦無同意用槍對付警察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，從來沒有人稱呼或承認黃是隊長，他亦沒有獲「屠龍」成員授權作為代表，去面對傳媒、進行眾籌，以及與吳智鴻那夥人交涉。在行山之前，黃沒有提及認識有人可提供槍或炸彈對付警察。李又指，不知道黃所說的「新Plan」與舊有的「眼鏡Plan」是甚麼，他並沒有交代過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對話顯示黃於12月6日曾私下向吳索取手槍，表示想自行使用。李表示不知情，又指小隊成員沒有同意過示威期間用槍對付警察。李續指，無聽過黃說行動後要「走佬」，亦無聽過他說事成後可獲一百萬，黃也沒有吩咐隊員收拾東西。對話顯示，行動前仍有人問「其實我哋會做邊個Plan？」，李同意隊員之間沒有共識。李最後同意，不知道12月8日的行動內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（11日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今日（10日）處理第四批共9名被告求情，包括參選九西的毛孟靜、岑子杰、何啟明、馮達浚、黃碧雲、劉澤鋒；參選超區的岑敖暉、王百羽；及參選衞生服務界的余慧明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;清晨5時半，西九龍裁判法院外已有40人排起長龍，自備雨傘、折凳等輪候入場旁聽。排在隊伍前列的，包括曾參與超區初選，被裁定罪脫、律政司亦無提上訴的李予信。戴鴨舌帽、穿白色上衣和短褲的李，排在隊伍約第5位。他表示因為知道有排隊黨，今凌晨約1時攜露營椅和乾糧到場。李說有密切留意早前的求情聆訊，至於今天為何到場，他表示：「唔講太多點解，淨係想過嚟，想喺度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明友人讚默默支持弱勢社群&quot;&gt;何啟明友人讚「默默支持弱勢社群」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明的教會朋友李先生，今晨約5時到場，他認識何逾20年，形容他在深水埗區多年是「好好嘅議員」，很多事情親力親為，甚至會親自執老鼠。李先生又指，何辭任區議員後仍然服務社區，形容他「唔係一個身分先做嘢，係本身人品都會一直默默去支持弱勢社群」，也與基督信仰的精神「貫徹如一」。李說望親身入庭，對被囚禁的人表達支持。對於刑期長短，他坦言不到他考慮，「有啲嘢你都控制唔到，諗嚟都無謂，諗啲可以控制到嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告友讚好有原則&quot;&gt;被告友讚「好有原則」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一名被告的朋友阿修今晨約8時到場，表示「想見一個朋友」。他指認識該被告7年，形容他「好有原則」、有時甚至「好惡」，會很執意解決朋友矛盾，笑言他「好難相處」、「通常啲矛盾都喺佢度嚟」，但也有他的優點：「佢會好講件事公唔公平。」阿修又讚這位朋友「好識煮嘢食」，最深刻是他曾煮過清酒煮花甲，二人又會一起打牌，新年時看《喱咕喱咕新年財》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阿修說，與該被告現已沒什麼聯繫，但從其他朋友口中，聽到他為人比以前平靜，推斷以他的性格「已準備好面對佢要面對嘅嘢」，希望「有機會一齊食嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民希望佢哋知道仲有好多人記住&quot;&gt;市民：希望佢哋知道仲有好多人記住&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;莫小姐於早上約8時到達，表示希望支持被告，特別記掛岑敖暉、毛孟靜、余慧明等人，指在2019年運動時看到岑「瘦咗好多」，想看看他現在的情況。莫在初選47人案首度提堂、裁決日、求情聆訊等也有來旁聽，「希望佢哋知道仲有好多人出面記住佢哋。」自認「姜糖」的莫小姐帶同印有姜濤頭像的扇到場，被問到有哪首歌鼓勵她，她笑說「冇諗過」，想了想後選擇了《濤》：「雖然19年運動唔成功，但都激起個浪濤，起碼全世界都知道香港發生咩事。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 莫小姐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初次來旁聽的阿T（化名）則表示，47人只是在「行使公民權利」，認為否決財政預算案是《基本法》賦予的權利，讓議員能監察政府運作，如今的指控為「莫須有」。他認為過往立法會內存在太多利益輸送，導致許多工程以嚴重超支、大白象收場，當初47人提出的方法能改變議會。阿T不滿稱現在的財委會「好垃圾」，「幾分鐘就批八十幾億啊、一百億咁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（10日）處理第四批共9名被告求情，包括參選九西的岑子杰、毛孟靜、何啟明、馮達浚、黃碧雲、劉澤鋒；參選超區的岑敖暉、王百羽；及參選衞生服務界的余慧明。毛孟靜一方望以監禁5至6年為量刑起點。辯方指，毛孟靜對否決預算案有保留、私下反對「攬炒」，亦非組織者，她明白對公眾造成的潛在危害，望真誠道歉，並可與丈夫度過餘下時光。毛亦獲前立法會議員石禮謙、融樂會等撰求情信，提到她政見不同仍願交流，及為少數族裔貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明一方則望判監3年或以下。何獲前民協主席馮檢基等撰求情信，指他熱心服務弱勢社群。辯方指何出於良好動機、具高尚目的而犯案，他望令香港變得更好，只是採用了非法手段；而他被捕後持續服務社區，包括跟進保育深水埗主教山配水庫，本案後打算遠離政治，專注教會事奉。辯方又提及，何本質上是一名好人，法官陳仲衡即指，不認為本案有任何被告本質上是一個壞人，多名被告發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告分兩排就坐-毛孟靜做心心飛吻&quot;&gt;被告分兩排就坐 毛孟靜做心心、飛吻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。岑子杰由大律師郭憬憲代表，毛孟靜和岑敖暉由大律師黃雅斌代表，何啟明由大律師阮偉明代表，馮達浚由資深大律師祁志代表，黃碧雲由大律師沈士文代表，劉澤鋒由大律師黃錦娟代表，余慧明由大律師石書銘代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，男女被告分成上下兩排，由6名懲教隔開就坐。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的何啟明，戴眼鏡、穿深灰色短袖上衣，看到旁聽席後不住雀躍微笑揮手。黃碧雲則穿有橙色圖案的深藍色上衣，微笑揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其餘被告均還柙逾3年，毛孟靜紮髻，穿黑色連衣裙、卡其色針織長外套，站起向旁聽席張望，又雙手放頭做心形手勢和飛吻。紮起馬尾的余慧明同樣穿黑色上衣、卡其色外套，向親友揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑敖暉穿米白色上衣，外穿深啡長袖裇衫、牛仔褲；王百羽穿開胸白色長袖裇衫、露出內裡的黑色內衣，大幅度揮手；戴白色口罩的岑子杰，穿黑色Polo上衣，身形較健碩；馮達浚穿深藍色摺至中袖的裇衫、繫藍白斜間領帶，微笑望向旁聽席；劉澤鋒穿白色裇衫、戴淺藍色口罩。何啟明、岑子杰、王百羽等人，也與旁聽席做手勢和口型溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪脫的李予信、毛孟靜的丈夫、前立法會議員邵家臻、前沙田區議員李志宏、前民陣召集人陳皓桓、社民連陳寶瑩等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱毛孟靜質疑否決財案倡以5至6年為起點&quot;&gt;辯方稱毛孟靜質疑否決財案、倡以5至6年為起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;毛孟靜一方先進行求情。代表毛孟靜的大律師黃雅斌同意，毛在初選勝出後報名參與立法會選舉，接受她有一定程度的參與，建議以5至6年為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃強調，毛從不曾向人施壓、或譴責不跟隨涉案謀劃的人，亦曾質疑否決預算案的需要；毛現時已反省，明白對公眾可能造成的潛在危害，她真誠道歉和有悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;石禮謙融樂會等撰求情信-毛望與丈夫度過餘下時光&quot;&gt;石禮謙、融樂會等撰求情信 毛望與丈夫度過餘下時光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂呈上多封求情信，包括其大學同事、街坊、學生等，讚揚她真誠關心弱勢社群。其中前立法會議員石禮謙表示，即使政治立場與毛孟靜不同，但毛總是願意交流意見，以制訂政策，對香港整體有利。服務少數族裔的非牟利機構融樂會，則指毛利用立法會的機制和資源更好地保障少數族裔，又設立首個針對少數族裔議題的委員會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;毛的政治助理則指，在初選前後均重複聽到毛表示反對否決預算案，認為只是政治姿態、他們亦不夠票，若否決預算案，便無法建學校和醫院。辯方強調，毛孟靜視立法會為能為社區做正面的事的地方，她對參與本案串謀感到後悔，並於今年1月撰信對其參與真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃指，毛孟靜現年67歲，她在任職立法會議員前，曾長年從事傳媒行業，其後從事教育。其丈夫亦撰信，辯方指其丈夫有一些個人情況，但不便公開，並指毛非常希望能與丈夫度過餘下的時光。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;去年有報導指，毛孟靜的英籍丈夫、八旬資深傳媒人 Philip Bowring 因肺炎入住醫院深切治療部近3周，他其後出院。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官關注曾獲諮詢意見-辯方指毛非組織者&quot;&gt;官關注曾獲諮詢意見 辯方指毛非組織者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡主動引毛的求情信，提及明白到自己透過只是私下反對「攬炒」和相關政治行動，成為了串謀的共犯，她要承擔後果。陳問毛是否即指，她因沒有公開反對「攬炒」而成為共謀者？黃否認，指承認毛有參與串謀，但有人可以意圖參與串謀的同時，也對計劃有所保留，強調其悔意屬真誠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又強調，根據求情信、毛過往的經歷、對立法過程的真誠關注，她有可能不會真的否決預算案。法官陳慶偉和李運騰關注，戴耀廷曾就初選的合法性諮詢毛的意見，法官陳仲衡亦認為，因此不能視她對法律無知，黃則回應，毛從來不是涉案謀劃的組織者或推動者。法官陳慶偉亦提到，毛曾提到尋求國際線協助，黃回應這與本案控罪無關；又重申毛公開所說和私下的意見有所不同，現時已有真誠悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指何啟明是好人-官同意本案被告非壞人&quot;&gt;辯方指何啟明是好人 官同意本案被告非壞人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由何啟明一方陳詞。代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明先表示，望說服法庭，何啟明本質上是一個好人（by nature a good man）。法官陳仲衡即指，不認為本案有任何被告本質上是一個壞人。岑敖暉、何啟明、黃碧雲、馮達浚等聞言發笑，岑子杰亦用力點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明續呈上9封求情信，來自何的父母、兄弟、女友、校長、神學院教授、朋友及前民協主席馮檢基。阮表示，何自小已有愛心、關愛他人，是個照顧弟弟的哥哥，他出身草根、在基督教學校受教育，成為一名虔誠的基督徒，並以其基督精神，積極幫助貧窮和有需要人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮續指，何大學畢業後於2015年加入民協，因民協的願景與他一致，即為弱勢社群爭取利益和服務社區。阮又呈上何的 Facebook 專頁截圖，指何在2020年立法會選舉延期、2021年因本案被捕後，仍繼續爭取保育深水埗主教山配水庫，直至該配水庫獲評為一級歷史建築，強調他持續服務社區，並非為競選而做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指何被捕後仍服務社區獲馮檢基撰求情信&quot;&gt;辯方指何被捕後仍服務社區、獲馮檢基撰求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明又引用馮檢基的求情信，指馮是資深政治人物，作為2021年立法會選舉的候選人，是獲確認參選資格的「愛國者」，望法庭能考慮。馮信中提及，在何啟明2013年為民協工作時認識他，對何服務弱勢社群的熱情和投入印象深刻，指他的熱情不僅在於他所屬的社區，而是令整個香港成為更好的地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wC5tlae.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
▲ 馮檢基（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮續指，何啟明在本案後打算遠離政治，並專注教會事奉，故過去數年開始在神學院修讀基督教研究碩士課程，並獲認識何近20年、與他關係親密如母子的牧師寫求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮表示，本案屬非常嚴重的罪行，望法庭接納何啟明是一個好人，他犯案後有良好動機、高尚目的（honorable goal），只是採用了非法手段。阮又指，何希望成為立法會議員，令香港成為更好的地方，更好地服務社會。何已對其行為深切反省，不大可能重犯，指他不應承受長期監禁，認為3年或以下的刑期已足夠反映其罪責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，兩名超區參選人今（10日）午求情。庭上讀出岑敖暉親撰的求情信，他表示經過反思後，發現自己過去被憤怒充滿、參與政治並非完全出於良好和有建設性的意圖，對此深感後悔；他亦承認否決預算案會影響政府運作，從而危害國安，對違背公眾期望感到深深後悔和抱歉。岑又提到，與妻子分隔逾3年，但愛意無隨時間流逝而減退，反而日益深厚和強烈，「我現時內心每一刻最大的願望，就是回到我們一起建立的家，與她共度所有時光，這是我這個魯莽和愚蠢的人，對她無條件的愛和支持所能做的回報。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉求情信昔日言行被憤怒推動非全出於良好意圖&quot;&gt;岑敖暉求情信：昔日言行被憤怒推動、非全出於良好意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選超區初選的岑敖暉和王百羽先後求情。代表岑敖暉的大律師黃雅斌指，無意減輕岑的參與程度，並呈上街坊等求情信，指岑並非只喊口號、而是願意親力親幫助居民，而他現時已改過自新。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續讀出岑的求情信（英文全文見文末），岑提到他自還柙起，自願進行單獨囚禁，並視之為機會以投放時間反思及閱讀。岑自言被捕前，曾任社運人士多年，望能建立更公平、平等和自由的社會和政治體制，但經過仔細反思，他發現他政治參與背後的一些原因，「並非像他們看起來那樣光采」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑形容，他過去是被憤怒所充滿的人，更壞的是，憤怒有時演變成仇恨或怨恨，驅使他作出某些政治行為、修辭和言論。過去數年，他閱讀哲學、歷史、文學、靈性等著作，最重要是有他妻子的愛，他慢慢意識到憤怒，更莫說仇恨或怨恨，絕對不能將世界或他自己帶去任何地方——至少不能帶去任何美好、有建設性或充滿愛的地方。經過深切反省，他譴責（denounce）自己案發時的行為，包括參與涉案謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CsEdRJV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑續指，他明白以否決預算案作為政治手段，不僅嚴重破壞、干擾和阻撓人們的生活，以及政府機關履行職能，亦會危害國家安全，亦離他當初的政治願景更遠。因此他譴責自己過去的言行，不僅在於違法，更重要是它們並非出於完全良好和有建設性的意圖，他對此深切後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑與妻分隔3年-內心每刻願望回家共度時光&quot;&gt;岑：與妻分隔3年 內心每刻願望回家共度時光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑表示，望向公眾造成的傷害深切道歉，包括其言行所造成的社會分裂和政治風險。他指，案發時作為頗具影響力的政治人物以及區議員，公眾寄望他會服務大眾，但其行為與該目的背道而馳。自還柙後，他無法再服務公眾，對那些寄望他為負責任公眾人物的人，「我令他們失望，為此我深深懊悔、後悔和抱歉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑最後指，與可愛的妻子分隔逾3年，「我的愛沒有隨時間流逝而減退，反而日益深厚和強烈」。岑形容，妻子是他反省生活和改過的動力，「我現時內心每一刻最大的願望，就是回到我們一起建立的家，與她共度所有時光，這是我這個魯莽和愚蠢的人，所能對她無條件的愛和支持的回報，雖然我這些年帶給她的憂傷、痛苦和寂寞是永遠無法彌補」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑表示，明白他犯下嚴重罪行，長期監禁是無可避免，「我願意接受我過錯所帶來的所有後果」，只望刑期不會剝奪他改過和向家人彌補過錯的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上讀出的岑敖暉求情信&quot;&gt;庭上讀出的岑敖暉求情信：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing to express myself for the mitigation of HCCC70/2022 which I’ve pleaded guilty. Upon voluntary, I have been placed under solitary confinement since I was taken into jail custody, taking this as an opportunity to invest my time mainly on reflecting on myself and reading various aspects of materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to my arrest, I had been a political activist for years, with self-perceived goals of creating a more just, egalitarian and liberal society and political institution. Upon painstaking reflections however, I figured out some underlying causes of my political participation were not as bright as they may appear to be. I was a person filled with anger, worse still, anger sometimes evolved into hatred or resentments, which occasionally fuels or drives my political acts, rhetorics, and utterances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past years, I became gradually aware of these aims with various philosophical, historical, literary and some spiritual readings and most importantly, with the love of my wife, I gradually realised that anger, not to mention hatred or resentment, could lead the world and myself to absolutely nowhere, at least nowhere bright, shining, constructive or loving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon deep reflection, I denounce the action undertaking at the material time, including but not limited to my participation to the scheme. I understand that had the budget been vetoed, the so called political means, not only the people’s livelihood and performances of the duties and functions discharged by the HKSAR government would be seriously interfered in, destructed, undermined, and hence endangering national security, also place nowhere near, if not further away from the aforementioned political vision. As such, I denounced the actions and utterances I had done, not merely because it breaches the law, but equally importantly, it was not made out of purely good and constructive intentions, I am deeply regretful and remorseful of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to apologise for the harm to public, especially for the great social political risk and ruptures created, I acknowledge my actions and utterances contribute to that and I deeply apologise. Moreover, having been quite an influential figure and district councillor at the time being, the public has placed hope upon me to serve the public. Not only did my action contradict with that purpose, since I was remanded in jail, I have not been able to continue to serve the public. To those who looked up to me as responsible public figure, I have let them down, and for that I am deeply remorseful, regretful and deeply apologetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been separated from my lovely wife for more than 3 years, my love did not fade gradually with the passage of time, but became deeper and stronger bit by bit daily. She has been my motivation of reflection, living and reform. The greatest wish at every single moment in my mind now, is to return to the home my wife and I build together, and to spend all my time with her. This is all this reckless and foolish man can return for her for her unconditional love and support, although the sorrow, pain and loneliness I brought to her for these years could never be compensated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that I committed a serious crime. I understand that an imprisonment with substantial length is inevitable, and I am willing to accept all the consequences brought about by my wrongful act. I just humbly pray the sentence would not deprive me of the opportunity to perform penance for my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，兩名超區參選人今（10日）午求情。辯方指，王百羽並非謀劃組織者，屬「積極參加者」，他還柙逾3年，體重減了20公斤，又患高血壓需服藥控制，望獲釋後繼續以專業服務社會。庭上讀出王百羽所撰的求情信，他感激家人不離不棄，形容他們是「天下間最好的父母」、「家人是我最珍視的寶物」，「我非常渴望能早日回家、擁抱家人，好好地盡孝道，孝順父母。」辯方讀出求情信和談及其家人時，王百羽雙眼通紅，數度以手和紙巾拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方王百羽屬積極參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：王百羽屬「積極參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表王百羽的大律師黃俊嘉表示，王屬「積極參加者」，其罪責屬於高級別，但並非謀劃的組織或協調者，只是一名參與者。辯方指，王已深切反省，知道其行為屬不恰當，如再有機會，他並不會這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，王來自勞動階層，於香港出生、長大，是家中第一名入讀大學的成員，其父母對他非常自豪，其母親今亦有到庭，給予兒子無條件支持。辯方指，王有貢獻社會的抱負，他畢業於科大計算機科學及工程學系，從事資訊科技工作，尹認為香港需要更多社區服務，故參與義工服務弱勢，並當選特首選委委員、港區全國人大代表選舉團成員，至2019年當選元朗區議員，會議出席率100%，為該區居民帶來改變，反映他的公共服務獲得認可。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，王兼顧繁重工作和社區服務，令他有巨大的精神和生理壓力，患有高血壓，至今仍需服藥控制；王亦對因本案而無法服務居民感到深深抱歉。王百羽聞言時點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;王百羽稱望及早回家盡孝-庭上落淚&quot;&gt;王百羽稱望及早回家盡孝 庭上落淚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續讀出王百羽的求情信節錄，提及對家人的愛和感激。王表示：「家人是我最珍視的寶物⋯⋯我非常渴望能早日回家、擁抱家人，好好地盡孝道，孝順父母⋯⋯他們是天下間最好的父母，直到今天我的家人對我都仍不離不棄，我十分感激。疫情期間未能親自照料家人，只能獨自擔心卻無能為力，令我有很大的反思。看到他們能夠活得健康精神，是我現在最開心的事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃俊嘉朗讀求情信時，王百羽眼眶通紅，不禁落淚，他一度用手揉眼睛，又拿出紙巾數度拭眼和鼻。黃續指，王百羽其中一名祖父母年近九旬，王望能好好照顧家人，王早前置業，但因本案未能負擔供樓開支，需由家人承擔，黃望為他所犯的過錯道歉，並向家人表達感謝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;還柙期間減20公斤&quot;&gt;還柙期間減20公斤&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，王已是一名改過的人，他還柙逾3年，減輕了20公斤，獲得珍貴的機會反省自我，並制訂將來的計劃。他沒有放棄原本的專業，一直留意最新的科技發展，望獲釋後繼續以其專業，以恰當和合法的方式服務社會，重犯機會輕微。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，辯方提及王真誠誤信謀劃為合法，但看畢3頁求情信，似乎看不到他有這樣說。法官李運騰亦指，辯方可提供王百羽在初選期間說過的話，以顯示他當時相信是合法。黃俊嘉稱會索取指示，遂押後至明天繼續求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，毛孟靜再向旁聽席以手臂做出心心手勢，何啟明則向律師表示：「唔該晒！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oO2fkId.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今處理參選九西初選的6名被告求情。代表馮達浚的資深大律師祁志表示，本案被告是法官「永遠不會在被告欄見到的人」，他們有學識、表達和思考能力高，並告訴法庭他們是出於良好動機而犯案。祁志形容，案發時24歲的馮達浚是年輕、熱心和幼稚的理想主義者，他畢業自拔萃男書院，望服務社區，而他成長於有多元辯論和選舉文化的香港，當時提出反對不僅合法，也是人們生活的基石，通識教育亦鼓勵人發問和思考，惟在《國安法》後，這樣的情況結束，爭取權力監察政權，一夜之間變成了顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，馮案發時真誠相信謀劃合法，政府亦於《國安法》後逾半年才將他們拘捕，認為謀劃無對國安造成危害，望法庭按其參與程度判處較輕的刑期。辯方又引述馮所撰求情信，指自己還柙3年已反省和改變，他現時已不在意特首會否下台，並向他曾無禮對待的泛民致歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告為民主社會領袖-望以和平手段服務社會&quot;&gt;辯方：被告為民主社會領袖 望以和平手段服務社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;毛孟靜和何啟明一方完成求情後，由馮達浚一方求情。代表馮達浚的資深大律師祁志表示，在法官席前的案件獨特，是這個司法管轄區從未聽過的，本案被告是各法官「永遠不會在被告欄見到的人」，他們被指以非法手段尋求改變，望透過選票進入議會，並告訴法庭他們是出於良好動機犯案，是其他案件所沒有的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續舉例，搶劫犯運用暴力手段偷竊，販毒者從他人痛苦賺取利益，危駕者為他人帶來巨大傷害；但法庭從逾百日的審訊和聆訊，會得知本案被告均是民主社會、或「相對民主社會」的領袖，他們真誠相信多元主義（pluralism），望以和平手段服務社會，是有學識、表達和思考能力高的人，馮達浚亦是其中之一，因此法庭的量刑並不容易。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方馮達浚為理想主義者望服務社區&quot;&gt;辯方：馮達浚為理想主義者、望服務社區&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志提到，馮達浚與他另外代表的袁嘉蔚一樣，是本案最年輕的被告之一，當中袁比馮年長，此時岑子杰和王百羽在唇邊舉起手指做出「shh」的手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志指，馮達浚案發時是一名24歲的理想主義者，他是一個「DBS boy」，畢業自拔萃男書院和浸會大學，從無隸屬任何政治組織。馮2014年受到雨傘運動觸動，其後開始服務九龍城社區，並於2019年參選區議員但失敗；惟他繼續懷有理想，為社區工作付出所有，他口中的「本土派」，是指對九龍城和九西社區工作的「本土」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方馮熱心幼稚真誠信謀劃合法&quot;&gt;辯方：馮熱心幼稚、真誠信謀劃合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志指，馮達浚不是街頭抗爭者、也不暴力，只是一個熱心和幼稚的年輕人，望服務社區，盡力令他的聲音被聽見，真誠相信謀劃合法。但他能帶來影響的機會很微，他最終亦在初選被公眾所「拒絕」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cUAv35v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志認為，法庭判刑時應合乎比例、避免壓迫性的刑罰；又指本案是以串謀罪而非《國安法》定罪，《國安法》第22條的三級刑期分級制不適用，法庭應按《刑事罪行條例》第159C條有關串謀罪的罰則，按串謀的嚴重性和危害來判刑，而本案串謀屬最輕微，馮的參與亦屬較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告國安法後逾半年始被捕選舉延後無續危害國安&quot;&gt;辯方：被告國安法後逾半年始被捕、選舉延後無續危害國安&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續指，法庭判刑時僅應考慮事實和實際後果、而非臆測和假設性的結果，而涉案謀劃不大可能成功，因能否取得35+、立會重選後能否再當選等均屬未知數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又指，若被告行為對國家安全有任何實質威脅，大可在《國安法》生效後不久將他們拘捕，但這期間政府沒有指各人違法，他們最終在6至7個月後才被捕，認為事實上涉案謀劃和被告並無對國安造成危害，馮達鴻參與串謀的時間短。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉打斷指，那是因為立法會正式選舉延期，惟祁志指，政府是稱因疫情而延後，而出於幸運，被告因此不能進一步危害國安，串謀的影響也停止，該「幸運」的利處應歸於被告。陳慶偉指他不同意，又提到根據庭上證供，戴耀廷此後還打算找香港民研做民調，謀劃沒有即時停止。祁志則重申，馮達浚的參與和造成的後果，在當刻已停止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方馮成長於多元社會鼓勵公開辯論&quot;&gt;辯方：馮成長於多元社會、鼓勵公開辯論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又提到，案情提及馮達浚在2020年6月26日的選舉論壇，在「對《國安法》有全面理解（with full appreciation of NSL)」下，表達對《國安法》的不滿。惟祁志強調，《國安法》條文於6月30日晚才頒布，由特首簽署生效，被告沒有水晶球、事前無人見過內容，社會只對可能有《國安法》感到恐懼，被告此前並不知道所做的行為是違法。即使《國安法》通過後，行政會議成員、資深大律師湯家驊也不肯定是否違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志指，馮達浚成長的香港社會，有多元辯論和選舉文化，提出反對不僅合法，也是港人生活和政治的基石；而香港有不同語言的報章，可從不同角度辯論政治議題，通識教育亦是教育制度重要一環，年輕人被訓練問問題，也被鼓勵思考和在公開及私下辯論。惟在《國安法》生效後，這樣的情況結束，爭取權力監察政權，一夜之間變成了顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;馮達浚求情信向泛民道歉-官一度問有否提悔意&quot;&gt;馮達浚求情信向泛民道歉 官一度問有否提悔意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續指，馮達浚撰寫了6頁的中文求情信，形容他在法律界多年，從沒有看過如此準確和字體工整的求情信。當中馮表示已深切反省，不再談及政治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡表示，他讀過求情信，問其信中有否提及悔意。祁志解釋，馮達浚並非空洞的道歉，而是在信中探索其內心，稱自己成為更冷靜的人。馮又提及2020年末決定不再參與選舉，而他還柙3年已經改變，現時已不在意特首會否下台，並望向他曾經非常不禮貌對待的泛民、他的團隊、家人等道歉，對困擾社會感到後悔，並感謝家人和他的貓的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮的母親亦指馮望貢獻社會，已經反省和改變。馮亦獲浸大新聞系前高級講師呂秉權和另一講師撰求情信，指他對干犯《國安法》感後悔，並嘗試理解整個圖畫，而非只聆聽單一聲音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mwPpEZp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今處理參選九西初選的6名被告求情。代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文指，黃的角色次要，沒有出席任何協調會議、無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，她是在選舉論壇被激進派「逼到牆角」，受壓下才提及否決預算案，應屬「其他參加者」。辯方又引包括前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良等撰寫的求情信，指黃溫和、務實，屬「對抗式政治」的受害者，犯案與本性不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉澤鋒的大律師黃錦娟則指，劉生於廣州，熱心服務弱勢，參選是望服務他熱愛的社區，即香港和香港人，望考慮他為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低級別。辯方又指，劉在獄中沒有放棄自己，修讀會計課程，望將來繼續服務社區和長者，並引其好友寄語：「雨後會是天晴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黃碧雲受壓下始提否決-屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：黃碧雲受壓下始提否決 屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文指，涉案謀劃在於當選後無差別否決預算案，惟能實現的機會很微。沈形容，黃碧雲的角色非常次要（peripheral），她並非組織者，並在社會氣氛熾熱時，從沒有親身出席任何協調會議、沒有簽署或支持「墨落無悔」聲明、政綱沒有提及否決預算案，亦從沒有公開表達對預算案的看法，而是專注在民生議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9Et26xI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，黃碧雲之所以被定罪，主要因法庭裁定時任民主黨主席胡志偉的言論可指證黃，以及她在選舉論壇的言論。惟沈指，黃在論壇被激進派強烈批評，被「逼到牆角（cornered）」後才表示會用盡憲制裡的權力，包括否決預算案。沈指黃的角色非常被動，她沒有提倡無差別否決，反而是避免（refrain）這樣做，片中可見她頗為緊張，受壓才提到否決，考慮她的政治背景和往績，懷有顛覆國家政權的意圖嚴重干擾阻撓政權機關運作，與她本性完全不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，雖認為《國安法》第22條的三級罰則不直接適用本案，但考慮被告角色時仍可作參考，並認為黃的角色屬最低級，為「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張炳良為黃碧雲撰求情信-稱屬對抗式政治受害者&quot;&gt;張炳良為黃碧雲撰求情信 稱屬「對抗式政治」受害者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黃碧雲的背景，沈士文指，她於加州大學洛杉磯分校（UCLA）取得政治科學博士，2012至2020年任兩屆九西區立法會議員，2020年立法會選舉延期後沒有被DQ，但自願辭職，其後沒有再參與政治，黃亦曾於理工大學任多年講師。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方呈上前民主黨員、運輸及房屋局局長張炳良所撰的求情信，形容黃碧雲是2019年「對抗式政治（confrontational politics）」的受害者，捲入本案不符其性格。其他求情信亦指黃在社區及立法會工作獲得正面評價，對政治採取溫和、務實的做法，在撥款議案與政府合作，亦關心社區健康和福利事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WWOyGNR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image23&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前運輸及房屋局局長 張炳良&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又提及，前特首曾蔭權於2010年提出政改方案，在功能組別增加5席「超級區議會」，議案在黃碧雲的支持下獲得通過，顯示她務實，望香港循序漸進實現民主化。黃亦曾於2015年揭發「鉛水事件」，曾召開記招要求政府成立獨立調查委員會徹查，對公共衞生等議題作出貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又提到，控方證人區諾軒曾發表一篇論文，提及民主黨認同「一國兩制」，支持香港回歸中國，並引黃碧雲為傳統民主派的例子。沈另提及，黃有2個定罪記錄，涉於2020年5月及10月擾亂立法會會議，黃被控違反《立法會（權力及特權）條例》，承認兩項藐視罪，共被判監4星期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指劉澤鋒參選為服務香港-屬其他參加或積極參加較低級&quot;&gt;辯方指劉澤鋒參選為服務香港 屬「其他參加」或「積極參加」較低級&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表劉澤鋒的大律師黃錦娟則指，劉生於廣州、來自草根家庭，案發時剛畢業於樹仁大學、近24歲，現年近27歲，一直投入義工和社區服務，是政治素人，參選是嘗試以他的知識服務他熱愛的社區，即香港和香港人。辯方望法庭考慮劉只是報名參加初選，簽署「墨落無悔」、參加選舉論壇和接受一些訪問，並於初選落敗，之後沒有再參與謀劃，其參與時間較短、角色輕微，認為劉屬「其他參加者」、最多是「積極參加者」較低級別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oAZjFLj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;
▲ 劉澤鋒（左）、余慧明（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續指，劉還柙至今逾3年，其家人今有到庭支持，認識他逾12年的友人、同學、牧師等亦撰求情信，指劉一直樂於助人、熱心服務弱勢，曾發起協助無家者的計劃，亦會探訪長者，為他們清潔家居。黃指，劉還柙至今逾3年並沒有放棄自己，他修讀中大的會計課程並取得不俗成績，望日後進修輔導、管理及運動治療等課程，望繼續以知識幫助別人和服務香港社會，尤其是長者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最後引述劉澤鋒好友求情信，指劉曾提及在獄中，雨天時會感到比較舒服，好友寄語「雨後會是天晴」。黃提及，劉參與謀劃與其性格不符，他錯誤相信謀劃屬合法，望法庭能寬大處理，令劉能獲釋並看到雨後晴天。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李家田稱被警方施行「水刑」 擔心母親同受苦故應要求背答案&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3WQfiOW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（9日）踏入第49日審訊。被告李家田供稱，警方上門拘捕時不斷追問他手槍下落，並多次施行「水刑」，用毛巾蓋着其臉再沖水，令他感覺遇溺及窒息。李擔心同住的母親會受到同樣對待，內心「淨係想保護我媽媽，唔想佢受呢啲苦」，故訛稱手槍由吳智鴻保管，並順從警員的要求，在錄影會面期間背出他們指示的答案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李家田稱沒有應黃振強要求前往灣仔單位-翌日得知對方被捕&quot;&gt;李家田稱沒有應黃振強要求前往灣仔單位 翌日得知對方被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第四被告李家田第二日作供，他稱自己沒有出席11月25日的荃灣三陂坊會議。Telegram「滅龍」群組對話顯示，事前黃振強邀請大家出席，稱僅「食吓嘢」。李表示當時身處尖沙咀，認為眼前的事情較重要，因此沒有出席。另外，黃振強早前稱李於12月有出席何文田的媒體訪問。李今表示沒有出席，因當時去錯另一地址。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，黃於12月7日要求他前往灣仔克街一單位。李知道「屠龍」成員會在示威前一日於附近租住地方睡覺，但他認為自己沒有需要，故不打算前往。他表示當晚到了太子某酒吧飲酒，因無錢結帳而在「滅龍」群組問可否借400元。對話紀錄顯示，黃振強轉賬了500元予李。黃於凌晨傳訊息催促李問：「瞓著啦，嚟未？」，李表示為了找藉口推搪黃，故稱「擺條鎖匙喺門口先」。李強調，當晚飲酒後返回新蒲崗工作室睡覺，翌日中午醒來，從新聞得知「屠龍」成員於克街的單位被捕，而張俊富在柴灣角街同被捕。李聞後感驚訝，因警方是上門拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，加入「屠龍」至被捕期間，並沒有打算與其他人串謀放炸彈、藉爆炸品導致爆炸，或串謀謀殺警務人員。他亦無管有槍械或彈藥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱不滿政府委任懲教作特別警察-故用口號黑警死全家回應&quot;&gt;李稱不滿政府委任懲教作特別警察 故用口號「黑警死全家」回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後解釋自己在 Telegram「滅龍」群組所發出的訊息。他於11月14日表示：「我聲援你哋」，並解釋當時「連登討論區」有帖文流傳，荃灣或葵芳有人死亡，有警察會去仁濟醫院「搶屍」，李不知消息真偽。群組內的成員「快樂的TT」表示「我殺去仁濟」。李解釋，由於自己不想前往，因此用藉口推搪並稱「我聲援你哋」。法官張慧玲一度問：「聲援唔係代表支持？點解變咗藉口？即係用把聲去援？」李解釋表達自己不想去現場的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦曾發訊息指：「黑警死全家」，他解釋當時政府公布委任懲教人員作為特別警察，李不滿警察想把其他紀律部隊「拖落水」、「拖埋入去社會事件」，因此套用示威口號「黑警死全家」回應此事。李強調：「我唔係好似字面咁解，想黑警死全家。」張官追問：「你唔係真係想啲警察死？」李回答：「正確。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李身處理工大學期間，一度發訊息指「啪隻老解」。他解釋指是回應黃振強所說：「快啲啪隻狗先」，當時黃著李盡快攻擊警察，但李卻不想這樣做，因此用藉口推搪稱「啪隻老解」，以表達想攻擊解放軍。黃及後回應：「啪老解做乜，啪狗呀」，李認為接不上話題，於是回應「直接返屋企瞓覺，舒服」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱套用我最期待的畫面迷因-問為何沒有槍械訓練&quot;&gt;李稱套用「我最期待的畫面」迷因 問為何沒有槍械訓練&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，當黃振強在群組發送軍訓內容後，李曾問：「我最期待的眼鏡訓練呢？」李解釋，他看畢軍訓內容後不見有槍械訓練，於是套用其中一個「網絡迷因（memes）」，即 TVB 劇集中的「我最期待的畫面出現了」一幕，希望詢問為何沒有槍械訓練。張官一度問甚麼是「網絡迷因（memes）」，李解釋一輪，指這些畫面被網民視為「好笑」。張官聽完解釋後表示：「我都唔明你講緊咩」，又追問李說這句話是否表達「好期待」。李不同意，強調自己並非真的期待槍械訓練。辯方一度希望展示該張「迷因」圖，但張官拒絕並指：「我唔需要知道呢個出處係咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱說話經包裝刻意引人笑-為免失資助故婉轉討論&quot;&gt;李稱說話經包裝刻意引人笑 為免失資助故婉轉討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，看清楚檔案後發現有槍械訓練，並問是否為期一天。黃回應：「眼鏡建基於體能，使用好眼鏡，體能係必須」，李回應：「我唔想變 John Wick 喎」，他解釋想表達自己不欲去軍訓。李補充，自己上述兩句話都透過修飾及包裝，目的「有心引人笑」。被問到為何不直接拒絕不願意的事情，李解釋因黃振強提供很多資助支援李的生活，包括請吃飯等，「我唔想失去呢個資助，所以我會用比較婉轉嘅方式，去參與群組入面嘅討論內容。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱被警員施行水刑-不斷吸入水感覺如遇溺&quot;&gt;李稱被警員施行「水刑」 不斷吸入水感覺如遇溺&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後談及被捕過程，他指於2020年6月11日早上，正於家中房間的電腦椅睡覺，突然房門「嘭」一聲被打開，李遂嚇醒，亦不知入房的是警員。警員5820隨即用手銬將李雙手鎖在背後，並將他推入廁所。偵緝警署警長馮保羅掌摑李的臉並問：「支槍喺邊？」李反問：「咩槍呀？」馮再掌摑李的臉數次，並對他大叫：「仲扮嘢？你係檸檬呀嘛。」李否認，馮隨即恐嚇李：「黃振強篤咗你出嚟啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，警員5820不斷用拳頭打李的氣門，並問：「有冇呀？」馮則表示：「嗱，我哋依家想搵返支狗（槍）啫，因為依家唔對數」，李回答：「冇。」其後，警員5820及6314一同打李的腹部，警員6314更用軍裝長靴踢李的左腰間，並大叫：「仲扮嘢？冇呀喇？」毆打過程維持30至45分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馮則表示：「肯講未呀，依家我哋畀機會你，黃振強已經篤到你應一應，你講咗我哋就淨係告你支槍，如果唔係你就大鑊」，李回答：「冇。」戴「勞力士」錶的警員之後將毛巾放在李的臉上，並從後拉扯頭髮令其臉朝上。最後他對李施行「水刑」，即開花灑弄濕李臉上的毛巾。李在庭上表示：「嗰陣我嘗試唞氣，但因為（警員）沖水，我只係吸到啲水，我濁親係咁咳，就吸返啲水入去。」李形容當時感覺像遇溺：「我嗰陣覺得自己好似遇溺咁，身體反應係咁講。我完全吸唔到氣，只係吸水，情況好辛苦，覺得好似窒息咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施行「水刑」後，馮問：「講唔講？」李回答：「冇。」警員再次施行「水刑」，期間有人打李的腹部。他認為：「可能想我更加辛苦，吸更多水。」馮再度問：「講唔講？」李當時感到混亂，為想辦法令警員停止「水刑」，於是要求吸煙，警員最後將煙及火柴遞給李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱擔心母親受同樣對待-故訛稱手槍由吳智鴻保管&quot;&gt;李稱擔心母親受同樣對待 故訛稱手槍由吳智鴻保管&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在李吸煙後，戴「勞力士」錶警員拍其膊頭表示「繼續」。馮再次恐嚇李：「諗清楚未呀？我要搵支槍啫，黃振強講晒你哋去西貢行山試槍嗰啲嘢出嚟啦，同鴻仔佢哋行呀嘛，知㗎喇。依家係唔對數啫。」李仍然表示沒有，警員6314再次對李施行「水刑」，李大叫：「唔好呀！」他在庭上嘆氣表示：「水刑真係好辛苦，我想叫佢哋停止」，「我講咗冇⋯⋯唔知點解講完之後，佢哋都要繼續咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，馮向他表示：「你知唔知依啲係恐怖份子，我而家喺度殺咗你都冇問題，就喺出面搵棵樹吊死你都得。」警員6314隨即大力扯李的頭髮迫他站起，並問：「你係咪想玩滾水淥啫啫？」手戴「勞力士」錶的警員則取出腰間的手槍，把子彈取出並放在李的手心上摩擦，並說：「依粒子彈而家有你指模，我可以話依粒子彈係喺你屋企搵到，到時你都係衰藏有軍火㗎咋，仲會連你阿媽都拉埋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這時馮拿出自己的手槍，並在李手心摩擦說：「依家支槍有你指模，我可以話你搶槍，喺度開槍啪咗你都仲得。」馮更用槍指住李頭部說：「同樣嘅情況可以出現喺你阿媽身上。」李聞後感害怕，他解釋：「由佢哋（警員）入我間房之後，我都冇見過我阿媽，我唔知佢咩情況，好驚佢受到好似我咁嘅對待，佢會頂唔住。」他又指近60歲的母親為菲律賓籍，不太熟悉香港文化，不知她是否懂得處理這種情況。李因為不想母親有事，「淨係想保護我媽媽，唔想佢畀人拉、受呢啲苦」，最後「求其」訛稱：「支槍喺鴻仔度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李稱錄影會面部分答案屬警方要求部分屬虛構&quot;&gt;李稱錄影會面部分答案屬警方要求、部分屬虛構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後馮打開電話中吳智鴻及黃振強的照片，其他警員亦展示不同人的照片，要求李記住。警員又要求李提供電話、iPad 等密碼。警員更教導李一些槍械的專用名詞，包括「扳機」及「上膛」。李又指，沒有警員押他到住所其他位置見證警方搜查，整個過程亦沒有看過搜查令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，沒有說過警員記事冊上的警誡供詞，而簽名則是警員寫下所有說話後，李一次過簽署。李解釋，為免影響母親故順從警察，「佢哋叫我做乜我就做。」李稱其後被帶往落馬洲警署，馮要求他記熟稍後在警誡錄影會面的答案，包括要說黃振強為「屠龍」隊長、吳智鴻將槍交給李、李本人有參與試槍。及後李再被帶往上水警署，被警員指示在錄影會面背出剛才的答案，若不知道則自行虛構，李擔心再被施行「水刑」而答應。李表示，警員聲稱做得好可獲保釋，但最後對方沒有遵守。李感不開心但不敢投訴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指出錄影會面中的答案，部分屬事實，部分屬警方要求，部分屬他自行虛構。虛構的包括：李在試槍後保管手槍，最後應吳智鴻要求把手槍歸還；李主動表示要去試槍。而屬警方要求的說法包括：黃振強為「屠龍」隊長、試槍時各人曾輪流開槍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明（10日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;
